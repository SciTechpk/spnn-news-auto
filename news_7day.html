Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah handed in their resignations, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday.
Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly today, Asif accused the judges of having “selective amnesia”, saying that they had “forgotten their past” and were now becoming “guardians of democracy”.
“Four to five years ago — in fact, eight to 10 years ago — when the process to remove Nawaz Sharif from his post started, I want to tell you about the history of our SC judges at that time. The conspiracy created against Nawaz before that and the role our judiciary played in turning that conspiracy into reality,” Asif said, amid chants of ‘kon bachayega Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan’ [who will save Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan] by the opposition.
“The entire process started with the Panama case when Chief Justice Saqib Nisar formed two benches that deemed Nawaz ineligible to hold office,” Asif said, adding that the bench included Justices Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Ejaz Afzal, Gulzar Ahmed, and Ijazul Ahsan.
“After Nawaz was declared ineligible, another bench was created to decide the duration of the ineligibility,” the defence minister said.
He highlighted that under the supervision of Justice Nisar, a bench comprising Justices Umar Ata Bandial, Ijazul Ahsan, and Sajjad Ali Shah, decided that ineligibility will be life-long.
“Then another bench was formed, also supervised by Justice Nisar, which declared that no ineligible person can become the leader of a political party,” Asif added. He said in almost every political lawsuit, the same few judges were witnessed thereafter.
“When these kangaroo courts were being formed, Nawaz was being victimised, and an agenda was being implemented that he would not remain a leader and would be expelled from politics forever; at that time, no one felt any shame,” the minister said, referring to the resignations of Justices Shah and Minallah following the passage of the 27th Amendment by the parliament.
“These judges from yesterday were serving in SC and high courts back then; now they’re writing poetry and issuing political statements,” referring to a poem Justice Shah added to his resignation letter.
According to Asif, the judges’ “conscience awakened because their monopoly in SC was curtailed.”
The minister added that the amendment in question sought to establish the superiority of the Constitution.
Referring to the opposition, he said that they chant ‘Khan nahi tou Pakistan nahi’ [if there is no Khan, there is no Pakistan], which was proof that they don’t stand with the Constitution of Pakistan but instead with a single person.
“These people have become protectors of terrorists; people who come from across the border and do murder and destruction here,” Asif said, assailing the opposition for not condemning the attacks in Wana and Islamabad.
Resignation letters
In his letter to the president yesterday, Justice Shah had assailed the 27th Amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
“By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote.
“As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed — but not before leaving deep institutional scars.”
The judge had stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation.
On the other hand, Justice Minallah had stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order.
“I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added.
Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”.
“What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote.
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation had come hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had said 64 votes were cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate yesterday to consider the latest changes.
The 27th Amendment promised, on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.
At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters</p><small>2025-11-14 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14161201a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955060/phc-bars-kp-govt-from-employing-official-vehicles-for-personal-or-political-use' target='_blank'><strong>PHC bars KP govt from employing official vehicles for ‘personal or political use’</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday imposed a ban on the use of government resources, such as vehicles, by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for personal or political use.
The provincial administration was banned from using government vehicles to carry out long marches, while the use of rescue machinery and fire brigade vehicles at political rallies was deemed “dishonest”.
“[The] use of government resources for political purposes is tantamount to undermining public trust,” the PHC ruled.

On October 27, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira announced that his party and the PML-N had agreed on bringing a no-confidence motion against the government in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members, and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members. Earlier in October, PPP’s ranks swelled to 27 after ten lawmakers from the forward bloc joined the party.
PPP AJK President Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, while speaking to the media today, along with PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf, said, “Our chairman has decided… that Faisal Rathore, who is the General Secretary of our party in AJK, will be nominated for the position of PM.”
He detailed that “we are going to table the vote of no confidence today, so god willing, in the next few days, PPP will have its government in AJK.”
“The voting will begin on Monday,” he later said in response to a question.
“Faisal Rathore is an educated young man; he has a lot of experience and has been part of the assembly before,” Raja Pervez said.
Before announcing the nomination, Ashraf told the media that the party had taken an “excellent decision”, reaffirming that the PPP “remains committed to the people of Kashmir”.
“Right now, we want to ease their hardships and pave the way for the next elections,” he said.
Chuahdry echoed similar thoughts, stating that the generations of party leaders had “always taken a strong stance on Kashmir”.
Before making the announcement, Chaudhry said, “We have the required number (in the legislative assembly), I feel that we have the golden number.”
Ashraf told the media that PPP was the “largest parliamentary party (in the legislative assembly) and we have the support of our allies.”
He expressed confidence that his party “is in the position to form the government,” noting that they had the required “strength.”
He continued: “PPP will bring peace to Kashmir and ease their hardships; the promises made to the Action Committee will be fulfilled as well.”
On October 28, sources had told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Rathore and Sardar Yaqub were under consideration for the top slot.
Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister.</p><small>2025-11-14 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1413521816e019a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955043/justices-shah-and-minallah-guardians-of-the-constitution' target='_blank'><strong>Justices Shah and Minallah — Guardians of the Constitution</strong></a><br><p>One of the most striking moments in A Man for All Seasons comes when Thomas More debates his hot-headed son-in-law, Roper, who insists that the law should be swept aside to catch the “devil”, meaning anyone dangerous or politically threatening. More responds with a powerful image: England is planted thick with laws, “like a forest”, and those laws protect everyone, even the people we despise.
Then More asks a piercing question: if you cut down every law to hunt your enemies, what will protect you when power turns and comes for you? Without the law, More warns, you will be standing in an open field with the winds blowing from every direction, completely defenceless.
This scene captures the core of the play: the rule of law is not a tool for the powerful but a shield for everyone, and once it is weakened for expedience, no one can control what comes next.
Yesterday, Pakistan lost two of its most brilliant jurists — Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah. Why that happened remains for history to answer. But their story did not begin yesterday. It began decades ago, in 1997, when three friends, united by a shared belief in the Constitution, established one of the most progressive law firms of the time: Afridi, Shah & Minallah. They had little more than their intellect, their conviction, and an unshakable refusal to compromise principle for power.
A decade later, that promise was tested. They stood by their principles, boycotting the Dogar Court and taking to the streets as part of the nationwide lawyers’ movement to reinstate Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. Their courage was quiet, steadfast, and unwavering. The Dogar court fell. The Chaudhry court resumed. What happened within those walls is a discussion for another day.
Justice Shah: a bench of reform
Justice Shah was elevated to the Lahore High Court in 2009, following a distinguished legal career spanning tax, corporate, and numerous public interest cases, particularly in environmental protection and sustainable development. Elevation had never been on his radar, but a few persuaded him that the bench would give him a platform to interpret the law, expand rights, transform social order, and uphold the rule of law.
And he did all that, and more.
At the Lahore High Court, Justice Shah authored some of the most progressive judgments across elections, democracy, disability, gender, climate, technology, court delays, local government, and more. Known as the “green judge”, he led the Green Bench to hear climate and environmental disputes.
 
 

A judicial reformist, he established Alternate Dispute Resolution Centres in Punjab to reduce chronic case backlogs, set up Criminal and Civil Model Courts to improve coordination and expedite justice, and introduced the Case Management and Court Automation Systems.
With the Punjab Information Technology Board, he implemented the first Enterprise IT System to make the judicial system open, transparent, and fully connected for the decade ahead.
Justice Minallah: courage in the capital
In 2014, Shah was joined by his friend and former law firm partner, Athar Minallah, who rose to the bench at the Islamabad High Court, where a clear strand of judicial courage emerged.
Justice Minallah confronted enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings, illegal land acquisitions, animal rights violations, and defended society’s most vulnerable. When the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 was weaponised to stifle dissent, he declared it unconstitutional.
He also made exemplary judicial appointments, including several judges who repeatedly stood firm to principle despite intense executive pressure.
 
 

The purpose of this piece is not to catalogue every judicial achievement. Even their critics must acknowledge the creativity, constitutional insight, and hundreds of judgments they authored, which enriched Pakistan’s jurisprudence domestically and internationally. They carried this par excellence with grace and grit at the Supreme Court, and their impact continues to resonate.
One may disagree with many of their lordships’ judgments, but like everyone else, they are human.
As Justice Minallah recently reminded in a letter, “Barring a few exceptions, all of us, myself included, have erred or fallen short of the ideals we are sworn to uphold. We are, after all, fallible human beings.”
The Qazi court
Much of what we have witnessed over the past two years is the story of how one judicial era and its successor inflicted extraordinary damage on the Constitution. The Qazi court set the stage. Whatever remained intact after that was not undone; it was taken to an entirely new level by the court that followed, a level defined by autocratic legalism.
During this period, Pakistan’s largest political party, the PTI, was stripped of its electoral symbol on the eve of the 2024 general elections. The court declined to clarify PTI’s legal status, forcing its candidates to contest as independents. When the majority of those independents managed to clinch victory despite the several hurdles placed in their way, their democratic mandate was quietly denied. When PTI-backed independents joined another entity to claim reserved seats, the Election Commission of Pakistan denied them their constitutional entitlement. The Peshawar High Court upheld this denial.
The matter then reached the Supreme Court, where a three-member bench led by Justice Shah, and joined by Justice Minallah, granted leave, suspended the PHC judgment, and directed the formation of a larger bench. By an 8–5 majority, the full court, in an opinion authored by Justice Shah and joined by Justice Minallah, held what had been obvious: “PTI was and is a political party.”
 
 

The judgment reaffirmed a fundamental principle of electoral democracy: “When the Election Commission errs or makes significant mistakes impacting the electoral process, judicial intervention becomes necessary to rectify them and ensure electoral justice. The judiciary, tasked with ensuring electoral justice, must foremost preserve the will of the people.”
Even this was not enough. The principle of the “Master of the Roster”, which Justice Isa himself had previously critiqued, was restored, now manipulated to serve his own whims. The Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Committee was reshuffled to engineer bench composition. Judges were handpicked, verdicts overturned, and the path cleared for the 26th Amendment, designed to prevent a single individual from ever becoming chief justice. History will not forget this episode: it is truly one for the books.
Yet the will of the people was never delivered. Not then, not later, not to this day. The same court, aided by two dissents, opened the door for the Election Commission to ignore the verdict.
So, where did the Qazi Court lead us?
A Constitution left adrift, civil freedoms suspended, executive capture entrenched, and judicial independence in tatters. On his last day in office, both Justice Shah and Justice Minallah refused to attend the chief justice’s reference.
Justice Shah described him as “an ostrich with its head in the sand, complacent and indifferent to external influences and pressures on the judiciary”. Even when courageous judges confronted interference in their work, the chief justice publicly insisted there was “no external influence in the judiciary”.
Justice for those judges was not served, and it is still not served.
The loyal court and the path to the 27th Amendment
The Qazi court had already undermined the very foundation of the Constitution. Its successor, with a handpicked chief justice, completed that destruction. Military courts were legalised, verdicts restoring the will of the people were overturned, and challenges to the 26th Amendment were ignored.
In the reserved seats verdict, Justice Shah reminded us, “We must remember that Constitutions are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing situations but are designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.”
Today, Parliament has bulldozed through a constitutional amendment that fundamentally alters the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. The amendment establishes a Federal Constitutional Court, effectively a Federally Controlled Court (FCC), a parallel judicial structure that strips the Supreme Court of Pakistan of its defining role: interpreting the Constitution.
Under this amendment, the president and prime minister appoint the FCC’s chief justice and initial judges, bypassing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan and embedding executive influence from the outset. Until legislation determines its composition, the executive alone decides the number of judges. Their preferred nominee has already been identified: the same judge who instructed the election commission to disregard a binding Supreme Court decision.
Almost every civil or criminal case involves a constitutional question, yet litigants must now navigate a maze between the FCC and the Supreme Court. Cases will ricochet; justice will become slower, costlier, and less certain; ordinary citizens seeking refuge from power will have no clear path.
 
 

History is rarely kind to regimes that attempt permanence through constitutional engineering. Their projects always collapse, but only after inflicting deep wounds on institutions meant to protect citizens. Pakistan has seen this cycle before.
In his additional note in the Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Reference, Justice Yahya Afridi warned that “the extraordinary political climate of the time and the pressures inherent in such an environment appear to have influenced the course of justice in a manner inconsistent with the ideals of judicial independence”. He paid tribute to Justices Dorab Patel, Muhammad Haleem, and G. Safdar Shah, judges who stood firm in moments of darkness, even when their dissents could not change the outcome.
But when history presented him with the same test, the chief justice appears to have chosen accommodation over conviction. The 27th Amendment was bulldozed through, and he did not resist the dismantling of the judiciary. What he diagnosed in words, he failed to defend in practice. In the end, others saw him as more concerned with retaining his title than safeguarding the institution — serving as chief justice of a broken, toothless Supreme Court stripped of its constitutional soul.
Reckoning and responsibility
The damage will haunt the country for years. Like all assaults on constitutionalism, this too will eventually be undone, but we cannot leave that reckoning to time. The moment demands clarity, courage, and memory.
The judges who take oath in an illegitimate, federally controlled court will be nothing but collaborators; those who accepted extensions and titles in exchange for conscience have betrayed the very principles they swore to uphold. Now is the time to act. This responsibility is not limited to them; it extends to each of us who believes in the supremacy of the Constitution, and in courage and judicial independence.
Eighteen years after the lawyers’ movement, when three friends and colleagues, bound by a shared belief in the Constitution, were tested once more, only two remained true to that promise. Shah and Minallah still stood firm, courageous, and unbowed.
And so the story returns to where it began: the law, when defended with intellect, conviction, and courage, remains the forest in which justice grows, shielding all, even those we may despise, from the unpredictable winds of power.
Thank you, Shah and Minallah. History will neither forget nor forgive.</p><small>2025-11-14 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/141517507571a1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955058/no-mention-of-27th-amendment-in-sc-full-court-meeting-called-after-judges-letters-to-cjp-yahya' target='_blank'><strong>No mention of 27th Amendment in SC full court meeting called after judges’ letters to CJP Yahya</strong></a><br><p>There was no discussion on the 27th Amendment in a full court meeting called by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Friday, according to a Supreme Court (SC) press release, which also said that the meeting gave its final approval to the SC Rules, 2025.
It was reported a day ago that after a series of letters seeking a full court meeting on the contentious amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday, the CJP called one today.
According to the press release issued after the meeting, the participants “unanimously updated the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 on the recommendation of the committee, comprising Hon’ble Justice Shahid Waheed, Hon’ble Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Hon’ble Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Hon’ble Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, constituted under Rule 1(4) of Order I of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 for removal of difficulties arising in giving effect to its provisions”.
It said the meeting extended “sincere appreciation to each member of the committee individually for undertaking such a massive task of meticulously reviewing the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, drafting the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 and addressing the suggestions thereon for removal of difficulties”.
“The updated Supreme Court Rules, 2025, are to improve service delivery and ensure inexpensive and expeditious administration of justice,” it added.
Moreover, the full court meeting also unanimously approved the grant of the status of senior advocate of the Supreme Court to Muhammad Munir Paracha — who was an advocate of the SC until now —  in terms of Rule 5 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
Letters by SC judges
Yesterday, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar became the third judge SC to request a full court to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary.
“From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”.
Before the bill for the constitutional amendment was passed, Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah — both of whom tendered their resignations yesterday following the enactment of the 27th Amendment — had written separate letters to the CJP, asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference to discuss the constitutional tweaks.
In a six-page letter, Justice Shah described the amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges.
“You (CJP) act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance.
Separately, in a seven-page letter, Justice Minhallah said: “I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.
“A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning.”
He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”.
Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, in a letter endorsed by ex-judges, had also asked the CJP to take a stand on the matter.</p><small>2025-11-14 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14144721fba3782.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955057/pakistan-will-not-hold-talks-with-any-terrorist-group-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not hold talks with any terrorist group: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi asserted on Friday that Pakistan had never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul but would not hold talks with any terrorist groups.
“Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul. However, Pakistan will not hold dialogue with any terrorist groups, be it Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA),” he said while addressing his weekly press briefing.
“The third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime concluded on November 7 in Istanbul,” he said, expressing appreciation for the “sincere efforts” of mediating countries Qatar and Turkiye.
“Since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil on Pakistan. Throughout these years, Pakistan — despite suffering military and civilian casualties — exercised maximum restraint and did not escalate,” he said.
He added that Pakistan’s expectation was that with the passage of time, the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the banned TTP.
He said that during this time, Pakistan also tried to positively engage with the Afghan Taliban regime, offering bilateral trade assistance and humanitarian assistance.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan, the response from the Taliban regimes has only been hollow promises and inaction,” he regretted.
He said that TTP and the BLA were declared enemies of Pakistan.
“Anyone harbouring, abetting or financing them is not considered a friend and a well-wisher of Pakistan and its people,” he said.
“Pakistan is determined to take every possible action to safeguard its security and the security of its people. We regret that the Taliban regime is constantly trying to misrepresent the issue of terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“Taliban regime is also trying to portray TTP and BLA as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee crisis but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees,” he said.
“Pakistan is ready to receive any Pakistani living in Afghanistan … provided they are handed over at the border crossing … and not hurled across the border fully equipped with sophisticated weapons and equipment,” he said.
The FO spokesperson also stated that there were some elements in the Afghan Taliban that did not want confrontation with Pakistan but there was a “strong lobby” with monetary support from foreign actors that had been tasked to “stoke tension”.
“These elements have been engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan, and in doing so, they are fast eroding whatever good-will they had,” he said.
“Some elements in the Taliban regime are also trying to propagate that there is some disagreement within Pakistan over its Afghan policy. This is misleading. There is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that ordinary people are the biggest victims of terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan,” he said.
“The armed forces of Pakistan are making sacrifices to safeguard the lives and properties of the people of Pakistan. Therefore, the entire nation, stands with its armed forces to safeguard the interests of Pakistan and the lives of the people,” he said.

“In a joint operation conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Division and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), four members of the TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij terrorist cell involved in the suicide attack at the Judicial Complex G-11, Islamabad have been apprehended,” the government said in a post on social media platform X.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
 






The government said that during the investigation, the handler of the suicide bomber, identified as Sajidullah alias Sheena, confessed that TTP Commander Saeedur Rehman alias Daadullah contacted him through the Telegram app to carry out a suicide attack in Islamabad to cause maximum casualties of law enforcement agencies.
The government said that the TTP commander sent pictures of the suicide bomber, identified as Usman alias Qari, for Sheena to recieve him. It further said that on the directives of the TTP commander, Sheena collected a suicide jacket from a graveyard in Peshawar and brought it to Islamabad.
On the day of the blast, the handler “set the suicide jacket” on the suicide bomber, the government added.
“The network was handled and guided at every step by the Fitna al-Khawarij/TTP high command based in Afghanistan. The entire cell involved in the incident, including its commander and three other members, has been arrested,” the government said.
“Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it added.
At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured as a bomb blast ripped through the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on Tuesday. The blast occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the sixth Margalla Dialogue.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said earlier that the bomber was “not a Pakistani national”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the blast was “related to Afghanistan”.
The incident in Islamabad had come the same week as an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.</p><small>2025-11-14 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1413370742552ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955048/renowned-physician-dr-shahid-rasul-passes-away-at-59' target='_blank'><strong>Renowned physician Dr Shahid Rasul passes away at 59</strong></a><br><p>The Executive Director of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Dr Shahid Rasul, passed away at 59 in Karachi on Friday.
Colleagues and hospital sources confirmed to Dawn that Dr Rasul died of cardiac arrest today.
Dr Rasul was a renowned physician who was appointed as the international adviser for Pakistan for the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (RCPS) of Glasgow.
Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed sorrow over the death of Dr Rasul, stating that “he will always be remembered for his services.”
In a statement issued today, the spokesperson for CM Sindh Abdul Rasheed Channa said, “Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the death of Jinnah Hospital Head Professor Shahid Rasul.”
“Dr Shahid was considered one of the best surgeons in the country,” CM Murad was quoted as saying, adding that his “services will always be remembered.”
The chief minister prayed for the departed and offered condolences to his family, as per the statement.
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also expressed condolences on the passing of Dr Rasul, calling it a “great loss”.
In a statement, he said, “Dr Shahid Rasul was a talented, dutiful, and humane physician.”
“His services to the health Department and the health sector can never be forgotten, “ he was quoted as saying.
“Dr Shahid Rasul devoted his entire life to serving the medical field, research, and patient care, “ the minister said, stressing that his death was not only a “great loss for his family but for the whole of the health sector and society.”
“We stand with the bereaved family in their hour of grief,” the minister added.
 






Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho also expressed sorrow over his death, saying that she “was deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Professor Dr Shahid Rasul.”
In a statement, Pechuo said, “His contributions to public health, medical education, and patient care have left an imprint that will continue to guide us for years to come.
“He led JPMC with dedication, compassion, and a firm commitment to serving the people not just from Sindh but all over Pakistan, especially those who rely on our public hospitals the most.
The health minister said that Dr Rasul’s death was a loss “felt not only by the medical community, but by everyone whose lives were touched through the institution he strengthened.”
“We honour his service, his leadership, and his unwavering belief in the power of healthcare to uplift communities,” she added, offering “heartfelt” condolences to his family, colleagues and JPMC.
“May they find strength during this difficult time, and may his legacy continue to inspire us as we work to build a healthier, more caring Sindh,” she said.</p><small>2025-11-14 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14141049b3bbd34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955053/rise-of-the-robots-the-promise-of-physical-ai' target='_blank'><strong>Rise of the robots: the promise of physical AI</strong></a><br><p>A pair of swivelling, human-like robotic arms, built for physical artificial intelligence research, mirror the motions of an operator in a VR headset, twirling his hands like a magician.
With enough practice, arms like these can complete everyday tasks alone, says Tokyo company Enactic, which is developing humanoid robots to wash dishes and do laundry in short-staffed Japanese care homes.
Welcome to the future of AI as it starts to infiltrate the material world in the form of smart robots, self-driving cars and other autonomous machines.
“The next wave of AI is physical AI,” Jensen Huang, head of US chip giant Nvidia, said last year.
That’s “AI that understands the laws of physics, AI that can work among us” and understands “how to perceive the world”, Huang added.
Tech firms are pouring massive sums into physical AI, and Morgan Stanley predicts the world could have more than a billion humanoid robots by 2050.
The buzz is only heightened by videos showing advanced androids, often Chinese-made, dancing to Taylor Swift or pulling heavy objects with ease.
Beyond the promise of sci-fi robot butlers, the race has sparked concern over job losses, privacy and how long these innovations will take to actually be useful.
Hiro Yamamoto is the 24-year-old CEO of Enactic, whose OpenArm physical AI training devices are used by Nvidia and at top universities such as Stanford.
He plans to begin deploying new robots, currently under development, from next summer to “live alongside people in environments that are very chaotic, and where conditions are always changing”, like care homes.
“So it has to be safe,” with a soft exterior that won’t injure anyone, Yamamoto said.
‘Any human role’
In the Chinese city of Guangzhou, a female figure with a glowing oval-shaped visor for a face, clad in white woven fabric like a fencing athlete, walked slowly across a stage last week to cheers and whispers.
It was the latest humanoid robot to be unveiled by Chinese electric vehicle maker XPeng, which is also pushing into physical AI.
Nimble machines made by US companies, such as Boston Dynamics’ dog-like robots, have grabbed headlines over the years.
But government support and strong domestic supply chains are helping Chinese rivals, also including Unitree Robotics and EngineAI, race ahead.
“I haven’t given much thought to how many robots we will sell annually in 10 years’ time, but I think it would be more than cars,” XPeng CEO He Xiaopeng told reporters.
XPeng’s robots walk and even dance autonomously — but how well they handle objects, a more complicated feat, has not been widely demonstrated.
Their dexterous fingers and flexible skin are unlikely to replace workers on China’s factory floors soon, He said.
The cost of one robot hand, which needs to be replaced regularly for heavy-duty work, could pay a Chinese worker’s salary for years.
But with enough data and training, AI humanoid robots could one day perform “almost any human role”, from nanny to home chef or gardener, XPeng co-president Brian Gu told AFP.
On-the-job training
Text-based AI tools like ChatGPT are trained on huge volumes of words, but physical AI models must also grapple with vision and the spatial relationship between objects.
For now, remotely operating AI robots to teach them how to do something like picking up a cup “is by far the most reliable way to collect data”, Yamamoto said.
Just 30 to 50 demonstrations of each task are needed to fine-tune “vision-language-action” AI models, he added.
Enactic has approached several dozen care facilities in Japan to propose that its teleoperated robots take over menial tasks, so qualified care workers have more time to look after elderly residents.
This on-the-job experience will train physical AI models so the robots can act autonomously in future, Yamamoto said.
US-Norwegian startup 1X is taking a similar approach for its humanoid home helper NEO, which it will deliver to American homes from next year.
NEO costs $20,000 to buy, but so far its performance is shaky, with one video in US media showing the robot struggling to close a dishwasher door, even when teleoperated.
Physical limits
In another embarrassing moment, a Russian humanoid robot, said to be the country’s first, staggered and then fell flat on its face as it made its debut on stage earlier this week.
There is currently a “big gap” between robots’ AI systems and their physical abilities, which lag behind, said Sara Adela Abad Guaman, assistant professor in robotics at University College London.
“Nature has shown us that in order to adapt to the environment, you need to have the right body,” Abad told AFP, giving the example of a mountain goat that stumbles on ice.
Nevertheless, big deals are being struck, even as booming investment in artificial intelligence feeds fears of a stock market bubble.
Japan’s SoftBank recently called physical AI its “next frontier” as it said it was buying industrial robot maker ABB Robotics for $5.4 billion.
Automation raises questions about the future of human labour, but Abad is not too worried.
At the end of the day, “our sense of touch is incomparable,” she said.</p><small>2025-11-14 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14134249626891e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955004/justice-aminuddin-khan-sworn-in-as-first-chief-justice-of-federal-constitutional-court' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Aminuddin Khan sworn in as first chief justice of Federal Constitutional Court</strong></a><br><p>Justice Aminuddin Khan on Friday was sworn in as the first chief justice of the newly established Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) after the 27th Amendment was enacted into law a day earlier.

Meanwhile, Supreme Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sat alongside Justice Aminuddin on the stage.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, his sister Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani, and members of the federal cabinet were also in attendance.
The ceremony began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, following which President Zardari administered the oath to Justice Aminuddin in English.
In his oath, Justice Aminuddin vowed to discharge his duties in accordance with the Constitution and the law, while also abiding by the code of conduct issued by the Supreme Judicial Council.
“That I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions. That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and that in all circumstances, I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will,” he said in his oath, after which he shook hands with the president.
His appointment was made by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier under Clause 3 of Article 175A, read with Article 175C, of the Constitution, adding that it would come into effect from the date of Justice Aminuddin’s oath-taking.
The proposal to establish the FCC has been revived as part of the judicial reforms incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. According to government officials, the FCC’s creation aims to reduce the SC’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases and strengthen judicial independence and credibility.
6 judges appointed to FCC
Meanwhile, President Zardari appointed six judges to the FCC. A notification issued by the law ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the president made the appointments under Clause 3 of Article 175-A read with Article 175-C of the Constitution.
Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the Supreme Court, Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech.
Justice (retd) Arshad Hussain Shah has also been appointed. He was appointed as Supreme Court’s Justice Musarrat Hilali was not willing to join the FCC, a source told Dawn.
The initial strength of the FCC has been determined through a presidential order, while any fu­­ture increase in the number of judges will require parliamentary approval through an act of Parliament.
Of the judges appointed to the FCC, Justices Rizvi, Farooq and Najafi were administered oath by Justice Aminuddin at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) today.
It was earlier reported that the oath-taking ceremony for the FCC judges would be held at the IHC, as judges of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) had resisted an immediate relocation to the third floor of the IHC building.
Initially, the oath-taking of Justice Aminud­din was scheduled for Thursday at 10am. However, following a minor revision to the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, the legislation had to be returned to the Senate for approval. After the Senate cleared the bill on Thursday, the ceremony was first rescheduled for 6pm and was later moved to Friday morning.
Interestingly, that ceremony was also not held in the FSC as originally planned. The FCC was intended to be established in the FSC building in Islamabad, while the Shariat Court was to be shifted to the IHC premises. However, sources within the FSC revealed that its judges expressed dissatisfaction over their abrupt relocation and raised the matter with Chief Justice Afridi.</p><small>2025-11-14 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14130304477fa06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955044/following-na-approval-senate-also-passes-bill-for-resetting-coas-munirs-tenure-after-appointment-as-cdf' target='_blank'><strong>Following NA approval, Senate also passes bill for resetting COAS Munir’s tenure after appointment as CDF</strong></a><br><p>The Senate swiftly passed four bills related to the recently approved contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Friday, including one that seeks changes to the Army Act and resets the tenure of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir after his appointment as the chief of the defence forces (CDF).
As explained by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly (NA) yesterday, this means that the five-year tenure of the chief of the defence forces would commence from the date of his notification of the appointment.
The four bills were passed by the Senate today — a day after their hurried passage in the National Assembly — without debate and with little resistance from the opposition.
Apart from the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025, the bills also included the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025, the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025, and the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar tabled the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif until he joined the session.
Asif presented the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025 when he arrived in the house. After him, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Law Minister Tarar.
As Dar began presenting the bills, he explained that the bill sought changes to the relevant laws in line with the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday.
The passage of the Amendment, which has paved the way for the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and changes to the military leadership structure, has been heavily criticised by the opposition.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the Amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
But, little resistance by the opposition to the passage of the four bills in the Senate was witnessed today.
What are the changes?
The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill seeks to replace the expression “chief of the army staff” with “chief of the defence forces” as per the 27th Amendment. Similarly, it suggests replacing the “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee” (CJCSC) with the “commander of the Natio­nal Strategic Command”.
Another important amendment to Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act 1952 says that “provided that for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces under paragraph (a) of Clause 4 of the Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
Another amendment regarding the appointment of commander of the National Strategic Command says, “The prime minister may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces, appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command, from amongst generals in the Pakistan Army, for a tenure of three years.”
The proposed amendment also authorises the prime minister to “reappoint the commander…for additional tenure of three years and/or extend the tenure(s)…up to three years” on the recommendations of the chief of the defence forces.
It further says that “the appointment, reappointment or extension of the commander of the National Strategic Command, or the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.
Another amendment reads that “the federal government may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces and by order in writing, authorise the officer appointed as vice chief of the army staff or deputy chief of the army staff to exercise and perform such of the powers and functions vested in the chief of the army staff under any law, rules, regulations, orders or instructions for the time being in force as may be so specified”.
Meanwhile, amendments to the air force and navy laws include the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.
The amendment to the Supreme Court law paves the way for the elimination of the Constitutional Bench, which was formed under the 26th Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14120757cb1623f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955038/the-amendment-that-ended-an-era' target='_blank'><strong>The amendment that ended an era</strong></a><br><p>After five days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill was passed by Parliament on Thursday. A swift and subsequent signature by the head of state, and it is now a reality.
With this, the separation of powers and basic structure established by the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan — which envisioned an independent judiciary and armed forces subservient to the civilian dispensation — now stands terminated. The irony isn’t lost here that instead of the military, an independent judiciary has been amended away into a subservient department of the executive branch.
Two senior judges of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, both former chief justices of their respective provincial high courts, and one who should have been the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan, have tendered their resignations on grounds of complete judicial capture and constitutional distortion in the wake of the 27th Amendment. More resignations from independent judges are expected.
All of this has been achieved by a parliament that is widely perceived to be unrepresentative of the polity.
Much has been written and said in the past few days condemning the 27th Amendment and calling it the darkest chapter in Pakistan’s constitutional and legal history. Funeral rites referenced and obituaries have been written for the Supreme Court, in some cases by those who actively abetted this murder. At the same time, the military leadership has been able to secure constitutional and legal cover for itself that previous dictators and hybrid regimes, of which Pakistan has had many, have only dreamt of.
What is the 27th Amendment?
The amendment makes significant changes to the judicial system, the military’s chain of command and grants sweeping immunities to government officials.
A Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has been established as the apex court in Pakistan, while the Supreme Court has been reduced to a final appellate court for civil and criminal matters. All matters of a constitutional nature, including those involving disputes between provincial and federal governments, public interest and the enforcement of fundamental rights of the people, will be heard by the FCC.
The chief justice and all judges of the first FCC will be handpicked by the prime minister and the President and shall remain in office till the age of 68. There is no stated criterion for the selection of these judges. The FCC will not be bound by any earlier decision in the decades-long jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court and all other courts will be bound by the decisions of the FCC.
 
 

In the future, a Special Parliamentary Committee will select the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the FCC from amongst the judges of the respective courts. There is no stated criterion for a judge being selected to either position. Previously, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court was automatically selected as the chief justice of Pakistan without any selection by the government.
The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), which selects judges for elevation to the Supreme Court, the FCC and the high courts by voting, will be dominated by political, executive-branch members. Only five out of 13 members of the JCP will be judicial appointments (two executive-appointed FCC judges and two senior-most judges of the SC, and one more judge of either court).
Before the 26th Amendment, the judges of the superior courts were selected by a JCP which had a majority of judicial members; this means that the judiciary was selecting judges from within itself without being outvoted by the executive’s representatives on the JCP.
The executive-dominated JCP will also have the power to recommend the transfer of judges from one high court to another through the President. If a judge does not accept the transfer, they will undergo disciplinary proceedings (which are not public) before the Supreme Judicial Council (consisting of executive-appointed judges) and may be removed for misconduct. There is no stated criterion on the basis of which judges may be transferred from one court to another, and therefore no way of assessing whether there are any legitimate grounds for transfer.
Amendments have also been made to grant lifetime immunity from arrest, and all criminal and civil proceedings to the President and anyone holding the ranks of Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet, and Marshal of the Air Force. The position of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has been abolished. The National Strategic Command has been transferred to the military. The army chief will be the Chief of Defence Forces, making him the head of all military services, including the army, navy and air force. The Field Marshal has been empowered to retain his rank, privileges and uniform for life.
And finally, there is another person-specific amendment which allows Justice Yahya Afridi to retain his title of the CJP. After him, the title may no longer reside at the Supreme Court.
Did the judiciary need this overhaul?
According to the regime, its unelected parliamentarians and pro-regime opinion makers, these amendments are necessary to control a superior judiciary that had become all-powerful and was stepping outside its constitutional role.
Some judges, they say, are too “independent”, guilty of judicial overreach, and that is not desirable. The Saqib Nisar, Khosa and Bandial terms are particularly lamented.
Let’s divide “judicial overreach” into two categories. The first category is where courts have interfered in politics or persecuted politicians, and the second category is where courts have made populist decisions that interfered with policy.
 
 

When courts have interfered with politics, endorsed martial laws or removed prime ministers, it was not because they were “independently” exercising their own preferences. It was because they were too susceptible to pressure from certain quarters that used them as tools for political engineering. Decisions in Maulvi Tamizuddin, Dosso, Nusrat Bhutto, and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto are a testament to the courts being used to achieve state objectives and not judicial preferences.
More recently, the judges of the Islamabad High Court, in a display of historic courage and national spirit, through their letter to the then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa and more recently through petitions before the Supreme Court, have documented the kind of coercion and pressure judges in this country are subject to when they act “independently”.
Mere days ago, Justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to Chief Justice Afridi, detailed the pressure judges were under before passing an “undesirable” judgment in favour of the PTI in the reserved seats matter.
Does this demonstrate a judiciary so “independent” that it must be brought under executive control? Absolutely not.
In cases where the courts have acted out of socio-economic populism and interfered with policy or the Supreme Court exercised its original jurisdiction under Article 184(3), the record is mixed. While there have been dam debacles, there has also been progress for missing persons/enforced disappearances, women’s rights and environmental actions.
There is no denying that there have been judicial excesses at times, but the courts have also advanced fundamental rights and kept creeping authoritarianism and state overreach in check. It’s possible to acknowledge a mixed record without dismantling the entire institution.
 
 

As with any evolving institution in a nascent, post-colonial democracy prone to military takeovers, the judiciary has been imperfect, sometimes excessive and at others more accommodating of certain interests. If the problem is that the judiciary has been too easily influenced or captured in the past, the solution cannot be to strip it entirely of independence and render it beholden to the executive.
Especially when the executive is as prone to elite/ military capture as it is in Pakistan; this will only intensify the use of courts as a tool for political engineering and punishing opponents, with no recourse or hope of a dissenting opinion.
A more basic and easily debunked argument is that these changes to judicial structure will solve the problem of case pendency and litigation delays. This is a catchy lie. Cases at the Supreme Court account for less than three per cent of pending cases nationwide. The remaining case pendency is before the district and high courts, where endemic issues of understaffing, underfunding, poor case management, corruption and bribery, and a culture of litigation continue unabated.
Parliamentary supremacy or constitutional democracy?
The regime and its friends will tell you that Parliament is supreme and can amend the Constitution as it wishes. They will also tell you that such amendments cannot be questioned by any court because of Parliament’s absolute power to amend laws under Article 239 of the Constitution.
There are several responses to this claim of parliamentary supremacy. The first and most intellectually honest response is that constitutional democracies and legal traditions across the world disagree about the origin and distribution of power within a constitutional separation of powers arrangement.
Common law systems such as the USA and India have stood by constitutional supremacy. The courts have extensive powers of judicial review, and in India and other countries, the basic structure doctrine is recognised, which means that the basic features of the constitution, such as separation of powers, democracy, and independence of the judiciary, cannot be amended away by parliament.
 
 

This indicates that the legislature cannot amend the basic social contract into anything it desires simply because it has the procedural ability to do so. The doctrine is also recognised by the Supreme Court in District Bar Association Rawalpindi vs Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2015 SC 401).
Separately, as argued by Justice Isa in his Rawalpindi Bar judgment, the 1973 Constitution did not envision parliamentary sovereignty, which prevented courts from reviewing amendments. Article 239’s bar on judicial review of amendments was introduced in the 8th Amendment so a dictator, General Zia-ul-Haq, could maximise his own power. Therefore, these provisions are inherently undemocratic and illegitimate.
There is also the preamble to the 1973 Constitution, which seeks to establish representative democracy, federalism and an independent judiciary. If all of these features may be amended away, then what is the nature of the constitutional document?
We should consider whether a strong, independent judiciary as a watchdog of salient constitutional features is more likely to serve our democracy and protect fundamental rights, or an entirely unchecked parliament with unlimited legislative powers.
While reasonable (and honest) people may disagree about the origins of constituent and amendment powers and constitutional versus legislative supremacy, one thing should not be lost in the noise of seemingly innocent democratic arguments: even if parliament is supreme, an embellished parliament, representing the interests of a select few, does not have the legitimacy to amend the Constitution of Pakistan into oblivion.
Legitimate constitutional amendments are the product of democratic consensus, public debate and transparent collaboration over months and years, not the work of invisible forces rushed through in hours and days.
The road to the present
Other worrying explanations for how we have ended up here include a lack of resistance and truth-telling over the past several years, all the way up to the passage of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, and the 26th Amendment.
 
 

Dissonant positions born out of severe political partisanship and a deep-rooted national cynicism about “how things are” in Pakistan haven’t helped. Fear of a PTI populist wave and distrust of its leadership caused many ‘progressives’ to cheerlead and justify one encroachment on civilian supremacy after another.
Deep divisions within the senior judiciary following the reference against Justice Isa resulted in the inability to put aside personal agendas and opportunism to protect the institution. External actors didn’t have to try very hard when, at every juncture, judges stood ready to become collaborators, undermining each other and the court in pursuit of personal gain or animosity.
Why should the average Pakistani care?
The 26th and 27th Amendments to the Constitution are the latest assault on fundamental rights and democratic freedoms in Pakistan. But they are part of the same coercive project that seeks to crush the will of the people, keep their elected representatives out of office, and entrench an unelected elite at the top.
No ordinary Pakistani, irrespective of political affiliation or ideological gymnastics, will remain unaffected or benefit from the collapse of the judiciary and the empowerment of military elites. This will not stop here.
We already know the damage an executive-controlled court can do, not just in our history, but in the conduct and decisions of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench following the 26th Amendment. It reversed the SC’s reserved seats decision and gave an unrepresentative majority to an unelected government by denying reality. It allowed the secret court martials of ordinary civilians. It allowed the transfer of judges as an instrument of control. It argued in riddles and tautologies to justify the 26th Amendment.
 
 

In exchange, Justice Aminuddin, who led this bench, has been rewarded with the chief justiceship of the new FCC. As this piece is being written, he takes the oath for the new position.
Whenever there is a violation of fundamental rights or unlawful acts by the state, the matter will go before the FCC. When the state is being tried by a court that it has hand-picked, the citizens will lose every time.
The chaos created by artificially splitting constitutional and appellate jurisdictions in the context of the Pakistani legal system, with no precedent to guide it, will bring the entire system into deadlock.
The state’s ability to transfer or deselect a judge anytime they show defiance or “independence” will eliminate every judge’s ability to stand up for citizens and prevent rare public victories. The fight against the 26th and 27th Amendments is a fight for every Pakistani’s right to justice. It is not a fight to protect the judiciary for its own sake.
Where do we go from here?
In this moment, it is not enough to hope that these constitutional amendments will end up in the dustbin of history by virtue of time. There is a fundamental obligation on every Pakistani to resist the re-writing of our relationship with the state through illegitimate means by unrepresentative, undemocratic forces.
No leaders, political parties or bar councils are coming to our rescue. Most are complicit, co-opted or coerced. The people will have to come together, overcome our apathy and determine the course of our future.
The resignations of Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah from the Supreme Court are a testament to the severity of the crisis. But they are also a spark of hope and a reminder that individuals can put aside personal gain in defence of greater principles.

As Justice Shah wrote, nations that prosper are those that place the rule of law at the heart of their governance and preserve judicial independence as a sacred trust.
He reminds us that the law is a calling of conscience. There is an undeniable onus on judges and lawyers to defend the Constitution and the independence of the judiciary against these amendments.
May every Pakistani judge, lawyer and citizen exercise their conscience in these darkest of times.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1411350117098db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955039/fresh-us-draft-on-gaza-mentions-path-to-palestinian-statehood-while-russia-submits-counter-proposal' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh US draft on Gaza mentions path to Palestinian statehood while Russia submits counter proposal</strong></a><br><p>The United States circulated a second revision of its draft resolution on Gaza at the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Thursday, even as Russia countered with its own text calling for the preservation of the current ceasefire and a renewed commitment to a two-state solution.
Senior UN diplomats told Dawn that Washington placed “Revision 2” of its draft under a silence procedure until 6:30pm New York time on November 13, a step intended to indicate that the negotiation phase was nearly complete. Under this procedure, the absence of objections signifies consent.
“But China and Russia broke the silence,” one diplomat said, noting that both delegations submitted formal objections shortly before the deadline. “Once silence is broken, other member states may also submit comments — and some did — although Pakistan did not,“ the diplomat added.
Following the break, Russia swiftly distributed its own draft resolution to UNSC members.
Breaking silence means, the US may now be forced to resume negotiations. Washington may still put its draft “in blue”, the final pre-vote format, but doing so without addressing the concerns of permanent members would almost certainly trigger a veto.
Diplomats said another negotiation round is now expected before any vote is scheduled.
The latest US revision builds on Trump’s broader post-conflict Gaza plan, which includes the creation of a foreign-administered “Board of Peace” to manage Gaza during a transitional period. The plan also proposes the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to disarm armed groups and secure the territory.
The plan places Gaza under a multilateral but foreign-led body while Palestinian institutions undergo reforms. Several countries have expressed reservations about this model, prompting Washington to refine the language in its second revision.
One of the most significant additions in the revised draft is the explicit call to maintain the Gaza ceasefire, a concession made after weeks of discussions with Arab, Muslim and European delegations.
The US also expanded the section on Palestinian statehood. The new language in Operative Paragraph 2 (OP2) states: “After the Palestinian Authority reform programme is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”
The paragraph then commits Washington to political engagement, saying: “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”
This wording aims to reassure delegates that Palestinian statehood will not be indefinitely delayed, but will depend on concrete progress in governance and reconstruction.
Another change specifically clarifies that the Board of Peace’s authority is strictly “transitional”, addressing concerns from several UNSC members that the board might evolve into a long-term trusteeship.
Crucially, diplomats noted that the revised draft also specifies the conditions for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The revised language states that Israel will withdraw “as the ISF establishes control and stability”.
By linking withdrawal to ISF deployment and consolidation, the US draft outlines a phased exit rather than an immediate pullout, something that has drawn objections from Moscow and Beijing.
Russia’s counter-resolution
In response to the US initiative, Russia circulated its own draft resolution on Thursday evening. Moscow’s proposal centres on preserving the ceasefire, guaranteeing humanitarian access, and reaffirming the two-state solution without introducing foreign transitional authorities or an externally imposed governance structure.
The Russian draft cites the UN Charter and recalls “all its relevant resolutions on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, as well as a UN General Assembly resolution on the peaceful settlement of the conflict.
It “welcomes the initiative that led to the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”, referring to the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict of September 29, and calls on all parties — with UN facilitation — to determine practical steps to implement it.
The resolution also “stresses the need to maintain the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that should lead to a comprehensive and permanent cessation of hostilities”, urging all sides to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law.
On humanitarian issues, Moscow’s draft “demands full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access” for UN agencies and partners, both to expand relief operations and to support reconstruction.
The Russian text also takes a firm position against changes to Gaza’s geography, saying: “The Security Council rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of the Gaza Strip.”
On the political framework, the resolution “reiterates its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution”, and stresses the importance of “the unity and the territorial contiguity of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”.
It concludes with the standard clause that the UNSC “decides to remain actively seized of the matter”.
With silence broken on the US draft, Washington is now preparing for another round of consultations. Senior diplomats say the two competing drafts reflect “a deeper divide over who should shape Gaza’s post-war administration — and on what timeline Palestinian statehood should become actionable”.
Both texts emphasise the ceasefire and humanitarian access, but differ sharply on governance, security arrangements, and the nature of international involvement. The US plan proposes transitional foreign supervision and conditional political progress, while the Russian draft anchors itself in existing UN frameworks and rejects foreign administrative bodies.
Diplomats in New York expect “intense, possibly prolonged” negotiations before the Security Council takes action on either draft.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69167a93ec759.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954920/focus-back-on-cricket-as-pakistan-eye-series-triumph-over-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Focus back on cricket as Pakistan eye series triumph over Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: After a day and a night of chaos, focus will finally shift back to cricket when Pakistan take on Sri Lanka in the second One-day International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Friday.
The encounter — Pakistan’s opportunity to wrap up their second successive ODI series — comes after a turbulent 48 hours that threatened to overshadow the cricket itself. The match was originally slated for Thursday, but the schedule was thrown into disarray after a terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday sparked understandable concern within the Sri Lankan camp.
Reports soon emerged that several visiting players were contemplating abandoning the tour altogether. The uncertainty prompted urgent intervention from Pakistan’s interior minister and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who, along with the country’s top security officials, held lengthy discussions with the Sri Lankan delegation to assure them of their safety.
By late Wednesday night, the situation had stabilised. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) reaffirmed its commitment to completing the series, a gesture that was met with appreciation across Pakistan.
“Thank you Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan cricket board,” Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi said in a video released by the PCB. “You have supported us in difficult times. We are grateful.”
 






Speculation that a few Sri Lankan players would fly home and be replaced by fresh faces was swiftly denied by the team’s manager, who confirmed there would be no changes to the touring party. That assurance means the visitors will field a full-strength line-up in Rawalpindi as they attempt to level the three-match series following a narrow defeat in the opener.
In the first ODI, Pakistan’s six-run victory owed much to a remarkable century by Salman Ali Agha and a fiery spell of fast bowling from Haris Rauf. The two combined to restrict Sri Lankan dominance at crucial junctures before the match went Pakistan’s way.
Salman, coming in with his side struggling at 76-3, stitched together a crucial 138-run partnership with Hussain Talat to lift Pakistan to a defendable total. Haris then ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order with four wickets, halting their chase just when it appeared they were cruising.
Shaheen’s men, however, will be aware that they cannot rely on individual brilliance alone. Their top order faltered once again, scoring just 76 in the first 20 overs, a familiar pattern that has left Pakistan’s middle order under constant pressure in recent months. The bowling, too, lacked discipline early on, as Sri Lanka raced to 85 in 12 overs before Haris’ intervention.
Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka, meanwhile, will take heart from his side’s aggressive start in the first match but lamented the lack of composure during key phases. The visitors also found themselves on the wrong side of fortune, having burned both their reviews early before one tight lbw shout against Hussain that replays later suggested could have gone either way.
“It was phenomenal, the way our bowlers started,” Asalanka said afterwards. “But one decision went against us, and that was unlucky. We couldn’t capitalise after that.”
With the series on the line, both teams will look to regroup mentally after the off-field turbulence. Pakistan will want to build on their momentum and seal the contest, while Sri Lanka will hope to draw inspiration from their composure in adversity.

Over the January-October period, Pakistan’s edible oil imports stood at 3.07m tonnes, surpassing the 3m tonnes imported in 2024.
“This is a huge increase going on … and this is primarily because of the surge in the population growth and also certain economic development,” Jan Mohammed told an industry conference on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali.
 
 

The country imported around 2.9m tonnes to 3m tonnes per year from 2022 to 2024. Over the January-October period, it imported 2.2m tonnes of oilseeds.
During a recent consultative meeting on edible oil regularisation, it was highlighted that approximately 30 per cent of edible oil consumed in Pakistan annually — more than 4.5m tonnes — comprises unbranded, loose oil, primarily found in semi-urban and rural areas.
Experts said that the loose oil, typically sold in bulk without proper packaging or labelling, often contains harmful chemicals, impurities, and biological contaminants. These pose serious health threats, including cardiovascular diseases, strokes, and brain disorders, they warned.</p><small>2025-11-14 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1408090757db9bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954954/two-ihc-judges-signal-exit-after-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Two IHC judges signal exit after 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: At least two judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have hinted they might not be available to hear cases in the federal capital from next month, amid speculation about possible transfers following the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz made these remarks while hearing separate cases on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively.
During the hearing of a case related to a private company before Justice Kayani on Thursday, a lawyer requested that the final arguments be scheduled for the first week of December.
However, Justice Kayani responded: “In the first week of December, another judge will be sitting here to hear this case.”
The lawyer expressed his concern, saying, “Sir, don’t say things like this that make us uncomfortable.”
Justice Kayani replied with a smile, “No problem. I am happy about it.”
When the lawyer said, “Sir, you will leave… we have a lot to learn from you”, Justice Kayani reiterated, “No problem, I am happy.”
A day earlier, Justice Imtiaz had made similar remarks during the hearing of another case, saying that her bench might not be available from December, when a counsel sought an adjournment for the following week.
 
 

It may be recalled that five IHC judges, including Justi­ces Kayani and Imtiaz, had strongly challenged the tra­n­s­fer of incumbent Chief Jus­ti­­ce Sardar Mohammad Sarf­raz Dogar to the Islamabad High Court earlier this year.
The recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary.
According to sources, the transfers of high court judges are exp­ected to take place in phases, with the IHC likely to be affected first.

“Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth posted on social media platform X.
“This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,” he said.
 






The post gave no details of what the operation would entail or how it might differ from military actions already being undertaken.
President Donald Trump’s administration is conducting a military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, deploying naval and air forces for what it calls an anti-drugs offensive.
US forces have carried out strikes on about 20 vessels in international waters in the region since early September, killing at least 76 people, according to US figures.
Asked for clarification on the precise nature of Operation Southern Spear, a Pentagon spokesperson simply referred inquiries back to Hegseth’s post on X.
CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land.
Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region.
Caracas fears the deployment, which also includes F-35 stealth warplanes sent to Puerto Rico and six US Navy ships in the Caribbean, is a regime change plot in disguise.</p><small>2025-11-14 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13230312748df31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954892/flagrant-attack-on-independence-of-judiciary-jurists-body-assails-newly-enacted-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>‘Flagrant attack on independence of judiciary’: jurists’ body assails newly enacted 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) on Thursday issued a statement assailing the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, calling it a “flagrant attack” on judicial independence and the rule of law.
Last year, the ICJ similarly derided the 26th Constitutional Amendment being signed into law as a “blow to judicial independence”.
ICJ Secretary General Santiago Canton was quoted as saying: “The changes made to the judicial system in the 27th Amendment are alarming …They will significantly impair the judiciary’s ability to hold the executive accountable and protect the fundamental human rights of the people of Pakistan.”
The jurists’ body expressed concern over several main points, namely the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), the appointment of judges and chief justices to the Supreme Court and the FCC, the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes between any of Pakistan’s governments, provincial and federal and to adjudicate matters of public interest involving the enforcement of ‘fundamental rights’,” the statement read, adding that it can call for the record of any case and hear appeals if they deal with interpreting the Constitution.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the statement read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
 
 

“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
“The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted.
The ICJ noted that amendments to Article 200 (transfer of high court judges) allow the JCP to recommend that the president transfer a judge from one high court to another, with the judge in question forced to accept the transfer within 30 days, lest they be barred from judicial duties.
“Article 200 fails to provide for any basis on which the JCP will decide when judges should be transferred and there is no requirement to establish a mechanism with clearly defined criteria and objectives to guide recommendations for transfer,” the ICJ said.
“This arbitrary system makes it impossible to determine whether transfer might actually be intended to be punitive or retaliatory, rather than for the legitimate purpose of better administration of justice and public interest.”
With regards to lifetime immunity granted to the president, the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the fleet under Articles 243 and 248, the ICJ said the amendments are “contrary to core rule of law principles, including accountability, access to justice, and equality before the law”.
“No public official should ever be entirely unaccountable, as this effectively allows for the possibility of unlawful or arbitrary exercise of power without consequence,” the statement read.
Senate’s approval
The president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-14 04:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/140932293cebecd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955030/afghan-regimes-move-to-suspend-trade-sends-shock-waves-through-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan regime’s move to suspend trade sends shock waves through KP</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: The sudden announcement of the Afghan Taliban regime about abrupt suspension of trade ties with Pakistan on Thursday sent shock waves through the trading, industrial and transportation circles in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with the reopening of Pak-Afghan border points out of sight.
Traders and customs clearing agents expressed serious apprehensions about grave economic implications of Kabul’s move for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in particular and the country in general.
In a video message on Thursday, Afghan Taliban regime First Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar warned all Afghan traders and industrialists against maintaining any trading relationship with Pakistan and warned that his government would not be responsible for any trouble or losses faced by Afghan exporters and importers.
Announcing an end to the country’s all trading contracts with Pakistanis in three months’ time, he asked Afghan traders to explore “new avenues” and approach other countries for trading items needed by the people of Afghanistan.

Business leader fears country will lose big market in both Afghanistan, Central Asia

Reacting to the Afghan Taliban regime’s announcement regarding abrupt suspension of trade with Pakistan, Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice-president of Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, feared that Pakistan would lose a big market in both Afghanistan and Central Asian States, with whom Pakistan just recently signed trade agreements worth millions of dollars.
He said that Afghanistan had the option to sign business deals with almost all Central Asian States along with Iran and Turkiye on easier terms than Pakistan’s, with Pakistan permanently losing the Afghan market, much to the displeasure of the local trading community and colossal financial losses to the country’s industry.
Mr Sarhadi said that Pakistan was exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics and a number of locally manufactured items valuing around $100-200 million per month.
“We are the ultimate losers due to the closure of our border with Afghanistan as Kabul has more choices than us,” he argued.
 
 

Zahidullah Shinwari, a former president of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that besides losing the Afghan and Central Asian States markets, the suspension of trade with Afghanistan would also seriously affect the tax collection of Federal Bureau of Revenue, which was collecting millions of rupees on a daily basis from both exports and imports at all border points.
He said that industry in KP would be particularly hit hard by the trade suspension with Afghanistan as the KP industry was heavily reliant on its products to Afghanistan, while they couldn’t compete with industry in Punjab and Sindh due to several reasons.
“Much of our big industry, especially cement factories, are run by coal imported from Afghanistan, so suspension of coal import from Afghanistan will adversely affect the production capacity of our big industries,” he said.
He warned if the trade with Afghanistan ended permanently, it would result in the closure of a majority of industrial units in KP with hundreds of industrial labour becoming jobless, while the owners would go bankrupt.
The SCCI leader said that the continued border disturbance and subsequent closure was ‘a losing bargain’ for Pakistan as it would do away with its grip and monopoly over the Afghan and Central Asian States markets.
“We need to rethink our security policies as our financial losses are much bigger than any political point scoring on the diplomatic front over the security issues against Afghanistan,” he said.
Mujeebullah Shinwari, president of Torkham Clearing Agents’ Association, argued that the border closure and subsequent trade suspension had confronted local traders and transporters with huge financial losses.
He said that local transporters were heavily rallied on trade with Afghanistan and therefore, the trade suspension would render thousands of tribesmen jobless in the acute financial crises facing the country.
Mr Shinwari said that around 500 vehicles loaded with a variety of export goods were stranded on the Pakistan side of the border as they had no choice but to wait for a reopening of the border.
He said that neither the exporter nor the industrials were now willing to take back the merchandise they had sold to Afghanistan while the transporters too had received their fare up to Kabul and were now under contractual obligation to deliver the consignment to the designated firm in Afghanistan.
“This is a very uncertain situation and also very unfortunate for the local traders and transporters as they are now caught between the devil and deep sea”, he said.

“We didn’t know where TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi have gone,” a senior officer in Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told this reporter on Thursday.
According to him, both of them were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 FIRs lodged against them.
Quoting the intelligence reports, the police official said the TLP chief and his brother were not using any kind of electronic gadget or device and that was the leading factor that helped them to stay away from the radars/gadgets of the law enforcers.

Officials claim arrest of 1,250 key members, financiers; say duo not using gadgets; reject allegations about harassing female family members of ‘wanted’ TLP men

“We used many modern gadgets and technologies to trace them but failed to find out their whereabouts in the country,” the official claimed.
 
 

He said the ‘mysterious disappearance’ of Saad and Anas has baffled the Punjab police and other law-enforcement agencies.
“I can only make sure that they are not in Punjab’s territory,” the official said, adding that the provincial police experts, who were assigned tasks to trace and arrest them, could only obtain four possible locations when they managed to flee from Muridke city soon after the operation.
Their locations were identified in a remote area of Muridke, then in Lahore and Azad Jammu & Kashmir.
As per the later reports, the Punjab police were informed that the TLP chief and his brother may have gone underground in Karachi, he said.
About the crackdown in Lahore, the official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of the party.
So, the major focus of the police remained arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore.
“We have prepared two lists of the TLP members for carrying out violent agitation and attacks on the police,” he said.
A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke where they had encountered with the LEAs.
The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said adding that in the crackdowns continued on a daily basis, the city police have arrested a total of 1,250 hardcore TLP members and the financiers so far.
Sources said sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes.
A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid police crackdown.
According to the sources, they had no option other than to abandon the educational activities of their children as they were frequently changing locations amid reports that the police teams were vigorously pursuing them to complete the ‘targeted’ arrests.
The police officers, however, claimed that they were not harassing or arresting the female members of the TLP members wanted in the cases lodged against them under heinous offences.
Talking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity, a station house officer (SHO) posted in Lahore confirmed that they were under immense pressure to complete the task of arresting the ‘wanted’ TLP men.
In order to trace them, they had no option other than to take into custody the close relatives of the ‘targets’ including father, brothers, young sons and their immediate cousins.
“After taking them into custody, we used to get the call record data of the close male relatives of the wanted TLP men to find out whether they were in contact with them or not,” the SHO said.
Though this practice could not be justified, it was employed to reach the ‘targeted’ TLP men and in many cases it worked and helped them to arrest the suspects.
He, however, rejected the allegations that they were harassing the female family members of the ‘wanted’ TLP men.

“On average, refugee households have more members than host community households and the national average,” the report ‘Forced Displacement Survey — Pakistan, 2024’ says, adding that the national average is 6.3, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
The survey highlights a significant dependency burden, with the age dependency ratio at 137 among refugees and 105 in the host community.
This indicates more than one dependent for every working-age individual in both groups, a figure higher than the world average of 55. The data also showed 54 per cent of children in refugee households are under age 4, compared to 31 per cent in the host community.

Says the typical refugee family has 8.9 people, exceeding the national average of 6.3.

Also, the refugee population is predominantly young, with half of all refugees, nearly 620,000 children, under the age of 15.
Child marriage rates were also found to be alarmingly high. Approximately 5pc of refugee girls are married before the age of 15 and 25pc before 18.
This means one in every four girls in the refugee community is married before adulthood. The rates are lower but still significant in the host community, where 2pc of girls are married before 15 and 12pc before 18.
According to Unicef and the World Bank, child marriage is closely linked to poor health outcomes, reduced educational attainment, and economic hardship — particularly among vulnerable populations such as refugees.
The survey also sheds light on the origins of the refugee population, revealing that the majority were born in Pakistan. Around three-quarters of refugees aged 18 and above were born in the host country.
Only 24pc, or approximately 160,000 individuals, were born in Afghanistan. Nine in ten refugees have at least one parent who is or was also a refugee.
Marriage rates among household heads are high in both communities. Among refugees, 96 percent of males and 60 percent of females are married. In the host community, 95 per cent of male household heads and 40pc of female household heads are married.
This potentially indicates that among both refugees and host communities, most female-headed households are single-parent households.
For over four decades, Pakistan has hosted more than three million Afghan refugees, making it one of the world’s leading refugee-hosting nations. The survey focused on Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, the majority of whom live in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
 
 

In addition to registered refugees, UNHCR has recorded data on approximately 190,000 Afghan asylum-seekers and refugees who arrived after the Taliban takeover in 2021.
Of these, an estimated 110,000 are considered to have “extreme vulnerabilities and would be at risk of imminent harm if returned to Afghanistan”.
The Forced Displacement Survey (FDS) is UNHCR’s flagship programme for producing high-quality data on displaced populations. Data collection for the survey was conducted by the Centre for Development and Evaluation (C4ED) under UNHCR supervision between March 2024 and January 2025.

The company is likely to establish technical collaborations, knowledge-sharing, and feasibility studies to assess specific investment projects in partnership with local entities.
Nova Minerals is a dual Nasdaq and ASX-listed gold, antimony and critical minerals mining exploration and development company, and its delegation, led by Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Gerteisen, held a meeting with Minister for Board of Investment, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, on Thursday, and showed interest particularly in antimony and rare earth minerals.
The leader of the delegation stated that Pakistan’s geological diversity, coupled with government facilitation and policy reforms, offers ample opportunities and makes it an attractive destination for long-term investment.
Lauding Nova Minerals’ interest in Pakistan’s mineral exploration sector, Minister Qaiser Sheikh informed the delegation that the government encourages responsible, technology-driven ventures that ensure sustainability and local value addition. Such initiatives would help create an ecosystem conducive to further foreign investment in Pakistan’s mining sector.
 
 

The investment minister noted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly supports foreign investments and joint ventures, recognising them as key drivers of economic growth and modernisation. He also lauded the efforts of the business community and international partners who continue to build confidence in Pakistan’s investment climate.
During the meeting, Mr Qaiser Sheikh highlighted Pakistan’s vast and largely untapped potential in the minerals and mining sector, emphasising that the country offers promising investment opportunities across multiple areas, particularly in the exploration and processing of high-value minerals.
He underscored that foreign investment in mining will not only unlock Pakistan’s natural resources but also strengthen bilateral economic relations, promote technology transfer, and create opportunities for skill development and higher education exchanges, enabling Pakistani professionals and students to return with advanced expertise.

The latest meeting, held at the company’s head office in Karachi on Thursday, was convened with the same agenda put forward earlier this month, i.e. the removal of CEO Moonis Alvi.
However, the effort faltered as the meeting witnessed serious differences among the government board members and those from the private sector. A majority of board members walked out, effectively blocking the motion.
 
 

Company sources told Dawn that, unlike the previous meeting on Nov 5, Thursday’s session met all legal requirements and began with a quorum. Nine of the 10 directors were present, though the federal finance secretary was unable to attend. Proceedings were recorded in line with the procedure.

Motion blocked as majority of board members leave six-minute meeting

However, the meeting lasted only six minutes. As the agenda centred on the CEO’s removal, Mr Alvi did not attend.
After the meeting opened, five directors — Adeeb Ahmad, Mubasher H. Sheikh, Muhammad Kamran Kamal, Saad Amanullah Khan and Shan A. Ashary — excused themselves and left the venue.
This left only the two government nominees — the Secretary of Power and director Javed Kureishi, who had called the meeting — in the room. Board Chairman Mark Gerard Skelton also remained on the premises.
The walkout rendered the meeting unworkable and the attempt to unseat the CEO collapsed for a second time.
Later, K-Electric forwarded its report to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) titled ‘Board Meeting Other Than Financial Results’.
“In continuation of our intimation dated Nov 7, this is to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held on Thursday, 13 November 2025, considered matters other than the financial results of the Company. Please inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” the company’s statement said.

• Achakzai wants  demos on Fridays
• KP CM stopped from meeting Imran for sixth time
ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the resignations of the judges of the top court and urging the judiciary to stand on its feet, the PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee has suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
However, the suggestions will be discussed in a meeting of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday (today), followed by a press conference.
 






The parliamentary party’s meeting was chaired by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief and TTAP chairman, and attended by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Asad Qaiser and other members of the National Assembly.
Former NA speaker Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said during the meeting, proposals were sought to devise a strategy after the passage of the 27th Amendment.
“The participants [of the meeting] unanimously agreed that the incumbent government is not capable to run the country. At the same time there is an economic crisis, miserable law and order situation and the country is at the verge of a civil war,” he said.
Mr Qaiser said Mr Achakzai was of the view that the countries, which lac­ked respect for the law and Constitution, were destined to fall apart.
 
 

“[Mr] Achakzai suggested involving the religious segment of the society and holding a countrywide protest on Fridays.”
Replying to a question, the former NA speaker said the resignation of the two judges was a commendable act and marked the first drop of rain against the government.
“We urge the judiciary to stand on its feet because the whole nation will stand along with it over the issue,” he continued.
He said that a meeting of the TTAP to be held on Friday would chalk out and announce the collective strategy of the joint opposition.
KP CM denied meeting again
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was stopped from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan for the sixth time on Thursday.
Mr Afridi, along with other leaders of the opposition, including Raja Nasir Abbas and Junaid Akbar, reached Adiala jail, but were not allowed to enter its premises.
Later, they returned to their vehicles as the time for the meeting had expired.
The KP chief minister, while talking to reporters, said that it was unfortunate that the orders of Islamabad High Court were not being implemented.
It is worth mentioning that the apex court has directed to allow the KP chief minister’s meeting with the PTI founder.
Mr Afridi wondered as to why there was a fear if he held a meeting with his party’s patron-in-chief.
“Am I going to discuss nuclear secrets with him?” he remarked.
He urged the security establishment to “focus on the borders of the country” and allow the politicians to address their issues through politics.

Mari Energies — a joint venture of Fauji Foundation and the federal government and its other entities — has emerged as the leader by securing stakes in all 23 blocks in the bidding round, in which a total of 40 offshore blocks were offered by the government.
The Islamabad-based Mari Energies said that it secured all the 23 blocks, as operator in 18 and as joint venture partner in the remaining five blocks. Mari has 100pc ownership and operatorship in 10 offshore blocks and majority shares along with operatorship of eight others.
Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) — the country’s oldest producer and Karachi-based state-owned enterprise — secured six blocks as operator and partnership in two others, while the largest producer — Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), based in Islamabad — was awarded two blocks as operator and six others as joint venture partner.

Mari Energies and partners secure new stakes as govt eyes global investors for next exploration phase

Prime Global Energies — a private firm — also secured operatorship in one block with 31pc stakes, with the remaining 23pc each by Mari, PPL and OGDCL.
These awards are subject to the execution of production sharing agreements (PSAs), the grant of exploration licences, the signing of joint operating agreements (JOAs) among the respective partners, and the completion of other legal and procedural formalities.
The government had received on Oct 31 a total of 23 bids for 40 offshore blocks on offer for exploration. The provisional awards for 23 blocks covered a total area of about 53,510 square kilometres.
Earlier last month, the government had received only one bid for 23 onshore exploration blocks on offer from Mari Energies and that too from Mari Energies. International and local private-sector partners, like Turkish Petroleum, United Energy, Orient Petroleum, and Fatima Petroleum, are also part of these joint venture partners, underscoring growing international interest in Pakistan’s offshore potential, according to the Petroleum Division.
The exploration attempts by leading international firms like Shell and ExxonMobil in Pakistan’s offshore blocks remained unsuccessful, the latest by a consortium led by ExxonMobil about five years ago in Kekra-1, despite the availability of promising hydrocarbon data.
 
 

Before initiating the process, the Petroleum Division developed a model production sharing agreement (MPSA), a key document integrated into the bid package, to ensure transparency, competitiveness, and investor confidence. In parallel, the Offshore Petroleum Rules were promulgated to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework, paving the way for renewed offshore exploration in Pakistan’s waters.
A recent basin study conducted by the US firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) has indicated a significant yet-to-find potential of hydrocarbons in Pakistan’s offshore basins. Building on this encouraging assessment, the Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched with a view to offering blocks that allow companies to undertake systematic exploration efforts to test various geological plays across both the Indus and Makran basins.
The Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched in January this year after a gap of 18 years for the grant of petroleum exploration licenses in 40 Indus and Makan offshore blocks near the jurisdictions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Petroleum Division said a total of 4,427 work units have been committed for these 23 blocks during Phase-1 of the initial three-year license period, representing an investment of approximately $80 million. The companies have submitted work programmes designed to progressively mitigate the geological risks, and in the event of exploration drilling, investments could reach up to $750m to $1bn, it said.
During Phase-1, the companies will undertake comprehensive geophysical and geological (G&G) studies, including seismic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation, to better define the hydrocarbon potential of Pakistan’s offshore basins. Upon completion of these studies, the Phase-II work programme will be finalised, which will include drilling of exploratory wells in the prospective areas.
The statement said the government strategy to initiate exploration in both the Indus and Makran basins simultaneously paid off, as reflected in the participation and outcome of the bid round. After the completion of G&G work and drilling planning, the ministry will invite global oil majors to join the next phase of offshore exploration, several of whom are already in contact with the government and local companies and are currently evaluating the available data.

The incident occurred when the CTD’s SWAT team was conducting a “targeted operation” in the Kanda Pul area of Mardan district and tried to stop two men on a motorcycle, a statement by the department said.  
The suspects opened fire on the officers, who “narrowly escaped” harm, prompting the team to return fire, killing both assailants. 
The deceased were later identified as Noman, known by the aliases Murad and Ghaznavi, and Sohail, also called Charsi.  
According to the Coun­ter Terrorism Department, they were implicated in the murders of Head Constable Amjad, Cons­table Iqrar Syed, and a bystander named Ehtesham.  
Additional charges of murder and attempted murder were also filed against them. 
Following the exchange of fire, authorities recovered a motorcycle, two pistols with ammunition, and a mobile phone from the scene, the statement said.
