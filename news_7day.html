<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16180234b01353d.png?r=180831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597/3-killed-7-injured-as-gunmen-attack-passenger-bus-in-balochistans-kalat' target='_blank'><strong>3 killed, 7 injured as gunmen attack passenger bus in Balochistan’s Kalat</strong></a><br><p>Three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat, according to the provincial government spokesperson.
A statement from Shahid Rind said: “Three passengers were martyred and seven were injured in the tragic incident” when a shooting occurred on a passenger coach coming from Karachi to Quetta in Kalat’s Nemargh area.
He said the injured were being moved to the District Headquarters Hospital Kalat for treatment, adding that an emergency had been imposed at the facility.
“Security agencies, district administration and rescue teams have immediately reached the scene. Security forces have surrounded the area and a search operation is underway. Security forces are pursuing the attackers,” Rind said.
 






Speaking to Geo News, he said Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police and law enforcement agencies.
“Based on initial info, terrorists were sitting in ambush, they stopped the bus and then attacked. We cannot confirm the number of terrorists, but it was carried out from both sides of the road,” Rind said.
State broadcaster PTV also posted a video of a passenger who said the terrorists had indiscriminately fired at the bus.
It also shared a statement from security sources that said: “Ever since the security forces started successful operations against the terrorists of Fitna-Al-Hindustan and the FC (Frontier Corps) sealed the border, cutting off their smuggling income, these cowardly terrorists, in a state of frustration, are targeting the lives of innocent people.
“One of the two reasons for terrorist attacks on passenger buses on highways is that they are soft targets. The second reason is that by carrying out such incidents, they want to divert the army and FC from the border and operation areas to these locations so that the terrorists can operate more easily in the border and operation areas.”
 






President Asif Ali Zardari ordered the provision of immediate and the best medical services to the injured.
“Targeting innocent civilians is an extremely cruel and condemnable act. Terrorists aim to sabotage peace and stability, they are enemies of humanity and peace. With the support of the nation, we will completely eradicate the scourge of terrorism. The state will continue to take action against terrorism with full force.”
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the shooting in Kalat in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing Fitna-Al-Hindustan — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — for targeting civilians.
“The targeting of innocent passengers by Fitna-Al-Hindustan terrorists is a very cowardly act,” he was quoted as saying. “These terrorists are hatching a heinous conspiracy to sabotage peace by targeting soft targets. With the support of the nation, we will foil these conspiracies by Indian-sponsored terrorists.”
“The attack on the passenger coach in Qalat is a cowardly and despicable act of terrorism. The loss of precious lives is an irreparable tragedy. The terrorist organisations of Fitna-Al-Hindustan have previously carried out attacks based on identity, but now they are indiscriminately targeting civilians, which clearly shows that this war is against every ordinary Pakistani, and we will defeat it at all costs!” CM Bugti said in a post on X.
 






National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said that “terrorists of the Indian conspiracy are targeting peace and stability.”
He said the cowardly attack was the “worst example of enmity against humanity”. “We will foil every conspiracy sponsored by India,” he said.
 






Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani termed terrorists the “murderers of all humanity”.
“Terrorists can never succeed in their nefarious objectives. The entire nation is united against terrorism.”
 






Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also condemned the incident.
“Targeting innocent passengers is a very barbaric act. Terrorists are a plague on the nation’s soil,” he said, adding that it was necessary to eliminate such elements for the country’s prosperity.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman said targeting innocent and defenceless civilians was a “heinous act”.
“The state must take decisive and robust action against terrorists. The entire nation and security institutions are united in the fight against terrorism … The government must bring terrorists and their facilitators to justice and deliver exemplary punishment,” she said.
 






PPP MNA and spokesperson Shazia Marri said such incidents went against Baloch traditions.
“Innocent and unarmed people are being killed on foreign instigation; these people do not deserve any leniency. Elements involved in terrorism in Balochistan should be dealt with firmly and decisively.
“The nation is united against the terrorists of Fitna-ul-Hindustan. The cowardly actions of terrorists are increasing; the federal and provincial governments should suppress such elements.”
 






The incident comes a week after at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts.
The government had said that Fitna-al-Hindu­stan had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.
The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.
According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.
The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint. “They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger had told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”
After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area. According to sources, the attackers had checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan.
In March, five people were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.
In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.
Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, nine people were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while two labourers from Punjab were shot in Kech.
In May last year, seven barbers from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw 23 travellers offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.
The Musakhail incident was part of a flare-up of violence, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.
Three injured in Quetta roadside blast: SHO
Later, a roadside bomb exploded in Quetta’s Hazar Ganji area, leaving three women injured. Shalkot police Station House Officer (SHO) Khair Muhammad Samalani told Dawn.com that a bomb planted in a motorcycle was remotely detonated near Murree Camp.
“Immediately after the explosion, police and security agencies surrounded the area and the process of collecting evidence began,” the SHO said, adding that no group claimed responsibility.
“The injured women were immediately transported to Civil Hospital Quetta for medical treatment,” he stated, adding that their condition was said to be “out of danger”.
SHO Samalani added that police and bomb disposal personnel launched search operations at the scene to avert any other potential threats.

On Sunday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which is expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former prime minister’s imprisonment.
At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’, with PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later expressing her reservations over this announcement.
“Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” Imran’s post read.
“My instruction is firm: whether a senior officeholder or a junior member, no one is to express internal differences on social media, electronic media, print media, or any other platform,” he added.
“At this time, many, including myself, are enduring some of the harshest imprisonments. Therefore, I direct every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances,” Imran continued.
He called upon the party to focus exclusively on the protest movement so that fundamental human rights are restored in Pakistan.
“If any party official fails to participate in this movement, I will make the final decision about them myself, even from within jail.”
Malik was conspicuous by her absence at the press conference by KP CM Gandapur. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, she questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.
“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”
“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Raja.
The dec­ision of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats dealt a serious blow to the PTI, which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran’s messages.
Earlier in June, as the KP government passed the budget for the upcoming financial year without the approval of the PTI founder, his sister Aleema Khan claimed that a “minus Imran” formula was now in effect.
Speaking to the media, Aleema had said that if KP CM Gandapur lacked the courage to stand his ground, he should have resigned.
Later, she clarified that she meant that the government, not his party, was trying to isolate her brother.
“Minus Imran Khan, is the government trying to minus him. Is it not minusing that they imprisoned him?” she had said.
Many senior party members believed that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.
Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.</p><small>2025-07-16 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16162642446a714.jpg?r=162658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924584/28-killed-across-punjab-in-rain-related-incidents-over-last-24-hours-rescue-official' target='_blank'><strong>28 killed across Punjab in rain-related incidents over last 24 hours: rescue official</strong></a><br><p>At least 28 people were killed and 90 others injured in rain and storms across Punjab in the past 24 hours, provincial rescue service spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said on Wednesday.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and replenishing water supplies and agriculture. They are crucial to the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In the last 24 hours, roof collapses killed 12 people in Lahore, eight in Faisalabad, three in Sheikhupura, two in Okara, and one each in Pakpattan, Nankana Sahib and Sahiwal, according to the spokesperson.
Those seriously injured in rain-related roof and wall collapses across Punjab were immediately transported to the hospital, the spokesperson added.
PDMA issues Jhelum River flood warning
The PDMA has issued a flood warning for the Jhelum River, reporting that “exceptionally high” flooding ranging between 350,000 to 450,000 cusecs of water was expected upstream at Mangla. It also warned that associated nullahs of the river may attain high level flooding in the next 24 hours.
Addressing the high death and injury tolls across Punjab today, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the injured were being provided with “the best medical assistance”, adding that assistance would also be provided to the families of the deceased.
The DG requested citizens to take precautionary measures in view of the rainy season to avoid loss of life and property.
Citizens were requested not to live in old mud houses, as the highest number of deaths were recorded due to roof collapses in dilapidated buildings and houses.
“Take care of children and never let them near electric wires, poles, or low-lying areas,” he added.
This year, 77 civilians were killed and 214 injured due to monsoon rains, according to a Punjab PDMA spokesperson, who added that 74 houses were affected and six livestock killed due to the rains.
Monsoon rains recorded in most districts of Punjab in last 24 hours
Sheikhupura recorded 217 millimetres of rain, Okara 170mm, Sahiwal 80mm, Chichawatni 130mm, Hafizabad 90mm and Kasur 85mm of rain in the last 24 hours, according to a PDMA spokesperson.
Additionally, maximums of approximately 170mm of rain were recorded in Lahore, 60mm in Faisalabad, 32mm in Mandi Bahauddin and 29mm in Jhelum. Rains were also recorded in Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Mianwali, Multan, Gujarat, Layyah, Sargodha, Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Toba Tek Singh.
More rains are forecast in Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Multan, DG Khan and Bahawalpur divisions. This series of monsoon rains will continue till July 17, according to the PDMADG , who directed all the relevant departments to remain alert.
The PDMA spokesperson added that rains are expected to continue in Punjab today.
“There is a possibility of heavy rains in the upper reaches of rivers, including Lahore,” he said, adding that the PDMA’s provincial control room and district emergency operation centres were alerted.
Heavy rain and wind are expected in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Jhelum, Attock, Chakwal, Murree, Galiat, Mianwali, Narowal, Gujrat, Sialkot, Toba Tek Singh, Mandi Bahauddin, and DG Khan.
The PDMA said that there is a risk of flooding in rivers and canals in low-lying areas due to heavy rain, which poses a risk of landslides in the mountainous areas of Murree.
“Tourists and travellers should be extremely cautious during the forecast period,” it said, adding that citizens should also take precautionary measures.
Citizens are directed to call the PDMA helpline, 1129, in case of civil emergencies.</p><small>2025-07-16 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/161919511e2feb2.jpg?r=193203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924604/evidence-so-far-shows-humaira-asghars-death-accidental-or-due-to-natural-causes-police-report' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence so far shows Humaira Asghar’s death accidental or due to natural causes: police report</strong></a><br><p>Evidence so far shows that actor Humaira Asghar’s death was accidental or due to natural causes, according to a police investigative report released on Wednesday.
Last week, police formed a special investigation team to probe the actor’s death, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment on July 8.
According to the report by South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, “Evidence so far suggests no signs of foul play or suicide.
“Circumstances indicate a possible accidental or natural cause of death while she was engaged in household chores.”
The report added that the double-locked door and the presence of all keys inside support the conclusion of no third-party involvement. There was also no evidence of physical assault, struggle, or weapon marks as per the initial post-mortem report.
The final confirmation of the cause of death awaited toxicology, chemical analysis and forensic findings, according to the report.
“A foul smell was reported by neighbours in December 2024. In January, the owner and building staff visited the apartment but did not detect anything substantial,” the report read.
The balcony door and window were found open and that likely allowed the smell to disperse.
The report continued that no one followed up further due to the assumption that she was out of town, as Humaira had a pattern of extended absences, and the owner of the apartment she had rented had already filed an eviction case and chose not to engage with her personally.
According to the digital and forensic analysis conducted by the police on Humaira’s personal devices and mobile phones, the last day of recorded outgoing activity was on October 7, 2024, when she contacted 14
individuals.
“The last known communication was around 5pm, strongly suggesting she died later that same day on Oct 7,” the report said.
The police also alluded to a lack of surveillance and monitoring at the apartment building, as no CCTV cameras were installed inside or outside the building, and there was no lift operator or front security to monitor residents.
Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore last Friday following a sparsely-attended funeral.
 
 

An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed had confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
The notification calling for the formation of the investigation team had directed them to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p><small>2025-07-16 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1608070677b0813.jpg?r=174112' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924548/irans-envoy-to-pakistan-widely-respected-says-fo-after-fbi-adds-him-to-most-wanted-list' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s envoy to Pakistan ‘widely respected’, says FO after FBI adds him to most wanted list</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday stressed that Iran’s envoy in Islamabad, Reza Amiri Moghadam, was “widely respected” after the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) added him to its Most Wanted list for his alleged role in the 2007 disappearance and suspected abduction of retired FBI agent Robert A. “Bob” Levinson.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the ambassador of Iran is widely respected for his role in the promotion of Pakistan-Iran relations,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told Dawn.com in response to a request for comment on the matter.
“He is entitled to all the privileges, immunities and respect due to [being an] ambassador, that too, from a friendly neighbouring country,” Shafqat highlighted.
Levinson arrived on Iran’s Kish Island on March 8, 2007 and went missing the following day.
Notably, a 2013 Associated Press (AP) investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a spy mission by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. Levinson’s family had received a $2.5 million annuity from the CIA to stop a lawsuit revealing details of his work, AP reported.
In 2020, after the US concluded that Levinson had passed away “some time ago”, Iran said he had left the country “long ago” and that Tehran had no knowledge of his whereabouts, rejecting claims by his family of him dying in Iranian custody.
 
 

On Tuesday evening, the FBI’s Washington Field Office released ‘seeking information’ posters of three senior Iranian intelligence officials, whom it blamed for playing key roles in Levinson’s disappearance and in efforts to conceal Tehran’s alleged involvement.
While Pakistani authorities have not been linked to the incident, the case now has a direct connection to Islamabad through Moghadam’s diplomatic posting.
The FBI statement said Moghadam had previously headed the operations unit of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), adding that he reportedly oversaw agents operating across Europe during that time.
However, according to the Iranian foreign ministry’s website, Moghadam has worked as deputy of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council in foreign and international policy affairs.
Per the FBI, Moghadam was “suspected of supervising the operation that led to Levinson’s reported abduction and later taking part in the cover-up”.
The FBI’s move comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Iran.
The US, which had been in talks with Tehran since April 12 for a nuclear deal, joined Israel’s war with Iran on June 22, striking three Iranian nuclear sites. The strikes came after warnings by US President Donald Trump to attack Iran if it did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
A US intelligence assessment had even found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one” before the US military launched the strikes.
In the wake of the FBI’s move, Iran denounced recent arrests of more than 100 Iranian nationals residing in the US during anti-immigration raids, IRNA reported.
Meanwhile, Iran’s parliament said the country should not resume nuclear negotiations with the US until preconditions are met, Reuters reported, citing Iranian state media.
The US periodically sanctions Iran and companies involved in trading Iranian oil, with the latest such move made on July 9.
 
 

In March, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned US sanctions that targeted its Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad, several oil tankers and commercial entities, Iran International reported.
Iran also strongly condemned the US government in February for imposing fresh sanctions on various individuals and entities for being involved in the sale of Iranian crude oil, terming the move as completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.
Two other Iran officials added to FBI’s list
In a statement, the FBI said the posters were released as part of an ongoing investigation into Iranian officials “who allegedly played roles in Bob’s abduction and Iran’s attempt to obfuscate its responsibility”.
The two other officials named were Taghi Daneshvar and Gholamhossein Mohammadnia.
The FBI claimed that Daneshvar, who it said had the alias Sayyed Taghi Ghaemi, was a senior MOIS counter-espionage officer who reportedly supervised Mohammad Baseri — another person in the bureau’s most wanted list — around the time Levinson disappeared.
Mohammadnia, the FBI said, was a senior MOIS deputy who served as Iran’s ambassador to Albania in 2016. He was expelled from Albania in December 2018 for allegedly “damaging its national security” — a move hailed by the US. The FBI claims he led efforts to shift blame for Levinson’s disappearance to a terrorist group in Balochistan.
“These three intelligence officers were among those who allegedly facilitated Bob’s 2007 abduction and the subsequent cover-up by the Iranian government,” said Steven Jensen, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office.
 
 

“Bob likely later perished in captivity far away from his family, friends and colleagues.”
In March 2025, the US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Moghadam and several others in connection with the case.
Images and a video showing Levinson in captivity surfaced in 2010 and 2011, but there has been no confirmed sighting of him since.
The FBI maintains that its investigation remains active as it seeks to identify further Iranian officials allegedly involved in the abduction.</p><small>2025-07-16 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16182330c339e3e.jpg?r=185730' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924588/israel-strikes-key-syrian-institutions-in-damascus-attack-as-druze-clashes-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Israel strikes key Syrian institutions in Damascus attack as Druze clashes continue</strong></a><br><p>An Israeli airstrike hit next to the presidential palace in Syria’s capital Damascus on Wednesday, according to a Reuters witness, after the Syrian defence ministry and military headquarters were also attacked.
Earlier, Israeli strikes hit near the Syrian army and defence ministry headquarters in Damascus, the state-run Alekhbariya channel reported on Telegram, after Israel’s military said it stepped up attacks on the authorities with the declared aim of protecting the Druze minority from harm by government forces.
AFP correspondents heard a loud explosion echoing throughout much of the capital, shortly after a first air strike had targeted the same building in the city centre.
It marked the third day in a row that Israel has struck Syria where government security forces have clashed with local Druze fighters in the southern city of Sweida.
Security sources from within the defence ministry told Reuters that at least two drone strikes had hit the building and that officers were taking cover in the basement. State-owned Alekhbariya TV said the Israeli strike wounded two civilians.
The Israeli military said it had “struck the entrance gate of the Syrian regime’s military headquarters complex” in Damascus and that it continued “to monitor developments and the actions being taken against Druze civilians in southern Syria”.
Massive airstrikes damaged the defence ministry in Damascus, live footage on Al Jazeera TV showed.
 






Syria’s state media and witnesses said Israeli strikes throughout Wednesday also struck the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, where a fourth day of fighting swiftly collapsed a ceasefire announced the previous evening.
Syrian government troops were dispatched to the Sweida region on Monday to quell fighting between Druze fighters and Bedouin armed men, but ended up clashing with the Druze militias themselves.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor with sources inside Syria, said 21 Druze civilians had been killed “in summary executions by government forces” and allied groups.
Local news outlet Sweida24 said the city of Sweida and nearby villages were coming under heavy artillery and mortar fire early on Wednesday.
Syria’s defence ministry, in a statement carried by state news agency SANA, blamed outlaw groups in Sweida for breaching the truce.
The defence ministry called on residents of the city to stay indoors. Some residents that Reuters was able to reach by phone said they were holed up at home in fear, with no electricity.

The European Union said it was “alarmed” by the continued clashes in Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida, calling on all sides to implement a ceasefire and protect civilians.
A statement by the EU’s diplomatic arm also urged “all external actors” to “fully respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” after Israel carried out strikes in support of the Druze.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Druze not to try to enter Syria, after dozens crossed the armistice line in both directions following deadly fighting in the Druze heartland.
“Do not cross the border,” Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of a “very serious” situation in Sweida.
Reactions
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when asked about Israeli strikes on Syria, said that the United States was concerned and added that he had just spoken to the relevant parties over the phone.
“We’re going to be working on that issue as we speak. I just got off the phone with the relevant parties.
“We’re very concerned about it, and hopefully we’ll have some updates later today. But we’re very concerned about it,” Rubio said, adding that the US wants the fighting to stop.
Similarly, US President Donald Trump’s administration asked Israel again to halt strikes on Syria and engage in dialogue with the government in Damascus, Axios correspondent Barak Ravid reported, citing a senior US official.
Neither Axios nor Ravid said whether that request came before or after Israeli strikes on Syria’s military headquarters and near the presidential palace in Damascus.
 






France called for an end to “abuses targeting civilians” in Syria’s Sweida, after a war monitor accused government forces of summary executions and other abuses.
“The abuses targeting civilians, which we strongly condemn, must stop,” the foreign ministry said, calling for an “immediate cessation of clashes” and urging all sides to respect a ceasefire.
“France supports the efforts of the Syrian transitional authorities and the leaders of the Sweida region to restore dialogue and hopes for a lasting agreement to strengthen the unity, stability, and sovereignty of Syria, as well as the safety of all Syrians,” Paris said.
Meanwhile, Turkiye condemned Israel’s strikes on Syrian army headquarters. “Israel’s attacks on Damascus, following its military interventions in the south of Syria, constitute an act of sabotage against Syria’s efforts to secure peace, stability, and security,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Germany criticised the airstrikes, urging Tel Aviv to refrain from actions that could destabilise the country, Anadolu reported.
Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Christian Wagner said that Germany is closely following the situation in Syria, including recent unrest in Suwayda province and Israeli airstrikes targeting Syrian forces. “We are calling on all sides to refrain from taking steps that could destabilise Syria,” he said.
“It’s clear that Syria must not become a plaything of foreign powers, that Syria’s sovereignty must be safeguarded,” he stressed.
The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) also condemned the attacks on Damascus in the “strongest terms”, Al Jazeera reported.
In a statement, GCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said the air campaign represented a “flagrant violation” of Syria’s sovereignty, “a breach of international laws and norms, and a serious threat to regional security and stability”.
Albudaiwi reiterated the GCC’s support for Syria’s territorial integrity, adding that the continuation of the repeated Israeli attacks had constituted an “irresponsible escalation” and disregarded international efforts to achieve stability in Syria and the region.
He also called for international action to stop the “serious violations, hold the perpetrators accountable, and work diligently to protect the Syrian people and preserve its sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law”.​</p><small>2025-07-16 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1616213119578bf.png?r=162208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924589/performance-of-ministries-to-be-evaluated-every-two-months-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Performance of ministries to be evaluated every two months: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Wednesday that the performance of ministries will be evaluated every two months following the determination of key performance indicators, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Chairing a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad, the prime minister said the ministries demonstrating strong performance will be commended.
“From this year, we will determine key performance indicators for the ministries to evaluate their performance every two months,” he said, emphasising that enhancing ministries’ performance was ultimately about delivery and service to the nation.
 






Expressing satisfaction over the stock market touching record levels this week, the prime minister said that the development reflected the positive business sentiment and that collective efforts were being made for the economic growth of the country.
PM Shehbaz also expressed grief and sorrow over the loss of lives in recent monsoon rains across the country. He especially regretted the incident in Swat, emphasising the need to take effective measures in the future to prevent such incidents.
Mons­oon rains in Pakistan have been linked to more than 110 deaths, including dozens of children, since they started in late June, according to government figures released on Monday.
On Tuesday, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country’s sake.
“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed,” according to a press release by the Presidency.
Last week, PM Shehbaz said that transforming the outdated system into a modern, digital and effective governance model is among the government’s top priorities, as economic development and prosperity are not possible without modernising the system to meet contemporary demands.
Cabinet approves 15pc increase in EOBI pensions
The federal cabinet approved a 15 per cent increase in pensions provided by the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), effective from January 1, 2025, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
This increase will be funded from the institution’s own resources, according to APP.
The prime minister directed the formation of a cabinet committee to introduce institutional reforms in EOBI.
The committee will also deliberate on proposals to extend old-age benefits to the informal labour sector, including domestic workers, agricultural labourers, and other marginalised employment categories that have been previously overlooked.
These reforms aim to ensure that workers in these neglected sectors receive their due rights.
The cabinet also approved the initiation of necessary legal procedures regarding the draft of the Sea Carriage Shipping Documents Bill 2025, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.
On the recommendation of the Ministry of National Health Services, the cabinet approved a five-year extension of the exemption on the import of anti-cancer, cardiac, and life-saving drugs used in hospitals and related healthcare institutions.
These medicines are considered vital for saving human lives, and the exemption is intended to ensure their prompt availability.
These drugs will be available only in hospitals and authorised institutions, with a ban on open market sales. Import of these medicines will require prior approval from the relevant licensing authority.
The federal cabinet also endorsed the decisions made in the meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases held on July 2 and 3.</p><small>2025-07-16 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1617073123a2d04.jpg?r=170933' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924595/pakistan-china-reaffirm-mutual-support-in-security-and-agriculture-on-sco-sidelines' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China reaffirm mutual support in security and agriculture on SCO sidelines</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, where the pair discussed and reaffirmed mutual support in core sectors, including agriculture, mining, industry and security, Chinese media reported.
Dar was on a three-day visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Tianjin on Tuesday. According to the Foreign Office (FO), Dar and Wang were scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the event.
The Foreign Office (FO) said in a post on X: “The two leaders held wide-ranging discussions on key areas of mutual interest, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and multilateral cooperation.”
 






According to Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN, the top diplomats reaffirmed their mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interests.
“China is ready to work with Pakistan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push forward the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future,” said Wang.
“China will strengthen strategic dialogue with Pakistan, jointly build [CPEC] with high quality, deepen cooperation in fields such as agriculture, industry and mining, and plan celebratory events marking the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year.”
Wang also echoed China’s concerns about the safety of Chinese nationals working in Pakistan, but stated that Beijing supported Pakistan’s efforts in counter-terrorism and “expressed belief that Pakistan will continue to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions”.
 






Meanwhile, the FO said in its post on X that Dar congratulated Wang on successfully hosting the meeting and conveyed his gratitude to the Chinese government for its hospitality.
“It was a pleasure to engage in meaningful discussions with my counterparts on the sidelines of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers, covering a broad spectrum of regional and multilateral issues of shared interest,” Dar said in a post on his own X account.
 






“Pakistan fully supports China’s preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Tianjin Summit and looks forward to further deepening the all-round cooperation between the two sides,” Dar said, according to CGTN, adding that he pledged efforts to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Pakistan.
“Pakistan adheres to the one-China principle and supports China on issues concerning its core interests,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-16 12:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16152147f270710.jpg?r=152227' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list' target='_blank'><strong>UK lifts ban on Pakistani airlines, removes country from Air Safety List</strong></a><br><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.
Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was banned from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban on operating to Europe was lifted in November last year.
Today’s development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
“Following air safety improvements, the UK’s Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,” said a statement from the British High Commission.
“Individual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.”
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: “I’m grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.
“While it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.”
In a post on X, Marriott called the approval “an important step, and a testament” to PIA’s air safety improvements.
 






Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.
“This is overseen by the UK’s Air Safety Committee, who have [sic] been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.
“The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.”
PIA said it was all set to resume flights to the UK now.
“It became possible after adherence to the most stringent flight safety standards, reviewed by the UK’s Air Safety Committee.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the move, saying it will provide “ease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold”.
“With over 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the UK and thousands of British nationals in Pakistan, today’s announcement brings long-awaited relief and new opportunities for families and friends to reunite,” he wrote on X.
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the government had made concerted diplomatic efforts, in addition to technical and regulatory compliances, with the UK authorities on the matter to ensure the earliest possible lifting of the ban.
 






Reacting to today’s development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for “crossing another milestone”. “Three years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,” he said on X.
“The green crescent flag is once again soaring proudly in the skies,” Asif added, commending his aviation ministry for its efforts.
 






In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.
The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: “According to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.”
Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.
The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday launching e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
A day prior to that, the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
Asif assails PTI for PIA losses, calls for ‘fixing’ responsibility
Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK’s Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a “crime against state”.
He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost 40 per cent of the country’s pilots had fake licenses.
 


The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation’s image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.
“Imran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,” Asif quipped.
In reply to a question, he said Sarwar’s speech was “enough to fix responsibility” as the national flag carrier’s image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.
The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became dysfunctional and the pilots’ reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.
Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the “historic” day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.
The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.</p><small>2025-07-16 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16124112e78847b.jpg?r=125036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924573/pakistans-quiet-solar-rush-puts-pressure-on-national-grid' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s quiet solar rush puts pressure on national grid</strong></a><br><p>The quiet energy revolution has spread from wealthy neighbourhoods to middle- and lower-income households as customers look to escape soaring electricity bills and prolonged power cuts.
Down a cramped alley in Karachi, residents fighting the sweltering summer heat gather in Fareeda Saleem’s modest home for something they had never experienced before —uninterrupted power.
“Solar makes life easier, but it’s a hard choice for people like us,” she says of the installation cost.
Saleem was cut from the grid last year for refusing to pay her bills in protest over enduring 18-hour power cuts.
A widow and mother of two disabled children, she sold her jewellery — a prized possession for women in Pakistan — and borrowed money from relatives to buy two solar panels, a solar inverter and a battery to store energy, for Rs180,000 ($630).
As temperatures pass 40 degrees Celsius, children duck under Saleem’s door and gather around the breeze of her fan.

Mounted on poles above homes, solar panels have become a common sight across the country of 240 million people, with the installation cost typically recovered within two to five years.
Making up less than two per cent of the energy mix in 2020, solar power reached 10.3pc in 2024, according to the global energy think tank Ember.
But in a remarkable acceleration, it more than doubled to 24pc in the first five months of 2025, becoming the largest source of energy production for the first time.
It has edged past gas, coal and nuclear electricity sources, as well as hydropower, which has seen hundreds of millions of dollars of investment over the past decades.

As a result, Pakistan has unexpectedly surged towards its target of renewable energy, making up 60pc of its energy mix by 2030.
Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember, told AFP that Pakistan was “a leader in rooftop solar”.
‘The great solar rush’
Soaring fuel costs globally, coupled with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to slash government subsidies, led successive administrations to repeatedly hike electricity costs.
Prices have fluctuated since 2022 but peaked at a 155pc increase, and power bills sometimes outweigh the cost of rent.
“The great solar rush is not the result of any government’s policy push,” Muhammad Basit Ghauri, an energy transition expert at Renewables First, told AFP.
“Residents have taken the decision out of clear frustration over our classical power system, which is essentially based on a lot of inefficiencies.”

Pakistan sources most of its solar equipment from neighbouring China, where prices have dropped sharply, largely driven by overproduction and tech advancements.
But the fall in national grid consumers has crept up on an unprepared government burdened by $8 billion of power sector debt, analysts say.
Pakistan depends heavily on costly gas importswhich it sells at a loss to national energy providers.
It is also tied into lengthy contracts with independent power producers, including some owned by China, for which it pays a fixed amount regardless of actual demand.
A government report in March said the solar power increase has created a “disproportionate financial burden on grid consumers, contributing to higher electricity tariffs and undermining the sustainability of the energy sector”.
Electricity sales dropped 2.8pc year-on-year in June, marking a second consecutive year of decline.

Last month, the government imposed a new 10pc tax on all imported solar, while the energy ministry has proposed slashing the rate at which it buys excess solar energy from consumers.
’Disconnected from the public
“The household solar boom was a response to a crisis, not the cause of it,” said analyst Jones, warning of “substantial problems for the grid”, including a surge during evenings when solar users who cannot store energy return to traditional power.
The national grid is losing paying customers like businessman Arsalan Arif.
A third of his income was spent on electricity bills at his Karachi home until he bought a 10-kilowatt solar panel for around Rs1.4 million (around $4,900).
“Before, I didn’t follow a timetable. I was always disrupted by the power outages,” he told AFP.
Now he has “freedom and certainty” to continue his catering business.

In Sialkot, safety wear manufacturer Hammad Noor switched to solar power in 2023, calling it his “best business decision”, breaking even in 18 months and now saving Rs1m every month.
The cost of converting Noor’s second factory has now risen by nearly Rs1.5m under the new government tax.
“The tax imposed is unfair and gives an advantage to big businesses over smaller ones,” he said.
“Policymakers seem completely disconnected from the public and business community.”

According to a statement from the Chief Minister’s House, aside from the Rs100m grant, Murad also announced an annual grant of Rs15 million for the Pakistan Wheelchair Cricket Council (PWCC), along with a dedicated customised coaster (minibus) for the national wheelchair cricket team.
PWCC is the governing body of wheelchair cricket in Pakistan and a founding member of the International Council of Wheelchair Cricket (ICWC). It focuses on providing sporting and recreational activities for people with disabilities. The Pakistan Cricket Board has previously endorsed the achievements of the Asian champion Pakistan wheelchair cricket team, according to the organisation’s website.
The announcement was made during a meeting with the two-time Asian Champion Pakistan Wheelchair Cricket Team at the CM House. The meeting was attended by Minister for Education Sardar Shah, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, Sports Minister Muhammad Bux Mahar, Principal Secretary to CM Agha Wasif, and Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPD) Secretary Tauha Farooqi.
The delegation included Rukhsana Rajput, President of the Pakistan Wheelchair Cricket Council, and team captain Mohammad Zeeshan, who briefed the CM about upcoming international wheelchair cricket events.
“During the meeting, the CM was informed that a Pakistan vs Afghanistan Wheelchair Cricket Series is scheduled to take place in September 2025 in Karachi,” the statement said. “The Wheelchair Cricket Asia Cup 2025 will be hosted by Pakistan in October, with matches scheduled to take place in both Karachi and Hyderabad.”
Participating teams in the Asia Cup include Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, and potentially India.
The CM directed Sports Minister Mahar to immediately begin renovation and preparation work at Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad, for hosting Asia Cup matches, the statement said.
“We are committed to ensuring the Asia Cup is held in a grand and dignified manner. Our wheelchair cricket team has made the nation proud, and we must provide them with the support they deserve,” the chief minister was quoted as saying.
The meeting underscored the Sindh government’s growing commitment to inclusive sports development, especially for athletes with disabilities.
Pakistan Wheelchair Cricket Team, having won back-to-back Asia Cup titles, continues to rise as a symbol of courage, determination, and sporting excellence, the statement added.
In December, the CM reaffirmed his commitment to inclusivity, urging the private sector and civil society to unite in creating an enabling environment for persons with disabilities.
Last year in June, the CM inaugurated a vocational training centre for persons with disabilities and directed the secretary of DEPD to run the centre effectively, adding that he would provide more facilities and equipment if needed.</p><small>2025-07-16 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16120605d0d0056.jpg?r=131905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924569/2-cops-shot-dead-by-terrorists-in-kps-dera-ismail-khan-police' target='_blank'><strong>2 cops shot dead by ‘terrorists’ in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan: police</strong></a><br><p>Two policemen were gunned down in a “terrorist” attack on Wednesday in Kulachi area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.
Speaking to Dawn.com, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, “The two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.”
The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.
Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.
“Weapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,” according to the spokesperson.
Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.
He saluted the “sacrifices made by the brave sons” of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.
Naqvi vowed that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”.
“KP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,” he noted.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.
On June 21, KP Police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
On June 3, terrorist attacks on two police stations in KP’s Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-07-16 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16121428ef8eb7a.png?r=122016' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924568/us-lawmakers-warn-pakistan-over-transnational-repression-hint-at-possible-sanctions' target='_blank'><strong>US lawmakers warn Pakistan over transnational repression, hint at possible sanctions</strong></a><br><p>The US Congress may soon urge President Donald Trump’s administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested during a congressional hearing on Pakistan on Tuesday.
“One of the biggest disappointments — regardless of who is in the White House or at the State Department — is the absence of sanctions,” said Smith, who co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (TLHRC).
Smith recalled that the only individual ever sanctioned under US religious freedom laws was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following the 2002 Gujarat riots. “We are going to call on the Irfa office to consider imposing [sanctions] — especially in light of the terrible acts committed against people of various faiths,” he said.
The Irfa office, based at the State Department, enforces the International Religious Freedom Act, which authorises the US government to designate and penalise countries that engage in or tolerate severe religious persecution.
“That’s it. We’ve got 18 sanctions here, and we are going to impose them on you,” Smith declared during the hearing on Pakistan’s current political and human rights situation.
 


Amnesty International’s advocacy director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari; law firm Perseus Strategies’ Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini provided their testimonies during the hearing.
Although the TLHRC does not directly recommend sanctions, Smith’s remarks were widely seen as a signal that such measures may be under consideration if current trends persist.
His Democratic counterpart, Congressman James McGovern, echoed the concern. “A vibrant Pakistani community in Massachusetts engages me all the time, and quite frankly, they are worried about the signals coming from our government right now,” he said.
Speaking about the political climate in Pakistan, McGovern added: “They need to know that people are watching. They need to know we don’t like what we are hearing.”
The bipartisan hearing focused on civil liberties and political freedoms in Pakistan, highlighting reports of repression, persecution of minorities, and efforts to silence dissidents abroad.
 
 

Amnesty’s Ben Linden opened his testimony by raising concerns over the situation in Balochistan.
“Dr Mahrang and other Baloch detainees should be freed,” he said, referring to the rights activist who has been in prison for more than three months over cases on allegedly “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”.
A day ago, a campaign letter by Amnesty International called upon Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.
Linden warned that recent crackdowns on PTI supporters should be seen in the context of a broader assault on fundamental rights.
“Ahmadis and other religious minorities are being targeted while local authorities fail to protect them,” he said. “Vaguely worded blasphemy laws are being weaponised by majoritarian religious groups, while the accused have few means to defend themselves.”
In 2024 alone, over 300 new blasphemy cases were registered — most against Muslims. “Several of the accused were killed extrajudicially,” Linden said, calling the trend “a tragedy”.
 
 

He also condemned the recent blocking of US-based YouTube channels critical of Pakistan’s military, describing the move as “totally unacceptable”.
However, Jared Genser of Perseus Strategies stressed that Washington could not afford to disengage entirely.
“We don’t act that way with any regime. We have to engage. The key is for President Trump and Secretary [of State] Marco Rubio to say very clearly: we want a strong relationship with Pakistan, but this is what needs to be done to get there. And that includes releasing [ex-prime minister] Imran Khan and other political prisoners,” Genser said.
He noted: “We need to talk about the tragedy that Pakistan is today in terms of human rights. The Pakistani diaspora is a ray of hope.”
McGovern concurred: “We need to talk. We need to engage. And we need to be talking about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan … but also how you do it.”
The hearing also addressed last week’s White House meeting between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Bukhari, a former close aide to Imran, told the panel: “President Trump wanted to meet someone who is calling the shots. That’s why he met the army chief.”
 
 

Bukhari claimed nearly 200 politically motivated cases had been filed against Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi. He alleged that “fundamental rights had been suspended” in Pakistan, the media silenced, and judicial independence undermined through “coercive” amendments.
Sadiq Amini, founder of the Afghanistan Impact Network, focused on what he called Pakistan’s “duplicity” in its relationship with the United States, claiming that ex-prime minister Imran was “used” to mislead Trump during his first term.
“After the announcement of his South Asia strategy, [Imran] Khan rushed to Washington with a message of peace from the Taliban — a message that was actually a carefully crafted deception by his Russian counterparts. He convinced President Trump to pursue a peace deal with the Taliban, which only empowered them.”
He argued that the peace process ultimately failed, leading to the US withdrawal and the rise of a “gender apartheid regime” in Kabul.
 
 

Amini further alleged that Imran, as prime minister, acted as a spokesperson for the Taliban, promoting them as an indigenous movement serving Afghan interests.
He warned that Pakistan’s leadership could not win US trust by imprisoning a few individuals like Imran or former spy chief Faiz Hameed. “Pakistani leaders, both military and civilian, complain about the Taliban threat. But even now, they say the Taliban is good for Afghanistan but bad for Pakistan. That’s a blatant display of duplicity.”
He also denounced Pakistan’s detention and deportation of Afghan refugees as “shameful and inhumane”, and called on the US to reassess Islamabad’s commitment to democracy.
In earlier remarks, TLHRC Co-chair Smith warned that the US “cannot stand by” while military influence allegedly subverts civilian rule in Pakistan.
Earlier on Tuesday, US lawmakers also heard disturbing accounts of harassment faced by Pakistani dissidents in the US. Multiple speakers alleged that within 48 hours of a protest outside the Pakistani Embassy in Washington on June 14, “family members of critics were abducted in Pakistan.”
Lawmakers, including Democratic representatives Jimmy Panetta, Suhas Subramanyam and Greg Casar, expressed support for safeguarding the civil liberties of Pakistani Americans.
In March, Panetta and Republican Congressman Joe Wilson had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations.
A month before that, US Congressmen Joe Wilson and August Pfluger had written to Rubio, urging him to engage with Pakistan to secure Imran’s release.
 
 

During the commission’s hearing, speakers also urged Congress to oversee foreign surveillance operations on US soil and to press technology companies to resist censorship demands from foreign military courts.
Established in 2008 and named after Holocaust survivor and former House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Lantos, the TLHRC holds bipartisan hearings to guide US human rights policy.
Tuesday’s session underscored longstanding concerns about Pakistan’s democratic trajectory and signalled growing interest in potential policy responses — including targeted sanctions.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed its deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy. Its annual report for 2024 also highlighted a troubling dec­line in civic freedoms, deteriorating law and order, and a marked strain on federalism.
Rights tracker Civicus Monitor has listed Pakistan’s status as “repressed” and added the country to its human rights watchlist for 2025 due to a narrowing civil space.
Washington DC-based organisation Freedom House ranked Pakistan as “partly free” in political rights and civil liberties in its latest annual report, with the country losing three points from the year prior.</p><small>2025-07-16 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1613032564998dc.jpg?r=130552' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924577/global-health-aid-to-sink-to-15-year-low-in-era-of-austerity-amid-us-funding-cuts-study' target='_blank'><strong>Global health aid to sink to 15-year low in ‘era of austerity’ amid US funding cuts: study</strong></a><br><p>Sweeping foreign aid cuts led by the United States will cause international health funding to plummet to the lowest level in 15 years, a study said on Wednesday, warning the world has entered a new “era of global health austerity”.
Money that provides healthcare to some of the poorest and most in-need people across the world has been dramatically slashed this year, led by the administration of US President Donald Trump.
The new study published in the prestigious Lancet journal also pointed to recent steep aid cuts announced by the UK, France and Germany.
 
 

After reaching an all-time high of $80 billion in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the total amount of global health aid will sink to $39bn this year, the US-led team of researchers estimated.
That would be the lowest level since 2009.
Such a dramatic change will result in the world entering a new “era of global health austerity”, the authors of the study warned.
Sub-Saharan African countries such as Somalia, the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Malawi will be hit worst because most of their health funding currently comes from international aid, according to the study.
The funding cuts will have a major impact on the treatment and prevention of a range of diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, it added.
 
 

The US slashed its global health funding by at least 67 per cent in 2025 compared to last year, according to the research. The UK cut its funding by nearly 40pc, followed by France with 33pc and Germany with 12pc.
The researchers at the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation called for the world to urgently ramp up health aid. They also warned that nations would likely need to find other sources of funding.
The study was released as AIDS experts meet in Rwanda’s capital Kigali for an international conference on HIV science.
The US foreign aid cuts alone are estimated to result in the preventable deaths of more than 14m people by 2030, according to a different Lancet study published earlier this month.
For comparison, around 10m soldiers were killed during World War I.</p><small>2025-07-16 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16133551f68c4da.jpg?r=133628' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924362/fact-check-ticket-prices-of-ferry-service-from-gwadar-to-gulf-countries-have-not-been-decided-yet' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Ticket prices of ferry service from Gwadar to Gulf countries have not been decided yet</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platforms since July 9 alleged that a newly announced ferry service set to be launched from Gwadar to Gulf countries costs between Rs25,000 to Rs30,000. However, the maritime ministry said the fares have yet to be decided and the matter is still under negotiation.
On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
On July 9, an online news portal, focused on developments about Kuwait and the Middle East, said in a post on Facebook that the fares of a ferry service between Gwadar and Gulf countries would be Rs25,000 to Rs35,000.
The post was captioned: “Pakistan has announced the imminent launch of a direct luxury ferry service (sea travel) from Gwadar to GCC for 25,000 to 35,000 rupees. The service will be launched for the UAE and Oman, while the service for Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait will be launched later.”
The post gained 17,000 reactions and was reshared 1,300 times.
Notably, the post did not provide a link to any source or news report for the alleged development.
The claim was similarly shared by others on Facebook here and here, on X here, here, here, here and here and on Instagram as well.
The claim was also shared by local news outlet 24 News HD in a YouTube video titled: “Pakistan To Dubai Fare 25 Thousand From Pakistan - Luxury Ferry Service Starts From Gwadar”. The video did not provide the source of the information about the alleged ticket fares was from.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim to satisfy the public’s request seeking authentication for the claim and a keen interest in developments related to the Middle East.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged development yielded no news reports regarding the fares of the ferry service. Furthermore, no news reports were found about the operationalisation of the announced ferry service.
Contacted for comment via Dawn correspondent Umaid Ali Hajjana, Muhammad Arshad Chaudhry, the spokesperson of the maritime affairs ministry, said the rumours about the prices were “totally fake and fabricated”. Denying the reports, he said such developments and the issue of ferry ticket prices were at the “initial stages” and still being negotiated, with no decision yet.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that the ferry service from Gwadar to Gulf countries will cost Rs25,000 to Rs35,000 is false. The spokesperson for the maritime affairs ministry confirmed that no fare prices have been set yet as the matter is still under negotiation.

The multi-stakeholder committee will conduct a 30-day consultation process to develop a consensual and actionable proposal, which will be submitted to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
According to sources present at the meeting, officials from various ministries clarified that the new tax amendments are primarily intended to curb large-scale sales tax fraud. The committee will only consider trader concerns that are deemed genuine and substantiated, the officials added.
Traders were firmly told that the government remains committed to documenting the economy and discouraging cash-based transactions. Several trade associations have already called for strike actions in protest against the new measures.

Committee tasked with addressing concerns over tax reforms and documentation efforts within 30 days

An official statement announced that the decision was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, which brought together representatives from Pakistan’s business community, chambers of commerce, and trade organisations. The session primarily addressed trader concerns over Section 37A and other provisions introduced in the Finance Act 2025.
The committee will be led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, and will include Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, the Prime Minister’s Trade Coordinator Rana Ehsan Afzal Khan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial, and nominated members from the business community.
Business leaders expressed concerns about the impact of the new legislation on routine commercial transactions. In response, Mr Aurangzeb assured full transparency and cooperation from the government, reiterating that the reforms aim to combat widespread tax evasion, not to harass legitimate businesses.
The traders also shared their reservations and proposals, prompting the government to promise a considerate and inclusive approach. It was mutually agreed that efforts would be made to avoid placing undue hardship on the business community during the implementation of the reforms, the official announcement added.
Under the Finance Act 2025, a new Section 37A has been inserted into the Sales Tax Act 1990, empowering the FBR to constitute a three-member committee that can authorise the Commissioner to issue an arrest warrant against individuals involved in tax fraud, provided the tax loss exceeds Rs50 million.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South, Syed Asad Raza, told Dawn.com that he held a meeting with the representatives of popular food delivery and ride-hailing services to address the misuse of rider services for drug delivery.
“Delivery companies informed the police that certain individuals had been caught using counterfeit uniforms, helmets, and branded delivery bags to pose as legitimate riders while carrying out unlawful activities, such as delivering illicit drugs,” the DIG said.
To counter this, he said, the stakeholders agreed to tighten security protocols, including rider screening, background verification, and stricter registration procedures.
“Briefings for riders will also be conducted more regularly to ensure compliance with legal and safety standards,” DIG Raza said.
The management of the companies assured law enforcement of support in identifying and cancelling the accounts of unverified or unregistered riders.
“In addition, they said patterns of repeated suspicious orders from specific locations will be monitored to detect and disrupt illegal operations,” he said, adding that the authorities have also agreed to identify individuals using fake identities or posing as company employees for illicit deliveries.
In March, police and heads of educational institutes agreed on a joint strategy against the growing menace of narcotics in Karachi.
In May, the Islamabad High Court imposed a ban on all direct courier and food deliveries to students in the federal educational institutions amid concerns that drugs were being smuggled into campuses through food orders and courier packages.</p><small>2025-07-16 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16113325948d948.jpg?r=113945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924514/west-bank-seeing-largest-displacement-since-1967-un' target='_blank'><strong>West Bank seeing largest displacement since 1967: UN</strong></a><br><p>GENEVA: The UN warned on Tuesday that mass displacement in the West Bank had hit levels not seen since the start of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territory nearly 60 years ago.
The United Nations said an Israeli military operation launched in the north of the occupied territory in January had displaced tens of thousands of people, raising concerns about possible  “ethnic cleansing”.
The military operation “has been the longest since … the second Intifada”, in the early 2000s, said Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
“It is impacting several refugee camps in the area, and it is causing the largest population displacement of the Palestinians in the West Bank since 1967,” she told reporters in Geneva via video from Jordan, referring to the six-day Arab-Israeli war that led to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank.
The UN rights office meanwhile warned that mass forced displacement by an occupation force could amount to “ethnic cleansing”.
Since Israel’s military launched its operation “Iron Wall” in the north of the West Bank in January, rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan said that “about 30,000 Palestinians remain forcibly displaced”.
Israeli security forces had during the same period issued demolition orders for about 1,400 homes in the northern West Bank, he said, describing the figures as “alarming”.
He pointed out that Israeli demolitions had displaced 2,907 Palestinians across the West Bank since October 2023.
Another 2,400 Palestinians — nearly half of them children — had been displaced as a result of Israeli settler actions, he added, lamenting that the combined result was the “emptying large parts of the West Bank of Palestinians”.
“Permanently displacing the civilian population within occupied territory amounts to unlawful transfer,” Kheetan said, stressing that depending on the circumstances this could be “tantamount to ethnic cleansing” and could “amount to a crime against humanity”. Kheetan said 757 attacks by Israeli settlers had been recorded in the West Bank during the first half of the year, a 13 percent increase on the same period in 2024.
The attacks injured 96 Palestinians in the occupied territory in June alone, he told reporters, stressing that this was the highest monthly injury toll of Palestinians from settler attacks “in over two decades”. Violence in the West Bank has surged since October 2023.
Since then, at least 964 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, according to the UN. During that same period, 53 Israelis have been killed in reported attacks by Palestinians or in armed clashes — 35 of them in the West Bank and 18 in Israel.

The convicted men include Maulana Ziaul Haq Haidari, his son Abu Bakar, and their bodyguard Sanaullah. The court handed down life terms, as well as additional sentences of 25 years, three years and two years, respectively, and imposed a fine of Rs500,000 on the convicts. 
The verdict comes more than a year after the tragic incident that sent shockwaves across the region. According to police and prosecution the girl had been living at an orphanage-cum-seminary in the Mandizo area of Jandol when she was reportedly assaulted and murdered.  
District prosecution office, led by DPP Rafiullah, pursued the case vigorously, while assistant public prosecutor Ubaidullah argued it in court. 
The FIR was registered at Munda police station on May 23, 2024, under sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape), and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Pakistan Penal Code, along with Section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act. 
Sartaj, the victim’s father, while registering the FIR, told police that the seminary administration informed him on May 17 last year that his daughter had died and asked him to collect her body. However, he alleged that his daughter had been killed days earlier and that her body had been concealed to hide the crime.

The three-member ben­ch was headed by Nisar Ahmad Durra­­ni, with Shah Mohammad Jatoi and Justice (retd) Ik­­ram Ullah Khan as members.
However, PTI has criticised the election watchdog alleging that it did not de-seat the PML-N president for submitting a “fake” consent affidavit, claiming that PTI MNA Adil Khan Bazai had joined the PML-N. The party claimed that a genuinely elected public representative and a staunch supporter of Imran Khan had been disqualified unjustly.
A three-member ECP bench declared Mr Dasti’s seat vacant after finding him guilty of submitting a fake degree. The bench ruled that the MNA had committed an offence pu­­nishable under the Elec­tion Act, recommending legal action against him.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Dasti, elected from NA-175 during the current tenure of the National Assembly, was a powerful voice against the ruling party in the House. Earlier this year, ECP had sent Mr Dasti’s educational credentials to the Karachi education board for verification.
Meanwhile, PTI Cent­ral Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram lashed out at the electoral watchdog for not de-seating the PML-N president over the allegedly fake affidavit regarding MNA Adil Khan Bazai.
He asserted that such desperate and “illegal” ac­­tions could neither sile­nce the voice of the people nor prolong the government’s grip on power, adding the rising tide of public dissent would soon sweep away their “unconstitutional” rule.

The order came during the hearing of a case seeking the formation of such a commission Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while hearing the case, ordered  that the commission should complete its work within four months.
However, he allowed the commission to seek an extension from the court, if  required.
While concluding the hearing, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan  said the court’s primary task was to determine whether there were  sufficient grounds to form a commission.
 
 

Satisfied with the  arguments, he ordered the government to form the commission within 30  days and instructed that it must submit its findings within four months.  Any request for an extension must be brought before the court.

IHC judge concerned by ‘disappearance’ of woman believed to be a central figure in a number of related cases

The judge also expressed concern over the disappearance of a woman who is the elusive central figure linked to an ongoing blasphemy-related case.
During the proceedings of this case, Komal Ismail had been identified as ‘Iman’, a shadowy figure who was allegedly involved in ‘trapping’ a number of those accused of blasphemy.
Earlier this month, Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan had ordered her CNIC to be blocked over her failure to appear before the court.
On Tuesday, an official from the National Cyber Crimes  Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the bench that four SIMs were registered under her identity, but all these numbers had became inactive after November.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq noted that while the petition in the case had been filed on September 14, and Komal went missing in November.
The officer also said that Ms Ismail had not left the country and was believed to be still in Pakistan. Her name has been placed on the Exit Control List (ECL), and efforts to trace her are ongoing.
The judge observed that the matter directly concerned Komal’s personal safety. “Her life may be in danger. What action can the agency take in such a situation?” he asked.
Advocate Hadi Ali Chatha informed the court that earlier, it had asked for WhatsApp data of three mobile numbers, but telecom companies had responded that WhatsApp data is not covered under Call Detail Records (CDRs), and even standard CDRs are only available for the past year.
The judge remarked that if an intelligence agency has the capability to retrieve such data, the commission should be empowered to request its assistance, adding, “This is a matter of people’s lives”.
The court also reviewed the conduct of the investigation.
Naik Muhammad, one of the accused, had claimed he was trapped by a woman named ‘Iman’.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq questioned the thoroughness of the investigation, observing that officials had merely retrieved five images from Naik Muhammad’s phone and built a case without establishing whether ‘Iman’ had ever contacted him.
Advocate Chatha also revealed that the complainant in the case, Shiraz Farooqi, had remained in contact with the accused just a week before filing the complaint. When questioned by the court, Farooqi denied the claim, calling it “a complete lie.”

The prime minister was accompanied by senior cabinet members, including Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, and Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that the president and the prime minister agreed that no one will be allowed to harm peace in the country in the name of ‘political rally and sit-in’.
It was decided that PTI protesters will not be allowed to enter the federal capital and will be stopped by any means necessary.
A suggestion also came during the meeting that a specified place away from the central parts of the capital could be allocated for the protest of the main opposition—PTI, which is coming out for its main demand of the release of its jailed founder Imran Khan.
The source said that Presi­dent Zardari, widely regarded for his political acumen despite PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s formal leadership, is known for securing support from non-allied parties during critical political moments.
According to the source, the president assured the prime minister of his cooperation in making efforts to win the maximum number of Senate seats from KP.
Earlier this month, the Election Commission of Pakistan had finally announced the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, setting July 21 as the polling date.
The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise will see elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.
Experts believe the outcome will hinge on how PTI-backed and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) members vote. If the opposition remains united and PTI-backed members strictly follow party discipline — with JUI-F support — the ruling coalition may win only one general seat.
However, the scenario would shift dramatically if some PTI members defect and JUI-F strikes a deal with the ruling coalition. In that case, the coalition might bag around five seats, potentially gaining a two-thirds majority in the upper house of Parliament. JUI-F already holds five seats in the Senate.
Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).

• ECP allows PML-N to count independent ‘notified’ later among its tally, rejects similar plea from PTI-P
• ANP also denied relief, told allocation is calculated on basis of general seats, not by-election
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan has decided to allow the PML-N to retain a general assembly seat while rejecting a similar request by the PTI-Parliamentarians, saying it was not supported by the law.
In its decision on a case about the allocation of reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, announced on Tuesday, the commission provided relief to the ruling party that had sought a greater share in the KP Assembly reserved seats on the basis of the additional general seat handed to the PML-N, which was initially declared to be held by an independent candidate.
The announcement followed a Peshawar High Court order, asking the ECP to redistribute reserved seats in the provincial assembly. With the addition of one more seat, the PML-N is eligible for an extra reserved seat in the KP Assembly and holds the same number of seats as the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F).
 
 

After the PML-N received the general seat, the ruling party and the JUI-F hold the same number of seats in the KP Assembly, and the former is entitled to get at least one more reserved seat in the provincial assembly.
The ECP had determined the quota of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims on the basis of party position as it stood on Feb 22 — the legal deadline for the issuance of victory notifications.
In its decision, the commission accepted the plea that Malik Tariq Awan — an independent candidate — who joined the PML-N a day after the allocation of reserved seats did not get three days to join a political party. Interestingly, a similar plea by the PTI-Parliamentarians has been rejected by the ECP.
The ECP order referred to proviso of Article 51(6)(e), read with Article 106 of the Constitution, which provides that the calculation of quota for the reserved seats shall be made on the basis of total number of general seats won by political party, which shall include the independent returned candidate or candidates who may duly join such political party within three days of the publication in official gazette.
Mr Awan was declared an independent returned candidate on Feb 22, 2024. The commission, after the passage of around one and a half years, now reached the conclusion that Mr Awan joined the PML-N on Feb 23, which was within three days of the victory notification.
The commission held that he was eligible to be considered as a member of for an additional seat on the basis of the same grounds was rejected by the ECP. The ECP order conceded that PTI-P won two KP Assembly general seats in the Feb polls, but it could not recalculate the reserved seats at the request of the party because it would be an ‘unending process’ if such a request was entertained.
The order said that at the time of calculation of quota, one seat was duly notified for PTI-P from PK-73 (Peshawar-III).  Subsequently, another candidate of the said party from PK-103 was notified on Feb 27 after the calculation and allocation of reserved seats to the political parties.
Without explaining if the commission can punish a political party for belated issuance of a victory notification, the ECP said recalculation of quota for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims at belated stage after allocation of reserved seats to the political parties was not supported by the Constitution and law.
“The rationale for calculation of quota for the reserved seats on the basis of party position on 22-02-2024 was to avoid unending controversies. For example, if a political party succeeds in getting more seats as a result of recounting or by-election or decision of the tribunal, the quota will be revised again and again and it will be an unending process which is against the spirit of Constitution and Law as enshrined in Articles 51(6) & 106 of the Constitution and Section 98 & 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Rule 92 of the Election Rules, 2017,” it noted, while dismissing PTI-P’s plea for another reserved seat.
The commission directed the office to take follow-up action in light of the order and submit the case to the commission accordingly.
ANP by-election seat
Meanwhile, the Awami National Party (ANP) had secured one general seat from PK-75 Peshawar-IV during the General Elections 2024, which was notified on Feb 22. Subsequently, the ANP secured another seat from PK-22 Bajaur-IV, held on July 11, and the returned candidate was notified on July 25.
The order said in accordance with the Constitution and applicable legal provisions, the quota for allocation of reserved seats is calculated on the basis of general seats and not on the basis of subsequent by-elections.
“Results of by-elections cannot be included as it is not the spirit of Constitution provided under Article 224(2) of the Constitution read with Section 98 of the Elections Act, 2017.
In case, this petition is accepted it will be un-ending processes which will result recalculation/fluctuation of seats from time to time after each and every by-election or decision of the tribunal,“ the commission observed while rejecting ANP’s plea for another seat.

Filing a plea before the SHC, petitioner Malik Shahzain Ahmed sought compensation and an inquiry into the incident.
He cited the ministry of aviation, Civil Aviation Authority, Airport Security Force, Federal Investigation Agency and AirSial as respondents, and sought directive for effective implementation of mandatory standard operating procedures (SOPs) and documentation procedures.
The petitioner submitted that he is a resident of Korangi, Karachi, and frequently travels within the country for work-related assignments as he is a professional civil engineer.

Seeks compensation for financial and mental distress caused by airline’s negligence; urges high court to order implementation of SOPs

He stated that on July 7, he had purchased a ticket of AirSial to travel from Lahore to Karachi, but due to alleged gross negligence and procedural failure of the airline, he was “wrongfully and unlawfully boarded on an international flight of the same airline to Jeddah despite lacking valid passport, visa and international travel clearance”.
The petitioner also submitted that such a reckless conduct of the private airline resulted in his prolonged detention and interrogations at the Jeddah Airport and eventually he was deported back to Lahore by the Saudi immigration authorities without any assistance or representation of the respondent airline.
He further maintained that after returning to Lahore, he was again compelled to purchase a new ticket to reach Karachi.
He said he sent a formal legal notice to the airline for legal intimation and initiation of appropriate action, but no response had been received so far. He alleged that the airline has failed to offer any apology, remedy, or compensation and instead attempted to suppress the incident and such action was amount to gross violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Constitution.
The counsel for petitioner, Nawaz Dahri, submitted that besides violation of constitutional provisions, such an act has also caused immense mental distress, financial loss and reputational damage to him as well as exposing him to criminal liability abroad.
He also argued that the regulatory authorities have also failed to perform their statutory duties in order to prevent such gross misconduct and their inaction has caused violations.
The lawyer maintained that actions of respondents have also violated various laws and regulations including Rules 272 and 273 the Civil Aviation Rules 1997 requiring passengers’ verification, the Pakistan Immigration Ordinance 1979, barring international travel without valid documents and the Montreal Convention 1999 and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 9 binding the air carrier to ensure secure and lawful travel procedures.
He further submitted that the petitioner was also facing threats and intimidation not to pursue the matter in question publically and legally while his client was subjected to unlawful detention, loss of dignity, deprivation of liberty and financial injury.
The counsel argued that the conduct of the private airline has posed a serious threat to the aviation safety standards and inaction on the part of aviation authorities has undermined public confidence in aviation institutions.
He also contended that no alternative remedy was available with the petitioner but to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of the SHC primarily to safeguard his fundamental rights.
The lawyer further maintained that the petitioner had been able to demonstrate infringement of fundamental rights, meriting the exercise to move the SHC.
The petitioner pleaded for a full transparent inquiry into the incident and to fix responsibility upon delinquent officials or persons and sought compensation for damages.
He also sought directives for the respondents to suspend the license of the airline and effective implementation of mandatory SOPs and documentation procedures.
