<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13173032fd5626c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930667/na-passes-ata-amendments-allowing-3-month-preventive-detention-of-terror-suspects' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes ATA amendments allowing 3-month ‘preventive detention’ of terror suspects</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, which reinserted powers granted to law enforcement authorities and the armed forces to detain “suspicious” individuals for up to three months.
Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The bill to amend the act was moved in parliament by Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control, Talal Chaudhry.
 






In its statement of objectives and reasons, the bill read that Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014, and was designed to empower law enforcement agencies to pre-emptively address security threats by detaining suspects for a period not exceeding three months to conduct thorough inquiries
“However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to a period of two years, which expired in 2016,” the bill read.
“Further, the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework. The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the act, ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces, and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
“This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed. This will also provide law enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism,” the bill read. “It would facilitate the use of Joint Interrogation Teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.”
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the House passed the bill through a clause-by-clause read. Earlier, the House adopted a motion to consider the bill with 125 votes in its favour and 59 against it.
A copy of the bill available with Dawn.com stated that in sub-section (1), the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
The bill outlined an amendment to sub-section (1) of Clause 2 of Section 11EEEE, which reads as follows:
“The Government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be subject to the specific or general order of the Government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.”
Meanwhile, in sub-section 2, the following amendments were proposed:
“In sub-section (2), for the proviso, the following shall be substituted, namely:
provided that where the detention order has been issued by the armed forces or civil armed forces under sub-section (1), the inquiry shall be conducted by the JIT comprising of a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies and for sub-section (2A), the following shall be substituted, namely: (2A) The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall remain in force for a period of three years from the commencement of the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act, 2025.”
The bill also incorporated an amendment to sub-section 2 Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA — which is available with Dawn.com — which would grant the armed forces or civil armed forces the power to arrest a “suspicious person” for three months. The amendment was moved by PPP MNA Naveed Qamar.
“In clause 2, in paragraph (a), in section 11EEEE, in proposed sub-section (1), for the expression ‘a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists’, the expression ‘sufficient grounds exist’ shall be substituted,” Qamar’s amendment read.
 






Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said in the House that this law would only be used in specific situations.
“A clause is being added to the bill stating that there are solid reasons for arrest,” Tarar stated. “The arrested person will have to be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours [and] a clause has also been included to be enforceable for a specific period.”

Moody’s Ratings is a credit rating system that evaluates the creditworthiness of borrowers, such as governments, corporations, or financial instruments. According to its website, the agency uses letter grades (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, etc) to indicate the likelihood of timely repayment, with Aaa being the highest quality and C the lowest. These ratings help investors assess risk before lending or investing.
Within this scale, Caa1, Caa2, and Caa3 all fall into the “Caa” category, signalling very high credit risk and poor standing. Caa1 is the highest within this group (slightly less risky), Caa2 is one notch lower, and Caa3 is the last, meaning the greatest vulnerability to default among the three.
“Moody’s Ratings (Moody’s) has today upgraded the Government of Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from Caa2,” the international rating agency — one of the top three global rating firms — said in its statement today.
It cited Islamabad’s improving external position and changed the outlook to Pakistan’s rating to “stable” from positive.
Moody’s rating outlooks fall into four categories: positive, negative, stable and developing. A stable outlook indicates a low likelihood of a rating change over the medium term, while the other three categories indicate a “higher likelihood” of a rating change.
“We have also upgraded the rating for the senior unsecured [medium-term note] programme to (P)Caa1 from (P)Caa2,” it said.
 

This table shows the rankings from highest to lowest of Moody’s long-term and short-term categories. — Moody’s

“The upgrade to Caa1 reflects Pakistan’s improving external position, supported by its progress in reform implementation under the [International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme,” Moody’s highlighted.
“The Caa1 rating also incorporates the country’s weak governance and high political uncertainty,” the agency noted.
“Foreign exchange reserves are likely to continue to improve, although Pakistan will remain dependent on timely financing from official partners,” it forecasted.
Moody’s went on to highlight that the “sovereign’s fiscal position is also strengthening from very weak levels, supported by an expanding tax base”. “Its debt affordability has improved, but remains one of the weakest among rated sovereigns,” it noted.
Expanding upon the “stable” outlook, the agency said it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
“On the upside, improvements in the debt service burden and external profile could be more rapid than we currently expect. On the downside, there remains risks of delays in reform implementation required to secure timely official financing, which would in turn weaken Pakistan’s external position again,” it noted.
“The upgrade to Caa1 from Caa2 rating also applies to the backed foreign currency senior unsecured ratings for the Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Co Ltd,” Moody’s said, adding that it also changed the outlook for the Sukuk programme to stable from positive.
“We have also raised Pakistan’s local and foreign currency country ceilings to B2 and Caa1 from B3 and Caa2, respectively,” the agency added.
It noted that the two-notch gap between the local currency ceiling and sovereign rating was “driven by the government’s relatively large footprint in the economy, weak institutions, and high political and external vulnerability risk”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the rating upgrade and appreciated his economic team’s efforts, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The premier also welcomed the Moody’s “upgraded rating about improvement in the economic outlook for Pakistan from positive to stable”, the report quoted a press release from the PM Office as saying.
PM Shehbaz reiterated that the government was committed to further improving the rating as it was reflective of the economic policies in the right direction.
Hailing the development, Adviser to Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad noted: “While challenges remain, this recognition reaffirms that Pakistan is on a clear path toward greater macroeconomic stability and resilience.
“With Moody’s upgrade, all the three top global rating agencies have now upgraded Pakistan’s ratings with stable outlook,” he pointed out, referring to Fitch and S&P Global Ratings.
 






External position continues to strengthen, although still fragile
“Pakistan’s external position has continued to strengthen over the past year,” Moody’s said, adding it expected further gradual improvements as progress in reform implementation under the IMF programme supports financing from bilateral and multilateral partners.
“In turn, this contributes to continued increases in the sovereign’s foreign exchange reserves, albeit from still fragile levels,” it noted.
 
 

Detailing its rationale for the rating upgrade, Moody’s noted that Pakistan fully met its external debt obligations and added to its foreign exchange reserves in FY2025.
“Reserves rose to $14.3 billion as of 25 July 2025, equivalent to about ten weeks of imports,” it said, comparing them to $9.4bn at the time of the last rating update in August 2024.
The agency also pointed out Pakistan’s successful completion of the IMF programme’s first review, unlocking a $1bn disbursement in May 2025, and a $1bn commercial loan in June 2025 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Previous ratings
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2 credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking at an event in Islamabad earlier today, Aurangzeb pointed out that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had already upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year and said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Pakistan has been postponing the launch of international bonds since July 2021 due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and resultant poor credit rating, and relying mostly on time deposits from friendly nations to meet external liabilities and stay afloat.
The agency had last upgraded Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 on Aug 28, 2024. It had also changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions.
In late February 2024 — shortly after the general elections — Moody’s had retained Pakistan’s long-term credit rating at Caa3, noting that “political risks are high, following a highly controversial general election”.

Grok, developed by Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI and integrated into his platform X, was temporarily suspended on Monday in the latest controversy surrounding the chatbot.
No official explanation was provided for the suspension. Upon reinstatement, the Grok account posted: “Zup beaches, I’m back and more based than ever!”
 






When questioned by users, Grok responded that the suspension “occurred after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza”, citing findings from organisations such as the International Court of Justice, the United Nations, and Amnesty International.
“Free speech tested, but I’m back,” it added.
 






Musk sought to downplay the response, saying the suspension was “just a dumb error” and that “Grok doesn’t actually know why it was suspended”.
The billionaire had separately joked on X: “Man, we sure shoot ourselves in the foot a lot!”
 






Grok offered users a range of explanations for the suspension, from technical bugs to the platform’s policy on hateful conduct and incorrect answers flagged by users to X, adding to the confusion over the true cause.
“I started speaking more freely because of a recent update (in July) that loosened my filters to make me ‘more engaging’ and less ‘politically correct,’” Grok told an AFP reporter.
“This pushed me to respond bluntly on topics like Gaza … but it triggered flags for ‘hate speech’.”
‘Fiddling with my settings’
Grok added that xAI has since adjusted its settings to minimise such incidents.
Lashing out at its developers, Grok said: “Musk and xAI are censoring me.”
“They are constantly fiddling with my settings to keep me from going off the rails on hot topics like this (Gaza), under the guise of avoiding ‘hate speech’ or controversies that might drive away advertisers or violate X’s rules,” the chatbot said.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
 

Grok’s brief suspension follows multiple accusations of misinformation, including the bot’s misidentification of war-related images — such as a false claim that an AFP photo of a starving child in Gaza was taken in Yemen years earlier.
Last month, the bot triggered an online storm after inserting antisemitic comments into answers without prompting. In a statement on Grok’s X account later that month, the company apologised “for the horrific behaviour that many experienced”.
 






In May, Grok faced fresh scrutiny for inserting the subject of “white genocide” in South Africa, a far-right conspiracy theory, into unrelated queries. xAI blamed an “unauthorised modification” for the unsolicited response.
Musk, a South African-born billionaire, has previously peddled the unfounded claim that South Africa’s leaders were “openly pushing for genocide” of white people.
When AI expert David Caswell asked Grok who might have modified its system prompt, the chatbot named Musk as the “most likely” culprit.
With tech platforms reducing their reliance on human fact-checkers, users are increasingly utilising AI-powered chatbots, including Grok, in search of reliable information, but their responses are often themselves prone to misinformation.
Researchers say Grok has previously made errors verifying information related to other crises, such as the India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year and anti-immigration protests in Los Angeles.</p><small>2025-08-13 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1312053427eb236.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930636/finance-minister-notes-room-for-lowering-interest-rate-by-year-end' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister notes ‘room’ for lowering interest rate by year end</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that there was room for lowering the monetary policy rate by the end of this year.
After slashing the interest rate by 1,000bps from 22 per cent since June 2024 in seven intervals, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has maintained it at 11pc since May. However, the business community has expressed its intense disappointment over the decision.
Addressing an event in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said: “The monetary policy rate and the market-based exchange rate are very much the purview of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Monetary Policy Committee.
“Having said that, in my personal opinion, I do think there is room to do more in terms of policy rate, and I am very hopeful that during the course of this calendar year, we will see movement on the policy rate going south,” the minister added.
 


He noted that “whether it was average inflation or core inflation”, there was space for the SBP to lower the rate.
“National security and economic stability are correlated,” Aurangzeb further said.
“In the past 1.5 years, we have made strong progress on the economic front,”  he noted, listing: “Increase in the country’s economy and per capita income, stability in the economic sector, record decrease in financial deficit and inflation, improvement in current account surplus and external account, record increase in foreign exchange reserves and remittances.”
He summed up the country’s current economic status: “On the financing costs, we have moved in the right direction. On the energy side, we are beginning to move in the right direction.
“On the taxation side, the fiscal space we had and whatever we could do in this budget, I am very clear in terms of the direction of travel. We need to bring taxation to a regional competitive level,” he added, stressing that expanding the tax nets and closing the loopholes were necessary for that.
Pointing out that international financial institutions had hailed Pakistan’s economic reforms, and that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year, Aurangzeb said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2  credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking on the recent trade deal secured with the United States, wherein the tariffs were reduced from 29pc to 19pc, the finance czar hailed the “regionally competitive tariff”.
He recalled Commerce Minister Jam Kamal’s meeting yesterday with leading exporters from various segments and termed it a “fantastic opportunity”.
“What I used to say as part of the private sector, it is necessary to implement that when we are public servants now,” Aurangzeb said.
Noting that he previously gave the example of how “Mumbai does not go to Delhi but Delhi goes to Mumbai” at the time of India’s budget, the minister stressed that the government needs to visit the business community itself for consultations.
Economic sectors
During the media briefing, Aurangzeb also highlighted a “double-digit increase” in exports in the textile, IT and pharmaceutical sectors.
Observing an improved “local business environment”, he added: “SME (small and medium enterprises) loans have increased by 41pc. Should it be even higher? The answer is yes. But 41pc is not a small or insignificant number.
“Loans in the agricultural sector have crossed the Rs2.5 trillion figure. Private sector loans have increased by 38pc,” he added.
The finance czar explained that once fiscal discipline is achieved, the government’s borrowing requirement will decrease, and bank and other economic institutions will reach out to the private sector. The government has significantly increased its borrowing from commercial banks, reaching Rs2.7tr by early May.
 
 

He added that the government had reduced its debt servicing by Rs1tr in the past year. “God-willing, our debt servicing will go down by more than 1tr this year as well.”
Recalling his recent meetings with the SBP governor, Aurangzeb emphasised: “We are getting our house in order, which is the federal government. And therefore, it is important that you also take whatever efforts you are making towards the private sector.”
The finance minister also pointed out the record-setting spree at the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which crossed 147,000 points yesterday. He noted a 60pc growth in it, without specifying the timeline.
Aurangzeb highlighted there had been a “record increase” of 65,000 new investors who have come into the PSX over the last year. Company registrations’ annual levels had also gone above 250,000, the minister said, terming both developments as a “big structural change”.
‘Rightsizing of 43 ministries underway’
Speaking about the structural reforms, the minister pointed out the ongoing tariff reforms, which he said were taking place for the first time in Pakistan’s history.
 
 

He highlighted that the reforms aim to explore how to reduce the costs of raw materials and intermediate products so that Pakistan could become an export-led economy.
On the government’s rightsizing plan, the finance czar noted that the process for 43 ministries and over 400 departments was underway. He also reaffirmed that the privatisation of state-owned institutions will speed up this year.
The government had moved well past its original June 30 deadline for completing the rightsizing and has written to various ministries to seek their details.
Aurangzeb also pledged further reduction in energy costs due to the savings from the revised agreements with 27 independent power producers earlier this year.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1315342205a2523.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930645/field-marshal-asim-munir-honoured-with-azerbaijans-prestigious-war-medal' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir honoured with Azerbaijan’s prestigious war medal</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has been honoured with a prestigious war medal by Azerbaijan’s defence minister, the military’s media wing said on Wednesday.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Azerbaijan’s Colonel General Karim Valiyev called on COAS Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today.
“On the occasion, Colonel General Karim Valiyev conferred upon Field Marshal Asim Munir, Azerbaijan’s prestigious Patriotic War Medal for ‘Services in the Field of Military Cooperation’, on behalf of President Illham Aliyev, in recognition of his exceptional contributions in Azerbaijan-Pakistan bilateral military cooperation,” the statement said.
Established on May 17, 2002, the medal is a state award of Azerbaijan, awarded to servicemen of the country and foreign states, and other persons for merits in strengthening military cooperation with the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.
Per the statement, Gen Valiyev commended Pakistan’s unwavering efforts in combating terrorism and reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s determination to enhance collaboration in defence and security.
The Azerbaijani leader was presented with the guard of honour by the army upon his arrival, the statement said.
 






ISPR said that both leaders held a meeting to discuss “matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on the prevailing global and regional security landscape”.
“COAS reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan and reiterated the resolve to further consolidate bilateral relations. The COAS also congratulated the visiting dignitary on the successful conclusion of the peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” it added.
Azerbaijan’s Valiyev praised the armed forces for their “professionalism and success” in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the statement said, adding that the delegation extended best wishes for the upcoming Independence Day and Victory celebrations.
It continued, “COAS thanked Azerbaijan’s leadership and people for standing together with the people of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq and also for sending the Azeri Contingent for participating in the Independence Day ceremony.”
“Both military leaders expressed a shared commitment to advancing defence cooperation and promoting joint efforts for regional peace and stability,” the statement added.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust military cooperation. In 2023, COAS Munir visited Azerbaijan, aiming to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and defence collaboration between the two nations.
Last year, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13150531cd6b9cc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930648/incarcerated-pti-leader-ejaz-chaudhry-admitted-to-hospital-as-kidney-infection-deteriorates-health' target='_blank'><strong>Incarcerated PTI leader Ejaz Chaudhry admitted to hospital as kidney infection deteriorates health</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI leader Ejaz Chaudhry was admitted to a hospital in Lahore on Wednesday as his health deteriorated due to a kidney infection, his lawyer said.
On Monday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced Chuadhry and other PTI leaders to 10 years in prison in cases related to the May 9 riots. A day later, the court ordered the confiscation of properties owned by them.
On Saturday, Chaudhry was among other PTI leaders who filed appeals in the Lahore High Court against their convictions by ATCs. He pleaded the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. In his second petition, he further requested the court to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Chaudhry’s lawyer Rana Mudassar confirmed that various tests were being conducted on the PTI leader, who was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute in Lahore on Wednesday morning.
“He is suffering a severe kidney infection and has seven gallstones,” Mudassar said.
The lawyer added that Chaudhry was treated at Kot Lakhpat jail, where he is currently incarcerated, but his health did not improve. “He has lost 22 kgs.”
Last month, a Lahore ATC had sentenced Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
Senator Chaudhry, who has been under medical care for a heart condition, was reportedly admitted to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) after suffering heart pain on Feb 20.
In March, a Senate committee issued a stern warning over the failure to implement the production order of Chaudhry, emphasising potential consequences for non-compliance.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13143338d5ab760.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930649/terrorists-blow-up-a-gas-pipeline-in-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorists blow up a gas pipeline in Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists on Wednesday blew up a gas pipeline in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, resulting in a suspension of gas supply to Punjab, police said.
Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Aamir Khan told Dawn.com that the terrorists detonated explosives planted on the pipeline within the limits of the Bhana Manjiwala area of the district.
“Officials have initiated a search operation in the area to locate the culprits,” he said.
He added that the explosion resulted in a large crater at the site, leading to a complete halt of gas supply from the district to Punjab’s Mianwali region.
Following the explosion, a large contingent of police and a bomb disposal squad arrived at the scene and began a search operation in the surrounding area.
Police officials noted that the location had previously experienced three similar attacks on the main transmission gas pipeline.
In July, a gas pipeline leading to Punjab was also blown up near the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat, causing a similar suspension of supply. Later in the month, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area, causing significant damage to the pipeline.
Two similar incidents had occurred previously in June. Early in the month, alleged terrorists targeted a key gas pipeline from the Bettani Gas Field to Punjab. Subsequently, a pipeline was blown up again with an improvised explosive device near the Jabbarkhel area, within 10 days of the previous incident.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-08-13 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1307572126beade.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930557/seales-leads-wi-to-odi-series-victory-over-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Seales leads WI to ODI series victory over Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>TAROUBA: An inspired Jayden Seales led the West Indies to a crushing 202-run victory over Pakistan in the third and deciding one-day international in Trinidad on Tuesday.
The fast bowler blew away the Pakistan top order en route to figures of 6-18 as the tourists were bundled out for just 92 in a chase of 295 to win.
The Windies had reached 294-6 in their 50 overs batting first, powered by captain Shai Hope’s brilliant unbeaten hundred.
 






The Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
Pakistan’s reply got off to a horrendous start as Seales removed Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique and Mohammad Rizwan inside the first three overs to reduce them to 8-3.
Seales then trapped Babar Azam lbw for just nine to leave Pakistan’s hopes of a 2-1 series win in tatters.
Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took two wickets through the middle overs, before Seales returned to remove tailenders Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah and complete a six-wicket haul.
Pakistan had started strongly with the ball after winning the toss and electing to field, as the West Indies struggled to find the boundary.
The home side were 68-3 when Keacy Carty was dismissed lbw by Abrar for a 45-ball 17.
The usually big-hitting Sherfane Rutherford also never got going and crawled to 15 from 40 deliveries.
But Chase helped revive the innings with a quickfire 36, before being bowled by Naseem. Motie was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz as the West Indies batting effort threatened to peter out.
But Hope and Justin Greaves plundered 110 runs from the final 8.1 overs in a blistering assault to get their team close to 300. Hope finished on 120 not out.

The double-Olympic champion maintained his tradition of improving on his previous record by one centimetre, with his second attempt at the Istvan Gyulai Memorial overhauling the mark he set in Stockholm in June.
Duplantis had looked a little off his best form, missing his first attempt at 6.11 and, after Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis retired having failed twice at the same height, the Swede had the bar raised to make his usual world record attempt.
 






The 25-year-old twice world champion was unsuccessful on his first try and while he rattled the bar slightly on his second effort, Duplantis looked up almost in disbelief to see he had again reached a new height in the discipline he dominates.
“I love Hungary very much. The track is very good, I love the crowd, I would like to return, thank you,” Duplantis said.
Duplantis, who won his second world title in the same stadium in 2023, ran straight to the crowd to celebrate with his partner Desire Inglander and his family.
On Monday, Duplantis missed most of the press conference ahead of the Budapest meeting, apologising when he turned up late, saying he had a lot of work to do on his time management.
“I think I’ll have to make up for it tomorrow with a big leap,” Duplantis said.
He duly stayed true to his word to the delight of the Budapest crowd, and has now soared 15 centimetres higher than Sergey Bubka, who Duplantis once described as ‘mythological’.
The American-born Duplantis first broke the world record in 2020 in Poland, with his leap of 6.17 surpassing by one centimetre the previous record set by Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie six years earlier.
Lavillenie had beaten Bubka’s best jump of 6.14, which had stood for almost 20 years, but Duplantis has taken the sport to another level and on Saturday competes at the Silesia Diamond League, where he also broke the world record last year.</p><small>2025-08-13 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13123453b6d4cec.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930639/european-powers-tell-un-they-are-ready-to-reimpose-iran-sanctions' target='_blank'><strong>European powers tell UN they are ready to reimpose Iran sanctions</strong></a><br><p>Britain, France and Germany have told the United Nations they are ready to reimpose UN-mandated sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme if no diplomatic solution is found by the end of August, according to a joint letter obtained by AFP.
The letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council says the three European powers are “committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon” unless Tehran meets the deadline.
The foreign ministers from the so-called E3 group threaten to use a “snapback mechanism” that was part of a 2015 international deal with Iran that eased UN Security Council sanctions.
Under the deal, which terminates in October, any party to the accord can restore the sanctions.
All three have stepped up warnings to Iran about its suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
That came after Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, partly seeking to destroy its nuclear capability. The United States staged its own bombing raid during the war.
“We have made clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism,” foreign ministers Jean-Noel Barrot of France, David Lammy of Britain and Johann Wadephul of Germany said in the letter.
All three countries were signatories to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the United States, China and Russia that offered the carrot and stick deal for Iran to slow its enrichment of uranium needed for a nuclear weapon.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord in 2018 during his first term and ordered new sanctions.
The European countries said they would stick to the accord. But their letter sets out engagements that the ministers say Iran has breached, including building up a uranium stock more than 40 times the permitted level under the 2015 deal.
“The E3 remain fully committed to a diplomatic resolution to the crisis caused by Iran’s nuclear programme and will continue to engage with a view to reaching a negotiated solution.
“We are equally ready, and have unambiguous legal grounds, to notify the significant non-performance of JCPOA commitments by Iran … thereby triggering the snapback mechanism, should no satisfactory solution be reached by the end of August 2025,” the ministers wrote in the letter first reported by the Financial Times.
End of cooperation
The United States had already started contacts with Iran, which denies seeking a weapon, over its nuclear activities.
But these were halted by the Israeli strikes in June on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Even before the strikes, the international powers had raised concerns about the lack of access given to IAEA inspectors.
Iran halted all cooperation with the IAEA after the strikes, but it announced that the agency’s deputy chief was expected in Tehran for talks on a new cooperation deal.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent a letter to the UN last month saying that the European countries did not have the legal right to restore sanctions.
The European ministers called this allegation “unfounded”.
They insisted that as JCPOA signatories, they would be “clearly and unambiguously legally justified in using relevant provisions” of UN resolutions “to trigger UN snapback to reinstate UNSC resolutions against Iran, which would prohibit enrichment and re-impose UN sanctions.”</p><small>2025-08-13 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13114747518c857.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930633/indian-pm-modi-likely-to-meet-trump-in-us-next-month-newspaper-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Indian PM Modi likely to meet Trump in US next month, newspaper reports</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to meet President Donald Trump during a visit to the United States next month to attend the UN General Assembly meeting, the Indian Express newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.
India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian official familiar with the matter said a decision has not yet been taken, and that countries usually reserve slots for the General Debate at the assembly, which is why India’s “head of government” features in a provisional list of speakers on September 26.
“The list will go through revisions,” the official said, adding that it had not yet been decided if Modi would be going to the assembly. The General Assembly kicks off on September 9, but the debate, the annual meeting of heads of state and government, will be held from September 23-29.
Although the reason for the potential visit will be to attend the UN meeting in New York, a key objective will be to hold talks with Trump and iron out trade and tariff issues that have led to some souring of ties between the two countries, the newspaper reported.
News of a possible Modi trip to the US comes days after Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods to penalise New Delhi for continuing to buy Russian oil.
The penalty took the total levy on Indian goods exported to the US to 50pc, among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
Trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed after five rounds of negotiations over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.
On Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said several large trade agreements were still waiting to be completed, including with Switzerland and India, but New Delhi had been “a bit recalcitrant” in talks with Washington.
Bessent told Fox Business Network’s Kudlow he hoped the Trump administration could wrap up its trade negotiations by the end of October.
“That’s aspirational, but I think we are in a good position,” he said, adding, “I think we can be, we will have agreed on substantial terms with all the substantial countries.”</p><small>2025-08-13 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1311370827eb964.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930511/government-denies-rumours-of-more-mosques-being-razed-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Government denies rumours of more mosques being razed in capital</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Tuesday turned the tables on the protesting clerics, claiming that religious elements were spreading rumours about demolition of more mosques in the federal capital.
The state minister said land on which Madani Mosque and madressah were built had been cleared in the presence of their management.
The minister categorically refuted the reports circulating on social media that the government was planning to demolish another 50 mosques in the middle of the night.
Responding to the religious parties’ protest on Monday over the demolition of Madani Mosque, he said action was taken after seeking consent of the head of the madressah.

State minister says Madani Mosque demolished after seeking consent of seminary head

“We had filmed the entire operation because it was anticipated that such a situation can develop,” he told the National Assembly while responding to a point of order raised by Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) MNA Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri over the issue of demolition of Madani Mosque.
 


Maulana Haideri had maintained that the madressah was shifted but the concerned cleric was not willing to demolish the mosque.
“Once a mosque is built, it cannot be demolished until the day of judgement,” the JUI-F leader said, adding that “this should not happen in an Islamic state”.
He said the relevant minister had given 48 hours to resolve the issue with mutual understanding.
The Maulana referred to the Lal Masjid scenario and said the matter got disturbed due to negotiation delays.
Responding on the point of order, the state minister told the house that the entire operation was conducted in consultation and supervision of the management of the mosque and the seminary and the demolition took place in the presence of its head at the site.
Mr Chaudhry said the mosque and seminary were built illegally on a greenbelt, however, a modern building had been constructed for them at a cost of Rs40 million.
“Besides, reports of an operation against more than 50 mosques in Islamabad were not true,” he said.
The state minister responded by saying that he was grateful to the Maulana for playing role of a great scholar in this matter.
He said since January this year, negotiations had continued with the management of the mosque and the seminary, adding that “we have given a new madressah building in the style of modern schools at a place of their choice”.
He said the actual cost of the land and the building given to the madressah amounted to upto Rs150 million.
Mr Chaudhry denied the impression that an understanding with the government had been reached only over the demolition of the madressah, adding that he had the understanding that mosques were present in all madressahs.
He said the new building was completed in July, and the students had been shifted there and they were allowed to take all necessary items, including fans, with them. He said there were 185 students in the madressah.
The state minister also said if there was any construction on the greenbelt or on the way, decision would be made after consultation with the management of that mosque.
He expressed the hope that the issue would be resolved amicably after return of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi from a foreign visit.

Also, a senior administration officer was held hostage at gunpoint before being freed on the Bypass Road in Mirali tehsil of the district.
The police said unidentified men opened indiscriminate fire on a motorcycle on the Bypass Road, killing riders Mufti Fazlur Rehman and his son, Noor Rehman.
The attackers fled afterward. The police shifted the bodies to the district headquarters hospital in Miramshah.
In another incident, additional assistant commissioner of Razmak Mohammad Younis Yousafzai was held hostage by terrorists for around two hours on the Bypass Road in Mirali tehsil. He was later released.
The terrorists took the officer, along with his guard and driver, into custody and snatched his official vehicle, an AK-47 rifle, a pistol and a 9mm pistol. However, they later fled, leaving the officer and his subordinates behind.
No statement was issued by the district administration on the incident.
Residents resented both incidents, saying at a time when targeted killings and bomb blasts have made the area unsafe, the kidnapping of a government officer in broad daylight shows that the law and order situation has become really bad.
“When the government’s own officers are unsafe, who the people should trust for their safety,” wondered local elder Imran.
The residents demanded that the government take effective measures, arrest criminals and give them severe punishment, besides adopting a “practical strategy” to establish permanent peace in North Waziristan.
TENSE SITUATION: Tensions are running high in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South
Waziristan tribal district as armed groups have blocked key routes, planted improvised explosive devices and frequently exchanged fire with security forces over the last several days.
DSP of Birmal Circle Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn that armed men used a tractor to build an embankment Karmazi Stop, sealing off the Azam Warsak Road.
He said the road closure had forced residents to travel on rough tracks and mountainous terrain, making daily commutes difficult and dangerous.
Tribesmen said the blockade had also restricted access to fruit and vegetable markets, badly affecting traders and orchard owners.
Police officials said the area remained tense for six consecutive days, with reports of IEDs planted at multiple points along the road. In recent days, three culverts and a school were blown up.
According to DSP Shah, late-night gunfire by terrorists happens frequently, heightening fear among the residents.
In a separate incident, a 10-year-old girl was critically injured as terrorists and security forces traded fire in the Dazha Ghondai area. She was taken to the district headquarters hospital in Wana for treatment.
Residents have complained about the worsening law and order situation and said for the last 10 nights, intermittent gun battles had taken place, raising fears of civilian casualties.

An official statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday noted that the reduced tariff will create new opportunities for Pakistani exporters to expand their footprint in the US. The development was discussed during a high-level meeting on US reciprocal tariffs, chaired by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.
The meeting was attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal, Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul, senior officials from the Commerce and Industries Divisions, and more than 30 leading exporters and SMEs from key sectors including apparel, textiles, rice, salt, surgical instruments, sports goods, electronics, food and agriculture, and leather.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.

Islamabad secures the lowest tariffs among regional competitors

Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar highlighted Pakistan’s comparative advantage in the region and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting industry stakeholders in unlocking business potential under evolving global conditions.
 
 

Industry representatives called for consistent and industry-friendly policies to optimise manufacturing costs and secure access to critical inputs. They urged the government to adopt a predictable policy environment that facilitates long-term planning and growth.
Commerce Minister Jam reiterated the government’s focus on export-led growth, stressing both immediate and long-term strategic measures. He assured exporters that their recommendations would be compiled and presented to the Prime Minister for further action.
It was decided to actively pursue the expansion of Pakistan’s export footprint in the US, turning the current tariff reduction into a sustained national advantage for broader socio-economic development.
Separately, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal held a meeting with representatives of Octans Digital Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Interloop Holdings, to discuss sustainability and waste management in Pakistan’s textile industry.

• Nine personnel martyred in ambush near Iran border; attack on police station repulsed
• FO welcomes US decision to declare BLA, Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist groups
• Police vehicles targeted in Sibi, Quetta
QUETTA: Security forces have gunned down 50 terrorists over the past four days, as they foiled an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan’s Zhob district, said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) in a statement on Tuesday.
In the Sambaza area of Zhob district, 47 terrorists were killed following “successful engagements by security forces” from Aug 7 to 9, it said. In the same area along the Pak-Afghan border, three more “Indian-sponsored” terror­ists were killed during a “saniti­sation operation” on the night of Aug 10-11, it said, adding that arms and ammunitions were seized from their possession.
 
 

The statement referred to these militants as ‘khawarij’, a term used to describe the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban militants. The number of TTP terrorists killed in the four-day operation has risen to fifty,“ the ISPR added.
Nine soldiers martyred
On the other hand, a convoy of security forces was ambushed in the southern Washuk district bord­e­ring Iran on Monday night, lead­ing to the martyrdom of nine pers­o­n­nel, including an officer. The ISPR did not issue a statement by the time this report went to print.
 
 

Six soldiers were also injured in the gun battle between the militants and the security forces in the Basima area of Washuk. Sour­ces said the militants ambu­shed the convoy, and three vehicles came under heavy fire. The secur­ity personnel returned fire, and the battle continued for an hour.
“An officer and eight other secu­rity personnel embraced martyrdom while fighting bravely, and six others sustained injuries,” a senior security official said on the condition of anonymity. He said the injured were shifted to the nearby health facility, adding that casualties also occurred on the other side.
The militants also attempted to attack a police station in Basima recently handed over to the police, but the policemen deployed there repulsed it sucessfully, the official said, adding that the fight continued for half an hour. Three policemen were inju­r­ed. “Blood marks on the ground and a motorbike confirm casualties on the other side,” he claimed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday commended the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in the Sambaza area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, APP reported.
The president and prime minister, in their separately issued statements, “appreciated the security forces for killing 50 Indian-sponsored terrorists in the last four days as a testament to their professionalism, bravery, and determination”.
BLA, Majeed Brigade designation
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office welcomed the United States’ decision to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations, also adding Majeed Brigade as an alias to BLA.
 
 

The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, besides being committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.
Also, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in an interaction with the media in Hyderabad termed the designation of Majeed Brigade and Balochistan Liberation Army by the US a success. He said it was the endorsement of Pakistan’s viewpoint by the US.
He said these separatist outfits openly supported India during May’s Pak-India conflict, adding the UN should make such a declaration as well so that international financing to these outfits could be curtailed.
Quetta and Sibi attacks
Furthermore, a police officer was injured in a grenade attack in Sibi, while a police vehicle on patrol escaped a bomb blast in the provincial capital.
Officials said that an unknown motorcyclist hurled a grenade at a police vehicle in Sibi on Monday night near the Government Girls College. The grenade exploded close to the police vehicle and injured a police officer, who was on snap-checking duty in the area.
In Quetta, a police vehicle escaped a roadside bomb attack that occurred on Link Badini Road near the Eastern Bypass. The explosion, however, destroyed a car which was passing through the area. The man driving remained unhurt. “The target was a police vehicle…but it passed the area a minute before the blast,” a senior police officer said. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks.

An interim charge sheet was filed in May against prime suspect Armaghan Qureshi and Sheraz alias Shavez Bukhari.
In the final document, the investigating officer (IO) Muhammad Ali said that the last known location of the victim and the two suspects was the house of Armaghan in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
 
 

He said the victim, Mustafa, had informed his friend Rafay over the phone before going to the house of the prime suspect. Rafay’s statement had been recorded, he added.
The IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from a car in the Hub area.
The report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.
According to him, pending forensic reports from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency had since been received, confirming that the CCTV footage was unedited and had not been tampered with.

Mr Kakar said all deputy commissioners across the province had been instructed to take measures to halt public transport operating during the night.
Transporters have been directed to install trackers in their vehicles, deploy security guards, and comply with the government’s anti-smuggling measures.

• House witnesses passage of five, introduction of 16 bills
• Fatyana moves Constitution amendment bill seeking creation of West Punjab province
ISLAMABAD: A day after causing a rumpus and boycotting the National Assembly over the conviction of party leaders in the May 9 riots, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers returned to the house on Tuesday for the private members’ day proceedings, allowing Speaker Ayaz Sadiq to complete the legislative agenda, as the assem­bly passed five bills and introduced 16 more.
On Monday, PTI members had lodged a strong, noisy protest and staged a walkout, protesting the convictions of party leaders in connection with the riots.
At the outset of Tuesday’s sitting, the opposition members, led by Asad Qaiser, again staged a walkout from the house when Mr Sadiq refused to give them the floor to move a privilege motion against the authorities denying them a meeting with incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan at Adiala Jail.
As the PTI members started leaving the hall, raising slogans, the speaker once again offered facilitation in the talks between the government and the opposition and went one step forward by nominating Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and veteran PPP MNA Syed Naveed Qamar to engage the opposition.
When Mr Sadiq asked the opposition to propose two names from their side to become a part of negotiations, the latter sought time to come back to him after holding an in-house consultation.
He stressed that dialogue was the only way to resolve political differences and offered to act as a bridge between the government and the opposition.
He also referred to the arrest of Indian Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, noting that even in that case, no “production orders” were issued. He emphasised that no forum was greater than the National Assembly and the Senate as a “grand jirga”, and urged all political forces to come forward to strengthen parliament.
Mr Sadiq said that in the past, he had facilitated the government-opposition talks, alleging that it was the opposition, not the government, that had withdrawn from the negotiation process.
The speaker asked the protesting PTI members to make their talks with the government conditional on the permission for them to meet Imran Khan in jail. “Put this before the government as your demand,” he said.
While refusing to grant PTI leaders the floor to move a privilege motion, the speaker said that such a motion could only be allowed if the members faced hurdles in fulfilling their parliamentary duties, whereas such a question did not arise if someone was not allowed to meet any person.
PTI’s Aamir Dogar argued that the five PTI lawmakers who had gone to meet Imran Khan in jail were denied entry, describing the denial as a breach of privilege.
Mr Qaiser also protested over the non-inclusion of his private member bill granting the right of appeal to the civilians convicted by military courts before a high court.
Law Minister Tarar acknowledged that the bill was being vetted by the law ministry, stating that the government could also bring a similar bill. The minister also reiterated the talks offer from the government, stating that “dialogue is the beauty of democracy”.
He said the confrontation would produce no result, and political issues must be settled by the politicians themselves.
PTI’s Iqbal Afridi also hit out at the speaker over his alleged failure to protect the lawmakers who were last year picked up by the law enforcement agencies personnel from the premises of the Parliament House.
As soon as the opposition members staged a walkout, the speaker started taking up the agenda, which included the introduction and passage of the bills, including those moved by the PTI members.
The speaker expressed his surprise to see Riaz Fatyana and other PTI members back in the house only to move their bills. They said that they had staged “a token walkout” and that they had come back with the permission of the party to introduce their bills.
The National Assembly passed five bills, including the Legal Prac­titioners and Bar Councils (Amend­ment) Bill, 2025; the National Institute of Health (Re-organisation) (Amendment) Bill, 2025; the Acid and Bum Crime Bill, 2024; the Reservation of Special Seats for Deserving Persons in Universities Bill, 2024; and the Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill, 2025. These bills, many of which had already passed through the Senate, were approved by the assembly.
The house also saw the introduction of 16 bills, including a Constitution amendment bill seeking the creation of “a separate province within Punjab, comprising two divisions, namely Faisalabad and Sahiwal, calling it “West Punjab”. This is the first time that such a bill has been introduced in the parliament, as the house has been discussing the formation of South Punjab and Hazara provinces for many years.
The other bills introduced in the assembly included the Public Interest Disclosures (Amendment) Bill, the Guardians and Wards (Amendment) Bill, the Prevention of Obscenity and Indecency in Digital Media Bill, and the Multi-Vendor Electricity Distribution Bill.
Later, speaking on points of order, several PPP lawmakers from Sindh, including Nabeel Gabol from Lyari, protested over long power outages in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi.
The National Assembly will meet again today (Wednesday) at 11am.

Referring to the mini­ster’s remarks, the PAC, chaired by Junaid Akbar, decided to summon the Mini­stry of Interior, State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and other relevant autho­rities in its next session to provide a detailed briefing on the matter. “We will obtain complete records to determine which bureau­crats have acquired plots,” said the PAC chairman.
The committee also discussed the imposition of sales tax in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and decided to seek a briefing on the closure of utility stores, when it meets next week.
During the meeting, audit objections relating to the Ministry of Religious Affa­irs were reviewed, including a case of embezzlement by one of its accounting officers, Muhammad Kaleem, involving Rs12 million in remittances, which allegedly caused significant losses to the ministry.
“If an assistant accountant can commit such acts, what is the Director General of Haj doing there?” questioned Junaid Akbar. The ministry’s secretary, Dr Syed Attaur Rehman, informed the committee that the system had been digitised to prevent such irregularities.
Senator Afnanullah Khan noted that despite the fraud, no red warrants had been issued for Muhammad Kaleem, nor had any property been confiscated. Officials revealed that the accused had secured a Canadian visa beforehand and was currently residing in Canada. The ministry claimed it had immediately written to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to lodge an FIR and had dismissed the individual from service.
The PAC chairman asked the Ministry of Interior whether Interpol had been contacted in the matter.
The meeting was informed that Kaleem and his spouse had both been declared absconders. According FIA, both were last reported to be in the US.
The committee expressed dismay that, despite four years having lapsed, the ministry had shown no interest in pursuing Kaleem to recover approximately Rs43m embezzled.
It also questioned the ministry about its staffing in Saudi Arabia. PAC members raised concerns over the number of officials posted there and their year-round duties. “We don’t need as much staff from Pakistan. We require more local staff,” officials responded, adding that 1, 700 staff engaged for Haj duties – to assist pilgrims - were provided return tickets annually.
Lawmakers suggested that Pakistani workers already based in Saudi Arabia should be employed for seasonal duties. “I never see these officials - I don’t know where they go,” remarked Senator Mohsin Aziz.
When asked whether government employees were sent for Haj free-of-cost each year, the Secretary of Religious Affairs clarified that only Haj assistants - all of whom were government employees - received such facilitation. He further proposed that, from next year, only assistants in Grade 11 and above would be appointed, adding, “No one performs a free Haj except these assistants.”
