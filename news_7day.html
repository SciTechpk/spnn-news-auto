The individual, identified as Irfan from Dera Ghazi Khan, was mistakenly presumed dead due to a mix-up in the identification of bodies.
Commandant Border Military Police Dera Ghazi Khan Asad Chandia (who had supervised transportation of bodies from Balochistan border to their native areas in Punjab) told that Irfan was among the 12 passengers who were forcibly offloaded from the bus by armed assailants. However, Irfan managed to escape execution.
The commandant said following his escape, Irfan did not return to the passenger coach but instead took an alternative vehicle to reach his native village, Wasti Buzdar, tehsil Taunsa Sharif. At present he is in a state of shock according to his family, Chandia said.
 
 

One Kashif, who is an employee of 1122 and hails from the same village, told Dawn that Irfan successfully escaped execution by hiding his mobile phone and identity card.
Due to his absence from the passenger list during the recovery process, authorities mistakenly identified the body of another victim, Sheikh Majid, as that of Irfan.
The confusion was cleared when local administration contacted Irfan Buzdar’s family to identify the body and they confirmed that Irfan had returned home safely but was not ready to give detail of his ordeal.
This revelation raises questions about the accuracy of initial reports and identification processes.
The Loralai attack, allegedly carried out by militants linked to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), resulted in the deaths of nine passengers. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation and renewed concerns over passenger safety in the region.
Talking to Dawn, DGK Deputy Commissioner Usman Khalid said the district administration does not allow public transport to enter Balochistan at night in order to prevent any untoward incidents. However, the recent fatal attack, which occurred in broad daylight, has raised serious concerns about the safety of commuters who prefer to travel during the day to avoid such threats.
 
 

In December 2023, Dera Ghazi Khan had received bodies of six barbers from Waziristan and three from Balochistan in January 2024.
Heirs of six barbers had also received compensation from government but the families of three truckers Ahmed Rasheed Zuhrani (23), two brothers Syed Ali Haider (16) and Syed Kumail Haider (25) could not get financial aid despite the fact that the DGK district government had officially requested and wrote to the provincial government for the compensation.

It is pertinent to mention that the people of three union councils were affected with the construction of 11.80 megawatt Karora Hydropower Project. The jirga was led by the renowned political and social figure, Nawaz Khan Shangla and advocate Naeem Sahib.
The negotiations were attended by the provincial minister for energy, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mr Tariq Sadozai, Deputy Commissioner Shangla, Mr Fawad Khan, and CEO PEDO, Mr Irfan Wazir, along with a high-level government delegation.
The government expressed readiness to resolve the public issues after advocate Naeem and Nawaz Khan Shangla briefed the jirga in detail about the problems being faced by the people and their legitimate demands.
The agreement led to an additional public welfare package, which included schools, infrastructure development, and water supply schemes, while the energy minister assured full support for protecting the rights of the people of the three union councils at every forum.
New micro and mini hydel projects for the three union councils were also approved, and it was also agreed that the installation costs of new electricity meters will be collected from the public in easy installments, and the matter would be taken up with the Pesco. They also agreed on a formula to provide electricity at lower rates for the benefit the local population.
Furthermore, a committee has been constituted under the supervision of the deputy commissioner Shangla to ensure construction of transmission lines, costing Rs48.5 crores. This committee will include representatives from the jirga and the Pesco.
Moreover, the energy minister assured that people from the three union councils and Shangla would be given priority for jobs at all levels.

“The use of Article 63(2) [of the Constitution] will not only constitute a misapplication of Constitutional provisions but will also set an unrestrained and troubling precedent, potentially affecting the sanctity of legislative forums across the country,” Mr Swati noted in a letter to Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan.
On June 27, the Punjab Assembly’s speaker ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sessions after their protests disrupted the speech of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and caused chaos in the house.
Days later, he filed a disqualification reference against them with the Election Commission of Pakistan. Of those MPAs, 17 were listed as members to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which the PTI-affiliated election candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol of cricket bat. However, at least eight others were declared PTI lawmakers.

Insists invoking Article 63(2) of Constitution can undermine legislative autonomy

In the letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Mr Swati said that he had come to know that in exercise of powers conferred upon the speaker under Rule 210(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997, read with Rule 223 of the ibid Rules, an order was issued on June 27 to suspend 26 members of the Punjab Assembly from the opposition benches for 15 sittings of the assembly.
“It has also been reported in print and electronic media that the treasury benches have filed a disqualification reference under Article 63(2), read with Article 113, of the Constitution before your good office against the said 26 members, and proceedings to that effect may be initiated subsequently,” Mr Swati formally told his counterpart in Punjab.
He insisted that Rule 210(3) of the rules served the vital purpose of maintaining order and decorum within the house, and compliance with rules of procedure was essential for upholding constitutional governance.
“However, to invoke Article 63(2) in this context raises serious constitutional concerns. The disqualification clause should not be used as a punitive measure for conduct within the legislative chamber, particularly when such conduct has already been addressed through suspension under the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure,” he said.
Mr Swati said that invoking Article 63(2) against the opposition lawmakers risked undermining the autonomy and dignity of elected assemblies.
“Proceedings within the house and the privileges of its members are protected under Articles 66 and 69, read with Article 127 of the Constitution. These provisions affirm the inviolability of legislative proceedings and guard against external interference in the conduct of business within the House,” he noted in the letter.
The KP Assembly’s speaker said the moment called for the promotion of democratic norms and culture at all levels of governance.
He said that it was imperative that all elected representatives, along with political leadership across party lines, adopted a constructive and statesmanlike approach.
“We must work to reduce political polarisation, foster reconciliation and reinforce the credibility of our democratic institutions, such action, vis-a-vis the constitutional mandate and disciplinary authority of the provincial assembly, would set an unprecedented and unconstitutional precedent, with far-reaching implications for the future functioning of legislative assemblies across the country, to be reconsidered hopefully,” he noted in the letter to the Punjab Assembly’s speaker.

The new air service will help facilitate commerce, reduce travel time and costs for traders, and strengthen bilateral ties, said Ali Reza Rajai, Iran’s acting consul general in Quetta.
The announcement was made at a ceremony organised by the Pak-Iran Joint Chamber of Commerce.
The flights are intended “to facilitate trade and travel between Pakistan and Iran,” Rajai said, stressing the need for stronger cooperation.
Top officials from the airline, including Iran Air Chief Agha Karimi and Deputy Chief Agha Ismail, were also in attendance.
Mr Rajai said the new service would be critical for enhancing port-to-port cooperation between Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and Iran’s Chabahar Port.
He called for bureaucratic hurdles to be removed to improve bilateral business, including streamlined visa processes and affordable fares.

A bench consisting of Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Sadiq Ali observed in a verdict that the existence of an alternate remedy — filing appeal under the Army Act — was not an absolute bar to exercise constitutional jurisdiction of the high court.
Referring to the May 7, 2025, short order of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench in the military courts cases, the bench pointed out that the apex court had held the same remedy (appeal under Army Act) to be inefficacious and for that reason, the federal government was directed to make necessary legislation for providing a right of appeal before the respective high courts.
“Additionally, it has already been clarified that individual cases/writ petitions if pending or filed before the High Courts for challenging vires of orders passed by Anti-Terrorism Court allowing transfer of cases or custody of an accused for military trial should be decided by the High Courts on its own merit,” the bench observed.

Declares convicts have right to court martial records

The bench issued the order while declaring a petition jointly filed by three convicts of a military court, who were sentenced to 10-year rigorous imprisonment for attacking military places during the May 9-10, 2023, violent protests in Mardan district.
It sought comments within a fortnight from the respondents including the federal secretaries of defense and interior and the relevant Field General Court Martial (FGCM) through its chairperson and the concerned brigadier commander.
The petitioners, including Adnan Ahmad, Rehmatullah and Shakirullah, have requested the court to set aside their conviction and sentences awarded by the FGCM and its confirmation by the concerned brigadier commander, as the same was unconstitutional and arbitrary.
The petitioners claimed that without recourse to the basics of the Constitution and inherent safeguards stipulated within the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 and Pakistan Army Act Rules, 1954, they were tried by the FGCM at Peshawar from Oct 6 till Dec 30, 2023, and consequently they were convicted.
A deputy attorney general Atif Nazir had contended that the petition was not maintainable and may be dismissed by the court. He contended an alternate forum was available to the petitioners, but they had failed in filing an appeal within the required 40 days.
Barrister Amir Khan Chamkani, representing the petitioners contended that the said remedy of filing appeal before Chief of the Army Staff had already been held to be inefficacious by the SC in its order of May 7, 2025. He stated that regarding individual cases/ writ petitions pending or to be filed before a high court, the same were to be decided by the high court on its own merit.
The bench observed that the remedy of appeal under section 133 (B) of Pakistan Army Act was time bound and the same was no longer available after expiry of the limitation period of 40 days.
The bench quoted several paras from the May 7 judgement of the apex court in support of its order.
The bench ruled that this court as a constitutional court couldn’t abdicate its jurisdiction particularly when such jurisdiction had also been held to be available in cases such as convictions in the case “Brigadier (retd) FB Ali versus The State.”
Record of FGCM Proceedings: In its six-page detailed order, the bench also discussed the issue of non-provision of record of proceedings to the petitioners, observing that under Rule 130 of the Pakistan Army Act Rules, every person tried by a court martial had been declared entitled to obtain a copy of proceedings against payment of prescribed fee.
The petitioners had requested for them to provide them with records of FGCM proceedings, including summary of evidence, in their cases as well as order of conviction.
“Only one exception has been provided i.e., where in the opinion of the Chief of Army Staff, supply of any proceedings or part thereof may be prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State,” the bench observed.
It pointed out that the DAG could not produce any order from the COAS that he had withheld delivery of copies to petitioners in the present case for the reason of same being prejudicial- to the safety or interest of the State.
The lawyer for petitioners claimed that his clients had been tried for civil offence and not in offence relating to security of Pakistan.
The bench ruled that it was also constitutional right of petitioners enshrined in Articles 4, 9,10-A and 19-A of the Constitution, that they be allowed copies of proceedings of the trial where-under they had been convicted.
It directed the respondents to annex all such records with their comments, where petitioners would be allowed to obtain copies.

I say meowler because his meows were practically cat howls each time he demanded food. However, when I walked into my apartment on that suffocating day in June 2023, I found him panting in a corner near the ventilation duct. A freak meteorological combination of humidity and hot continental air from Cyclone Biporjoy’s churning over the Arabian Sea had caused my sun-exposed apartment to turn into a tandoor [clay oven] — a hot and muggy enclosure.
I realised Poppy was indoors since the morning, ie exposed to an extended period of heat, had become heat-stressed and was suffering from heat exhaustion. I instantly hauled his warm body to my room. An hour later, his panting ended with him fast asleep in my arms.
This was the first time I felt I was at a loss to provide the care and comfort for him when I am not at my apartment. I comically imagined him grabbing the AC remote with his pink toe-beans to switch it on, much like I imagined him opening the refrigerator to acquire his food.
Of course, those are just imaginaries. The reality is as a housecat, Poppy — like other non-human species — was dependent on me as his kahu or guardian to protect and preserve his life from all forms of danger. This includes monitoring any increase in indoor heat during the hellish summers of Karachi.

As Karachi experiences sweltering conditions under record-breaking heat in 2025, unchecked urban development, energy poverty and poor governance are creating dangerous microclimates for its most vulnerable citizens

AN INVISIBLE SUFFERING
His feline existence is 100 percent dependent on the kind of decisions I can make for him concerning his living environment. It also includes monitoring and managing the build-up of heat and its risks inside our shared living space because of the double action of sustained urban warming and micro-urban heat islands, such as in this scenario. When it is hot, the two of us need to stay grounded in my room with the air conditioner turned on for hours — a privileged activity.
Life with heat stress is the new norm and this has come to dominate here in the concrete jungle of cement, glass and steel in this southern megacity in Pakistan and other high-density urban agglomerations across South Asia and the Global South.
2025 is coming to be known as the year of higher-than-average temperatures recorded across South Asia, beginning from February. This is unprecedented. India recorded its warmest February in 125 years. Bangladesh logged its highest day and night temperatures since 1948, while above-high temperatures were measured for Sri Lanka in over a decade. Essentially, I witnessed the shortest spring of my life to date.
Farmers across the region saw risks to their wheat and other crop yields as higher temperatures impact crop development just before the harvest season. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has been recording temperature anomalies since February through June 2025, with the month of April registering three distinct hot spells across Pakistan. The forecasts for the remainder of the summers already point to higher-than-average temperatures that will be breaking established records.
This is the ‘new normal’ and we are fast moving into unknown territory.
 


THE LIVED IMPACT
I have written in-depth on the lived impact faced by the citizens of Karachi and other similar urban-blocs of the Global South dealing with urban heat and rising greenhouse gas emissions. Unplanned and variegated urban development, building material and design, construction, other anthropogenic sources of heat, and increased densification and expansion are leaving regions during peak summers at dangerously higher risks to continuous heat-exposure — both indoors and outdoors.
Heat stress as a phenomenon is now a worldwide problem. However, countries of the Global South are at higher risk due to the scale of the impact, given the high population numbers, fast urbanising trends and energy poverty.
While the year-on-year rise in urban warming as Karachi has expanded has been a permanent feature, the risks are higher today because of an increasing frequency of above-average air temperatures. An unchecked increase in heat-retaining built-environments and the growing usage of air conditioners — as a natural consequence of attempting to stay cool — are further adding to heat stress felt inside microclimates.
In Karachi, the high-density zones are where a large part of the urban poor reside and who also provide ancillary services as daily-wage earners. These are your street hawkers and vendors, food delivery riders, mechanics, factory workers, those who work in the construction industry and as house-help, and several others who constitute the megacity’s political economy. Many reside in areas with unregulated building quality standards and limited green spaces and are thus at a higher risk. During hot days, it is normal for families to spend their nights sleeping in public spaces, including the beaches at Seaview or on open green belts across the megacity.
Indoor heat — a less studied form of heat exposure — in such zones is causing residents and workers alike to be subjected to increased local temperatures. Microclimates can push internal temperatures to well past 5°C above apparent temperatures — especially if ventilation conduits have not been properly designed and unit roofs are directly exposed to sunlight. Summarily, the physical attributes of home environments are no longer considered optimal for thermal comfort due to uncomfortable temperatures.
Data from a weather monitoring station at the Jinnah International Airport for the months of May to July from 2022 to 2024 are already indicating that heat index levels for the peak heat months are pushing the limits of human survivability.
 

The average and maximum heat index (HI) in Karachi in May, June and July across 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 (given data availability), including heat exposure during that time

Based on this three-year analysis, it is evident that conditions have consistently exceeded the human thermal comfort threshold, often crossing the serious baseline of 27°C, beyond which the human body must work more to effectively cool itself. While daytime heat index values are understood to cross high thresholds due to sun exposure, what is deeply concerning is that throughout these months, the average minimum heat index values rarely dipped below 27°C, especially in June and July, signalling persistent thermal stress, even during night-time.
More strikingly, night-time maximum heat index values regularly surged into the high 30s with 2024 showing the most extreme peaks, particularly in late June and July, where day-time heat indices consistently exceeded 45°C. Over the three months and years, more than 95 percent of days have seen heat index values greater than 40°C. This pattern points to a growing urban climate hazard, where heat stress is no longer episodic — as in when a heat wave is forecast — but prolonged and intensifying because of built environments.
Night-time temperatures are considered the time where the human body can cool off and rest. However, year-on-year comparison shows that night-time heat index temperatures indicate a rising trend for each month. Resultantly, compromised thermal comfort is having micro impacts on long-term public health and labour productivity.
These extend to child and maternal health, which are severely compromised due to limitations in fulfilling everyday activity including sleep. Home-based kitchen economies, of which women constitute a large part of the workforce, complain of heat syncope (fainting), heat rashes, heat fatigue, heat oedema (swelling) and heat cramps. Studies now indicate chronic heat stress increases household tensions and aggression, intensifies care work burdens, disrupts safe spaces, and reduces women’s physical capacity to resist violence.

Minors often fall ill from the early onset of heat exhaustion and are, in many cases, unable to focus on their schooling. Outdoor workers such as food delivery riders, utility workers and labour often narrate the lethargy brought on by hot weather. It is almost as if “our bodies are shutting down,” quips one food-delivery rider.
Pet-lovers find it challenging to care for their loved animals during the hot weather. The ongoing water and energy poverty, and lack of access to affordable electricity for basic cooling services are adding to further complications. Limited or incomplete sleep during hot and humid weather is a norm and that cascades into lowered productivity at work and keeps the most vulnerable in a repetitive poverty cycle.
Additionally, in Pakistan, a misconception exists that heat-relief camps must be activated only when formal notices are released by the PMD, declaring a heat wave as a meteorological event that accounts only for air temperatures. This ignores the ground realities of the compound and complex impacts of the built environment and humidity that produce “felt heat”, also known as the heat index — and its more accurate measure, the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature — that cause higher heat stress levels.
Going with the current trends, higher urbanisation rates and land conversion for more real-estate development are further locking in and intensifying risk to heat exposure. As global heating intensifies today, tomorrow and in the future people in these regions are fated to somehow ‘manage’ their vulnerabilities based around the aforementioned factors, amidst a water crisis that has been hitting Pakistan, and Karachi in particular, very hard in recent years.
While the understanding goes that coastal megacities have the advantage of the thermo-regulating action of the sea-breeze that real-estate agents, in Karachi at least, advertise as “west open” in their ads or sales pitches, this reasoning falls apart during extreme heat. The number of such days is increasing each year, especially during freak weather conditions, when the wind flows cease.

SYSTEMIC BLINDNESS
Yet again this year, the people of Karachi are facing another round of extreme heat, and it’s hitting the megacity’s poorest residents the hardest. These are the same families who are still struggling with debt in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and are also adjusting to the harsh austerity measures that come after every agreement signed between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), all while surviving another cycle of a dangerously hot summer.
The question is: why do the same people keep getting hit by one crisis after another? While some parts of the city have air conditioning and better housing, the urban poor are left to sweat and suffer through extreme temperatures with little protection or support.
Several forms of substantive research and commentary after the deadly 2015 heat wave have highlighted the risks to extreme heat. Yet there is a governance failure evidenced in using this established knowledge, science and wisdom to mitigate impacts. The recommendations that were made in the National Disaster Management Authority’s (NDMA) technical report and long-term recommendations laid out in the Karachi Heat Management Plan have also not been adhered to.
One would expect that, 10 years after the horrid days of the heat wave of June 2015, lessons would have been learned from the jolts that ruptured the megacity’s governing, civic- and utility-providing institutions. Yet, what is being observed is business as usual: laissez-faire real estate development in both the formal and informal sectors, with building contractors and investors benefitting from the generous tax amnesty schemes of the last eight years, and the soon-to-be-given reduction in property taxes. The unregulated market mechanism has left Karachi with a permanent environmental cost to cope with, given prevailing income and productivity levels.
In fact, the recent amendments to Karachi’s building regulations were akin to sanctioning chaos to its citizens’ collective health and quality of life that now depends on the chance certainty of survivable temperatures.
The ineptitude, malaise and apathy, however, don’t end there. Rather, a systemic blindness appears to exist within our policy-makers and those who govern and pull the levers of Karachi’s urban geography. The lived impact of heat stress is a dimension of necessary and urgent discussion that is cursorily mentioned in policy documents and surveys but is absent in practice and praxis. For example, the implementation of the long-term changes envisaged in the Karachi Heat Management Plan is stuck in a quagmire. Given Karachi’s current state, this document appears to stand as a nice-looking deliverable and nothing more than that.
 

The average and maximum heat index (HI) in Karachi in May, June and July across 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 (given data availability), including heat exposure during that time

While the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has sounded warning bells about the impact of heat stress on work and productivity, the last two editions of the Pakistan Economic Survey has little to no mention of the complex forms of heat stress and its impact on a workforce employed in the agricultural sector and other forms of outdoor work or the wider impact of heat stress on a debt-ridden economy. During extended “hot days”, electrical energy for basic cooling needs is heavily needed. Yet, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) makes no mention in its State of the Industry Report 2023-24 for provisions directing power companies to account for and provide continuous services and prevent prolonged heat exposure by the public at large – primarily during heat emergency periods.
While the National Adaptation Plan 2023 acknowledges heat stress as a climate change impact, less is said on required action, including further investigations concerning various forms of heat exposure. A small positive is that the erstwhile Karachi Climate Action Plan proposes ambitious targets to reduce heat stress via urban greening. However, it is limited to improving building design by retrofitting just government, educational and health facilities to reduce heat exposure.
It further outlines improving access to cooling via donation of 50,000 DC fans to vulnerable populations. This is but a drop in the ocean, in contrast to the massive remedying measures required to reduce heat exposure across the board. There is limited understanding on ways to address and improve thermal comfort within Karachi’s existing buildings and public spaces that can protect peoples’ health and well-being from extreme heat.
When it comes to governance, this is the most pertinent point: historically in Karachi, parcels of land are converted to support unsustainable concrete growth with high cooling demands, whereas sustainability means optimising its usage for efficiency. High-density zones have a higher range of vulnerability, due to the practice of building outside the purview of by-laws, since informal real-estate developers often cut corners to maximise on profits. Therefore the key to the success of any plan would lie in incorporating the reining in of real-estate economies, which can be done by implementing building code standards that reduce heat gain. Moreover, high grid-based electrical energy prices that keep vulnerable communities from accessing affordable cooling, also need to be addressed.
The disconnect between policymakers and Karachi’s vulnerable populations creates, what sociologists call, a “thermal apartheid.” Air-conditioned offices, luxury vehicles and well-insulated homes create a buffer, a sensory shield that prevents decision-makers from understanding extreme heat — in its truest sense — as anything more than a minor inconvenience.
When the entire professional, commuting and living environment is climate-controlled, the urgency of heat stress becomes an abstract concept. In such environments, cooling infrastructure becomes a seamless background infrastructure that never demands attention, as optimum cooling needs are met. When it fails — such as during extended electricity supply breakdowns — only then does it turn into a pain point of magnanimous proportions requiring instant redressal.
To contextualise this systemic disconnect, one must look back to the month of May in the previous year, when several students gave their 2024 matriculation examinations in extreme heat, with some examination centres even found to be devoid of fans. This, against the public warning issued by the PMD that “heat wave like” conditions were forecast for the month of May, when “felt heat” would exceed the extreme danger threshold.
It was only after a heat wave notification was released for the last week of May 2024 that scheduled examinations were officially postponed. Later, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah intervened to state that annual examinations should be held earlier, in the “cooler” month of March. However, it is the reactive rather than proactive approach to matters concerning public health that is alarming.
 

A numerical analysis of the temperatures, heat index (HI) and 90 day exposure in Karachi across 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025

THE HUMAN AND ECONOMIC COST
The numbers are stark. The ILO estimates that, globally, 2.41 billion workers are exposed to excessive heat. In the Asia-Pacific region, almost 75 percent of the workforce is already exposed to excessive heat. In Pakistan, it is estimated that, by 2030, roughly six percent of working hours will be lost to heat stress, thus impacting almost 5 million jobs across all sectors. Projections estimate GDP losses rising up to 21 percent — these projections assumed the rise in global temperatures would be capped at 1.5C, a battle that has already been lost according to climate scientists.
Urban landscapes compound this problem. Karachi’s, and the rest of Pakistan’s, mushroom concrete jungles, with minimal green cover and extensive heat-absorbing surfaces, have already transformed cities into a thermal trap. If you do not have access to optimum cooling, your productive days are going to be thoroughly reduced during the hot summer months.
 
 

For a long time now, Pakistan’s economic and urban policies have been enabling megacities to chase “modernity” as the model to social and economic growth and development. Neatly designed advertisements for real estate projects for housing or commercial zones in the megacity centres and gated-housing societies have only left end-users of the product to deal with rising costs to keep cool. The majority of projects have shied away from adopting indigenous methods that incorporate architectural designs promoting natural cooling. In fact, these methodologies have been systematically dismantled under the guise of ‘modernisation’.
Colonial and post-colonial urban planning prioritised aesthetics, economic incentives and dividends (real estate speculative trading) over safe and cool housing infrastructure. To paraphrase a social worker, “Dubai bananay chalay thay, aakhir mei dozakh bana di hai [They set out to create Dubai, but have instead created hell].” What is required is a massive re-engineering of our imaginations in order to address heat stress, not as a mere technical intervention but a fundamental restructuring of how we understand environmental and spatial vulnerability.
An approach must be adopted that centres the experiences of those most exposed to these conditions and acknowledges that heat stress is a critical public health issue. Global heating stands as one of the most crucial issues facing modern human existence, and adapting to its impact for countries of the Global South — especially in megacities such as Karachi — is imperative.
As the American writer Jeff Goodell puts it in The Heat Will Kill You First, “When heat comes, it is invisible. It doesn’t bend tree branches or blow hair across your face to let you know it’s arrived. The ground doesn’t shake. It just surrounds you and works on you in ways that you can’t anticipate or control. You sweat. Your heart races. You’re thirsty. Your vision blurs. The sun feels like the barrel of a gun pointed at you. Plants look like they’re crying. Birds vanish from the sky and take refuge in deep shade. Cars are untouchable. Colours fade. The air smells burned. You can imagine fire even before you see it.”

The failure to deliver relief at the consumer level highlights deep-rooted structural gaps in sugar sector governance, both at the federal and provincial levels. With no effective policy cohesion and regulatory oversight, the burden continues to fall on ordinary citizens who are forced to absorb rising costs amid persistent market volatility.
The sugar industry is one of the country’s most politically sensitive, with government and opposition elites controlling several mills. However, blaming mill owners for the sugar crisis simplifies a complex value chain. Vested production interests, speculative brokers, middlemen and inadequate provincial regulatory enforcement create market instability.
These systemic factors fuel recurrent boom-and-bust cycles, turning sugar into a commodity manipulated by multiple actors, with consumers inevitably bearing the brunt of the consequences.

Govt’s import efforts fall short as mill owners, brokers, middlemen, lack of regulation lead to instability

A senior official from the federal Ministry of Industry and Production acknowledged the absence of a coherent national policy for the sugar sector, stressing the need for a long-term policy to stabilise and structure the market.
“There’s no national policy,” he remarked, noting that current government actions are primarily reactive and temporary fixes are introduced only after public outcry.
This ad hoc approach, he warned, fails to address the sector’s cyclical vulnerabilities and leaves both producers and consumers facing unpredictability.
Import of sugar
On July 4, the federal cabinet authorised the import of 500,000 tonnes to overcome production deficits and stabilise the domestic market, as sugar retail prices had risen nationally.
Next, the Trading Corporation of Pakistan bid on July 10 to import 300,000 tonnes of sugar through Karachi and Gwadar ports. Despite these measures, retail prices rose to an alarming Rs200 per kg in numerous cities. Policy efficacy and timing are questioned when the market ignores government import decisions.
Even with duty and tax exemptions, imported sugar at Karachi port costs between Rs155 and Rs160 per kilogram, according to a Ministry of Commerce official. Retail rates of imported sugar in central Punjab are expected to be around Rs165 per kg, with transportation expenses contributing to higher prices in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other regions.
Duty-free clearance awaits IMF approval. The fiscal terms could drastically affect landing prices, thus officials believe this endorsement determines the ultimate cost structure.
Granularity is another issue. Pakistani consumers prefer coarse, thick-grain sugar; however, global suppliers typically provide finer varieties. This shows that the government might not be able to meet the import quota.
Industry insiders say brokers and a few mill owners, aware of the high cost of imported sugar, have continued speculative trading, weakening the possibility of imports stabilising prices.
The government approved 150,000 tonnes of sugar exports in June 2024, provided that retail prices remained constant. By March 2025, sugar exports had reached 757,779 tonnes, exceeding the target. Officials approved exports based on unrealistic surplus production predictions, worsening the sugar crisis.
A growing policy divide between Islamabad and the provinces has also hindered the development of the sugar sector. Punjab and Sindh defer to market forces to control pricing, unlike the federal government, which promotes regulatory measures due to political sensitivity.
However, a lack of unified control has allowed unfettered speculation to occur. A Ministry of Industry senior official called the situation “deeply troubling”, noting that provincial disengagement has allowed brokers to manipulate the market easily.
Moreover, two key factors contribute to market instability. Firstly, large millers often sell significant quantities of sugar to brokers and investors under informal agreements, keeping the product in storage for months. This arrangement allows millers to make quick returns, while speculators release stock at strategically timed intervals to maximise profits, often at the expense of price stability.
The involvement of brokers who also own sugar mills raises concerns. These vertically integrated operations blur the lines between production and speculation, allowing mill owners to control stock movement and manipulate market behaviour. These actions have led to accusations of price manipulation.

• Gohar says leadership will also take up suspension of 26 MPAs
LAHORE: The PTI top leadership arrived in Lahore on Saturday to devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on Aug 5 to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur describing the Lahore visit as the formal launch of the movement.
Before their departure, the party leaders held a meeting in Islamabad to discuss several issues, including the potential disqualification of the party’s Punjab Assembly lawmakers who had been suspended by the speaker.
In the evening, a caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar reached Lahore via G.T. Road. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign ahead of the two-year anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment on Aug 5.
 






PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s parliamentarians were going to Lahore for a meeting and added they would discuss the issue of 26 MPAs, suspended by the Punjab Assembly speaker. “The Punjab government has been unleashing fascism for the past two years, and now it is time that common sense should prevail,” he stressed.
Though there were reports that the Punjab police could block PTI parliamentarians’ entry into Lahore, the leaders had said they would stage a sit-in at the blocked point. However, the parliamentarians, led by CM Gandapur, made a smooth entry and camped at a farmhouse in Raiwind, Lahore.
The police, however, did raid party leaders and workers’ homes throughout the day and even went to the Shahdra Morr – Lahore’s entry point on G.T. Road – and took into custody five leaders, including Yasir Gillani from among those gathered to welcome the PTI caravan.
At a late-night party meeting in Raiwand, CM Gandapur told parliamentarians that they had reached the ‘political hub of the country’ to launch their protest campaign. “Any campaign launched from Lahore earns success and this too will be successful across the country,” he asserted.
Asserting that party leader Imran Khan is in jail for no valid reason, CM Gandapur advised party leaders to move forward through consultations and plans in respective jurisdictions to step up the protest campaign. “All the provinces should prepare their protest plans and implement them in line with their local issues and take the protest campaign to its peak by Aug 5,” he asserted.
He said the establishment had been ruling the country for decades and imposed multiple martial laws as part of different experiments, destroying the country. “The establishment this time has imposed a new kind of martial law, which is not official, but wielding every kind of power and pressure,” he observed and added that it destroyed the country but the perpetrators were not even showing any remorse.
At the meeting, Mr Bhachar said Punjab could not warmly welcome CM Gandapur because a “fascist government” was ruling Punjab that even lacked parliamentary as well as social norms. Mr Bhachar said the party’s 11 MPAs were suspended after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came to the assembly and her second visit led to the suspension of 26 members. “This clearly shows the level of fear the Punjab government is facing from PTI’s 107 tigers in the Punjab Assembly,” he asserted.
“Though the PTI leaders and workers are facing thousands of FIRs, the party is all set to launch a massive protest campaign aimed at the release of Imran Khan, his wife and all political leaders,” he added.
While the PTI parliamentarians have camped in Lahore, the party’s Punjab chapter, led by Aliya Hamza Malik, had already mobilised party workers across the province and assigned duties to step up the protest campaign and take to its pinnacle on August 5.
Before leaving for Lahore, the party’s interim chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said that the party had already sent a letter to the provincial government stating that it would hold a meeting in Lahore. However, he made it clear that the party was not planning to hold any rally or public meeting in the provincial capital.

The KPCIP, funded jointly by the Asian De­­velopment Bank (ADB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the KP government, is aimed at improving urban infrastructure and municipal services in key cities, including Peshawar, Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan and Mingora. 
Concerns regarding serious procurement violations, non-compliance with engineering and tax laws, and suspected corruption were formally brought to the PAC chairman by some members of the provincial assembly, including Sajjad Ullah of JUI-F, Taj Muhammad, Muhammad Riaz and Munir Hussain Lughmani (independents), and Muhammad Arif of the ruling PTI.
According to a formal complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the joint venture awarded multiple contracts under the KPCIP — comprising Zahir Khan and Brothers and Turkish firm T.T. Sh-Insaat LLC — was allegedly not registered with the FBR, KP Revenue Authority, or Pakistan Engineering Council at the time of bidding. 

Payments allegedly made despite negligible on-ground work

The complaint alleges that not only was the awarding of contracts unlawful, but undue financial favour was extended to the firm, resulting in the disbursement of Rs32bn, despite minimal on-ground physical progress. 
The complainants suggest that false progress certifications, weak oversight, and collusion among consultants and project staff may have enabled the payments.
Taking notice of the allegations, the PAC chairman and KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati has convened a special meeting on July 17.
‘Replies to all allegations’
Kashif Jan, Project Director of Zahir Khan and Brothers, while speaking to Dawn said that he was aware of the allegations made by the MPAs.
“We have been preparing a detailed presentation, for the PAC, in which there will be replies and clarifications to all the allegations. It is not correct that Turkish firm T.T.Sh-Insaat LLC is not registered or contract has been awarded against the rules. 
“Moreover, we have been working transparently and have ensured quality of work in all projects. Zahir Khan and Brothers is a well-reputed firm and we never compromise on quality,” he said. 
Replying to a question, Mr Jan hoped that the PAC will reject the allegations as he has all the relevant documentation.

Speaking to the media in Lahore, Syed Asif Ahmed, General Manager Marketing Division at MG Motors, welcomed the policy as a step in the right direction but criticised the local hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) market for remaining largely unaffordable and inaccessible to the average consumer.
“HEVs in Pakistan have become a luxury item for a niche market,” he said. “Despite policy support, the real benefits have not trickled down to car buyers.”
Mr Ahmed noted that the most expensive hybrid-electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) in the country — a seven-seater — carries an ex-factory price tag of Rs16 million, while five-seater variants are priced between Rs9.6m and Rs12m.

Plug-in hybrids better suited for urban Pakistan, says auto executive

“The industry must seriously consider affordability,” he stressed, adding that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a better alternative for urban mobility, offering practical electric range alongside hybrid versatility.
The NEV Policy, unveiled by the Ministry of Industries, introduces official classifications for electric vehicles (EVs), PHEVs, and hydrogen-powered vehicles as “New Energy Vehicles”, aligning Pakistan’s regulatory framework with global standards.
Mr Ahmed also criticised earlier tax incentives that allowed traditional hybrids to be classified as NEVs, primarily benefiting established automotive players. “Unfortunately, these subsidies neither served the environment nor the public. They simply padded profits for principal companies and their local partners.”
In contrast, he said, PHEVs offer a meaningful solution: pure electric driving for short urban commutes and hybrid flexibility for longer journeys — addressing the range anxiety often associated with EVs.
He pointed out that affordability remains a major hurdle. Globally, hybrids become financially viable when priced within 10pc of an equivalent petrol vehicle. In Pakistan, however, the price gap is much wider — averaging 45pc.
“For example, a C-segment SUV hybrid can cost up to Rs12m, while its petrol counterpart is priced around Rs8m — a difference of Rs4m,” he said.
While the NEV policy outlines a progressive roadmap, industry implementation remains critical. With more PHEV models expected to enter the market, the key question is whether automakers will pass on incentives to consumers — or repeat the hybrid-era model of high margins and minimal environmental benefit.
“The potential is enormous,” Ahmed concluded. “But only if we prioritise real consumer value and environmental impact over short-term profits.”

Myanmar has been mired in civil conflict since a military coup in 2021, with the junta battling a coalition of ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy resistance forces.
Saturday’s attack by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) targeted a military base in Kayin state at around 3pm local time, Thailand’s military said in a statement.
One hundred Myanmar soldiers and 467 civilians had crossed into Thailand on Saturday, where Thai military and police disarmed them and provided treatment and humanitarian aid, officials said.

Three kids among 22 civilians killed in monastery bombing

Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed there had been fighting near the border and said that joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the army.
“Some (Myanmar troops) defe­c­ted to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he said.
Myanmar’s civil war has caused huge waves of population displacement, with 81,000 refugees or asylum-seekers from the country currently living in Thailand, according to United Nations figures.
Strike on Buddhist monastery
More than 20 civilians, including children, were killed after an  air strike on a monastery in central Myanmar, an anti-junta fighter and a resident said on Saturday.
Myanmar has been consumed by civil war since the military ousted a democratic government in 2021, and central Sagaing region has been particularly hard-hit, with the junta pummelling villages with air strikes targeting armed groups.
The most recent occurred around 1am on Friday in Lin Ta Lu village when “the monastery hall where internally displaced people were staying” was hit with an air strike, said an anti-junta fighter, requesting anonymity.
He said that 22 people were killed, including three children, while two were wounded and remained in critical condition at the hospital.
“They had thought it was safe to stay at a Buddhist monastery,” the anti-junta fighter said. “But they were bombed anyway.”
Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.

GILGIT: The climbing season on K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II, has been thrown into disarray, as climate change, unpredictable weather and scant snowfall combine to create perilous conditions for foreign mountaineers.
Dozens of international expeditions are currently stranded at the base camps of the Karakoram giants, anxiously awaiting a safe window to attempt their summits.
Polish mountaineer Waldemar Kow­ale­wski on Friday suffered a leg fracture in an avalanche incident.
A source at base camp said Kowalewski is in a stable condition in a tent at 6,500m, attended by a colleague. A rescue helicopter has been requested from the army.
Traditionally, the main climbing season for these peaks stretches from late June to mid-August. But this year, tour operators say, the risks are unusually high.
“This year, weather at the peaks are not normal,” Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator with five foreign expedition groups waiting at base camps, told Dawn.
“Less snowfall was received in winter, and there are risks of rockfall and snow avalanches.”
Sakhawat Hussain, another tour operator, confirmed that progress on the 8,000-metre peaks has been delayed.
“Even ropes have not been fixed at K2, owing to unstable conditions,” he said, adding that the lack of snow has contributed to the danger.
“There are threats of rockfall at K2 and other eight-thousander peaks this year.”
Experts believe shifting weather patterns, driven by climate change, have upended the climbing season.
Low winter snowfall, followed by intense heat, means snow melts rapidly rather than consolidating into stable ice.

Once struggling on the geo-economic front, Islamabad has found renewed space in the geopolitical theatre, not just as a reactive player, but as one redefining its regional and global bearings.
The conflict, while perilous, proved to be an inadvertent diplomatic windfall for Pakistan. New Delhi’s narrative on terrorism, long used to isolate Islamabad, now appears increasingly unconvincing, especially in the absence of credible evidence following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan’s measured yet forceful military response surprised many observers and signalled a new strategic confidence. At the same time, the quiet revival of security ties with Washington added another layer to Islamabad’s growing diplomatic leverage.
Amid this recalibration, several factors stand out. China remains Pakistan’s foremost strategic partner, followed closely by Turkiye. Equally critical are the country’s untapped mineral reserves, now drawing renewed international attention. Afghanistan’s evolving landscape and Pakistan’s counterterrorism gains have further enhanced its profile in regional security conversations. Pakistan’s diplomacy during the Iran-Israel conflict also added to its strengths.
These shifts are set within a rapidly transforming geopolitical environment that spans the Middle East, South Asia, and the Caucasus. Islamabad’s diplomatic overtures are now reaching deeper into Central Asia and even into South Asia’s periphery, particularly Bangladesh. With growing disenchantment toward India and Russia’s increasingly transactional regional posture, Pakistan finds itself in a position to cultivate new alliances, provided it can maintain strategic coherence.

The current geopolitical environment is shifting in Pakistan’s favour.

Yet, this emerging external opportunity is contingent on internal consolidation. To sustain its newfound geopolitical relevance, Pakistan must stabilise its domestic front economically, politically, and institutionally. Without internal strength, diplomatic gains risk becoming transient. Pakistan has come to the critical realisation that sustaining recent strategic and diplomatic gains requires a more effective and evolved counterterrorism strategy. This urgency was underscored last week when the military leadership emphasised the need for “decisive and holistic actions at all levels” against all shades of terrorist groups.
Currently, Pakistan is engaged in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in Balochistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border regions adjoining Afghanistan — efforts that international actors have acknowledged. However, what continues to be a point of vulnerability, and what India persistently exploits, is the lingering presence of banned groups that were once active in India-administered Kashmir, particularly Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). In recent years, Pakistan has taken concrete steps to dismantle these networks, mainly in response to FATF requirements and sustained diplomatic pressure, especially from Washington and European capitals.
Despite these measures, India continues to assert that elements of these groups remain active within Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. It has effectively used this narrative to shape international opinion, particularly in Western policy circles, and has shown little indication of abandoning this diplomatic tool. However, it is increasingly evident that sustaining such a posture requires not only rhetoric but also viable alternatives. If India’s narrative begins to lose traction without credible evidence or renewed justification, it may be compelled to recalibrate its approach, potentially opening space for dialogue on more equal terms.
The latest reports submitted by India and Pakistan to FATF reveal contrasting approaches toward addressing terrorism financing. While Pakistan’s submission reflects a structured and institutionally grounded effort, India’s input appears more selective and strategically framed to serve its ongoing narrative.
India’s contributions are included in sections related to in-kind methods, the misuse of e-commerce platforms, and the use of online payment services and VPNs to fund lone-actor terrorism. India provided two case studies; first, about an attempted attack on April 3, 2022, at the Gorakhnath Temple, and second, the February 2019 suicide bombing of an Indian security convoy, which resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers. Notably, the FATF report did not reference the Pahalgam incident, nor did it express any concern about Pakistan’s compliance status.
In the case studies presented by India, the sources of the findings are not transparently identified. In contrast, Pakistan’s case studies, focusing on the TTP and IS-K, detail how these groups exploit informal banking systems and engage in kidnapping-for-ransom to generate funds. Cruc­i­a­l­ly, Pakistan’s submissions cite the National Cou­nter Terrorism Authority as the source of the intelligence, lending greater credibility to its inputs.
The contrast between the two approaches is telling. While India continues to weaponise narratives for diplomatic leverage, Pakistan is slowly repositioning itself through institutional credibility and regulatory compliance. In a shifting geopolitical landscape, such measured engagement is likely to yield more sustainable dividends.
Indian media outlets have misrepresented FATF’s findings, selectively quoting from the latest report to falsely suggest that Pakistan is not in compliance. FATF has neither issued any warning against Pakistan nor expressed dissatisfaction with its current level of compliance. On the contrary, Pakistan’s counterterrorism financing efforts have been acknowledged and appreciated by FATF member states.
Interestingly, as India’s counterterrorism narrative loses its international traction, Pakistan appears to be adopting a similar approach, attributing almost every act of terrorism on its soil to Indian involvement. Rather than playing to India’s rhetorical framework, Pakistan would be better served by charting its own strategic course. The current geopolitical environment is shifting in Pakistan’s favour. To fully capitalise on this, Pakistan must remain focused on dismantling terrorism and insurgency through sustained, credible efforts. This, more than counter-narratives alone, will demonstrate a meaningful difference to the world.

To me, Zubeida was my senior, my colleague and my friend, and an incredible woman and human being. She brushed aside daunting personal and professional challenges to power ahead with everything that mattered to her and nothing mattered to her more than the education of Pakistanis. She was Dawn‘s first woman op-ed editor. She’d worked at the newspaper for over 30 years before being named to the position.
That was less a reflection of her ability and intellect and more on the patriarchal, male-dominated work culture we have had in the best of times and the best of places. Zubeida was very mindful of that and, on her elevation, bluntly said: this would not have happened in the past.
 
 

She inspired and contributed to the growth of dozens of journalists, women and men alike, and so many have written/talked about what she meant to them. One of her most remarkable achievements at the newspaper, where I was privileged enough to work alongside her, was the transformation of the op-ed pages which, despite her fast deteriorating eyesight and health, she single-mindedly pulled into the present from a distant past where they seemed trapped.

Zubeida was long associated with and espoused the causes of the marginalised, whether women or the poor or minorities.

Zubeida Mustafa had the guts to politely yet firmly inform a stable of former senior civil servants and ex-military officers who had weekly op-ed slots that their submissions would be assessed on merit alongside other contributors. The new op-ed editor introduced hugely talented writers, both men and women, with the latter being somewhat under-represented in the newspaper till then, and her pages acquired a new look, life, vibrancy and relevance. She also insisted on not waiting for days to write leaders and began, for the first time in the paper’s life, editorials on the day.
Her generation is often blamed, sometimes rightly, for discouraging youth in the name of favouring ‘experience’ but Zubeida placed her faith in young writers and editors on her team. Dawn‘s current op-ed editor Ayesha Azfar, who initially trained under the watchful eye of the paper’s legendary M.A. Majid Sahab, worked as Zubeida’s deputy and transitioned seamlessly into the role after her predecessor asked for retirement due to ill health.
It was in the tenure of Mrs Mustafa, as she was addressed by all Dawn editorial staff, that young Cyril Almeida was recruited on the team and was also given the Wednesday column slot vacated by the well-established and widely-read Ayaz Amir when he decided to run for parliament on a political party’s ticket. Those were huge shoes to fill for Cyril but Zubeida’s instinct stood her in good stead and the young columnist was soon to carve a niche for himself and developed his own large following.
 
 

This was a summary, albeit so brief that I worry if it does her justice at all, of her work as a team leader and editor. As a columnist, unlike so many of us who write more or less exclusively on politics pointlessly, she chose more substantial issues to address such as education. Like one of her correspondents who calls her a ‘literary friend’, Nasser Yousaf remarked in an email to me: Although no one could write English like her, she was a relentless advocate for education in the mother tongue.
Her volume of work on education, her passion, must be unprecedented in the country in terms of its quality too. She would talk with excitement and exuberance about a school in Karachi started by a woman in her garage for poor children and would talk long about how that was transforming lives. I know she supported every initiative for the provision of quality education in rural areas and, into her eighties, remained an intrepid traveller to interior Sindh to support and chronicle what Sadiqa Salahuddin and Naween Mangi (to name just two) are doing for girls’ education and development there.
After I left Pakistan, we continued to communicate via email. When I had the audacity to express positive thoughts about education in Pakistan, she shot back an email: “I felt puzzled when you wrote about education being taken up in earnest in Pakistan. Abbas, that is an impossible dream now. Who will teach? The teachers are as uneducated as the children they have to teach. What should we do then?” But despite her directness she also had a very big heart, as she added: “I continue to enjoy your columns nevertheless.” With nearly 26 million children out of school in her country, I can’t even begin to imagine her heartbreak.
Zubeida was long associated with and espoused the causes of the marginalised, whether women in a patriarchal society or the poor or the minorities. I can’t even begin to imagine how she must have suffered seeing a spate of ‘honour’ killings every year, particularly of young women exercising choice in marriage or hearing of a father killing a daughter for having a TikTok account or a father and family reportedly disowning a daughter for choosing a career in acting, so much so that her forlorn death nine months ago in her Karachi flat was discovered just this week. Nobody cared enough to inquire after her when she went incommunicado all those months ago. Only because she was a woman with her own will and mind.
But what more can a writer do but write? Zubeida Mustafa was a true legend and a fighter who battled impossible odds. It is beyond my intellect and ability to write a befitting tribute to her. She was a believer in the public healthcare system and breathed her last at SIUT, an institution she supported with unparalleled zeal. Her own last act, the gift of sight, a donation to two individuals, is the most eloquent tribute to her. Travel well, Zubeida. Thoughts are with your daughters Seemi and Huma you often told me about with such pride and your sister Dr Fatema Jawad who was by your side to the end.

After all, only the very credulous would have believed reports about the president resigning and being replaced by the army chief.
With things going the establishment’s way, what good reason could it have to suddenly tear down the civilian façade that it has built up so carefully? There seems to be no doubt in anyone’s mind about where the real power resides; even the country’s defence minister recently spoke glowingly about how well the hybrid system has been working. Why, then, would the establishment risk alienating one of its main partners by displacing its figurehead from the top constitutional office?
The answer is quite simple if one looks at the question from a different perspective. The government has panicked because there are good reasons for players in hybrid set-ups to fear conspiracies. Political scheming and machinations are, after all, a central feature of coalition governments and hybrid power-sharing arrangements, and when the balance of power between civilians and the military goes off kilter, things can unravel rather quickly.
The ‘reports’ may have been based on rumours, but they were backed up with just enough ‘facts’ to sow seeds of doubt in the minds of various stakeholders. So much so that they prompted PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui, a key advisor to the Sharifs, to come forth with an endorsement of President Asif Zardari. “He is performing excellently in his role as the constitutional head of state,” he said.
 
 

Then came Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. “For the first time, politicians, the government and the military establishment are on the same page, and that bothers certain individuals.”
This was followed by Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, the PPP-P secretary general, who noted that “Zardari is the duly elected president of this country and this system cannot function without him.”
This was followed by yet another round of assurances from the interior minister and even PM Shehbaz Sharif. The former accused “those involved in this narrative” of “collaboration with hostile agencies”, while the latter reportedly stated that “Field Marshal Asim Munir has never expressed any desire to become the president, nor is there any such plan in the offing.”
It is painful to see civilian leaders scrambling to assert their relevancy: not because the rumour carried real weight, but because it touched a nerve. Once elected office is reduced to theatre, useful only for maintaining appearances, it becomes a stage for managing perceptions rather than exercising power. Politicians quickly find that they have little left to offer but words. Mutual suspicion becomes a default setting, and the system grows increasingly brittle. And this, perhaps, is the real cost of ceding civilian supremacy.

• Notes investment in youth essential for Pakistan’s future success
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to achieving a complete economic turnaround through long-overdue reforms, structural changes and prioritising meritocracy.
Addressing a group of Pakistani students enrolled in leading global educational institutions and selected for the government’s internship initiative ‘Uraan Pakistan’, the prime minister said that when the current government took office in 2023, Pakistan was facing a serious threat of default and its future was hanging in the balance.
 






“The majority believed Pakistan would default, while only a few were optimistic we would avoid disaster,” he said, adding that he held marathon discussions with the IMF managing director and gave firm assurances that Pakistan would not default and would stay committed to the Fund’s programme.
He said that the economy was in a bad shape at that time, with inflation reaching 38 per cent while the policy rate was hovering at 22pc. The PM, in his remarks broadcast on national TV channels, further said that they had a huge responsibility to work together with unity and sincerity to steer the country out of the crisis.
“The joint efforts have paid off as now the policy rate has dropped to below 11pc. The Uraan Pakistan programme has also taken off,” he added.
He also referred to reforms and digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), saying the government had removed corrupt officials without yielding to pressure or favouritism.
“To root out corruption from the FBR, I had a clear vision and took unprecedented decisions, ignoring the culture of favouritism,” he said.
The prime minister noted that earlier, the digitisation process in FBR had only existed on paper, as no practical steps were taken, blaming corrupt and shrewd elements for misleading the system.
Now, he said, digitisation was the hallmark of FBR, where work had been converted from paper-based to digital, with multiple initiatives including AI and faceless interaction.
As a result of the measures, revenue collection in one sector had jumped from Rs12bn to more than Rs50bn in one year, highlighting the extent of previous tax evasion, he maintained.
“We face a long and thorny journey, with mountain-like obstacles, but I assure the nation we will not shy away from fulfilling our responsibilities.”
Underscoring the importance of the country’s youth, he said their role is key to Pakistan’s success, and any investment in them is an investment in the nation.
Responding to students’ queries, the prime minister said that due to climate change, Pakistan had suffered significantly during the 2022 floods, with the economy facing $30 billion in losses, despite the country’s minimal contribution to the global greenhouse effect.
To another question, he said that Pakistan faced India’s uncalled aggression against the backdrop of the Pahalgam incident in May. “I proposed an impartial international investigation, but India never responded,” he said.
He claimed that as a result of Indian aggression, 55 Pakistanis were killed. In self-defence, Pakistan shot down six Indian aircraft. “On May 9 and 10, following India’s attack, Pakistan responded with full might and taught the enemy a lesson,” he said.
The prime minister praised the armed forces for their professionalism and bravery, stating that Pakistan had won the conventional war. He reiterated that Pakistan’s nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and self-defence.

• Orders issued for immediate restoration of irrigation channels amid drought threat
GILGIT: Extremely high summer temperatures and erratic weather patterns continue to cause destruction in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a cloudburst-induced flood damaged 13 homes, agricultural land, crops, and other properties in Gilgit and Ghizer on Saturday.
The flood also blocked Naltar Highway, Gilgit-Ghizar road and other link roads.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Deputy Director Raja Zahooruddin Babar described the cloudburst as “unprecedented,” as such an event had never been recorded in these areas before.
He said cloudbursts have happened in GB before; however, the scale of the disaster this time was unprecedented.
The cloudburst resulted in a heavy downpour in several areas of Gilgit and Ghizer districts, resulting in flash floods. At least 13 homes were damaged by the deluge along with farmlands, crops, water and irrigation channels and other properties in Shiroot and Shakyot areas of Gilgit.
A flash flood and landslides at Bargo Pari area in Gilgit damaged a car, two motorcycles and a tractor. Falling rocks blocked the Gilgit-Ghizer Road, which disrupted traffic for many hours.
Mr Babar of GBDMA stated that the road was later cleared and reopened for traffic. The authority is assessing damages in the area. No loss of human life or injury was recorded, he said. He added the cloudburst-induced flood also damaged farmlands and infrastructure in Biarchi and Gulapur areas of Ghizer. He said the authority was working to restore link roads in the area.
The Naltar expressway has been blocked at 10 locations from Nomaal to Naltar Valley.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain, along with Nagar Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan and other officials, visited the affected sites in Nagar district, including Hamari Tokorkot and Supultar nullahs.
Earlier on Thursday, floods damaged 20 homes and crops in Babusar area of Chilas.
On Friday, light rainfall across GB brought down the temperature.
Recovery efforts
This year, record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
The GBDMA DG has issued directives to expedite the restoration of irrigation channels damaged by recent floods.
The extensive damage to farmlands and crops and the unavailability of water posed a risk of drought in the region.
Mr Hussain told Dawn that GBDMA is prepared to protect vulnerable communities and dozens of households have been relocated to safer places.
The affected families in Nagar, Gilgit, Ghizer and Diamer have been provided with food and other items.

The DPP was originally established under the International Plant Protection Convention, while AQD was tasked with preventing the entry of foreign animal diseases. Their integration into NAFSA is intended to create a modern, scientific, and data-driven body capable of ensuring compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements while also facilitating access to quality agricultural inputs to promote surplus production and national food security.
A DPP official said NAFSA reflects the ministry’s broader vision of promoting sustainable agricultural exports and enhancing Pakistan’s credibility as a reliable source of plant and animal products. The authority will replace outdated structures with a technology-driven institutional framework aligned with international best practices.
While the DPP has shown relatively better performance in plant protection, AQD faced persistent staffing constraints that hampered its efficiency. However, sources familiar with the development noted uncertainty regarding NAFSA’s future role in locust control—a responsibility previously managed by the DPP.

NAFSA to align Pakistan with global food safety and phytosanitary standards

According to a press release issued by the ministry on Saturday, the reforms are aimed at improving Pakistan’s compliance with international trade requirements and boosting its export competitiveness. On the directives of Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, the DPP has undertaken a series of transformative, corrective, and disciplinary measures over the past six months to strengthen regulatory systems and operational efficiency.
Import regulations
As part of the broader institutional overhaul, the DPP has initiated several strategic projects, including the upgrading of testing laboratories and the establishment of modern infrastructure.
One of the most significant reforms has been the revision of import regulations based on scientific assessments, leading to a substantial reduction in the use of Methyl Bromide (MB) — a pesticide often applied unnecessarily. This regulatory shift has resulted in cost savings of Rs30,000 to Rs40,000 per container, particularly benefiting imports of cotton, grains, pulses, and lentils.
The move has been welcomed by industry stakeholders as a major step toward rationalised pesticide use and environmental sustainability.
The ministry also revealed that a detailed internal audit — carried out under the minister’s instructions for stricter compliance and transparency— found that a company was importing Methyl Bromide from a suspicious source. A rigorous investigation followed, involving third-party verification and document cross-checking.
The company’s licence was promptly suspended for regulatory violations, and, in coordination with Pakistan Customs, four under-process shipments worth approximately $1 million were intercepted at the port before clearance.
These enforcement measures not only prevented the potential entry of hazardous substances but also reinforced the ministry’s zero-tolerance stance on malpractice. Disciplinary action has been initiated against officials found involved in misconduct.
The minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to structural reforms, stating that Pakistan’s agricultural and quarantine systems will be aligned with international benchmarks.
He stressed that no leniency will be shown to those who violate the law or compromise national interests.
The unearthing and disruption of this high-value scam, he said, underscores the ministry’s resolve to uphold transparency, fair competition, and institutional integrity.

A similar number of infections are also believed to have been prevented, while billions of euros have been generated in estimated economic benefit.
The Gavi vaccine alliance, which backed the study, said it collaborated with researchers at Burnet Institute in Australia to provide the world’s first look at the historical impact of emergency immunisation efforts on public health and global health security.
“For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases,” Gavi chief Sania Nishtar said in a statement. “This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective countermeasure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks.”
The study, published this week in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health, examined 210 outbreaks of five infectious diseases — cholera, Ebola, measles, meningitis and yellow fever — in 49 lower-income countries between 2000 and 2023.
Vaccine roll-outs in these settings had a dramatic impact, with the study showing they reduced both the number of infections and deaths by almost 60pc across the five diseases. For some of the diseases the effect was far more dramatic.
Vaccination was shown to decrease deaths during yellow fever outbreaks by a full 99pc, and 76pc for Ebola.
At the same time, emergency vaccination significantly reduced the threat of outbreaks expanding.
It also estimated that the immunisation efforts carried out during the 210 outbreaks generated nearly $32bn in economic benefits just from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.
That amount was however likely to be a significant underestimate of overall savings, it said, pointing out that it did not take into account outbreak response costs or the social and macro-economic impacts of disruptions created by large outbreaks.
The massive Ebola outbreak that hit West Africa in 2014, before the existence of approved vaccines, for instance saw cases pop up worldwide and is estimated to have cost the West African countries alone more than $53bn.

Over the past year, multiple attacks have been reported across KP in which remotely operated quadcopters were used to drop explosives. The military has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for these attacks.
In Bannu, the quadcopter dropped ammunition at the Miryan police station building, an official told Dawn.
“The munition fell in the compound of the pol­i­­ce station and did not cau­se any damage,” he claimed.
He said policemen depl­oyed at the station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The cops opened fire at the unmanned quadcopter but failed to hit it due to its high altitude.
It was the fifth quadcopter attack on the same police station in the Miry­­an area during the last month, showing a surge in the use of advanced quadcopter technology by terrorists.
A search operation was launched to arrest the at­­t­ackers and security was be­­efed up across the district.
Attack repulsed
In Lakki Marwat, cops repelled a midnight attack on a police station in the Serai Gambila town.
A police official said around a dozen armed men attacked the police station with light and heavy weapons late Friday night in a bid to take over the building.
“It was a multi-pronged attack as assailants circled the police station and tried to strengthen their position before launching the attack,” he added.
“After an intense exch­ange of fire, the assailants managed to flee the pla­ce,” he claimed, adding that all policemen deployed at the police station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The Serai Gambila poli­­ce station is located along the Peshawar-Karachi High­way near Gambila river.
It has been attacked several times in the past.
KP Inspector General of Poli­­ce Zulfiqar Hameed and Bannu Regional Police Of­­ficer Sajjad Khan lauded cops for “bravely” repulsing the attack and thwarting the terrorists’ plan to breach the police station building.

The indirect talks over a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire are nonetheless expected to continue, the sources told Reuters.
According to AFP, which cited two Pales­tinian sour­ces with knowledge of the discussions, indirect talks are being held up by Israel’s proposals to keep troops in the territory.
Israel has meanwhile kept up its strikes on Gaza and the territory’s civil defence agency said more than 20 people were killed on Saturday, including in an air strike on an area sheltering the displaced.
“We all generally came here because we were told it was a safe area,” Bassam Hamdan told AFP after the overnight attack in an area of Gaza City. “While we were sleeping, there was an explosion… where two boys, a girl and their mother were staying. We found them torn to pieces, their remains scattered,” he added.
Medics said 17 people trying to get food aid were killed on Saturday when Israeli troops opened fire, the latest mass shooting around a US-backed aid distribution system that the UN says has resulted in 800 people killed in six weeks.
Witnesses who spoke to Reuters described people being shot in the head and torso. The news agency reported seeing several bodies of victims wrapped in white shrouds as family members wept at Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military claimed its troops had fired warning shots, but that its review of the incident had found no evidence of anyone hurt by its soldiers’ fire.
Seven UN agencies warned in a joint statement on Saturday that if fuel runs out in Gaza, it would be “an unbearable new burden on a population teetering on the edge of starvation”.
Delegations from Israel and Hamas have been in Qatar for a week in a renewed push for an agreement which envisages a phased release of hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals and discussions on ending the war.
US President Donald Trump, who hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past week, had said he hoped for a deal soon. But the Israeli and Palestinian sources described longstanding issues that remain unresolved.
A Palestinian source said that Hamas had rejected withdrawal maps which Israel had proposed that would leave around 40 per cent of Gaza under Israeli control, including all of the southern area of Rafah and further territories in northern and eastern Gaza.
Two Israeli sources said Hamas wanted Israel to retreat to lines it held in a previous ceasefire before it renewed its offensive in March.
The Palestinian source said matters regarding aid and guarantees on an end to the war were also presenting a challenge. The crisis could be resolved with more US intervention, the source said.
Hamas has long demanded an agreement to end the war before it would free remaining hostages; Israel has insisted it would end the fighting only when all prisoners are released and Hamas is dismantled as a fighting force and administration in Gaza.
Shooting
Saturday’s reported mass shooting near an aid distribution point in Rafah was the latest in a series of such incidents that the United Nations rights office said on Friday had seen at least 798 people killed trying to get food in six weeks.
“We were sitting there, and suddenly there was shooting towards us. For five minutes we were trapped under fire. The shooting was targeted. It was not random. Some people were shot in the head, some in the torso, one guy next to me was shot directly in the heart,” eyewitness Mahmoud Makram told Reuters. “There is no mercy there, no mercy. People go because they are hungry, but they die and come back in body bags.”
After partially lifting a total blockade of all goods into Gaza in late May, Israel launched a new aid distribution system, relying on a group backed by the United States to distribute food under the protection of Israeli troops.
The United Nations has rejected the system as inherently dangerous and a violation of humanitarian neutrality principles. Israel says it is necessary to keep “militants” from diverting aid.
Since Oct 7, 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, displaced almost the entire population of more than two million people, sparked a humanitarian crisis and left much of the territory in ruins.

They largely appeared in Europe and the United States. But most of these parties were ‘cadre parties’ — parties formed by economic elites. They invested more in strengthening their relations with a limited electorate who too belonged to elite groups. The working classes were not allowed to vote, and nor were women and non-white segments of the population. 
As industrialisation intensified, the number of people belonging to the working classes expanded. This created tensions between the new ‘bourgeoisie’ (middle/upper-middle classes) and the working classes. Some sections of the bourgeoisie, though, viewed the increasing size of the working classes as potential votes that could shape more ‘democratic’ means to address working class grievances. Thus was born the concept of the ‘mass party.’ 
Mass parties were mostly the creation of the ‘progressive’ bourgeoisie. These parties often organised themselves at the grassroots level and worked towards legislating economic and social reforms. The ‘social democratic’ parties in Europe, the Labour Party in the UK and the post-1930s’ Democratic Party in the US, all have roots in early mass parties.
Many cadre parties too began to transform themselves along similar lines — even though they promised economic prosperity through unregulated capitalism and a social order based on conservative values. The mass party model was also adopted by large fascist movements, but they weren’t interested in democracy. The mass fascist parties believed that societies should be directed by a ‘special’ set of people. They perceived the people of a particular nation or race as a single organic national entity. 

The evolution of modern political parties, from groups created to protect the interests of the elite into structures that precipitated the rise of populism, has often led to chaotic results and experimentation — especially in Pakistan

The All India Muslim League (AIML), which was formed in 1906, first emerged as a cadre party, or the party of a small Muslim elite. By the late 1930s, however, it began being transformed into a mass party to attract the votes of a much larger chunk of India’s Muslims. 
From the 1950s onwards, as the electorate expanded, most of the electorate now wanted to sustain their middle class status and the working class wanted to aspire to reach that status. In other words, they began to harbour similar interests. 
In the West, for example, the middle class strengthened and, consequently, more and more members from the working classes began to aspire to achieve middle class status. Gradually, politics of class conflict started to recede. So, in a bid to attract an even wider base of voters, mass parties began to transform into ‘big tent’ parties or ‘catch-all parties.’ 
Big tent parties adopt a wide range of positions. They seek a diverse coalition of supporters. For example, ‘progressive’ big tent parties have various wings representing different (and often opposing) expressions of leftist politics — from moderate to more extreme. The same is the case with conservative big tent parties that have within them wings representing moderate-right to far-right positions. Nevertheless, all big tent parties largely aim to retain an overall moderate/centrist disposition. 
In Pakistan, one of the first major big tent parties was the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Formed in 1967 as a progressive outfit, it had socialists, social democrats and Marxists, as well as ‘Islamic socialists’, ‘progressive’ ulema and landed elites within it. 
In the erstwhile West Pakistan, the PPP’s main opponents were cadre parties such as the Jamaat-i-Islami, a party headed by an elite group of Islamists, and various Muslim League factions that had lost the AIML’s mass party appeal. Then there were mass parties such as the National Awami Party, headed by progressive Pakhtun and Baloch bourgeoisie. 
Big tent parties dominated politics in many developed and developing democracies till the 1990s. In Pakistan, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) emerged as a major conservative big tent party. It co-opted industrialists, traders, Islamists and conservative bourgeoise/ petty bourgeoisie. But it increasingly aimed for a centre-right trajectory. 
However, in the late 2000s, both the PML-N and the PPP transformed into cartel parties. According to the American political scientist Richard S. Katz, most mass parties that became big tent parties eventually transformed into cartel parties. By this he meant that cooperation between competing big tent parties increased, but this was mostly done to block the emergence of new parties. 
But cartel parties began to lose ground due to complacency. New ‘anti-elitist’ parties (especially from the right) sprang up. These were mostly populist parties. In some cases, the populist branches of existing big tent outfits dislodged the more moderate wings of the parties. The Republican Party in the US is an example.



 
So, are populist parties symbolising the revival of mass parties? No. Mass parties had well-defined hierarchical structures and focused on grassroots organisation. They aimed to engage ordinary citizens in the political process and adhered to a coherent ideology. The same is the case with big tent parties, even though they are more pragmatic and ideologically flexible. Populist parties, on the other hand, are mostly led by ‘charismatic’ leaders who claim to embody ‘the will of the people.’ An anti-pluralistic us-versus-them dichotomy is central to their rhetoric. Populist parties seek broad support, but their organisational structures are loose, and they rely more on mobilising followers through performative rallies. In Pakistan, Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is an example.
Also, most populist parties fail to break out of their movement mode and are vulnerable to a burnout. For example, even as president, Donald Trump’s politics continues to be more about his ‘Make America Great Again’ (Maga) movement. His economic and social programmes are largely based on the narrow us-versus-them nature of the movement. 
For over a decade, political scholars have been lamenting the crisis democracy has been plunged into. This is also a crisis of big tent parties. Some scholars ascribe the emergence of the ‘destructive’ and iconoclastic populist parties to the cartel-isation of big tent outfits. But Pakistan offers an interesting resolution to this. 
The PML-N and the PPP became cartel parties. This was seen as an opportunity by the military establishment (ME) to facilitate the rise of a ‘third force’ because, apparently, the bourgeoisie had begun to feel ‘alienated’ by the ‘corrupt’ PPP and PML-N. The third force was the populist PTI and the moulding of a hybrid system, in which the ME’s political role was to come out in the open. This experiment was a disaster because populist parties are badly organised, lack strong structures, and remain in movement mode. According to the political commentator Najam Sethi, instead of a proper party, PTI became a ‘fan club.’
In 2022, after PTI’s Khan was constitutionally dismissed as PM, the ME picked up the pieces by plugging the more organised and experienced PML-N and the PPP in a more thought-out version of the hybrid system. This is Pakistan’s way of addressing the crisis that politics and big tent parties are facing in democracies. If the ploy succeeds, then this version of the hybrid system will continue to be strengthened through constitutional means.

“On the instructions of (PML-N President) Nawaz Sharif and (Punjab Chief Minister) Mar­­yam Nawaz, a budget of Rs35bn has been allocated for my constituency NA-120,” said Mr Sadiq while addressing party workers at his constituency here on Saturday.
“Currently, development work worth Rs19bn is underway in my constituency. There were no roads or sewerage systems here before. Now sewerage will be installed, clean drinking water available, and roads built. No street in any area will be left behind, I assure. All streets will be paved,” he said while praising Maryam Nawaz.
“The Maryam administration has allocated Rs70bn development budget for Lahore or all constituencies of the city in the first phase. In the second phase, a sum of another Rs70bn will be spent,” a senior official of the Punjab government disclosed while talking to Dawn on Saturday.

Federal ministers Tarar and Aleem also using their good offices to secure funds from CM, party source says

“Besides Mr Sadiq, federal minister Atta Tarar (who won from NA-127), Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) head and federal minister Aleem Khan (who secured NA-117), PML-N financers Khokhar brothers — Saiful Maluk (also PML-N Lahore president) and Afzal Khokhar who bagged NA-126 and NA-125 seats, respectively, — are using their good offices to secure maximum funds from the CM for their constituencies,” a party source said. 
Mr Tarar, who won the seat against PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and PTI’s Zaheer Abbas Khokhar, is keen to contest future elections from the same NA-127 constituency, which previously belonged to late Pervaiz Malik, former PML-N Lahore president.
The ruling party MNAs are not only seeking funds from the provincial government but also from the Shehbaz Sharif administration.
When the PML-N lawmakers met the prime minister and asked for more funds for their constituencies, the latter advised them to increase interaction with their constituents and resolve their problems on a priority basis.
While Nawaz, Shehbaz, Maryam and Hamza, all from the Sharif family, contested the 2024 elections from Lahore, the source said, this time around neither Nawaz nor Hamza was pressing the Punjab government for spending on their constituencies, considering the allocation of an equal amount of uplift fund to all Lahore constituencies happens to be pain in the neck of the provincial administration.

It is the sixth Grand Slam singles title for Swiatek, 24, and her first tournament victory since Roland Garros in 2024. She has never lost a Grand Slam final.
The lopsided 57-minute result was the first “double bagel” in a major final since Steffi Graff routed Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 to win the 1988 French Open. It was the first 6-0, 6-0 women’s final at Wimbledon since 1911.
 






“It seems super surreal,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. “First, I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks. You should be proud of the work you are doing, and I hope we will play more finals here.”
Anisimova, 23, was appearing in her first major final. She committed five double faults and finished with only eight winners and 28 unforced errors.
Swiatek never faced a break point to become Poland’s first Wimbledon singles champion. She converted six of nine break chances and finished with 10 winners and 11 unforced errors.
With Swiatek’s win on the grass courts of the All England Club, the former World No 1 has won Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces: four French Opens on clay (2020, 2022-24) and the US Open hardcourt in 2022.
“I didn’t even dream, for me it was way too far. I feel like I am already an experienced player after winning the Slams before, but I never expected this one,” Swiatek said. “This year I really, really enjoyed it and feel I improved my form here. It’s amazing and I’m going to enjoy this moment.”
Despite the disappointing finish, Anisimova’s performance in London, including a win over World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals, will vault her into the Top 10 for the first time on Monday.
“Congratulations Iga. Thank you to everyone who’s supported me,” Anisimova said at the trophy presentation.
“It’s been an incredible fortnight for me and even though I ran out of gas today and I wish I could have put in a better performance for you today, you guys still lifted me up, so thank you so much.”
It was the 100th career Grand Slam match win for Swiatek, who improved to 100-20 since making her main draw debut in 2019.
She is the eighth consecutive first-time women’s champion at Wimbledon since Serena Williams won her seventh title in 2016.</p><small>2025-07-12 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12220919e90860d.jpg?r=221127' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923742/wwii-memorial-shields-other-items-stolen-from-karachis-frere-hall' target='_blank'><strong>WWII memorial shields, other items stolen from Karachi’s Frere Hall</strong></a><br><p>World War II memorial shields and other high-value items were stolen from an office of the director general of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Parks Department in the city’s iconic Frere Hall, it emerged on Saturday.
The building, one of the most iconic in the metropolis, was completed in 1865 and a US-funded restoration project was completed last year.
A first information report (FIR), available with Dawn.com, was filed under Section 380 (theft in dwelling) of the Pakistan Penal Code by the deputy director of the KMC Parks Department at Artillery Maidan police station on July 7.
“The suspects have stolen a DVD player, one speaker, five World War II memorial shields and a cable of precious shield copper,” the FIR read.
It claimed that the items were stolen by unidentified burglars, who broke the windows and entered Frere Hall during the Ashura holidays.
The complainant said that the DG Parks office had been closed on July 4 at 10pm for the Ashura holidays. When the office re-opened on July 7 at around 9am, employees found that the office’s rear window was broken.
“During a search, we found that a DVD player, one speaker, five World War II memorials and one precious shield cable copper were stolen by unidentified person(s),” the complainant alleged.
Later, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that a suspect was identified in connection with the burglary and police were trying to bring him in for questioning.
“A contractor, under whose supervision the stolen items were kept in the room, has also been called for investigation,” he added.
DIG Raza said that the DG Parks has yet to provide further information, though the complainant stated that he would visit the police on Monday.
“Concerted efforts are underway to arrest the suspect and recover the antiques,” said the DIG, adding that the police are checking CCTV footage for possible identification of the burglars.
“Additionally, the local scrap market within Frere police jurisdiction has been checked and informants have been tasked accordingly,” DIG Raza added. “A breakthrough in the case is expected very soon.”
Robberies are very common in Karachi.
In May, a suspected thief was shot by security guards in the Keamari locale while trying to steal a pole-mounted transformer.
The Jackson police said that around five to six thieves attempted to steal the transformer at the Pak Shaheen Yard near Ziauddin Hospital. The PMT fell on the floor, which created a loud noise and drew attention.
The yard’s manager and guards came out, prompting the suspects to start shooting. The guards returned fire, after which one suspect was killed at the scene while another was injured. The other suspects managed to escape.</p><small>2025-07-12 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12181440c05eb6d.png?r=183916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923729/jui-f-chief-fazl-advises-change-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-administration' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‘change’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a “change” in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht­un­khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a “regime change” in the province.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has warned against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.
Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, “My advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.”
Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.
He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was “fake” and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.
 


Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, “The common citizen’s life is insecure today.
“If the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.”
Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, “We strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.”
Fazl said that the committee formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.
“From all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven’t given our representatives,” he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow’s grand tribal jirga.
“Is this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?” he asked.
The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government’s decisions, then he would have joined them. “Both the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,” Fazl said.
JUI-F senator says reservations with KP CM Gandapur
Later, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza said, “We have had reservations against KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.”
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, Murtaza said that he had personal reservations with Gandapur and his party did as well.
“The reason is his inappropriate behaviour and language; he is not a well-liked personality for us,” the senator said.
“However, we don’t want the government to fall.  So if PTI itself takes that decision that a certain individual will not continue and will be replaced by another, JUI-F would certainly welcome that decision,” Murtaza said.
He added that Gandapur being from Dera Ismail Khan, the same district Fazl hailed from, was not a a factor in the decision.
KP Governor Kundi says ex-Fata committee not about reversing merger
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not “about reversing the merger of Fata and the province”.
Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, “The committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a jirga was held.
“The provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.”</p><small>2025-07-12 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/122037484121f34.jpg?r=213440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923736/islamabad-court-halts-banning-of-5-more-youtube-channels' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court halts banning of 5 more YouTube channels</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Saturday suspended a lower court’s order to block 27 YouTube channels to the effect of five more channels, a day after a similar halt on channels of two journalists.
It emerged on Tuesday that an Islamabad court had ordered YouTube last month to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces. The sanctioned accounts were being run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas.
On Friday, an Islamabad district and sessions court admitted two revision petitions — submitted by journalists Matiuallah Jan and Asad Ali Toor — against the judicial magistrate’s order blocking 27 YouTube channels, suspending the ban for the two petitioners. Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the two revision appeals and ordered the suspension in a one-page written order for each petition.
Six more of those affected had appealed against the lower court’s order today. ADSJ Majoka heard the case and granted similar relief to the following five individuals: Makhdoom Shahabuddin, Orya Maqbool Jan, Abdul Qadir, Uzair Anwar and Umair Rafique.
The court adjourned proceedings on Habib Akram’s application till July 14 due to the unavailability of the petitioner. As per the short orders, seen by Dawn.com, the petitioners contended that they were not even given a prior notice and that the ban violated Article 10-A of the Constitution. The judge agreed that no notices were issued to the petitioners before the blocking order was passed and the point needed further consideration.
The ban order sparked criticism from various legal and digital rights groups.
On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the owners of these channels would face criminal action.
The Forum for Di­­gital Rights and Democracy (FDRD) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Wed­n­esday condemned the decision, calling it a “bla­­tant violation” of fundamental rig­hts and an assault on press freedom.
 
 

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also expressed concern over the ban, stating, “The wholesale blocking of entire channels — rather than addressing specific instances of unlawful or hateful speech in accordance with due process — conflates dissent with criminal activity.”
“The constitutional right to freedom of expression is fundamental not only for individual liberty but also for ensuring government accountability, fostering debate and enabling the public to access a diversity of viewpoints,” the HRCP said, urging “precise and proportionate” interventions against hate speech.
On March 20, Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.
In May, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lifted the ban on X after the platform was inaccessible to users for more than a year. The social media platform was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections, while the caretaker government was still in power.</p><small>2025-07-12 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/122005177a62f2e.jpg?r=200616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923735/javelin-aces-arshad-nadeem-neeraj-chopra-to-clash-in-poland-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>Javelin aces Arshad Nadeem, Neeraj Chopra to clash in Poland next month</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem and India’s Neeraj Chopra are set to lock horns next month at the Diamond League event in Silesia, Poland, in their first head-to-head contest since the Paris Olympics, it emerged on Saturday.
The match-up comes amid heightened political tensions between Pakistan and India, which have spilt over into the world of sports.
A press release from the Diamond League, issued on July 9, announced the athletes taking part in the upcoming competition in Poland, including Kenyan middle-distance runner Faith Kipyegon.
The contest between Nadeem and Chopra was described as “the first opportunity for revenge after the Paris Olympics”.
“The Pakistani’s form remains something of a mystery, as he rarely appears on the European circuit,” the press release read. “The exception he will make on August 16 results from his desire to face Chopra.”
The press release noted that Chopra threw 90 metres this spring, adding that he is “yearning for more”. Last week, Chopra headlined the ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ — billed as India’s inaugural world-class field competition — and walked away with another gold medal.
In May, Nadeem threw a massive 86.4m to win gold in the men’s javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea.
A day before an April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir, Chopra had announced that the world’s top throwers, including Nadeem, had been invited to the first Neeraj Chopra Classic. However, the attack in Kashmir prompted heavy criticism of Chopra’s decision to invite Nadeem.
Nadeem ultimately did not attend the event.</p><small>2025-07-12 15:35</small></div><hr>
