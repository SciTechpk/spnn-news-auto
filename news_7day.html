A fire erupted on Saturday night at Karachi’s Gul Plaza, which has so far claimed the lives of at least 23 people, with dozens still missing.
Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly today, the MQM leader maintained that it was “the right of the people of Karachi to question the Sindh government as well as the Centre over where exactly Karachi lies on their list of priorities”.
Sattar claimed that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah arrived at the site of the incident “22 hours” after the fire broke out. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also arrived late, he said.
“This shows how apathetic they are,” he added
Sattar paid tribute to the firefighter Furqan Ali, who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire.
“Someone will have to take responsibility and ask for forgiveness from the people for their inaction”.
“Three years of their mayorship […] they are building futsal and padel grounds,” Sattar said.
He held that Karachi remained “undercounted, underrepresented, and underfunded”. The MQM leader further said that the city lacked firefighting capability for its size.
He called on the government to “take ownership of Karachi” and further requested that the “there should be a consensus that this is a national tragedy”.
The MQM leader called for the creation of administrative units for better governance and strengthening local government systems.
“Such a huge burden can not be shouldered by a chief minister alone,” he said.
“These powers should instead be handed over to the mayor, town chairman, UC chairman”.
He recalled that MQM had also advocated for the inclusion of a clause aimed at strengthening local government bodies in the 28th Constitutional Amendment.
“Creating an administrative unit is not the division of geography; it is an administrative division, a division of justice and resources,” Sattar maintained.
Sattar urged people not to politicise the issue of local governments.
Shifting his attention back to the incident, the MQM leader said, “This fire was not only in Gul Plaza but in the hearts of the people of Karachi as well”.
“For the past 18 years, the government has been led by one party, which does not hold Karachi’s mandate but that of the rest of Sindh, so how are they allowed to dictate the fate of Karachi?” Sattar said.
“What kind of democracy is this?” he asked.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking during the session, echoed Sattar’s proposal, stating that it is “not humanly possible to manage Karachi in its present structure”.
“If we want to empower the people in a true sense, we will have to bring in the local government system,” Asif said.
He stressed that due to the 18th Amendment, all powers regarding administration had been assigned to the provincial government.
“If there is any local government, they do not have any powers,” he added.
The minister recalled that in the 28th Amendment, “we proposed that there should be a system for local government”.
“Despite consensus on developing a system for local government in the 18th Amendment, but as usual because of political wrangling but the clause was withdrawn,” he maintained.
“If we truly want to represent the people of Pakistan, then provide them representation in their own neighbourhoods,” the minister said.
He held that, “if local government systems are not strengthened, then the defence ministry, the navy and the aviation will be doing your work for you”.
He claimed that “local government elections were not even allowed to be held”.
He maintained that this was done so that the “power could not be transferred to the grass roots level”.
He went on to say, “This incident and the subsequent collapse of the fire brigade system are a clear signal that the country needs a system — across tehsils, neighbourhoods, and provinces — where people feel empowered and can hold their representatives accountable”.
PPP leader Shehla Raza objected to the claims made by Sattar, stating that, “it is not necessary for ministers to show up when such an incident happens”.
Rather, she maintained that it was more important to handle the situation.
“At 10:26pm, the incident was reported, and one fire vehicle from each Central Fire Station and the Saddar Fire Station was dispatched,” she said.
She continued: “Around 10:45pm, the first responders informed the chief fire officer of the scale of the fire, and that more fire tenders should be sent”.
“16 fire tenders, four snorkels, and two water browsers were sent,” she said.
She admitted that there was a delay due to traffic in the area.
“I am not defending anything, but such fires have been reported before in states like California as well,” she said.
Addressing the issue of local governments, Raza clarified: “There is an impression being made that there is no local government system in Sindh”.
“Sindh is the only province where local government systems are working,” she stressed.</p><small>2026-01-20 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/201411433ac713b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968027/pti-nominated-mwm-chief-raja-nasir-abbas-appointed-senate-opposition-leader-after-months-long-delay' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-nominated MWM chief Raja Nasir Abbas appointed Senate opposition leader after months-long delay</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was appointed as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday.
“In pursuance of sub-rule (3) of Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, the chairman Senate has been pleased to declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as leader of the opposition in the Senate, with immediate effect,” said a notification issued by the Senate Secretariat.







Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani also announced Abbas’ appointment as the opposition leader during Tuesday’s session in the House.
As the proceedings began, he said: “I want to give a ruling. Before proceeding further, I consider it necessary to place on record the legal and procedural background relating to the declaration of the leader of the opposition in the Senate.
“Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 mandates that the chairman Senate should declare as leader of the opposition the member who commands the support of the majority of the members in opposition.
“Following the disqualification of former senator Syed Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification dated August 5, 2025 and the consequential notification of the Senate Secretariat dated August 8, 2025, the office of the leader of the opposition stood vacated.
“The said notifications were challenged before the honourable Peshawar High Court, which issued restraining orders prohibiting further action in the matter. In view of the pendency of judicial proceedings, the matter remained under consideration of the Senate Secretariat for legal examination and procedural guidance, in accordance with the established parliamentary practice and constitutional discipline so as to ensure that no step was taken which might conflict with or render infructuous the proceedings before the honourable court.”
Gilani explained that the “earlier deferment [of the appointment] was therefore procedural, occasioned by institutional prudence, due deference to judicial authority and rule of law”.
He further stated: “There being no legal bar, I now proceed in accordance with Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 and hereby declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as the leader of the opposition in the Senate …”
At this point, Gilani was interrupted by the thumping of desks and slogans in favour of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, who nominated Abbas for the opposition leader’s post.
Meanwhile, Gilani continued: “… Having secured the support of 22 members out of 32 members on the opposition benches. The secretary is directed to issue a formal notification accordingly right now.”
He then requested parliamentary leaders in the House to “assist the opposition leader on his seat”, following which Abbas rose and changed his seat amid applause, shaking hands with several senators on his way.
Later, before giving the floor to Senator Abbas, Gilani congratulated him for becoming the opposition leader.
In his maiden address in the House as the opposition leader, Abbas credited Imran for “making me a senator”.
He asserted that he was “his (Imran) loyal companion, will never compromise on principles” and never violate his oath taken as a senator.
Abbas also expressed his commitment to making all-possible efforts and playing his role to ensure the security, betterment and national interest of the country.
He thanked treasury members for showing him respect and welcoming him. “It was a good gesture,” he said, adding that “we will try that this Senate play a role in addressing the difficulties of the people” and that legislation benefits the people.
Months-long delay
The opposition leader’s slot in the Senate had been lying vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of the then-opposition leader, PTI’s Shibli Faraz. At the same time, PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the opposition leader in the National Assembly (NA) back then, was also disqualified.
The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023, riots.
The PTI had then nominated in October last year Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot.
Abbas’ appointment today comes less than a week after Achakzai was appointed the opposition leader in the NA after a months-long delay.
On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today).
Zafar had also submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader.

The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
While the fire at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that rescue teams had not entered the building’s first floor and no bodies had been recovered overnight.
“Rescue teams have just entered Rimpa Plaza and the operation has just started,” said the senior police official.
He further stated that the total number of confirmed missing persons was 38, whose locations had been traced to Gul Plaza via their cell phones. The locations of the 37 other individuals could not be traced.
More than 60 people are reported missing.

 


Earlier, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who was present at the incident site overnight, said that the “blaze has been brought under control with the joint action of district administration, rescue agencies and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC)”.
He added that rescue teams were clearing the debris and had entered the basement of the mall and assured that “all possible help will be provided to the affected families”.
Wahab vowed that “until all missing persons are found and the rescue operation is completed, all departments of the KMC are to remain on high alert”.
Heavy machinery was also brought in to clear the mall’s roof, the mayor said.
The rescue teams have begun removing vehicles parked on the roof using cranes.
The mayor added that the heavy machinery will be present at the site until the operation is completed.
On late Monday night, DIG Raza told Dawn that 23 bodies had been recovered from the debris. He added that the body parts of some of the victims had been recovered.
In a statement, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal said that while “more than 20 bodies have been recovered, the final number of dead cannot be stated at the moment”.
“Some bodies have been recovered in the form of body parts from various locations,” he said.
“Until it is determined through a technical and forensic verification whether these parts are of the same person or different people, confirming the correct number [of deaths] is difficult.”
KP CM conveys condolences to Murad Shah
Meanwhile, in a letter to Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday, his Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counterpart Sohail Afridi conveyed his “heartfelt condolences” over the fire incident.
Stating that he was “deeply saddened” by the incident, the KP CM noted that the blaze “led to the loss of precious lives and caused immense distress to many
families”.
“My thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this hour of grief, and I sincerely hope for the swift recovery of those who were injured,” the chief minister wrote.
CM Afridi added, “I also wish to convey my sympathies to the Government of Sindh which is confronted with the difficult task of responding to the aftermath of this tragedy.
“At moments like these, the sorrow of one province is felt by the entire nation, and the people and Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stand with the people and Government of Sindh in solidarity and compassion.”







The KP CM’s letter comes after his visit to Karachi earlier this month, when he was accorded a warm welcome by the Sindh government, but the journey ended with him decrying the “treatment” meted out to him by the provincial administration.
During the visit, a meeting with CM Murad was on CM Afridi’s agenda but it did not take place, with both sides placing the fault on the other.
‘65 people remain missing’
On Monday, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Mayor Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing.
“Others are saying there are 77 missing, but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies, but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said.
He said that firefighting operations had concluded, and cooling work was ongoing.
“We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said.
The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received, but when rescuers accessed those areas, there were no signs of life.
He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution.
He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged which need to be investigated for negligence,” Wahab said.
The provincial government has set up an inquiry committee, led by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, to probe the causes of the fire.
CM Murad yesterday announced a relief, inquiry and fire-safety reform package, saying the government would support both bereaved families and affected shopkeepers.
The chief minister said the family of each deceased victim would receive Rs10 million in compensation. He also promised assistance for the shopkeepers, saying a special committee had been constituted to help those affected.</p><small>2026-01-20 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20125426d915806.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968030/they-forced-us-pm-shehbaz-says-pak-afghan-trade-blockade-result-of-kabuls-inaction-against-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>‘They forced us’: PM Shehbaz says Pak-Afghan trade blockade result of Kabul’s inaction against terrorists</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said Pakistan was “forced” to halt all trade with Afghanistan due to Kabul’s inaction against terrorists operating from its soil.
The Pak-Afghan border has been closed for trade since mid-October 2025, when border clashes erupted. Successive rounds of talks on counter-terrorism mechanisms failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar.
“There is a complete blockade of Pak-Afghan trade. It should not have been there, but they forced us,” the premier said while addressing a national workshop event in Islamabad.
“This time, it must be decided whether Afghanistan wants to live peacefully or not […] They are our brothers and sisters. If the interim Afghan government does not have an interest in this (peace with Pakistan), they should at least have mercy on its people and not oppress them.”
“Rest assured, we will keep trying our best,” the prime minister added.
While trade data shows that the border closure has hit Afghanistan far harder than Pakistan, exporters and the business community have raised concerns over the losses being faced by them.



“It is our neighbouring country, we have to live forever […] what is good for Afghanistan is good for Pakistan, and vice versa,” the prime minister remarked.
He called it unfortunate that the past and the incumbent Afghan governments “did not cherish the hospitality” offered by Pakistan.
The premier added that while international aid was received for the four million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, the country also had to use its own resources.
He further said that Pakistan did no favour to the Afghan people but fulfilled its responsibilities.
“But the way they are paying us back is very upsetting,” the prime minister added.
PM Shehbaz noted that the 2020 Doha Accords were “very clear” in stating that Afghanistan will rein in terrorist activity in the country and will not allow any terrorist to operate from their territory.
Recalling ministers’ various meetings held with Afghan leaders, the premier lamented, “But they did not adhere to a single one of our recommendations.”
Recalling the Pak-Afghan border clashes of October 2025 and the subsequent rounds of talks that failed, he said, “Nothing came of it. We had only one demand that you commit to rein in all terrorist outfits and proxies, whether it is the TTP, BLA, or the resources provided to them by India’s support.”
“Unfortunately, they did not make any serious commitment,” he added.
‘Terrorism resurged after 2018’
In his address, the premier also spoke at length about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the surge in terrorism.
Calling the province a “beautiful region” of Pakistan, he praised its people, saying they “never hesitate to sacrifice their lives for their country”.
“Whatever happened as a result of the Afghan war is before you,” the premier said, noting that Pakistan welcomed refugees from across the border and allowed them to live here “like a family”.
“[But] what did Pakistan get in return?” asked the prime minister.
He recalled that “thousands of innocent Pakistanis” lost their lives to terrorism, and that “political forces sympathetic to KP” made sacrifices.
“By 2018, terrorism had been completely eradicated, and everyone knew this was achieved through great sacrifices,” PM Shehbaz said.
He pointed out that in the wake of the 2014 Army Public School attack, the armed forces and the government decided that there would be “no good or bad Taliban”. “Today, there is no such distinction,” the premier asserted.

 

“But after 2018, what was the reason that this menace resurged?” he asked, adding that “we all know the answer very well”.
“Numerous terrorists were released from Swat, and thousands of people were brought from Afghanistan to live in Pakistan. This was the main reason terrorism resurged in the country,” PM Shehbaz said.
“Today, terrorism has once again dealt a major blow to Pakistan’s development and prosperity, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as in other areas.”
“Every day, there is a terrorist incident somewhere,” he added.
While hailing the fact that there could be “no greater sacrifice” than that made by soldiers, he regretted that hatred was being spread on social media and that an “evil attempt is being made to defame the martyrs”.
“They spew venom against Pakistan in chorus with the country’s enemies across the border,” the prime minister said, adding that the nation would continue its fight against terrorism until it is completely eradicated.
Centre’s ties with KP
During his address, the prime minister was also asked about the “disengaged” youth of KP and the Centre’s steps to include them in the national discourse.
“There is a cold war ongoing between the federal government and the KP government. This statement does not align with the facts,” he said.
The premier said he had spoken by phone with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on the day he was elected and had offered him his “full support” for the development and prosperity of the province.
“He thanked me. [But] after that, he did not contact me again,” PM Shehbaz noted, recalling that he had again invited the KP CM to work together during his address in Chitral later.
He affirmed that the Centre was engaged with the youth, pointing out multiple steps being taken by the IT ministry to upskill the youth.
“Pakistan will only develop when all four provinces have an equal part in it,” the prime minister said during his address.
“Without going into any political argument, I want to say that if you compare KP’s journey of prosperity and development over the past 10 years with that of Sindh, Punjab or Balochistan, the truth will become clear,” he remarked.
Noting that resources were allocated to the provinces under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, the premier lamented that corresponding development could not be seen “in some places, including KP”.
“What the reason for that is remains another painful question that we must reflect on and answer.”</p><small>2026-01-20 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2011590381ba3c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968034/content-to-die-afghanistans-hunger-crisis-worsened-by-winter-aid-cuts' target='_blank'><strong>‘Content to die’: Afghanistan’s hunger crisis worsened by winter, aid cuts</strong></a><br><p>In the dull glow of a single bulb lighting their tent on the outskirts of Kabul, Samiullah and his wife Bibi Rehana sit down to dry bread and tea, their only meal of the day, accompanied by their five children and three-month-old grandchild.
“We have reached a point where we are content with death,” said 55-year-old Samiullah, whose family, including two older sons aged 18 and 20 and their wives, is among the millions deported by neighbouring countries in the past year.
“Day by day, things are getting worse,” he added, after their return to a war-torn nation where the United Nations’ World Food Programme estimates 17 million battle acute hunger after massive cuts in international aid.
“Whatever happens to us has happened, but at least our children’s lives should be better.” He was one of the returned Afghans speaking before protests in Iran sparked a massive crackdown by the government.
Samiullah said his family went virtually overnight from its modest home in Iran to their makeshift tent, partially propped up by rocks and rubble, after a raid by Iranian authorities led to their arrests and then deportation.
They salvaged a few belongings but were not able to carry out all their savings, which would have carried them through the winter, Samiullah added.
Reuters was unable to reach authorities in Iran for comment.
“Migrants who are newly returning to the country receive assistance as much as possible,” said Afghan administration spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in areas from transport to housing, healthcare and food.
It was impossible to eradicate poverty quickly in a country that suffered 40 years of conflict and the loss of all its revenue and resources, he added in a statement, despite an extensive rebuilding effort.
“Economic programmes take time and do not have an immediate impact on people’s lives.”
The WFP says Iran and Pakistan have expelled more than 2.5m Afghans in massive repatriation programs.
Tehran ramped up deportations last year amid a flurry of accusations that they were spying for Israel. Authorities blamed the expulsions on concerns about security and resources.
Islamabad accelerated deportations amid accusations that the Taliban was harbouring militants responsible for cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations Afghanistan has denied.
No income, no aid
As winter spreads across Afghanistan’s arid landscape, work opportunities have dried up, while the wave of returning Afghans has swelled the population by a tenth, said John Aylieff, the WFP’s country director.
“Many of these Afghans were working in Iran and Pakistan and they were sending back remittances,” he told Reuters, adding that 3m more people now face acute hunger. “Those remittances were a lifeline for Afghanistan.”
Cuts to global programmes since United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House have sapped the resources of organisations such as the WFP, while other donor countries have also scaled back, putting millions at risk worldwide.
“Last year was the biggest malnutrition surge ever recorded in Afghanistan and sadly the prediction is that it’s going to get worse,” added Aylieff, estimating that 200,000 more children would suffer acute malnutrition in 2026.
At the WFP’s aid distribution site in Bamiyan, about 180km from Kabul, the capital, there are stacks of rice bags and jugs of palm oil, while wheelbarrows trundle in more food, but it is still too little for the long queues of people.
“I am forced to manage the winter with these supplies; sometimes we eat, sometimes we don’t,” said Zahra Ahmadi, 50, a widowed mother of eight daughters, as she received aid for the first time.
‘Life never remains the same’
At the Qasaba Clinic in the capital, mothers soothed their children during the wait for medicine and supplements.
“Compared to the time when there were no migrants, the number of our patients has now doubled,” said Dr. Rabia Rahimi Yadgari.
The clinic treats about 30 cases of malnutrition each day but the supplements are not sufficient to sustain the families, who previously relied on WFP aid and hospital support, she said.
Laila, 30, said her son, Abdul Rahman, showed signs of recovery after taking the supplements.
“But after some time, he loses the weight again,” she said.
After the Taliban takeover, she said, “My husband lost his (government) job, and gradually our economic situation collapsed. Life never remains the same.”
The United States led a hasty withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in July 2021, after 20 years of war against the Taliban, opening the doors for the Islamists to take control of Kabul.
As dusk gathers and the temperature falls, Samiullah brings in firewood and Bibi Rehama lights a stove for warmth.
“At night, when it gets very cold, my children say, ‘Father, I’m cold, I’m freezing.’ I hold them in my arms and say, ‘It’s OK.’ What choice do we have?” Samiullah said.
“(When) I worked in Iran, at least I could provide a full meal. Here, there is neither work nor livelihood.”</p><small>2026-01-20 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20122858cbd7948.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968037/trump-shares-messages-from-frances-macron-offering-g7-meeting-after-davos' target='_blank'><strong>Trump shares messages from France’s Macron offering G7 meeting after Davos</strong></a><br><p>French President Emmanuel Macron told US President Donald Trump that he could set up a G7 meeting in Paris on Thursday afternoon and that he did not understand what Trump was “doing on Greenland,” in a screenshot of the messages that Trump posted on Truth Social and said was a note from Macron.
According to the messages, Macron told the US president that he could invite the Ukrainians, the Danish, the Syrians and the Russians to participate on the margins of the meeting, and also invited Trump to have dinner with him in Paris on Thursday.







Trump’s replies, if any, were not part of the screenshot that he posted. The White House and the Macron’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
A source close to Macron said that the text message shared by Trump was authentic.
EU leaders are set to convene in Brussels on Thursday evening for an emergency summit following Trump’s threats to impose new tariffs on several EU countries over his demand to acquire Greenland.
Last week, in a post on Truth Social, Trump said an additional 10 per cent import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain — all already subject to tariffs imposed by Trump.
Those tariffs would increase to 25pc on June 1 and would continue until a deal was reached for the US to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote.
The president has repeatedly said Greenland is vital to US security because of its strategic location and large mineral deposits, and has not ruled out using force to take it. European nations this week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark’s request.</p><small>2026-01-20 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20120231b57e448.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968033/ihc-reinstates-bail-right-to-defence-for-imaan-hadi-in-social-media-posts-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC reinstates bail, right to defence for Imaan, Hadi in social media posts case</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday reinstated the bail of lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in the controversial social media posts case, after it was cancelled by a sessions court on January 15.
In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production.
During today’s hearing, the IHC judge reinstated the bail from earlier, suspending the arrest warrant issued by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka.
He further directed them to complete the cross-examination in three days and reinstated their right to defence.
At this, the couple’s legal counsel, Kamran Murtaza, requested the court to grant one week.
“I will look into it. You should proceed with the trial,” the judge remarked.
Hearings on Monday
A day earlier, Justice Azam Khan of the IHC, who has been presiding over the hearing, granted Mazari and Chattha a one-day protective bail, directing them to appear in court today.
During yesterday’s hearing at the IHC, Murtaza informed the court that his clients’ bail had twice been cancelled.
“Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said.
He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”.
“The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.
Earlier on the same day, Judge Majoka had expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested during a hearing.
He directed the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am.
However, after the IHC’s orders, the hearing was adjourned to January 20 (today).

Calling the incident “heartbreaking”, Rehman said that there could be no compensation for all of the lives lost in the incident.
She asserted that the entire Sindh government was active and dealing with the situation. However, she conceded that the fire brigade took time to reach the site after the fire broke out as there was a large crowd gathered at the scene.
She added that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had announced Rs10m as compensation for the affected families.
“Shutting down private enterprise is harmful since this is such a big plaza. But fire safety is necessary for a city like Karachi and one should ask the administration of Gul Plaza about how it happened since they run the market,” she added.
“I am not giving excuses; it was a huge lesson for all of us. It was a tragedy for the whole of Pakistan, not only for Karachi or Sindh,” she said.
“It was a big and tragic incident but there is no need for pointing fingers or engaging in politics,” she stated.
“If there is any aid or assistance that they (the MQM) can extend to us, then I urge them to do that but sadly, it will be politicised,” Senator Rehman added. “Our doors are open for both relief and criticism.”
MQM senator assails Sindh govt
In her remarks, Ateeb took aim at the Sindh government and highlighted that there were no safety or emergency measures at Gul Plaza.
“The whole building collapsed and there was no emergency exit,” she highlighted. “Whose responsibility is this? If people are saying the fire brigade turned up too late, then how did the building authority allow 1,200 shops in a space which only allows for 500?”
“Permission is granted to build the mall but all the things needed for such a building need to be considered,” she emphasised.
“Windows were shut because of air conditioners and were either blocked by items or had grills so people were unable to escape,” she added.
Senator Ateeb stated that the government was responsible for failing to ensure safety measures.
“The government says they will compensate the victims’ families for the damages, but there is no compensation for the lives lost,” she said.
“The people of Karachi are drowning in sorrow right now, yet we are here passing bills and giving speeches on different subjects. This needs to be our priority: the city which gives nearly 70 per cent in taxes to the Centre,” she said.
‘It’s incompetence, but pointing fingers alone will not help’
Speaking right after Rehman, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar agreed with her that the incident should not be politicised. But, he also highlighted that the incident “exposes corruption”.
“Corruption has its price,” he said, recalling that the Supreme Court had also ordered an investigation into authorities related to buildings’ construction in Karachi.
“What’s happening — in Karachi and across the country — is that building bylaws are only on paper,” he remarked.
Zafar said that because of corruption, building maps not meeting legal requirements and lacking features such as fire exits were being approved. “And once the building is constructed, there is no supervision of it, which is also because of corruption.
“This happened in Karachi, Lahore and other cities.”
He added that after incidents such as the Gul Plaza blaze, opposition members would usually hurl criticism and those from the government would defend themselves. “Chief ministers arrive at the site of the incident and express condolences. And compensations are paid from the treasury.
“But this does not solve the problem.”
Zafar urged that the implementation and enforcement of building bylaws, as well as penalties for their violations, be discussed in the upper House of Parliament.
“These are two major issues that we need to address,” he said, further highlighting the need for suggestions to prevent incidents like the Gul Plaza inferno.
“Our MQM senator made a good point, but let’s also give suggestions on how to stop this.”
Terming the Gul Plaza blaze an example of “incompetence” of the Sindh government, he stressed that “pointing fingers alone will not help. The issue will only be resolved once we address this issue.”
‘Extremely tragic’
PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi said the incident was “extremely tragic, disheartening, and saddening”, adding that there were more shops at the mall than had been approved, with “nearly 250 having been illegally set up”.
“The problem is that the building was constructed in the 1990s and only 900 shops had been approved, but approximately another 250 were built illegally,” he claimed.
The senator also noted that the building’s completion certificate was issued around 2003-04 by then-Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim.</p><small>2026-01-20 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20115728b5eb344.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968032/australia-set-to-pass-tougher-laws-on-guns-hate-crimes-after-bondi-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Australia set to pass tougher laws on guns, hate crimes after Bondi shooting</strong></a><br><p>Australia’s lower house of parliament has passed new laws for a national gun buyback, tighter background checks for gun licences and a crackdown on hate crimes, in response to the country’s worst mass shooting in decades at a Jewish festival last month.
Two bills for stricter gun control and anti-hate measures passed on Tuesday by the House of Representatives in a special parliament session will now go to the upper house Senate for debate.
The gun control laws are expected to pass with the support of the Greens party despite opposition from the conservative Liberal-National coalition. The anti-hate laws are likely to pass with support from the Liberal party.
Introducing the gun reforms, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said individuals with “hate in their hearts and guns in their hands”, carried out the December 14 attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people.
“The tragic events at Bondi demand a comprehensive response from government,” Burke added.
“As a government, we must do everything we can to counter both the motivation and the method.”
Parliament recalled early for special session
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese recalled parliament early from its summer break for this week’s special two-day session to toughen curbs after the shooting shocked the nation and prompted calls for more action on gun control and antisemitism.
The proposed gun control measures enable the largest national buyback scheme since a similar campaign after a 1996 massacre in Tasmania’s Port Arthur, in which a lone gunman killed 35 people.
They also toughen background checks for firearm licences issued by Australian states, making use of information from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.
Australia had a record 4.1 million firearms last year, the government said on Sunday, with more than 1.1 million of those in New South Wales, its most populous state and the site of the Bondi attack.
“The sheer number of firearms currently circulating within the Australian community is unsustainable,” Burke said.
The bill passed by a vote of 96 to 45 without the support of the coalition.
“This bill reveals the contempt the government has for the million gun owners of Australia,” said Shadow Attorney-General Andrew Wallace of the Liberals.
“The prime minister has failed to recognise that guns are tools of trade for so many Australians.”
Hate crime penalties stepped up
A second bill steps up penalties for hate crimes, such as jail terms up to 12 years when a religious official or preacher is involved, and allows bans on groups deemed to spread hate.
The bill, which also provides new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate, passed the lower house 116 to 7, with support from Liberal party lawmakers while the National party, their coalition partners, abstained.
“This bill targets those that support violence, in particular violence targeted at a person because of their immutable attributes,” said Attorney-General Michelle Rowland.
Such conduct was not only criminal but sowed the seed of extremism leading to terrorism, she added. Police say the alleged Bondi gunmen were inspired by the Islamic State militant group.
The measures were originally planned for a single bill, but backlash from both the coalition and the Greens forced the government to split the package and drop provisions for an offence of racial vilification.
In its own reforms, New South Wales limits individuals to possession of four guns, and beefs up the power of police to curb protests during designated terrorist attacks.
State police have extended by two weeks in some areas protest curbs enforced in Sydney late in December. While they do not ban protests outright, critics say they are undemocratic.</p><small>2026-01-20 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20101825ca88b9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968025/pm-shehbaz-to-lead-delegation-to-wef-summit-in-davos-expected-to-hold-multiple-substantive-engagements-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to lead delegation to WEF summit in Davos, expected to hold ‘multiple substantive engagements’: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level delegation to the annual summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
According to a statement by the FO, the annual WEF meeting will be held in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland from January 20-22. PM Shehbaz will be accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and others.
The statement added that the prime minister’s programme includes “multiple substantive engagements”, including participation in the WEF’s Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders (IGWEL) session on “Restoring a Spirit of Dialogue in a Divided World”.
It added that the prime minister would also host and chair a Pakistan-specific “High-level Business Roundtable” with different corporate leaders.







“On the sidelines, the prime minister is expected to interact with several world leaders, including business executives,” it said.
“Articulating Pakistan’s perspective on global and regional peace and development and highlighting the government’s vision and achievements in the areas of economy, trade and investment opportunities will be part of the prime minister’s key messages during the visit,” the statement added.

They decided to conduct ground surveys of all high-rise buildings in the capital.
“Besides fire and safety systems, the CDA should also ensure that every building owner has a completion certificate, which covers fire safety, structural stability, and implementation of approved building plans,” said a CDA official.
He added that a majority of high-rise and apartment buildings in Islamabad have been operating without this certificate.

Completion certificate covers fire safety, structural stability, and implementation of approved building plans

The meeting, headed by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, discussed “detailed arrangements for current fire safety measures, making protective measures more effective, and formulating a comprehensive strategy for private and public buildings,” according to a CDA statement.
The civic body chief directed that all high-rise private and public buildings in Islamabad be formally surveyed and categorised. “He emphasised that all necessary fire safety measures and emergency exit routes must be mandatory in high-rise buildings,” the statement added.
A participant of the meeting said that the Karachi Gul Plaza tragedy was discussed. “Although Islamabad does not face similar risks, as most buildings here have good fire safety arrangements and are constructed according to approved plans, we want to ensure safety and emergency exits in all high-rise buildings to avoid any mishap,” he said.
He added that special focus will be on buildings 15 meters and above, of which around 600 are located in Islamabad.
The meeting was attended by CDA Board Member Finance Tahir Naeem, Member Planning and Design Dr Khalid Hafiz, Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon, Director General of Building & Housing Control, Director General of Capital Emergency Services, and other senior officers.
During the briefing, officials said that approval of a building’s fire safety plan from the CDA is mandatory before constructing any new building. For new private and public buildings, fire certification according to Pakistan Engineering Council standards is compulsory. Drones will also be utilised in firefighting operations in high-rise buildings.
“Chairman CDA said a clear mechanism must be established to ensure full compliance of sensitive and older buildings with fire safety regulations. He stressed that the fire safety audit system should be strengthened and fully implemented,” the statement said.
The meeting also directed the Capital Emergency Services, in collaboration with the district administration, to arrange regular simulation exercises in high-rise buildings. The chairman instructed that human resource requirements of the Capital Emergency Services be fulfilled immediately.
Officials reviewed the activation of a modern emergency operation centre using digital technologies and the establishment of new rescue stations at key locations across the city.
It is relevant to note that a completion certificate (also known as an occupancy certificate) is mandatory for every building once construction is completed. However, in Islamabad, many high-rise and apartment buildings, particularly in sector E-11, operate without this certificate.
“Building owners often avoid obtaining completion certificates due to additional construction,” said an official. He added that besides fire audits, CDA management will ensure every building has a completion certificate to guarantee the safety of all occupants.

The animal was spotted in the area about two months back after its long disappearance for more than 10 years.
The deputy ranger of wildlife department, Shafiq Ahmed, and regional programme manager of Snow Leopard Foundation, Jamigh Sherazi, told Dawn that after receiving a report about spotting of the snow leopard carcass, they reached the spot along with a team.
They said the carcass was frozen, which meant that the animal had died many hours before their arrival. They said the cause of death of the wild cat would be ascertained only after the postmortem was carried out in the veterinary hospital, where the body was being shifted.
Earlier, the leopard was spotted in Wakht, Munoor and Beghusht villages, which attacked the goats of the local people. The people had also been voicing concern about their losses.
The area has recently received snowfall forcing the animal to come to lower altitude areas in search of food and that was how it came in close conflict with the local population, an official said.
An environmentalist requesting not to be named told Dawn that the death of the wild cat might not be natural.

Courts were defanged, risky deals struck with old patrons of autocracies and political foes jailed, all in the name of national progress.
Since the claims are tall and mass misery great, public hopes are high about delivery, which is crucial for the government, too, to help mask its dubious mandate. So, 2026 must be the year of growth. But herein lies the rub. This set of rulers has more autocratic powers than all set-ups after Gen Musharraf’s, but they only help it to survive; its ability to use them to usher progress is weak. Painful IMF medicine was unleashed as well. It lowered inflation, but undercut growth. A recent national household survey shows that to recover from the cost of past inflation, strong growth is needed, which the IMF says may remain elusive even next year.
To spur growth, while also cutting our ever-rising external deficit, the set-up must raise investment and exports. Its best idea on exports so far seems to have been to set up committees of clueless people, while the best one on investments is to dash to Gulf states. But despite dozens of meetings, Saudi Arabia and others have given few inflows. We need industrialisation; instead, we seem to be chasing avenues such as crypto, corporate farming, mining and defence exports that may even impede major industry. What is on display is crony capitalism, autocratic excesses and a lack of ability to ignite sustainable and equitable progress.
Sadly, the main alternative to our crony capitalism is the free-market neoliberalism pushed by the IMF and like-minded national economists. While crony capitalism can’t provide even the first two elements of progress — stability and growth — neoliberalism fails on equity and sustainability. It is naïvely said that to have progress, we need reforms to cut taxes, reduce state size and deregulate across the board. But no major state has progressed based on this mix alone. The world’s fastest growing state for decades, China, ranks in the lowest category ‘repressed’ on the Index of Economic Freedom.

What is on display is crony capitalism.

Cosmologically, the debate rages on among adherents of natural evolution and intelligent design. But economically, global evidence shows that only an intelligent design developed by the visible hands of an able state delivers progress rather than natural evolution spurred only by the invisible hand of markets.
A state-led intelligent design for us must include strategies for ensuring industrial and export upgradation and expansion, cutting regional and class inequities, ensuring sustainability and lessening the twin deficits.
To pursue such a design, the state must not cut its size blindly — it must shed its fat, but develop muscles. Reforms on taxes, tariffs, subsidies, etc, under such a design are not open-ended, but sequenced to support all its elements, as done by China. People who talk of reforms without invoking such an intelligent design are as clueless as our hybrid set-up and the IMF.
But the minds who could lead such a progressive developmental design are nowhere to be seen in our economic and political arena. So, for the near future, we will continue to pursue an odd mix: pretending to implement neoliberalism but actually pursuing crony capitalism. None of our governments ever had the capacity to implement export-led growth, and all pursued im­­port-led growth.
The telltale sign of that was that in all our brief growth spurts in recent decades, foreign reserves fell despite growth, as it came from rising imports rather than exports. This raises the current deficit, depletes foreign reserves and takes us back to the IMF.
Unfortunately, this set-up faces a double jeopardy. It lacks the ability to provide export-led growth and also foreign reserves for import-led growth. Already, even with just two to three per cent growth, the external deficit is rising despite high remittances, as exports are stagnant while imports are increasing.
The big dreams of the civilians in the set-up are centred on being able to churn up growth before elections and thus shun the economic-political crutches and shackles of the IMF and hidden forces. But given the inability to crank up our foreign reserves despite the three-pronged strategy of ‘beg, borrow and squeeze’ from the local market, they may have to continue serving both for long. Meanwhile, the chances of salvation for the masses will remain distant until democracy and civilian sway prevail.

“Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions? Then you will find your doubts and your self will melt away.”
A young journalist put out a video clip last week that should have impressed Gandhiji. Some of the poorest men, women and children have been sleeping in the freezing Delhi winter, covered only with plastic sheets and gunny bags, outside AIIMS, India’s premier hospital. The people include very ill or old patients who have travelled for treatment from Bihar and Uttar.
It’s not that there is no night shelter outside the hospital, but it still leaves around 100 miserable people in the cold while they await their turn to see the doctor or be called for a procedure that could take days or even weeks to begin.
Reports from abroad are equally dismaying. India has never been humiliated like this. Donald Trump is misbehaving with everyone. Everyone is standing up to him, even Europe, but not India. All BRICS countries censured Trump for the military assault on Venezuela and the kidnapping of its president. Brazil is wary of the US because its president has been in prison at America’s behest. Yet it condemned Trump’s assault on neighbouring Venezuela.
South Africa and Russia expressed outrage, and China’s response was priceless. Expressing grave concern over the forcible abduction of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, China said: “Release them at once, stop toppling the government of Venezuela, and resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation.” And how did Vishwaguru, who plays host to the BRICS summit this year, respond?
“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the foreign ministry’s statement read. Not naming the US is understandable, given India’s desperate need to have a trade deal with Trump. But “recent developments”? Wasn’t the president of a sovereign country that once supplied oil to India just seized by the US military?

The very least the fractured parties can do is to stop carping at each other publicly.

It’s perplexing at the very least, therefore, that the Indian opposition continues to be in disarray, despite there being every reason for it to take a lesson from Gandhi’s talisman and give a piece of its mind to the government for an abysmal show at home and abroad.
There isn’t room for excuses. The opposition has known all along that the prime minister has acquired an elixir of invincibility from the handpicked election commission. Modi changed the rules to allow only him to decide who would be the election chief to govern the elections and how. Modi also closed all legal options to remedy what Rahul Gandhi described as “vote chori” or brazen theft of votes. Having slammed all forms of electoral malpractice and to good effect, what has the opposition done about it?
Thinking calmly and collectively should be their first action. If the elections have become a mere formality and the outcome is suspiciously one-sided, with little support coming from the supreme court, what should the people expect of the opposition under the circumstances?
The very least the fractured parties can do is to stop carping at each other publicly. And this is where it’s a curious mystery that Rahul Gandhi, who has spoken on earlier occasions of the need for a second freedom movement, hasn’t stood up, for the sake of peace among his opposition allies, to assure them that he would not be a candidate for the prime minister’s job without a complete consensus.
He could clarify that, though the Congress party historically had the widest nationwide reach, more than the BJP, it is not putting its hat in the ring for the illusory top job. Gandhi could say to himself, yes, the Congress can be influential outside the government. The communists were, as was Gandhiji. And the nation would owe a standing ovation to him and his family for helping create the conditions to unite the fractious opposition behind a common minimum programme. All this without eyeing power.
The overarching need for the Gandhis, together with the rest of the opposition, is to first get Indian democracy running again as prescribed by the constitution, and not by the wilful fiat of an autocrat. The resolution should not be about power sharing, if it can be helped, but about saving the country and restoring trust in its once fabled electoral democracy.
It just so happens that India is in a double bind for the opposition to take guard. It’s being plundered relentlessly by a handful of favoured corporates on the one hand, while being fractured by communally divisive politics on the other. The opposition must display moral courage to wage a veritable two-front battle. The businesses are wary of Gandhi as he speaks of crony capitalism. Communalism grows because its financiers are the same lot.
Above all, the problem is one of extremely selfish interests that the opposition masks. Last week’s headlines were cheering Prime Minister Modi for winning another municipal election for his party, this time in Mumbai. What was left unsaid was equally important. The opposition had cut each other’s votes.
Elections are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, where the communists are rooting for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s arrest. In Kerala, the communists have the Congress in their crosshairs. And each one of them was an enthusiastic member of the now almost-defunct INDIA alliance. Perhaps Rahul has a way of retrieving lost hope from Gandhi’s talisman.

Those of us brought up on Dastaan-i-Ameer Hamza and Tilism-i-Hoshruba imagined lone men on horseback rushing between cities and fiefdoms, carrying letters or messages to and fro. They were known as ailchis.
In this age of modern communications, when we can even chat the Jetsons way with a video call, one would have assumed we no longer need ailchis. But we still do. They are no longer needed for the mighty and powerful to communicate with each other as such — though the ‘stories’ about the various London plans suggest otherwise — but they are still used, town-crier style, to talk to the awaam, or masses, as we like to call them in English-language newspapers.
The more politically correct term would be ‘citizens’, but why bother to be PC when the awaam in Pakistan barely have any rights, which is perhaps what defines a citizen?
To return to the point, the powerful still need to pass on messages to those who are mere mortals. It can be a warning, a threat, a message or even a bid to test the waters. And this can be done via anonymous accounts on social media or through individuals known to enjoy the confidence of the powerful. In recent days, a few such well-connected people have been informing their listeners that those who have their ears are considering changing the voting age from 18 to 25. The reason being given is that if one can’t be elected to parliament before the age of 25, then those who make this election possible should also be of that age.
It was also pointed out, with considerable pain, that this was simply a proposal under consideration and no final decision had been taken. And this, in our hack world, ladies and gentlemen, is called a feeler — to use a news story to gauge the reaction. Test the waters, so to speak.

What if after yet another amendment, it turns out it wasn’t enough to increase the age to 25?

Why in the world, in the middle of crises such as convincing the IMF to ease fiscal restrictions, decisions about Gaza, a security crisis, and even rolling back the NFC, would the government take on another constitutional amendment? Especially if they still have not been able to create a consensus on the NFC and the provinces-versus-local-government debate? But then, these are useless questions — for who knows how the minds of the powerful work?
But it is an idea being taken seriously on talk shows. Analysts have discussed it and politicians have been asked about it. And a senior politico, when asked about it, did point out that Gen Z doesn’t even read manifestos before voting. Valid argument, because every 30- and 50-year-old is making voting decisions after a detailed comparison of the manifestos.
Dare one say, though, that the argument about manifestos or the uniformity between voting and eligibility age is all just red herrings? Justifications conjured up post-decision making are akin to being told that the 26th Amendment had to be brought in to ensure judges could be recruited from a wider cross-section of society than just a law firm or two in Lahore. Because two dynastic families prioritise fresh blood — even if it is only in the judiciary.
What might just remain unsaid — like other issues such as trees or conflicts to the west — is that the increase in the voting age will be aimed at the PTI’s support base. This stubborn Gen Z, which the state now associates with the party, has to be kept from voting for its preferred party, hopefully reducing the PTI’s chances.
But why would the powerful do this? For it would be yet another admission of failure. Why admit that the trips to universities and colleges, which began all the way back with the caretaker prime minister, all the laptop schemes and the grand events where students weep and credit the government for their success, have not worked? All those talk shows with students and the discussion about Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Maryam Nawaz being an inspiration for young people — will these conversations be discarded?
And will we be denied further conjecture on what happened when officials who can’t be named go to a university or college to ‘talk’ to future generations? And it might just mean that new, young leaders such as a television anchor and a former musician would give up their efforts to carve out a political career. Surely, this would be most unfair. This would deny far too much enjoyment to us mortals.
And what if after yet another amendment, it turns out it wasn’t enough to increase the age to 25? The 25-to-35 age group also outnumbers the 50-year-old group and is impervious to the old-world charms of the 1990s leadership. Will there be another amendment? It might just prove exhausting for the 70-year-old parliamentarians who will have to vote again.
Surely, it would be easier to simply hone the election management technique introduced before, during and after the 2024 elections. It has proved rather successful so far, and the judiciary, which tried to tinker with the results, has also been brought to heel. Why try and fix what is already working?
In fact, it is also important to point out that when there is a way to simply discard the votes of younger people, why bother disenfranchising them altogether? The latter might upset them more than they already are. Indeed, it would be better to insist that the current strategy is working and not admit to failure. Stick to the visits and the engagements, grooming new political leaders. Continue to win over the young, one weeping student at a time.

The area has gas and electricity connections, and most streets are paved. Yet in 2026, his house has still never been connected to a water pipeline.
Like many of his neighbours, Jahangir plans his household routine around the arrival of a private water tanker, an expense that was once considered temporary but has long become permanent. What was once seen as an exception has quietly become the norm, as the experience is no longer confined to informal settlements.
Across Quetta, even residents of established urban localities are surviving without a regular public water supply. Instead, they are relying on private arrangements rather than a functioning municipal system.
To top it all off, unregulated use of tube wells, many of them illegally installed, has significantly worsened Quetta’s water crisis. Excessive pumping to compensate for weak public supply has rapidly depleted groundwater reserves, with extraction far exceeding natural recharge in the arid region.
Groundwater under strain
Behind people’s daily struggles lies a deeper structural crisis rooted in geography, climate and policy failure. Despite covering nearly 44 per cent of Pakistan’s landmass, Balochistan receives less than 200mm of annual rainfall, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. Data from the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) shows that agriculture depends on groundwater for over 90 per cent of its needs, while only five per cent of farmland is connected to canal irrigation.
In Quetta, groundwater levels are falling by two to five metres annually, driven by unchecked extraction, including more than 30,000 illegal tube wells, per the Balochistan Agriculture Department. Moreover, a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) shows that the water table has dropped from about 50 metres in 2,000 to over 150 metres by 2023, posing a serious threat to agriculture and livelihoods.
An issue long ignored
In September last year, Commissioner of Quetta Division Shahzaib Khan Kakar and Deputy Commissioner of Quetta Captain (Retd) Mehrullah Badini warned that the water shortage in the provincial capital was worsening with each passing day, urging joint action by the government and citizens. “We are going to announce a water emergency in Quetta,” they cautioned.

For residents, the problem is neither new nor unheard of. Jahangir said people living on his street have repeatedly submitted applications to elected representatives for pipeline installation, but their complaints were ignored, and no action was taken.
Fareed Bugti, a social activist living in the Nawa Kili Teachers Colony of Quetta, told Dawn that his neighbourhood is also deprived of basic facilities.
“The Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) installed a water pipeline in my area 10 years ago, but supply from these pipelines has not been restored to date,” Bugti said.
According to Bugti, the population of Nawa Kili has exceeded 200,000, yet the area relies on just two government-owned tube wells, which serve only Mandokhelabad and Pashtunistan Chowk.
“Citizens have installed hundreds of tube wells themselves without obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local administration, due to which the groundwater level is decreasing day by day,“ he said. “And areas where there are no tube wells, people are forced to depend entirely on private tankers.”
Even where water is supplied, it is irregular. In some localities, residents receive water only once a day for a few hours, while others get a supply once a week.
Uneven relief across the city
While some areas have seen limited intervention, relief remains uneven and fragile. Shahryar Kasi, a resident of Shaldara on Kasi Road, said water shortages in the area were once severe. “Wasa used to supply water after a week or 10 days, and even that would stop within minutes,” he said.
He added that during the tenure of the previous government, a tube well was installed on Kasi Road, easing shortages in the surrounding areas. “Now we get water once a day, which has provided clear relief,” he added.
The situation, however, has not improved uniformly throughout the city, with many areas receiving water only once a week.
Khair Muhammad Dehwar, a resident of Kalat Street in the Jail Road area, said water supply deteriorated after Balochistan faced a prolonged drought from 1998 to 2006.

“Some tube wells installed by the government were damaged, but they never got repaired,” he said, adding that Wasa later refused to take over certain wells, citing insufficient groundwater.
“Wasa provides water once a week for half an hour or an hour, but due to low pressure, it does not reach houses at the end of the streets,” Dehwar said. “As a result, about 60 per cent of households have to order private tankers.”
In Pashtunabad, resident Rehmatullah Durrani said water is supplied for about an hour a day through a tube well installed at a school. “If it develops a fault and is not repaired, residents are forced to call tankers,” he said.
‘Water reaches nearby streets, not ours’
In several neighbourhoods, even state-led interventions have failed to deliver equitable access. Umair Parkani, a resident of Killi Bangulzai in Quetta Saryab district, said his neighbourhood has relied on private tankers for years despite elected representatives from his area making repeated promises.
A tube well installed during the previous government failed to supply water to the entire area due to insufficient groundwater. Although two damaged tube wells were later repaired, Parkani said water still does not reach his house. “It reaches only a few nearby streets. People living farther away still have no option but tankers.”
Others have to keep paying the water bill despite their houses being largely deprived of water.
Mansoor Ahmed, a retired banker living in the Smungli Housing Scheme of the Quetta Development Authority (QDA), said he spends thousands of rupees monthly to purchase water from tankers. Like others, he too has a water supply connection in his house, but receives water for just less than an hour on alternate days. Yet, he has to pay for the whole month.

“Even then, I keep paying the water bill for a full month,” Ahmed told Dawn, adding that the situation gets even worse during the summer months.
“People living in the area have no other option but to purchase water from the private tanker mafia,” he lamented.
‘Serious act of administrative negligence’
Concern has also reached the judiciary. On October 15, the Balochistan High Court (BHC) expressed strong disappointment over the severe shortage of drinking water in Hazara Town and surrounding areas, terming the deprivation of such a basic necessity a “serious act of administrative negligence.”
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen heard a petition, ordering immediate action from Wasa, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHE) and Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco). The court observed that residents were facing extreme difficulties due to poor inter-departmental coordination and funding delays.

Residents of Hazara Town, appearing before the court, claimed that a private water supply mafia was illegally selling water through Wasa pipelines. They claimed that citizens were being charged Rs30,000-40,000 for illegal connections and monthly fees of Rs2,500-3,000.
The court ordered the cancellation of illegal contracts and directed authorities to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply to operational tube wells.
Despite the court’s orders, citizens said the situation could hardly improve.
‘Planning and regulation failure’
Experts say the crisis reflects long-standing failures in planning and regulation. Dr Munir Ahmed Babar, Professor at US-Pakistan Centre for Advanced Studies in Water (USPCAS-W) at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, told Dawn that Quetta’s continued reliance on tube wells was fundamentally unsustainable.
“Quetta depends almost completely on groundwater, and that groundwater is going down by around one to 1.5 meters every year,“ he said. “This means that more water is being pumped out than nature can refill, while continuing to install tube wells — even solar-powered ones — is not sustainable.”
Dr Babar compared groundwater to a bank account. “Quetta keeps withdrawing without making deposits,“ he said, adding that with very low rainfall and almost no natural recharge, this approach will lead to dry wells, land subsidence, agricultural collapse and worsening drinking water shortages.
“Sustainability is only possible if new tube wells are restricted or banned, illegal wells sealed, groundwater pumping is measured and priced, recharge dams are built, and rainwater harvesting is introduced.
“Without regulation and recharge, Quetta is moving towards water exhaustion,“ he said.

Speaking about why alternative long-term water sources were not developed in the city earlier, he said, “Quetta did not fail because solutions were unknown. It failed because of weak governance, lack of long-term planning, political interests, and dependence on groundwater, because it was cheap and easy,“ he said.
He added that urgent regulatory steps are needed to protect groundwater and ensure fair access. “Every tube well must be registered and metered, tanker businesses regulated, illegal extraction criminalised and recharge infrastructure prioritised. Quetta’s water crisis is man-made, and only governance reform combined with conservation and recharge can reverse it.”
‘Arid climate, low annual precipitation main reasons’
Wasa Managing Director Mujeebur Rehman Kakar said the authority supplies water to just 51 per cent of Quetta’s population, which makes about 1.275 million people.
“We have 544 tube wells, of which 387 are functional,” he told Dawn, adding that around 1,000 may be unauthorised.

He cited arid climate, low rainfall, poor geology, droughts, rapid urbanisation and weak monitoring as major contributors to the crisis.
PHE Secretary Muhammad Hashim Ghilzai said Quetta requires 60 million gallons per day but receives only 31.575 million gallons.
He added that the Mangi Dam project, expected to be completed in March 2026, would initially supply 8.1 million gallons daily.
‘Situation needs dedication, time and proper planning without delay’
As pressure mounts to move beyond short-term fixes, officials say resolving Quetta’s water crisis will require sustained political will, strict enforcement and long-term planning rather than ad hoc measures.
Deputy Commissioner Quetta Captain (Retd) Badini said resolving the crisis would require sustained effort, expert input and strict enforcement.
“We are keeping an eye on the installation of illegal tube-wells,” Badini said, adding that the use of potable water for car-washing at homes and workshops had also been banned. He said efforts were underway to supply treated wastewater for irrigation, plantations and roadside trees.
“No one uses fresh water for irrigation, providing water for roadside trees and for lawns in the houses,” he said, adding that a drip system had been adopted for roadside plantations. He pointed to countries that avoid using groundwater, relying instead on rain, snowfall, rivers, lakes and dams to preserve underground reserves for future generations.
Badini stressed the urgent need to raise awareness among farmers and other segments of society about conserving groundwater. “We have left nothing underground for the next generation,” he said, noting how unrestricted solar-powered pumping had accelerated depletion.
The president of the Quetta Press Club, Irfan Saeed, also expressed serious concern over the crisis, questioning what future generations would inherit. Recalling his childhood, he said groundwater was once available at depths of just 15 to 20 feet and rose to 10 feet after rainfall.
“Water is life, and we are rapidly depriving it,” he said, urging the construction of dams to store rain and floodwater for future use.

In a letter sent to the Parliamentary Affairs Division secretary, the commission has proposed an amendment in Section 219(1) of the Elections Act.
Section 219(1) of the Elections Act in its original form reads: “The commission shall conduct elections to the local governments under the applicable local government law, and the rules framed thereunder, as may be applicable to a province, cantonments or Islamabad Capital Territory.”
The proposed amendment by the ECP, however, states: “The commission shall conduct elections to the local governments under the applicable local government law at the time of the expiry of term or dissolution of the local governments, and the rules framed thereunder, as may be applicable to a province, cantonments or Islamabad Capital Territory.”
Explaining the rationale for the proposed amendment, the letter refers to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which mandates that each province shall establish a local government system by law, devolving political, administrative, and financial authority to elected representatives.
According to the Elections Act, 2017 (Chapter XIII), the ECP under Article 140-A (2), read with Article 219 (d) of the Constitution, is under an obligation to conduct local government elections.
In the letter sent to the Parliamentary Affairs Division secretary, the ECP said, “Local government is an important tier and bedrock of democracy, which provides basic facilities to the public at grass‑root level”.
“It is observed that no government has generally shown readiness to conduct local government elections and the Election Commission faces difficulties in timely holding of local government elections as mandated under the Constitution and the law,” it added.
Issued with the signatures of ECP Additional Director General (local government elections) Chaudhry Nadeem Qasim, the letter went on to say, “In order to fulfil its constitutional obligation, the commission has always strived to hold timely local government elections but the federal and provincial governments repeal or amend the local government laws even after the expiry of the term of the local government which causes inordinate delay in the conduct of election and the commission faces difficulty in [the] fulfilment of its constitutional duty”.
It is worth mentioning that Section 219 (4) of the Elections Act states that the commission should hold polls within one hundred and twenty days of the expiry of the local government’s term.
In May last year, the ECP had explained its failure to meet its constitutional responsibility of conducting long-overdue local government elections in Punjab and Islamabad, with ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan blaming Article 140-A of the Constitution for the inordinate delay.
“If the political parties desire timely local government elections, an amendment to Article 140-A is inevitable,” the ECP secretary had remarked.
The ECP had already summoned the Punjab chief secretary and the local government secretary to appear in person before the commission on Jan 22 to explain the delay in activities required to hold long-delayed local elections in the province.
Experts, however, note that the ECP had vast powers under the Constitution and was in a position to assert itself for the timely conduct of local government polls.
They say that guarding against corrupt practices was a constitutional obligation, and it was clearly a corrupt practice to allow governments to defeat the spirit of the law by amending the law even after the announcement of the election schedule.
A legal expert also referred to section 219 (5) of the Elections Act, which reads, “The commission shall organise and conduct elections under this chapter and shall make such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law and that the corrupt practices are guarded against.”
He said that the commission cannot only bar the respective governments from amending the local government law after the announcement of the election schedule, but can also punish them if they fail to comply.
“Asking the federal government to amend the Elections Act against its political interest amounts to helping the government drag its feet in conducting the electoral exercise,” he remarked.</p><small>2026-01-20 03:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/201108021643947.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967997/tirah-operation-sparks-debate-in-senate' target='_blank'><strong>Tirah operation sparks debate in Senate</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Alarm bells were rung in the Senate on Monday over the recently launched military operation in the Tirah area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Khyber tribal district.
Speaking on a point of public importance, ANP chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan accused the federal government of being in a “deep slumber” over the ongoing operation in KP, leaving the people helpless and clueless. He said such “processes” had been carried out in the past in KP with all stakeholders on board. “But this time, the Centre is sleeping, whereas the provincial government is unbothered about what is going on,” he added.
“The federal government is behaving as if KP is out of its jurisdiction, and the provincial government is headed by one who is openly talking against the system and is not ready to accept any operation,” he contended.
“Please leave aside day-to-day things and talk about this operation, as the KP government is not even bothered to arrange tents for the displaced people,” he said.

Senator Palwasha asks for her privilege motion against Aleem Khan to be taken up

Speaking on the subject, PTI Senator Noorul Haq Qadri maintained that Tirah was being set on fire and people in large numbers were being displaced on a massive scale in the name of an operation. “The law requires that the provincial government should be taken on board,” he said, claiming that no consultation had been made in the process.
PML-N Senator Abid Sher Ali, in his maiden speech in the House, said he failed to understand whether the ANP chief was speaking in support of the operation or against it.
He questioned the performance of the PTI-led government in KP, noting that the party had failed to ensure peace in the province despite being in power for a third consecutive term.
Mr Ali also criticised the KP chief minister for his recent controversial statements on terrorism. He demanded that the KP government should provide details of the funds it had received from the Centre to eradicate terrorism.
Privilege motion
Meanwhile, PPP Senator Palwasha Khan asked the chair to take up her privilege motion against Federal Communications Minister Aleem Khan over an alleged “personal attack” on her during a standing committee meeting.
Speaking in the House, Senator Palwasha said it was her right to ask a question and the minister had no right to react in such a manner.
PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate, Senator Sherry Rehman, supported the views expressed by her party colleague and said what had happened was something that should enrage everyone. She disclosed that she had contacted Aleem Khan and asked him to directly apologise to Senator Palwasha, adding that the minister told her he would return from Umrah on Jan 25.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said all members sitting on both sides of the aisle were equally honourable and noted that such an incident should not have taken place.
Senator Samina Mumtaz Zahri said one must not get away by merely tendering an apology. She warned that if it were allowed, it could happen to someone else tomorrow. “Will an apology cover up the insult?” she asked.

“With a heavy heart we state that in similar cases, where daughters are subjected to sustained maltreatment by their husbands or in-laws, it is the sad state of our society, though with a few exceptions, that families still compel them to return to the same abusive environment,” observed Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim in a six-page judgement regarding domestic violence in an abusive marriage case.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, a three-judge SC bench had taken up a jail petition of Khursheed Ahmad against the Feb 1, 2022 rejection of his plea by the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi bench.
The SC, however, upheld the conviction of the petitioner for the murder of his wife, Gulshan Bibi.

Husband’s conviction upheld as no evidence of natural death found

In the verdict, Justice Ibrahim expressed deep regret that women subjected to such treatment were undeniable victims of domestic violence and deserved protection, compassion and effective legal recourse. But societal pressures and entrenched cultural norms often compelled families to send their daughters back into circumstances that amounted to nothing less than a ‘living hell’, he observed.
Khursheed Ahmad was initially convicted by an additional sessions judge, Fatehjang (Attock), under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on Feb 12, 2021. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for his wife’s murder and directed to pay compensation of Rs200,000 under Section 544-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to the legal heirs of the deceased.

 

The petitioner then challenged his conviction before the LHC, Rawalpindi bench, which dismissed his criminal appeal though it also set aside the conviction and sentence under Section 302(b) of the PPC. Instead, he was convicted under Section 316 of PPC for committing Qatl Shibh-i-Amd and was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay Diyat amounting to Rs2,055,936 to the legal heirs of the deceased.
Through the present jail petition before the SC, the convict sought leave to appeal against the LHC decision. The apex court carefully examined the record and the evidence produced during the trial.
The SC noted that the convict, according to one of the prosecution witnesses, was unemployed, addicted to narcotics and frequently quarreled with his wife. In 2018, following repeated physical abuse, Gulshan Bibi left the petitioner’s house and began living with her parents. Upon the intervention of family elders, the parties reconciled and resumed cohabitation on the eve of Eid.
The witness deposed that he received a call from a woman residing in the vicinity of his sister’s house, informing him that the convict had murdered Gulshan Bibi, on July 21, 2019.
The complainant, along with his brothers Rasheed, Naseem Gul and Muhammad Akhlaq Ahmad, immediately rushed to their sister’s residence, where they found her lying dead.
Another prosecution witness, Muhammad Ali, testified that the minor son of the deceased and the appellant had informed them that during the previous night, his father, Khursheed Ahmad, had assaulted his mother with a wooden plank. He also alleged that one Raees Pathan had slapped her, as a result of which she lost consciousness and subsequently died.

GILGIT: A 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted Gilgit-Baltistan on Monday, killing one person, injuring four others and damaging dozens of homes, cattle sheds, and public and private properties.
The quake also triggered landslides that blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) and several other roads.
According to the Pakistan Mete­orological Department (PMD), the earthquake struck at 11:21am at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre located in northwestern Kashmir.
Meanwhile, the European Medi­terranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which reports magnitude using the Moment Magnitude Sca­le, recorded the quake at a magnitude of 5.7 at a depth of 31 kilometres. The EMSC said the earthquake was recorded about 58 kilometres northwest of Barishal in Pakistan.
Officials said that when the earthquake struck, heavy landslides occurred in mountainous areas, with clouds of dust seen rising from the slopes.
Gilgit-Baltistan caretaker Information Minister Ghulam Abbas told Dawn that a land-slide hit a motorcycle carrying two riders near Barswat Lake in the Ishkoman Valley of Ghizer district.
The riders were travelling from Imit village to Ishkoman when a falling rock struck them.
He said that Khush Baig, aged 60, a resident of Bilhanz, died on the spot, while Afzal Khan, aged 35, a resident of Barswat, was injured.
After receiving first aid at the Imit Dispensary, the injured man was shifted to the District Head­quarters (DHQ) Hospital in Gah-kuch, where his condition is rep­orted to be stable and out of danger.
The minister said the earthquake severely affected the Chipurson Valley of Upper Gojal in Hunza district. According to initial reports, the access road to the valley was blocked at multiple locations, while several kacha houses and cattle sheds were damaged or collapsed.
Rescue 1122 said that two children and a woman injured in the earthquake in Chipurson village were safely shifted from Chipurson to the Rural Health Centre (RHC) Hospital in Sost after receiving initial medical aid.
Mr Abbas said the Karakoram Highway was also blocked at multiple locations from Nagar to Khunjerab Top due to landslides. He added that machinery from the Gilgit-Baltistan Communi­cation and Works Department was mobilised to clear the roads, and the KKH and several link roads have since been reopened for traffic.
According to Rescue 1122, the most affected area was the Chi­pu­rson Valley in Gojal, Upper Hunza, located near the Pakistan-China bor­­der close to the Khunjerab Pass.
Hunza Deputy Commissioner Nizamuddin told Dawn that Chipurson was the worst-hit area. He said the earthquake’s epicentre was likely located in the surrounding vicinity.
He added that road access to the valley was blocked and, according to initial assessments, several homes, cattle sheds, and public and private properties were damaged. Large cracks developed in parts of the valley, while roads and water channels supplying power houses were also damaged.
The deputy commissioner said damage assessment was under way and would be completed once road access was fully restored. He added that the Chipurson Valley has been experiencing undergro­und tremors for several months.

TEHRAN: Internet access in Iran will “gradually” return to normal this week, a senior official said on Monday, as the government faces international fallout from an 11-day communications blackout imposed during deadly anti-government protests.
The announcement came the same day organisers of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confirmed the Iranian foreign minister would not attend the summit because it would not be “right” following the recent crackdown.
Simultaneously, the United Nations issued a report condemning Tehran for using executions as a “tool of state intimidation”.
“The internet will gradually return to normal operations this week,” Hossein Afshin, Iran’s vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said on Monday on state television.
The government imposed a nationwide communications blackout earlier this month amid huge demonstrations triggered by anger over economic hardship.
Limited internet access briefly returned on Sunday for some foreign websites such as Google, but opening links from search results remained impossible as of Monday.
The shutdown began on Jan 8. Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic Republic’s health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources.
The NGO warned the true toll is likely far higher. The media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not provided an exact death toll.
‘Not right’
Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the Davos su­­mmit in Switzerland this we­­ek, the organisers said, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.
Abbas Araghchi had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday during the annual gathering of the global elite at the upscale Swiss ski resort town.
But activists have been calling on the World Economic Forum organisers to disinvite him amid what rights groups have called a “massacre” in his country.
“The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the World Economic Forum said on X.
“Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added.







‘Intimidation tool’
Iran appears to be using executions “as a tool of state intimidation”, the United Nations said on Monday, as it denounced a jump in capital punishment globally in 2025.
The Islamic republic reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
“The scale and pace of executions suggest a systematic use of capital punishment as a tool of state intimidation, with disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities and migrants,” he warned.
The spike in executions in Iran — which according to rights groups is the world’s most prolific executioner after China — had contributed to “an alarming increase” in the use of capital punishment worldwide last year, Turk said.
While the overall global trend continues to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty, Iran and a handful of other states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States saw executions surge.
“Many of those executions were “for offences not meeting the ‘most serious crimes’ threshold required under international law,” Turk said, also criticising “the continued execution of people convicted of crimes committed as children, as well as persistent secrecy around executions”.

MOSCOW: The White House on Monday extended invitations to leaders from Russia, Poland and Israel to join a so-called “Board of Peace” which aims to address global conflicts and manage governance and reconstruction efforts in Gaza.
While others weigh participation, Central Asian leaders moved quickly to accept. The press secretaries of Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev confirmed their leaders’ readiness to join the board.
Both leaders have been courted by Trump, who invited them to the G20 summit in Miami.
Meanwhile, the Kremlin said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin received an invitation to join the board, which would be chaired by Trump.
“President Putin also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. He said Russia was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington but did not specify if Putin was inclined to join.
Last October, Putin praised Trump’s efforts, noting that “he’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises”.
Additionally, Israel has received an invitation, though it is unclear whether it has been accepted. Furthermore, Polish president’s foreign policy adviser said that President Karol Nawrocki of Poland has also been extended an invitation.
As Washington canvasses for participants, Britain signalled its willingness to play a role. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that the UK was in discussions with allies on the terms of the initiative.
Speaking at a press conference, Starmer indicated Britain is ready to assist in the second phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, particularly regarding the US-led board.
‘Us or them’
However, the initiative faces significant internal headwinds within Israel. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to shut down the US-led Civil Military Coor­dination Centre (CMCC) established last October to support the peace plan.
“The time has come to dismantle the headquarters in Kiryat Gat,” Smotrich said in remarks distributed by his office, referring to the facility where international personnel work on post-war planning.
Smotrich, a far-right cabinet member, argued that Britain, Egypt and other nations “hostile to Israel” should be removed from the coordination centre.
“Mr Prime Minister, it’s either us or them,” Smotrich said. “Either full Israeli control, the destruction of Hamas, and the continued long-term suppression of terrorism … or permanent Israeli settlement.”
Smotrich added that Hamas should be given a short ultimatum to disarm and go into exile, followed by an assault with “full force” if refused.
Netanyahu’s office has not responded to Smotrich’s remarks but has previously criticised the composition of the Gaza Execu­tive Board — a body falling under the Board of Peace authority — citing objections to the inclusion of Turkey and Qatar.
“The head of state sent a letter to the president of the United States expressing sincere gratitude and confirming his agreement to join this new association,” Tokayev’s spokesman, Ruslan Zheldibay, said.
Trump originally proposed the Board of Peace as part of a 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. The White House recently announced the plan is moving to its second phase, focusing on demilitarisation and reconstruction, following a ceasefire in October that saw the release of remaining hostages.
According to a draft charter seen by Reuters, the board is described as an international organisation seeking to secure enduring peace in areas threatened by conflict. Trump has invited 60 countries to join, with permanent membership available to nations that contribute $1 billion.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s nati­onal transmission system, one of the largest in the world, suffers from a damaging mix of overloading and underutilisation, creating operational constraints that unde­rmine merit-based power supply and impose an unquantifiable financial burden on consumers and the national economy, the National Electric Power Regul­atory Authority (Nepra) has said.
In a detailed review of the national grid system, the regulator pointed out that the backbone of the transmission network — 500kV and 220kV lines — remained “mostly overloaded” at the close of FY2024-25. It said the National Grid Company (NGC) faced critical overloading in several sections of its 500kV and 220kV network, particularly during summer peak demand.
“Many grid stations and power transformers are operating beyond 80 per cent of their rated capacity, risking equipment failure, voltage instability and outages,” it said. In FY25, out of 192 transformers across 68 grid stations, 116 were overloaded beyond 80pc, it added.
Providing a breakdown, Nepra said 30 of 47 transformers at the 500/220kV level were overloaded beyond 80pc. In addition, 86 of 145 transformers at the 220/132kV level were overloaded beyond the same threshold.
Regions with notable overloading included Hyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, with persistent constraints at key grids like Gatti, New Multan, Sarfaraz Nagar, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura.
“These limitations have led to reliance on expensive generation in violation of economic merit order (EMO) and rising project costs due to delays,” it said.
Ironically, most of these grid stations at Rawat, Sheikhupura, Gatti, Multan, Yousafwala, Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh have been in an overloaded condition since 2017-18 and onwards.
According to the review, these constraints have limited full power evacuation from the 1,300MW Sahiwal coal-fired plant, overreliance on Attock, Halmore, Sapphire and Liberty, limited transformation capacity in the south-central corridor and aggravated bidirectional power flows in the network.
The regulator called for fast-tracking the completion of critical transmission projects, upgrading existing substations with higher-capacity transformers and reactive power support, and enhancing real-time grid monitoring to address persistent overloading in the transmission network.
It said the resulting financial burden could not be calculated under current conditions because assessing the severity and duration of overloading would require hourly digitised operational data to determine how long a transformer or circuit operated beyond its rated capacity.

 

The regulator warned that transmission system constraints significantly impact the overall efficiency, reliability and affordability of electricity supply. When the transmission network lacks adequate capacity or flexibility, it restricts the flow of power from generation sources to demand centres.
“This leads to congestion, increased transmission losses and underutilisation of low-cost or renewable generation, ultimately raising the overall cost of electricity,” Nepra said.
“Transmission constraints not only raise reliability concerns for consumers but also lead to higher electricity tariffs. This is primarily because, in the absence of adequate transmission capacity, the system must rely on more expensive and less efficient power generation sources, even when cheaper alternatives are available but inaccessible,” it explained.
It said that one of the key challenges in the country’s power sector was the persistent inadequacy of the transmission system, particularly in evacuating electricity from cost-effective and indigenous generation resources located in the southern part of the country.
It noted that the system was often forced to rely on more expensive power plants in the northern region, which significantly increased the overall cost of electricity supply.
Despite the critical importance of resolving these issues, many transmission bottlenecks have remained unaddressed for years. The NGC has consistently failed to resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.
Observations show that nearly every second project undertaken by the NGC suffers from time delays and cost overruns. These delays not only inflate capital costs but also result in operational inefficiencies, such as the forced dispatch of power plants in violation of the EMO, leading to substantial financial losses for the power system.

 

The south-to-north transmission corridor remains a major bottleneck in NGC’s network, limiting the transfer of cost-effective electricity primarily from coal, nuclear and gas plants in the south to key demand centres in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
As a result, the system continues to rely on more expensive residual fuel oil (RFO) and re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation in the north, pushing up generation costs and tariffs.
The regulator cited the example of the overloaded 500kV Jamshoro and Matiari grid stations and their associated lines, which it said restrict power flow to about 1,800MW against available system capacity of 4,500MW. This bottleneck causes frequent load curtailment of up to 1,750MW of cheaper power. Evacuation of more than 2,000MW from Karachi’s two nuclear power plants was another example.
As a related event, the 4,000MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Matiari-Lahore transmission line, commissioned in September 2021 over 878km, still remains underutilised due to delays in completing the 500kV Lahore North substation and related transmission lines.
“This inefficiency imposes a financial burden on end-users despite the line’s full operational readiness,” the regulator said, adding that average loading of the line in FY2024-25 was recorded as 1,401.40MW with utilisation factor at just 35.04pc. There are many other such examples of smaller scale, Nepra noted.
The regulator also highlighted weaknesses in grid monitoring infrastructure. It said the original Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, the telecom backbone operational since 1992, had become obsolete due to the lack of hardware and software upgrades, impairing functionality.

In their petition, Advocate Saleem Michael and Muhammad Haris named the Sindh government, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, chief fire officer, Sindh Emergency Rescue Service director general, South deputy commissioner and director general of civil defence as respondents.
They stated that the “tragedy was not an unavoidable accident but a direct consequence of gross negligence, failure of inspection, non-enforcement of safety laws and maladministration by the respondents who are legally bound to ensure building and fire safety”.
Referring to a 2020 SHC order relating to public safety, fire prevention and protection of human life, the petitioners stated that despite a passage of more than four years, the respondents had “wilfully, deliberately and contumaciously failed to implement” the court directions.
The petitioners pleaded that the court declare that the Gul Plaza incident occurred “due to negligence, maladministration and failure of statutory duties by the respondents”.
They further sought the court’s directions for the respondents to initiate criminal, departmental and contempt proceedings against responsible officials.
The petitioners further urged the court to order a judicial or independent technical inquiry into fire safety compliance at commercial buildings across Karachi.

The restaurant was in the commercial Shahr-i-Naw neighbourhood of Kabul that includes office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said.
The district is considered one of the safest in the city.
The Chinese noodle restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community, Zadran said.
One Chinese national, identified as Ayub, and six Afghans were killed in the blast, which occurred near the kitchen, while several others were injured, Zadran added.
Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a large hole torn into the front of the restaurant building.
“So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCYs Country Director in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“Among the wounded are four women and a child … Unfortunately, seven people were already dead on arrival.”
There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosion. Authorities said they were investigating.
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the bombing and expressed grief over the loss of lives.
“The president conveyed sincere sympathy with the injured and their families and prayed for their early recovery,” the statement read.
“He paid tribute to the spirit of Chinese citizens who have continued to work for the development of Afghanistan despite rising insecurity and serious risks to their lives.”







According to the statement, the president noted the Afghan Taliban regime’s failure to honour commitments made under the Doha Agreement, particularly the obligation to prevent the use of Afghan soil for acts of terrorism.
“He recalled that Pakistan has repeatedly stressed that no terrorist groups should be allowed safe havens in Afghanistan and that regional peace and security must be upheld,” the statement said.
The statement noted that other countries neighbouring Afghanistan, including Tajikistan, were recently affected by terrorists operating from Afghan soil.
“The president further stated that the failure to establish a broad-based and inclusive government by the Taliban is contrary to the Doha Agreement,” the statement added.
“He emphasised that full implementation of the agreement, in letter and spirit, along with concrete steps to end cross-border terrorism, remains essential.”
The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the militant Islamic State group.</p><small>2026-01-19 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1920290271973f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967872/in-first-speech-as-na-opposition-leader-achakzai-vows-unconditional-support-for-strengthening-house' target='_blank'><strong>In first speech as NA opposition leader, Achakzai vows ‘unconditional support’ for strengthening house</strong></a><br><p>In his first speech after being appointed the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday vowed unconditional support for strengthening the lower house of Parliament.
It is worth mentioning that several parts of Achakzai’s nearly 30-minute speech were muted in the NA’s livestream.
At the outset of his address, Achakzai said: “The TTAP makes a promise to the whole country — if you wish to strengthen this house … you will receive our unconditional support.
“Without this house, we are nothing,” he said, adding that the NA should be at the centre of Pakistan’s policies.
“Mistakes happen in the world. Sit, think, sleep on it, as they say in English. What’s happened has happened but having animosity and hurling abuse at each other will not help us,” he said.



Quoting the Holy Quran, Achakzai said that work which focused on welfare and aid must be supported. “Whenever you talk about the public’s welfare, our votes will be with you,” he asserted.
“We want this house to be a reflection of strength … that Pakistan’s domestic and foreign policies emerge from it,” he said.
Achakzai also requested that lawmakers treat each other with respect both inside and outside of parliament and refrain from “saying things you would not say in front of your mothers or sisters”.
In his address, Achakzai also said that he was not someone who “sold his vote”. He asserted that he had not broken the oath he had taken.
In his address, he also talked about PTI founder Imran Khan. He said he was grateful for Imran and the party for nominating him as the NA opposition leader.
He said he was also grateful for NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, for appointing him after a delay.
“For five months, this house functioned without an opposition leader, which is very wrong … these people are the true representatives of this house who voted for me,” he said, gesturing to the opposition benches.
“We are ready to go to any extent for strengthening this house,” he said, as the opposition thumped their benches.
Talking about the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, he said, “I wish they were used for strengthening this house … it is still not too late.”
He asked what the harm was in passing a resolution for withdrawing the cases registered against political workers. “If we pass a resolution for withdrawing the cases against aged women who are jailed, releasing them … if this house says that Imran Khan is the most popular leader … he is in jail and this house unanimously decides that he should be released; the [political] temperature will come down. All this boxing will end,” he said.
“If that cannot happen, then at the very least the bar on meetings with Imran should be lifted,” he said. “We are ready to cooperate with you for any positive development,” he said.
He said that what happened on Feb 8, 2024 had raised the political temperature in Pakistan. “To bring that down, you hold the button. If you lower the pressure, the road for dialogue will open,” he said.
Talking about Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, who has been nominated as the opposition leader in the Senate, he said, “We will cooperate with you in positive developments but excuse us from negative developments.”</p><small>2026-01-19 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19201440ee2cac5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967870/gilani-to-notify-mwm-chief-as-senate-opposition-leader-by-tomorrow-ptis-ali-zafar' target='_blank'><strong>Gilani to notify MWM chief as Senate opposition leader by tomorrow: PTI’s Ali Zafar</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI Senator Ali Zafar said on Monday that Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had communicated to him that Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by tomorrow (Tuesday).
Speaking to Dawn, Zafar said he had submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas.
According to the PTI senator, Gilani had accepted the opposition’s demand of appointing Abbas to the vacant position and said that an announcement about his appointment would also be made in the House.
In a post on X, Zafar said that he had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader.
“[The] chairman informed me that he has approved the appointment and directed the secretariat to issue a formal notification,” Zafar said.
He welcomed the decision, saying that the party would be able convey its perspective in the Senate more effectively.







The opposition leader’s posts in the Senate and the National Assembly (NA) had fallen vacant in August 2025, following the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub, respectively. The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023 riots.
The PTI had then nominated Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot. After a months-long delay, Achakzai was notified as the NA opposition leader last week.
In his letter to Gilani, seen by Dawn, Senator Zafar recalled that the PTI had “duly nominated the honourable Senator Mr Raja Nasir Abbas for the post of the leader of the opposition in the Senate of Pakistan”.
“The continued non-appointment of the leader of the opposition is not only inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, but also runs contrary to well-established democratic traditions and parliamentary conventions,” the letter read.
It added that the “opposition is an indispensable pillar of any democratic system. A House without a formally recognised leader of the opposition remains institutionally incomplete, and its ability to perform its constitutional role of oversight, accountability, and meaningful debate is seriously undermined”.
“Parliamentary democracy rests upon the balance between the treasury and the opposition benches. Denial or delay in recognising the duly nominated leader of the opposition weakens democratic norms, erodes parliamentary decorum, and sets an undesirable precedent inconsistent with constitutional values and democratic practice.
“It is, therefore, once again respectfully requested that, in accordance with Rule 16(3) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, Senator Raja Nasir Abbas may kindly be appointed as leader of the opposition in the Senate of Pakistan at the earliest, in the larger interest of parliamentary democracy and the proper functioning of this august House,” the letter said.
Earlier on Monday, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali also spoke about the matter while talking to the media at the Supreme Court.
Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”.
He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today.
“Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said.
On Saturday, senior PTI leaders imprisoned in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail had demanded in a letter that Abbas be appointed the Senate opposition leader immediately.
The letter by PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and Omar Sarfraz Cheema was shared with the media by their counsel, Rana Mudassir.</p><small>2026-01-19 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19203454f76ad1c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967871/india-uae-sign-3-billion-lng-deal-agree-to-boost-trade-and-defence-ties-at-leaders-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>India, UAE sign $3 billion LNG deal, agree to boost trade and defence ties at leaders’ meeting</strong></a><br><p>India signed a $3 billion deal on Monday to buy liquefied natural gas from the United Arab Emirates, making it the UAE’s top customer, as the leaders of both countries held talks to strengthen trade and defence ties.
The agreement was signed during a very brief two-hour visit to India by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
They pledged to double bilateral trade to $200bn in six years and form a strategic defence partnership.
Abu Dhabi state firm ADNOC Gas will supply 0.5 million metric tons of LNG a year to India’s Hindustan Petroleum Corp for 10 years, the companies said.



ADNOC Gas said the agreement brings the total value of its contracts with India to over $20bn.
“India is now the UAE’s largest customer and a very important part of ADNOC Gas’ LNG strategy,” the company said.
The UAE is India’s third largest trading partner and Sheikh Mohammed was accompanied by a government delegation that included his defence and foreign ministers.
The two sides signed a letter of intent to work towards forming a strategic defence partnership, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters.
India’s arch-rival Pakistan signed a mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia last year, and last week, a minister announced the preparation of a three-way draft defence agreement between Pakistan, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, after being close allies for years, have increasingly diverged over regional policy, with their rift exposed in Yemen, and they have also had disagreements over oil output.
Misri, however, said that the signing of the letter of intent with the UAE does not mean that India will get involved in regional conflicts.
“Our involvement on the defence and security front with a country from the region does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that we will get involved in particular ways in the conflicts of the region,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-19 17:05</small></div><hr>
