• Educational institutions across AJK to remain closed until further notice as civil defence seeks thorough safety sweeps
• Thousands evacuated from LoC need humanitarian assistance
• Affectees lack adequate privacy and safety
MUZAFFARABAD: A day after Pakistan and India agreed to de-escalate tensions, internally displaced persons (IDPs) from vulnerable areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) found themselves caught in a dilemma — torn between the longing to return home and lingering doubts about the durability of the ceasefire.
According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), calm had largely prevailed along the LoC following the ceasefire agreement — except in Barnala sector of Bhimber district, where Indian shelling continued until 10:30 pm on Saturday before finally subsiding.
He said intense shelling had officially displaced around 1,186 families across AJK. However, he acknowledged that several other families had quietly fled their homes without notifying the authorities, meaning the actual number of displaced persons could be higher.
On Sunday, some displaced families began pre­paring to return, but many remained hesitant.
“We are not ready to take the risk just yet,” said Zahida Parveen, a housewife from Bugna Ban Chattar village in Neelum Valley, cradling her infant in a high school building in Lower Plate neighbourhood of Muzaffarabad.
 
 

“It’s our children we’re most worried about. We fled in panic and don’t want to go back unless we’re sure it’s safe.”
Parveen said she and her two sisters-in-law had rushed to Muzaffar­abad with their infants after a brief pause in Indian shelling on Friday.
“We stayed with some relatives for two nights, but they had limited space. So, we’ve moved to this school building and will wait to see what happens on Monday.”
Their fear was compounded by a recent tragedy: a teenage boy in their village was killed by shell fragments just a day earlier.
“We’ll reassess tomorrow after­noon,“said Mahreen Gillani, one of the sisters-in-law, seated beside her.
Outside in the school veranda, Syed Mureed Hussain, 56, from Sandok village, expressed a similar view: “My heart wants to go back, but the children are terrified. The sound of artillery still echoes in their minds.”
He said he planned to stay with relatives on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad for another day or two.
Nazarat Ali Kazmi, 39, another villager, said his trust in the ceasefire was low.
“There was a time when the Indian army raised white flags — a truce signal — and still resumed firing,” he alleged.
However, in Kotli’s Khuiratta Tehsil, many displaced people were more optimistic.
“I’m hopeful this agreement holds. We want to go back to our land,” said Chaudhry Azam, a 55-year-old farmer from Jamairi Kas village, just 200 metres from the LoC.
His home was damaged and livestock killed in Friday’s shelling, forcing him to seek shelter at a friend’s house in Manjwar, four kilometres away.
“People here have been kind, but there’s no place like home — even if it’s damaged,” he said.
“We’ve been told by local officials to wait until Monday noon. One more day won’t hurt.”
Neelum Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua confirmed that return was being encouraged, but with caution.
“These people left voluntarily and are returning voluntarily. All we have advised them is to remain alert until the situation stabilises,” he said.
He added that despite the shelling, life had not come to a complete halt. “Even in the worst days, passenger vans and grocery-laden vehicles continued to operate on the main Neelum road, and we made sure to facilitate them.”
Schools to stay shut
Meanwhile, SDMA Director General Sardar Waheed Khan announced on Sunday that all educational institutions across AJK would remain closed until further notice, pending a decision by a cabinet committee.
“The decision regarding the reopening of schools and colleges will be announced through the SDMA platform,” he said in a post on his social media accounts.
 
 

Separately, in light of recent Indian aggression and unprovoked shelling, Civil Defence Department Director General Abrar Azam urged immediate precautionary measures ahead of any plans to resume academic activities.
In a letter addressed to the divisional commissioners of Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, and Poonch, Mr Azam cited credible reports of suspicious objects, including unexploded ordnance (UXOs), allegedly dropped by Indian forces in civilian areas near the LoC.
“Given the danger posed by unexploded bombs and toy-like explosive devices, it is essential to carry out thorough search-and-sweep operations in all educational institutions before classes resume,” he stressed, urging timely safety measures on part of district administration concerned to ensure the protection of students and staff.
Humanitarian assistance
Thousands of people relocated from villages and their local communities near the Line of Control (LoC) due to drone strikes, indiscriminate cross-border firing, shelling and artillery exchanges, are facing the most severe impacts, needing humanitarian assistance.
Based on the findings of the Rapid Needs Assessment carried out by Islamic Relief Pakistan (IRF), immediate and comprehensive intervention is required to address the multifaceted needs of the affected people.
 
 

A significant limitation was the security risk posed by ongoing cross-border shelling and firing. Access to certain high-risk villages was restricted due to safety concerns, and some visits had to be delayed or rerouted. This limited access to the most affected areas, potentially leading to gaps in data from frontline communities, IRF report says.
The IRF teams collected data across three districts: Muzaffarabad, Bagh and Haveli. The 58pc people residing near the border are also facing protection concerns due to damaged shelters, as many are currently living in public schools and even with relatives, lacking adequate privacy and safety.
The SDMA said a state of emergency has been declared in districts of LOC: Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Jhelum Valley, and Kotli. There are mobility restrictions, road closures, and civilians are advised to evacuate from high-risk zones.
Displaced families are relocating to safer areas with relatives. Schools and essential services remain suspended, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly for women and children.
Assessment results show 58pc of the population lacks access to clean water, hygiene and dignity kits, primarily due to damaged infrastructure and widespread displacement across AJ&K. Many water sources at community level have been destroyed by heavy mortar fire and shelling, further compounding the crisis. Sanitation conditions have also deteriorated considerably, particularly in displacement settings.
As lack of adequate shelter and displacement led to psychological distress, immediate and comprehensive intervention is needed to provide temporary shelters, non-food items, and protection services to address the urgent needs of displaced families.
Due to the lack of proper shelter, many children have been unable to sleep properly, and are increasingly exposed to insect and mosquito bites, significantly raising health and protection risks.
Temporary camp conditions, lack of privacy, and inadequate facilities increase the risk of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.

• Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan’s airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.
In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army’s chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.
He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.
“Twenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,” he said in the presser.
 


Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan’s response was a “textbook demonstration” of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.
“The targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damages,” he added.
The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.
 
 

India launched a series of strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’ soon after the Pahalgam tragedy in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan’s military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.
The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.
“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.”
The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan — “who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country” — and the media that stood as a “steel wall” against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking “destiny-changing decisions” during this testing time
War not an option

Responding to a question about who first requested for the ceasefire, the DG ISPR said: “Put it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.”
He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. “if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,” he added.
He said: “This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations … no pull is also exerted on them.”
IAF airfields hit
Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
 
 

“I must appreciate the leadership … they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,” he said.
“With unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,” the officer said.
“While reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.”
Sea frontiers
Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country’s sea frontiers from a “numerically superior enemy”.
He gave details of the navy’s readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. “We were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea […] we were monitoring it from day one,” he added.
 
 

“On the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,” he said.
“If a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,” he said.
Indian military dodges question
Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‘Operation Sindoor’ were achieved, with ‘high-value terrorists’ being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.
The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the “objective has been achieved”.
Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that “losses are a part of any combat scenario”.
The Indian military said, “We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‘have we achieved our objective’? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.”

• Pakistan welcomes US offer, says settlement must be under UNSC resolutions
• FO says committed to regional peace, security, interested in boosting trade ties with US
WASHINGTON: As hostilities between Pakistan and India come to an end with the help of the US, Pakistan on Sunday welcomed a proposal by President Donald Trump expressing willingness to play an active role for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute by working with both South Asian countries with an aim to put an end to this perennial conflict.
Diplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal on Saturday evening, but within hours of its coming into force, both sides started blaming each other for violations. The reported shelling died down by Sunday dawn.
President Trump, in a statement posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, praised the leadership in New Delhi and Islamabad for agreeing to a ceasefire and credited the US efforts for facilitating this “historic and heroic decision”. “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” the US president said in his message.
 


In a swift response to the remarks made by President Trump, Pakistan’s Foreign Office acknowledged with “appreciation the constructive role played by the United States, alongside other friendly states, in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India”.
The FO in a statement said that Islamabad appreciated President Trump’s expressed “willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute — a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond”.
“Pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,” said the statement, adding that Pakistan was committed to engaging with the US and the international community to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the region.
“We also look forward to deepening our multifaceted partnership with the United States, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and economic cooperation,” it added.
Mr Trump’s Kashmir statement came a day after India and Pakistan agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire along the Line of Control and International Border, following what the US president described as a “long night” of negotiations facilitated by Washington.
 
 

The ceasefire, which came into effect on Saturday, was endorsed by Indian and Pakistani officials shortly after the initial declaration by Mr Trump. Tensions had spiked after Indian forces struck targets in nuclear-armed Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir last week. The flare-up raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
Referring to the role his administration played in defusing the crisis, Mr Trump said, “I am very proud of the strong and unwavering leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to understand that it was time to stop the aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many.”
He warned that “millions of good and innocent people could have died” if both sides had failed to seize the moment. “Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he added.
While the Kashmir issue was not explicitly mentioned in the ceasefire announcement, Mr Trump emphasised his intention to stay engaged on the broader dispute. “I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be found regarding Kashmir,” he wrote, adding that he also intended to “increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.
He also previously referred to Kashmir as a “thousand-year” dispute, a term initially seen as a mistake but later “interpreted” as a way of stressing the deep-rooted and complex nature of the conflict.
“I am very close to India and I’m very close to Pakistan, as you know. And they’ve had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir. Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years, probably longer than that…” he told reporters last month.
Several senior US officials and Republican lawmakers celebrated the ceasefire and credited President Trump for what they described as a landmark moment in regional diplomacy.
“I am incredibly proud to serve alongside Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. This historic administration is working every day to achieve peace. The golden age is coming, and it starts with peace throughout the world,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who is expected to be nominated as US ambassador to the UN, said this was “progress toward stability in a historically volatile region. It won’t be easy, there will be violations, and much work remains to be done, but it is another step in President Trump’s commitment to peace.”
Although India has long resisted third-party involvement in Kashmir, Trump’s repeated references to the conflict—and his offer to work toward a resolution—mark a notable shift in US engagement with South Asia’s most enduring flashpoint.

Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-12 02:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/120727579aedb9b.jpg?r=072939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910380/flight-delays-cancellations-persist-despite-airspace-reopening' target='_blank'><strong>Flight delays, cancellations persist despite airspace reopening</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Despite the reopening of Pakistan’s airspace following the ceasefire with India, flight operations — both domestic and international — remained disrupted across the country on Sunday, causing serious inconvenience to thousands of travellers.
Cancellations and delays of inbound and outbound flights worsened the situation, with two major Gulf carriers yet to resume operations after the airspace was officially reopened by Pakistani authorities on Saturday evening.
The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) had earlier issued a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) restricting the country’s airspace from 4am to 12pm on May 12. However, restrictions were lifted by 6pm on Saturday, after which some domestic flights resumed.
Flight data from Islamabad International Airport showed that 30 scheduled flights — 25 of them operated by international airlines — were cancelled on Sunday.
Similar disruptions were observed at Jinnah Inter­national Airport in Karachi and Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore, where multiple cancellations and delays affected departing and arriving passengers, including intending pilgrims.
Smaller airports in Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Sialkot and Faisalabad also experienced disruptions. Some airlines reportedly prioritised flights to Saudi Arabia for Haj pilgrims over domestic routes, contributing to further delays and cancellations.
 
 

The disruptions persisted despite Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and a few private carriers resuming limited operations. PIA confirmed that 97 domestic and international flights had departed on Sunday, although it acknowledged challenges due to heavy passenger traffic.
A PIA spokesperson acknowledged that the airline’s flights were disrupted due to a rush of travellers but hoped the situation would become normal within the next two or three days.
Operational factors
Aviation expert Qasir Ansari, who served with the national flag carrier for over two decades, explained that the cancellations stemmed from multiple operational factors.
He insisted that flight scheduling requires coordination of aircraft, crew, destination permissions and catering. After the sudden closure and reopening of airspace, foreign and private airlines need time to reorganise resources, he added.
Mr Ansari said that international carriers often deploy crews based on destination requirements, and many employ Indian personnel.
“Amid the prevailing tensions between Pakistan and India, foreign airlines may be re-evaluating the deployment of Indian staff on Pakistan-bound flights,” he said.
However, Mr Ansari hoped that flight schedules would likely become normal within the next 72 hours when all foreign airlines resume their flights.
Among the passengers affected was businessman Khalid Jilani from Swat, who was stranded in Kuala Lumpur after the closure of Pakistani airspace. He told Dawn by phone that he had originally booked a Rs100,000 ticket to return from China via Malaysia, but had to purchase another ticket for the same amount after his flight was cancelled.
“I have also spent Rs5,000 per day on accommodation in Kuala Lumpur, and I’ve been told I will only get a refund of Rs25,000 for the cancelled flight,” he said, adding that he now had a confirmed PIA ticket for Islamabad on Tuesday.
Refunds
In Lahore, Muhammad Imran, an intending pilgrim from Sialkot, told Dawn from the departure lounge of Allama Iqbal International Airport that his Haj flight had been delayed by over 17 hours and was expected to take off at 9pm on Sunday.
 
 

He said that earlier his flight was scheduled for 2:30am and, in line with the schedule, he left Sialkot and had hardly travelled for 15 minutes when he received a call from one of his friends that his flight had been delayed and would depart at about 2pm.
“I returned home and later left for Lahore to get my flight, which was rescheduled for 8:30pm. When I reached the airport, I was informed that my Haj flight was further delayed for 30 minutes. I hope it will not be delayed further,” Mr Imran said.
Travel agent Fakhar Abbas confirmed that some foreign airlines had suspended flights until May 11, but were now working to accommodate affected passengers.
When asked about refunds for cancelled flights, he said each airline has its own policy.
“If a traveller had a non-refundable ticket, they are not eligible for a refund. Those who don’t want to travel on the same airline will be able to get a refund in line with the airline’s policy,” he said.

The increasingly ugly trade spat between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets and raised fears of a global economic slowdown and an inflationary spike in the United States.
“We’ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva after the second day of discussions.
“The talks were productive,” he said, taking no questions but promising a “complete briefing” on the outcome on Monday.
In a statement on Sunday, which did not provide any additional details, the White House hailed what it called a new “trade deal” with China.
China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng told reporters the meetings had achieved “substantial progress,” echoing Bessent’s remarks, and described the atmosphere as “candid, in-depth and constructive.”
“This is an important first step,” he said, adding there were plans for a joint communique to be published Monday.
The two sides have agreed to set up a joint mechanism focused on “regular and irregular communications related to trade and commercial issues”, China’s international trade representative Li Chenggang said at the same briefing.
Asked if the communique would arrive before financial markets opened, Li replied: “If the dishes are delicious, timing is not a matter.”
“Whenever released, it is going to be big, good news,” he said.
The meetings marked the first time senior officials from the world’s two largest economies have met face-to-face over trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China totalling 145 per cent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245pc.
In retaliation, China put 125pc tariffs on US goods.
“These discussions mark a significant step forward and, we hope, bode well for the future,” World Trade Organisation chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in a statement shortly after her own meeting with He Lifeng.
“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.
Devil in the details
“It’s definitely encouraging,” Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) vice president Wendy Cutler told AFP after the talks had concluded.
“The two sides spent over 15 hours in discussions,” she said. “That’s a long time for two countries to be meeting, and I view that as positive.”
Ahead of the meetings at the discrete villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80pc tariff on China seems right!”
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally. China would also need to make concessions, she said.
The fact the talks are even happening “is good news for business, and for the financial markets”, Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview while the talks were ongoing.
But Hufbauer cautioned he was “very sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations”. Even a tariff rate of 70-80pc would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said.
“The devil will be in the details,” said Cutler from ASPI. “Without the details, it’s hard to assess whether the meeting was successful or not.”
‘Great progress!!’
China’s vice premier went into the discussions buoyed by Friday’s news that China’s exports rose last month despite the trade war.
The unexpected development was attributed by experts to a re-routing of trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate US tariffs.
The Geneva meeting comes after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.
The five-page, non-binding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington is willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties. But Trump maintained a 10pc baseline levy on most British goods.
In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said the talks had made “great progress!!”
“We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business,” he added.

This is what international security correspondent Jason Burke wrote in an analysis for Guardian, just a few hours after a ceasefire — brokered by the US — was reached between India and Pakistan.
As the nuclear-armed neighbours announced the breaking news, international media sifted through a swirl of disinformation and conflicting government statements.
The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of drone strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties.
Both sides then launched missiles at each other, which stretched over the week before US President Trump announced yesterday that a “full and immediate ceasefire” was reached between the two countries. There were reports from both sides that the ceasefire had been violated; however, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to adhere to the truce.
Here, Dawn.com looks at some of the reporting and analysis from across the globe on ceasefire, and what comes after it.
The Guardian — If India and Pakistan’s ceasefire holds, the coming weeks will see a new battle: of narratives
“Twenty years ago, a combination of Indian military success and US pressure brought about a shaky peace that survived a round of skirmishes a decade later until being broken again.
“In this new confrontation too, Washington’s influence appears to have been key in bringing about de-escalation. This will not please Russia and China, both manoeuvring for greater influence in the region, even if the reported involvement of Turkey and Saudi Arabia is a useful reminder that the unipolar days of the late 1990s are long gone.
“Casualties this time around have been mercifully low, and economic damage limited. The latter rather than the former may have weighed most heavily in the decision to call a halt to hostilities. Neither nation can afford the kind of destruction and disruption that moving to the next level of war might have entailed. There are ties that bind, as well as much that divides.”
Al Jazeera — India tried to project strength but ended up showing weakness
“The ceasefire announcement by the US president appears to have been perceived by some in India as a sign of the Modi government’s retreat under US pressure while his offer to mediate on Kashmir is being seen as an indication that India’s longstanding rejection of third-party intervention is being undermined.
“In South Asian geopolitics, perception often outpaces reality – until reality bites. India has long projected regional dominance, bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might.”
The Wire — Decisions, Hotlines and Mediators: The US-Led Diplomacy That Led to the India-Pakistan Ceasefire
“While there is no doubt that the technical mechanics of the ceasefire were indeed worked out by the two DGMOs without external mediation, the fact that they spoke and entered into negotiations was clearly the product of a larger diplomatic and political process pushed by Washington — a process in which the leaders of India and Pakistan agreed to set aside the wider military goals they had from the continuing conflict and settle for a truce.

“The [ceasefire] deal doesn’t undo the events of the past two weeks, which will continue to weigh heavily on the minds of many here. The military action has been the most significant between the countries in decades and dozens have died on both sides.
“But their enmity has been enduring, and even with the agreement in place, it feels a bit complacent to assume India and Pakistan will just walk back from the brink.”

Today, however, despite religious differences and divergent value systems, India has emerged as a very significant actor in the Gulf.”

Faced with increasing attacks by militants, especially in KP and Balochistan, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations.
Khanzala Khan, spokesperson to Bannu regional police officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, told Dawn.com that terrorists attempted to abduct three locals in the Landewa Gorobai area of Lakki Marwat.
“Local police immediately launched a search operation after receiving information about the incident,” Khan said. “During the operation, the police had a face-to-face encounter with the terrorists.”
The spokesperson added that terrorists opened fire on the police team, with a policeman sustaining a minor injury.
“However, the police and the DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) present at the scene fought bravely and pushed the terrorists back,” Khan said, adding that police recovered the three abductees. “Three terrorists were injured in the encounter and taken to the mountains by their companions. Two terrorists were killed on the spot.”
The spokesperson added that Lakki Marwat District Police Officer Jawad led a search operation to trace the escaped terrorists.
“Local peace committees cooperated fully with the police,” Khan added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in their first face-to-face meetings since the world’s two largest economies imposed tariffs well above 100 per cent on each other’s goods.
Talks were still underway after 3-1/2 hours on Sunday on the outskirts of Geneva, following eight hours of discussions on Saturday.
Bessent declined to comment to reporters at his hotel before setting off for the talks on Sunday.
But White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the Chinese were “very, very eager” to engage in discussions and rebalance trade relations with the United States.
Hassett also told Fox News that more foreign trade deals could be coming with other countries as soon as this week.
Overnight, US President Donald Trump gave a positive reading of the talks, saying the two sides had negotiated “a total reset … in a friendly, but constructive, manner.”
“A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
 






Trump added: “We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!”
He did not elaborate on the progress.
Speaking on ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ on Fox News with Maria Bartiromo, Hassett said Beijing is eager to re-set trade relations with the United States.
“It looks like the Chinese are very, very eager to play ball and to re-normalize things,” Hassett said.
Hassett also said more trade deal announcements could be imminent following last week’s announcement of an agreement with the United Kingdom, adding that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had briefed Hassett on two dozen pending deals in development with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.
“They all look a little bit like the UK deal but each one is bespoke,” Hassett said.
Gated villa
The negotiating teams met at the gated villa of Switzerland’s UN ambassador, overlooking Lake Geneva in the leafy suburb of Cologny. Black Mercedes vans with sirens shuttled to and from the venue which was bathed in bright sunshine.
Neutral Switzerland was chosen as the venue following approaches by Swiss politicians on recent visits to China and the United States.
Washington is seeking to reduce its $295 billion goods trade deficit with Beijing and persuade China to renounce what the United States says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption, a shift that would require politically sensitive domestic reforms.
 
 

Beijing has pushed back against what it sees as external interference. It wants Washington to lower tariffs, clarify what it wants China to buy more of, and treat it as an equal on the world stage.
China’s official Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary on Saturday that the United States’ “reckless abuse of tariffs” had destabilised the global economic order, but added that the negotiations represented “a positive and necessary step to resolve disagreements and avert further escalation”.
With distrust running high, both sides have been keen not to appear weak, and economic analysts had low expectations of a breakthrough.
Trump said on Friday that an 80pc tariff on Chinese goods “seems right”, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145pc levies he has imposed on Chinese imports.
China could be looking for the same 90-day waiver on tariffs that Washington has given other countries as negotiations take place, while any kind of tariff reduction and follow-up talks would be seen as positive by investors.
China’s He is also provisionally scheduled to meet the director-general of the World Trade Organisation, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, later on Sunday.
Since taking office in January, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145pc, citing unfair trade practices and accusing Beijing of failing to curb the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a lethal synthetic opioid.
China retaliated with 125pc retaliatory tariffs, and said it would not bow to “imperialists” and bullies.</p><small>2025-05-11 16:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/11200013671a684.jpg?r=200243' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910337/sc-hearing-on-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-appeal-in-noor-mukadam-case-set-for-may-13' target='_blank'><strong>SC hearing on Zahir Jaffer’s death sentence appeal in Noor Mukadam case set for May 13</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court of Pakistan is set to hear the appeal against Zahir Jaffer’s death sentence in the Noor Mukadam murder case on May 13, according to its latest cause list, it emerged on Sunday.
Noor, 27, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested from the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge convicted Jaffer of murdering Mukadam, handing him the death penalty along with 25 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000. His household staff, Iftikhar and Jameel — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison, while all other suspects, including Jaffer’s parents and TherapyWorks employees, were acquitted.
According to the cause list available on the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s website, “the hearing on the appeal against Jaffer’s death sentence will be held on May 13.”
Justice Hashim Kakar will head a three-member bench, comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, that will hear the case.
Noor’s father, Shaukat Muqaddam’s appeal against the acquittal of Jaffer’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also set for hearing.
The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case will also be heard.
According to the FIR registered by her father at the time of the murder, he had discovered that his daughter had been “brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”.
In March 2023, the Islamabad High Court upheld the death sentence for Jaffer and also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty.
In April 2023, an appeal in the Supreme Court was filed against the IHC decision to uphold the death sentence.
Last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
Mukadam, a former diplomat, had addressed a press conference to mark the birth anniversary of his slain daughter and demanded swift justice from the top court.</p><small>2025-05-11 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/111639292e8190f.jpg?r=181721' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910317/polish-cyclist-aiming-to-be-1st-to-reach-k2-base-camp-starts-final-leg-of-journey' target='_blank'><strong>Polish cyclist aiming to be 1st to reach K2 base camp starts final leg of journey</strong></a><br><p>Polish cyclist Paweł Małaszko, aiming to be the first person to cycle to the K2 base camp from Karachi, started the final leg of his journey on Sunday.
Małaszko, Aged 46, is cycling to the base camp as part of his adventure to cycle across Pakistan — from the shores of the Arabian Sea to the K2 base camp, the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court provided a permit to the Polish cyclist to complete his adventure earlier this month.
The legal battle between tour operators and GB tourism departments had stopped the issuance of mountaineering and trekking permits for foreigners.
Talking to Dawn, the cyclist said he started his final adventure on Sunday morning from Skardu.
“It is a challenging expedition, my goal is to cover this whole route on a bike. without additional support. If I succeed, I will be the first man in history to do so,” Małaszko said.
Earlier, the Polish cyclist reached Skardu, travelling 3,250 kilometres from Karachi on a bicycle.
“I am an athlete and an avid traveller, deeply engaged in challenging cycling expeditions. I am currently undertaking an ambitious project titled the ‘K2 Base Camp Bike Expedition’, with the goal of cycling across the entire length of Pakistan — from the shores of the Arabian Sea all the way to the K2 base camp, Paweł Małaszko told Dawn.

The Polish cyclist said the ongoing Pakistan and India tension never affected his adventure.
He added that the most technical and challenging section is from Skardu to the K2 base camp.
When asked, he said, “On the way to K2 base camp, there are glaciers, a mountainous route, a steep hike; however, at some sections, I will put my bicycle on the back and travel myself.
“Through GPS I will be monitored, at some points of K2 basecamp trek, it is not possible to cycle, at that points I will put my cycle at my back and will carry it myself, without any support, when I complete the expedition, I will tell at how many distance I have put my cycle at my back and carried it.”
He said he aims to cover the last 200 kilometres from Skardu to K2 base camp in 14 days.
Legal troubles stall journey
The Polish cyclist had started his adventure from Karachi on April 4.
However, his adventure was stalled as the required permit to go to the popular tourist destination couldn’t be issued due to an ongoing legal battle.
Last year, the GB government hiked permit fees for mountaineering and trekking expeditions by 300 per cent under the GB Finance Act, 2024.
The region’s tour operators challenged the decision in court, which issued a stay order, effectively suspending the issuance of new permits.
“When I was on the way, I was informed by my tour operator “, that issuing trekking permits has been suspended by the GB tourism department.
However, when I reached Gilgit after covering above 2000 kilometres, I approached the GB Chief Court during the hearing date of the case.
In the GB court, the foreigner requested the Chief Court judges to help him obtain the necessary permissions to complete this unique and historic journey — the first of its kind.
In the court, the Polish cyclist told the judge that this expedition was not only a personal dream but also an opportunity to promote Pakistan as a destination for adventure and exploration throughout Europe and beyond.
“I have invested significant effort and dedication into this endeavour, and your help would mean the world to me,” he added.
A GB Chief Court judge, after listening to his plea, ordered the GB tourism department to issue a permit at the previous rates on May 3.
After the Court order, the GB tourism department granted a trekking permit to the Polish cyclist.
However, permits for other foreigners couldn’t be issued until the court gives a clear directive.
The journey so far
Małaszko said Pakistan is a large country with different cultures in different regions. different climates. From Karachi to Multan, I had 46 degrees of heat every day.
“At that stage, I had to drive at night and early in the morning to avoid having a sunstroke,” he continued.
The Polish cyclist said that the hospitality among people is very high and that they try to be helpful in every aspect.
“This applies to the whole of Pakistan. I was very pleasantly surprised by the good condition of the roads, even the side roads. With small exceptions, it is really good,” he said.
The mountains and the Karakoram Highway are a different story.

He said no one can influence how the mountains behave and whether they destroy the roads, adding, “It is not man’s fault or negligence. That’s the case with the mountains.”
He continued that the temperature range he experienced was from 46 to -10 on the Khunjerab top.
Meanwhile, since the stay order by the GB Chief Court, the tourism department has stopped issuing permits to foreign adventurers.
The matter has been pending for more than two months since a hearing could not be held due to the lawyer’s strike.</p><small>2025-05-11 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/111616030b0171a.jpg?r=161713' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910314/trilateral-dialogue-afghan-taliban-govt-seeks-constructive-engagement-with-pakistan-china' target='_blank'><strong>Trilateral dialogue: Afghan Taliban govt seeks constructive engagement with Pakistan, China</strong></a><br><p>The Afghan government under the Taliban has called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.
The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.
“Minister of Interior Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani emphasised the importance of strengthening regional ties, stating that, from the Islamic Emirate’s perspective, the advancement of economic and political relations, as well as regional understanding, can be achieved through mutual respect and constructive engagement,” the Afghan interior ministry said.
It added that the special envoys of China and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening good neighbourly relations and fostering cooperation with Afghanistan based on mutual engagement. They also agreed that the sixth round of the trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers would be held in Kabul, continuing the established mechanism.
Separately, in a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said: “The meeting aimed to follow up on the fifth trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers of the three countries, held in Islamabad; prepare for the upcoming sixth ministerial round; and strengthen three-way political and economic cooperation.”
“The delegations emphasised their commitment to good neighbourly relations, regional stability, mutual respect, and constructive engagement as foundations for stronger ties,” he added.
 






Meeting with Afghan FM
Separately, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi held a meeting in Kabul with the Pakistani and Chinese special envoys and their accompanying delegations.
In a statement, the ministry said the meeting “focused on following up on the agenda of the fifthth round of the Afghanistan-China-Pakistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue”.
The fifthth round, which was held in Islamabad in May 2023, had “stressed on the need of not allowing any individual, group or party, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) etc., to use their territories to harm and threaten regional security and interests, or conduct terrorist actions and activities”.
Kabul’s trilateral meeting on May 10 decided that the sixth round of the Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue would be convened in Kabul, with preparatory measures also to be undertaken for the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries.
However, no date was announced for the trilateral meeting. “Underscoring the importance of political and economic relations with both countries, FM Muttaqi expressed hope for continued progress in these areas,” the statement added.
In a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said the meeting provided the occasion for convergence of views on economic and security cooperation as well as regional stability.
 






Meeting with Afghan commerce minister
Earlier, the Chinese and Pakistani envoys also met Afghan Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi. According to the ministry, the meeting aimed at strengthening and developing trade relations, attracting investment, and launching joint projects between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.
The meeting discussed key issues including the establishment of joint industrial parks in Afghanistan, the establishment of special economic zones, the launch of joint export processing centres, the holding of trilateral trade fairs, the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprise support centers in Afghanistan, and the facilitation of banking relations between the three countries were discussed and exchanged.
Azizi expressed gratitude for the presence of high-ranking representatives of Pakistan and China and emphasised the importance of joint and mutual cooperation, the statement said.
“The policy of the Islamic Emirate is economy-oriented, and we organise and implement programs to attract foreign investment based on this policy, taking into account common interests,” it quoted Azizi as telling the special envoys.

On May 4, four Pakistani climbers began their expedition to climb Dhaulagiri, located in Nepal. Sadpara had reached the base camp of the peak on April 6 and had begun his rotation and climbed up to the Camp 3 and descended to the base camp.
The feat, confirmed by the Alpine Club of Pakistan, marks Sadpara’s ninth 8,000m peak, all of which were climbed without bottled oxygen and were completely unsupported.

In a statement, Seven Summit Treks said the team successfully reached the summit starting at 9:35am on Saturday, marking the first confirmed ascent of Dhaulagiri in the Spring 2025 season.
The expedition team had previously fixed ropes up to 8,050m and launched their final summit push during a favourable weather window.
The team began their summit push from Camp IV at 6:15pm on Friday, making relentless efforts to reach the top while simultaneously securing the final section of the route by fixing over 350m of rope.
This year, Kangchenjunga has seen an impressive turnout, with nearly 70 international climbers and an equal number of Sherpas taking on the challenge.
“At just 29 years old, Sajid has displayed remarkable endurance, resilience, and dedication to high-altitude mountaineering,” the Alpine Club of Pakistan said in a statement.
His Dhaulagiri expedition was organised by Seven Summit Treks Nepal and Sabroso Pakistan, with technical gear sponsored by Kailas.
“[Sadpara] is the proud son of the legendary Muhammad Ali Sadpara, who tragically lost his life during a winter ascent of K2 in 2021. Carrying his father’s legacy with honour, Sajid has emerged as a powerful symbol of Pakistani mountaineering strength and global excellence.
Karrar Haidri, secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, congratulated Sadpara, calling it “a historic milestone that reflects the strength and courage of Pakistani climbers on the world stage”.
“This is another proud moment for Pakistan and the mountaineering world!”
While speaking to Dawn.com before beginning his summit push, Sadpara had said he would attempt to climb the peak without supplement oxygen and porter support.
Sadpara has already summited eight of the world’s peaks above 8,000m, including Everest, K2 , Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, and Gasherbrum-II.
He has also taken part in rescue operations at several peaks including K2, and plans to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000m.
Sadpara has made a name for himself in the alpine community with his summits of the most daunting peaks at a young age.
He has climbed K2 twice; once without supplemental oxygen. He also set records when he summited both Gasherbrum-I and Gasherbrum-II peaks in three days and 18 hours without supplementary oxygen.
In February 2021, his father Muhammad Ali Sadpara, Iceland’s John Snorri and Chile’s Juan Pablo Mohr went missing while attempting to summit the K2 during the winter season.
Their bodies were found in July, nearly five months after they went missing.
Sadpara described the search for the bodies of his father and other missing climbers as “the most challenging and extraordinary mission” of his life.
“First, the summit of K2 itself was a dangerous adventure and the burial of my father above eight thousand metres was heartbreaking,” he said.
“It was impossible to take the bodies back to base camp so we decided to bury them on the mountain.”
Now, Sajid Sadpara said his mission to summit all 14 peaks above eight-thousand metres altitude without supplementary oxygen would be the fulfilment of his father’s dream.
For him, climbing was something he was born to take up.
“When you get an environment where you listen and practice only to become a mountaineer, you definitely become one,” he explained while talking about his father’s training.</p><small>2025-05-11 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/11155012a0854cc.jpg?r=155053' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910312/bus-carrying-pilgrims-crashes-killing-21-in-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Bus carrying pilgrims crashes killing 21 in Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>An overcrowded bus carrying dozens of Buddhist pilgrims plummeted into a precipice in Sri Lanka on Sunday, killing at least 21 and injuring 24, a senior transport official said.
The island nation’s winding roads are among the most dangerous in the world, and the crash off a cliffside road on Sunday was among the deadliest recorded in Sri Lanka in decades.
The roof and side panels of the bus were sheared off, and more than half the seats were ripped from the floor of the vehicle, which landed wheels up into a tea plantation, photos of the wreckage showed.
The state-owned bus was carrying around 70 passengers — about 20 more than its capacity — through the central hilly region of Kotmale when the driver lost control and it veered off the road before dawn, police said.
“We are trying to establish whether it was a mechanical failure or if the driver fell asleep at the wheel,” a local police official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to media.
Deputy Transport Minister Prasanna Gunasena told reporters at the scene that the injured were rushed to two area hospitals.
“Twenty-one have died and we are trying to identify the victims,” Gunasena said.
The toll could have been higher, the minister added, if not for local residents helping pull people from the mangled wreckage and rushing them to hospital.
Police said 24 people were being treated in the two hospitals.
One survivor told a local journalist that he had been in the front section of the bus and was lucky to have escaped with only minor injuries.
“The bus was leaning to the left side and as the driver was negotiating a bend, he lost control and it fell down the precipice,” said the man, who did not give his name, in a video seen by AFP.
The bus was travelling from the pilgrim town of Kataragama in the island’s deep south to the central city of Kurunegala, a distance of about 250 kilometres.
Sri Lanka records an average of 3,000 road fatalities annually, making the island’s roads among the most deadly in the world.
Sunday’s bus accident was one of the worst in the country since April 2005, when a driver attempted to beat a train at a level crossing in the town of Polgahawela. The bus driver was lightly injured, but 37 passengers were killed.
In March 2021, 13 passengers and the driver of a privately owned bus died when the vehicle crashed into a precipice in Passara, about 100 kilometres east of the scene of the crash on Sunday.</p><small>2025-05-11 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/11151021fc62c86.jpg?r=151153' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910306/us-china-talks-resume-as-trump-hails-total-reset-in-trade-relations' target='_blank'><strong>US-China talks resume as Trump hails ‘total reset’ in trade relations</strong></a><br><p>Talks between top US and Chinese officials resumed for a second day on Sunday, after US President Donald Trump voiced optimism over the negotiations aimed at de-escalating trade tensions sparked by his aggressive tariff rollout.
In a Truth Social post following the first day of talks in Geneva on Saturday, Trump praised the “very good” discussions and deemed them “a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner”.
Earlier, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua also described the talks in Switzerland as “an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue”.
The second day of closed-door meetings between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng resumed shortly after 10am (1pm PKT) on Sunday.
As of Saturday, the talks were taking place at the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, a discrete villa with sky-blue shutters near a large park on the left bank of Lake Geneva.
“These talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,” Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told AFP, calling the tariffs a “lose-lose proposition”.
‘Good news’
The discussions are the first time senior officials from the world’s two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the thorny topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking a robust retaliation from Beijing.
The tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 per cent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245pc.
In retaliation, China put 125pc tariffs on US goods.
Ahead of the meeting, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80pc Tariff on China seems right!”
However, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and that China would also need to make concessions.
Going into the meeting, both sides played down expectations of a major change in trade relations, with Bessent underlining a focus on “de-escalation” and not a “big trade deal,” and Beijing insisting the United States must ease tariffs first.
The fact that the talks are even happening “is good news for business, and for the financial markets,” said Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
But Hufbauer cautioned he was “very skeptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations,” with even a tariff rate of 70pc to 80pc still potentially halving bilateral trade.</p><small>2025-05-11 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/111221184eb3c02.jpg?r=122656' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910172/imf-wants-cut-in-auto-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>IMF wants cut in auto tariffs</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The local auto industry and its suppliers are facing uncertainty ahead of the FY26 budget as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is reportedly pressuring the government to rationalise auto tariffs and permit the commercial import of used cars.
The IMF believes the auto sector is highly protective, and there is a need to rationalise tariffs to improve competitiveness and efficiency to benefit consumers. There are over 40 per cent taxes and duties on locally produced vehicles.
On May 6, auto assemblers and part vendors met Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAMP) Haroon Akhtar Khan in Islamabad and conveyed their concerns that the local industry would collapse if commercial imports of used cars are allowed and tariffs on CBU are lowered below a certain threshold.
The SAPM assured them that the government did not intend to jeopardise the industry and the investments. On the contrary, the ministry will protect the local industry and try to achieve balanced tariffs with industry consultation.
The old guards within the local assemblers and parts vendors are alarmed as the government moves to rationalise the excessively high tariff protection under the IMF’s direction.

Assemblers fear collapse of industry if used cars’ commercial import allowed

The part makers have been operating under the highest tariff protection, enjoying effective rates as high as 98pc. The landed price of any part is valued at $100, with 46pc duty, 18pc GST, and minimum 15pc margins, totalling $198.
 
 

They stressed this entire burden must be borne by consumers, who are already grappling with inflation and stagnant wages. The IMF, recognising the extraordinarily high effective tariff protection rate, has recently directed the government to rationalise the tariffs under the latest standby arrangements.
This will provide a lot of relief to consumers, as prices may be adjusted with a reduced duty structure. The old guards within Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam) wish to maintain the highly inefficient tariff structure and are seeking meetings with government officials to resist IMF demands.
Their usual arguments are that any reduction in tariffs will cause irreparable damage to the industry without addressing the core issue of overprotection and excessive pricing of parts in the market.
However, auto parts vendors, under the umbrella Paapam, believe that their competitiveness can be judged through the supply of Rs325 billion worth of auto parts to the local industry, estimating a foreign exchange saving of minimum $480 million annually, along with collateral advantage of direct jobs of over 150,000 and over 500,000 indirect jobs through Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers, besides providing taxes separately to the state coffers.
During the first stage, the government has proposed to rationalise tariffs by five per cent to 10-15pc, along with gradual reduction in additional customs duty (ACD) and regulatory duty (RD). The tariff reduction on higher engine size CBU is proposed to be much higher.
Part makers contest that their pricing are generally on a landed cost (minus) model, thus saving foreign exchange and assuring price stability, though their competitiveness can be judged if they can compete on FOB cost instead of landed cost.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Industries has been questioning part makers and local assemblers that if they are indeed competitive and produce global quality parts and vehicles, then why have they not been able to export from Pakistan?
Many Paapam members have invested in modern technologies, followed by joint ventures and technical collaborations with various foreign companies. Over 40 Paapam members are also exporting parts to Europe, Africa, the US and China, though the exports are negligible.
Paapam disagrees with the IMF impression that the Pakistani automotive sector rests upon a highly supportive tariff-protective sector.
An auto assembler said rationalisation of auto tariffs, along with added competition by new entrants, will help the government reduce vehicle prices and may also help in improving sluggish demand in the auto sector.

As the attackers attempted to flee, the police constable present at the scene took immediate action and chased one of the attackers.
The timely police action led to one attacker, Shah Jahan, being killed, while the other, Shahzad, was seriously injured.
In the exchange of fire, however, policeman Muhammad Khamari was martyred.

ISLAMABAD: Norma­lity returns to the Sub­continent after Pakistan and India agreed on Saturday to a full and immediate ceasefire after days of deadly jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — news surprisingly announced by US President Donald Trump, who congratulated them on using “common sense”.
Officials from Islam­abad and New Delhi confirmed the development mi­­n­utes after Mr Trump posted the ann­ouncement on his Truth Social net­work, as the conflict bet­ween the nuclear-armed neighbours appeared to be spiralling towards a full-blown war.
“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congra­tulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” Mr Trump posted.
In a statement on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect. Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added.
 






Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the two countries’ military operations chiefs had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT), without using the word “ceasefire”. He said the two DGMOs would speak to each other again on May 12.
Mr Dar told Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had actively helped to facilitate the agreement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US Presi­dent Donald Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region. “Pakistan appreciates the US for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” he said in a post on X.
 






The ceasefire comes after four days of attacks and counter-attacks by both sides that killed at least 60 people and saw thousands of civilians flee their homes along their border as well as in Azad and occupied Kashmir.
The fighting was touched off by an attack last month in the India-held Kashmir town of Pahalgam that killed 26 tourists, which Delhi blamed on Islamabad.
Pakistani military sources said armed forces had shot down at least 77 Israeli-made high-tech drones, while Indian officials claimed they had destroyed hundreds of Pakistani drones, many Turkish-made.
Pakistan also says it downed five Indian warplanes — including three French Rafale fighter jets — although New Delhi has not confirmed any losses.
This was the first time the two nations used drone attacks on a large scale against each other. Both countries have been developing their own drones, and they also import them.
Punitive measures in place
Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now.
The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Pahalgam attack, would continue to remain in abeyance.
Meanwhile, in contradiction to Mr Misri’s statement that the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of Pakistan and India would “talk again on May 12 at 12pm (11:30am Pakistan time)”, the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting reported that “there is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place”.
Quoting its Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian information ministry tweeted that the “stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries”.
“The Pak DGMO initiated the call this afternoon after which discussions took place and understanding reached,” it added.
Positive step
“The ceasefire is a positive step,” said Bilal Shabbir, an IT consultant in Muzaffarabad. “In war, it’s not just soldiers who die, it’s mostly civilians — and in this case, it would have been the people of Kashmir.”
Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, said both Pakistan and India “need to lift their large populations on virtually every measure of socio-economic development. We are happy that a ceasefire will help both governments to focus on this priority”.
Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, said the Indus treaty would figure prominently in the impending talks “after a decent interval, which allows both governments to claim credit for what they’ve achieved until now”.
However, within hours after the ceasefire, violations were reported from both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).
Blasts were heard in Srinagar and Jammu and projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky over Jammu, similar to the events of the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.
Residents in the city of Barnala, in Azad Kashmir, reported hearing exchan­ges of fire along the line dividing the region, according to the New York Times.
Military spokespeople in both countries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Separately, occupied Kashmir’s chief minister Omar Abdullah posted on X: “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!”
 






There were also reports from different border regions of skirmishes. Some reports also said that drones were spotted hovering over Bahawalpur.
Dawn learnt that the drones were spotted after Isha prayers, prompting citizens to come out of their homes. However, sources said the presence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is not a matter of concern as it may happen for a few days after a truce is brokered.
When contacted the district emergency officer, Police Emergency 15, Rescue 1122 Emergency Office and other security institutions, it was told that the situation was being cleared.
Deputy Commissioner Bahawalpur Dr Farhan Farooq told this scribe, via WhatsApp message, that “all intercepted” and no damage so far, Alhamdolillah“.
Rubio lauds PMs
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later revea­led that he and Vice President JD Vance had been in direct contact with senior Pakistani and Indian officials, including Prime Ministers Shehbaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, over the past two days.
In a statement released by his office, Mr Rubio said: “Over the past 48 hours, Vice President Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, and National Security Advisors Ajit Doval and Asim Malik.”
 






He added, “I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.”
He also commended PMs Sharif and Modi on “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.”
Mr Vance, who had earlier said the conflict was “fundamentally none of our business”, also endorsed the deal by reposting Mr Trump’s statement on X.
“Great work from the president’s team, especially Secretary Rubio,” Mr Vance wrote. “And my gratitude to the leaders of India and Pakistan for their hard work and willingness to engage in this ceasefire.”
 






In a separate statement, State Department Spokes­person Tammy Bruce said that Mr Rubio spoke with Mr Dar. “Secretary Rubio reiterated that both parties must find ways to de-escalate the current situation and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation. He also offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts,” she added.
Ms Bruce said that Mr Rubio also spoke with the Indian foreign minister and “emphasised that both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation”.
Secretary Rubio “further proposed US support in facilitating productive discussions to avert future disputes”, Ms Bruce added.
PM calls for dialogue
Hours after the ceasefire was announced, PM Shehbaz on Saturday expressed hope that a process of peace dialogue would take place to resolve all contentious issues between the two nuclear states, including fair distribution of water resources and the Kashmir issue.
In his address to the nation, the prime minister said Pakistan responded positively to the option of ceasefire for international and regional peace and for the sake of millions of people in the subcontinent.
He thanked opposition parties, political forces and friendly nations, including the United States, for their constructive and effective role in de-escalating tensions.
 


“We responded positively to the option of ceasefire for the sake of international and regional peace and millions of people,” PM Shehbaz said.
The premier extended special thanks to China and President Xi Jinping, saying, “China stood by Pakistan without concern for any personal gain or loss.”
He also expressed gratitude to other world leaders, including the US President Donald Trump, Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, and UN Secretary General António Guterres.
The prime minister congratulated the whole nation and armed forces for the victory in the standoff with India and said: “Today we got a historic victory. It is the victory of our principles.”
The premier said India played a shameful role in these days and Pakistani nation and armed forces gave a befitting response to the enemy what it deserved.
“In the pretext of Pahalgam incident, India imposed war on us and attacked our civilian population through drones and missiles. Then we decided that the issues which should have been resolved through dialogue, will be settled in battlefield,” he added.
Dar engages counterparts
Foreign Minister Dar also talked to his counterparts in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye and apprised them of the current situation in the region following last night’s Indian aggression and Pakis­tan’s subsequent response.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged Pakistan’s restraint and reaffirmed that China would continue to stand firmly by Pakistan.
Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan expressed condolences over the loss of innocent lives and appreciated Pakistan’s measured response.
Turkish Foreign Minister  Hakan Fidan also lauded Pak­istan’s restrained response.

The decision, announced late Saturday, follows days of street protests led by the student-driven National Citizen Party, which emerged from last year’s uprising that toppled Hasina.
Several Islamist and right-wing parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami and other opposition groups, joined the demonstrations, demanding that the Awami League be designated a terrorist organisation.
The ban would remain in place until the trial of the party and its leadership over the deaths of hundreds of protesters at the International Crimes Tribunal is completed, the government said in a statement.
The government also announced an amendment to the ICT Act, allowing the tribunal to prosecute not only individuals but also political parties and organisations. The change clears the way for the Awami League to be tried as a collective entity for alleged crimes committed during its time in power.
The Awami League, which was founded in 1949, dismissed the decision as illegitimate, posting on its official Facebook page: “All decisions of the illegal government are illegal.”
The country has seen rising tensions and protests in recent months, after deadly protests forced Hasina to flee to India in August and an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge.
Yunus pledged reforms and said the poll could be delayed until 2026.
The unrest began in July with student protests against public sector job quotas, but quickly morphed into one of the deadliest periods of political violence since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971.
In October, the government banned the Awami League’s student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, labelling it a “terrorist organisation” for its role in violent attacks on protesters.</p><small>2025-05-11 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1111450658a6b14.jpg?r=114527' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910253/people-in-lahore-celebrate-pakistan-armys-victory-over-india' target='_blank'><strong>People in Lahore celebrate Pakistan Army’s victory over India</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: People burst into celebrations after the armed forces early on Saturday responded to Indian war hysteria in a befitting manner and brought India to its knees. They celebrated the victory of the army after the ceasefire was announced in the wake of the US intervention.
Earlier in the day, Lahore also faced the first missile attack on Saturday that struck the Sundar Industrial Estate and, according to law enforcement agencies, sank into the ground. No loss of life or injury was reported. People, however, were skeptical over Pakistan’s delayed response to India’s ‘Operation Sindoor’ and aggressively asked for a befitting response. All the skepticism, however, evaporated when the army announced the launch of Bunyan-um-Marsoos and launched a powerful and well-coordinated military operation, targeting Indian military infrastructure.
As the Pakistan Army came out, saying it had avenged the blood of the innocent kids martyred in missile and drone attacks, the people shared the pictures of army artillery trucks and chanted slogans “Pakistan Zindabad. Pakistan Army Paindabad”. They took to the roads, organised rallies showing a national unity across the party lines and lauded the army for its calculated and meaningful response that even brought the mighty US to intervene and agree on a ceasefire between the neighbouring nuclear nations.
The ruling PML-N held a rally on The Mall to celebrate the success of the operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos against India. Paying tributes to the army’s befitting reply to the Indian airstrikes, the Lahorites burnt Indian and Israeli flags as well as an effigy of Indian premier Narendra Modi.

Rallies held in support of army and operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos; home dept asks law enforcement, civil defence to stay alert

Since India has been cut to size and licking its wounds, the rally participants asserted that Pakistan should not get relaxed but to win another war at the diplomatic front and ensure restoration of the Indus Waters Treaty as well as the legal status of India-held Kashmir.
As the nation showed unity in celebrating the victory and congratulating the Pakistan Army, a rally participant said, “The nation was divided and Indian Premier Modi’s false pride and arrogance helped it to unite across party lines”.
After the ceasefire, tributes and congratulation messages for the Pakistan Army’s bravery and war-ready spirit also poured in from all segments of the society and political leaders as well as PML-N president Mian Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and other political leaders across party lines. People were seen presenting flowers and garlanded army men wherever they came across them in the province.
The social media sites X, Instagram and Facebook were flooded with memes and shattered India’s propaganda, sensationalism and even serious statements and communications aimed at pressurizing Pakistanis.
As the airports opened for resuming flight operations and the expected resumption of academic and examination activities at all academic levels, students have also urged the ICAP to withdraw its notification of postponing next week’s examinations and proceed with the already notified schedule.
Earlier, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved the release of Rs2bn for emergency security arrangements in all districts and training of volunteers to enable them to deal with any emergency.
After the home department released the funds and the finance department made them available online, the respective district administrations were specifically instructed to ensure the availability of essential goods, including rations, medicines and fuel.
Though the ceasefire has been declared after the US intervention, the home department has asked all law enforcement agencies, civil defence and rescue services to stay on high alert. A home department spokesman urged the citizens not to post any videos or pictures on social media about the location of defence installations and the movement of law enforcement agencies. The citizens have also been instructed to avoid unnecessary travel, stay at home and follow the safety measures issued by the civil defence.

ISLAMABAD: After demonstrating restraint in the face of blatant Indian aggression since Wednesday, Pak­istan launched strikes early Satur­day morning targeting military installations in India and India-held Kashmir.
The strikes were launched under operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos at 5:16am.
“Bunyan-um-Marsoos” translates as a concrete structure or firm foundation.
 






The missiles, launched by aircraft and ground-based systems, targeted multiple strategic and military sites of India, security sources and state media reported.
According to the military’s media wing and Radio Pakistan, the targeted locations included S-400 missile system in Adampur; military intelligence’s training ce­n­tre in Rajouri and brigade hea­d­quarters in Uri; Adampur, Udha­mpur, Pathan­kot, Suratgarh, Sirsa, Bathinda and Halwara airfields; Akhnoor aviation base; artillery gun positions in Dehrangyari; Brahmos missile battery site in Nagrota; Brahmos storage site in Beas; and India’s Rabtanwali Post, Jazeera Post Complex, Kafir Mehri, Shahpar 3, and Ghadar Top across the Line of Control (LoC).
ISPR said PAF’s JF-17 Thunder hypersonic missiles destroyed the S-400 missile system in Adampur.
The strikes came hours after India fired missiles at three air bases in Rawlpindi, Chakwal and Shorkot, as well as the Rahim Yar Khan
airport.
All assets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) remained safe in the attack, the military spokesman said.

Pakistan has targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation, the federal government said in a statement.
“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes at three PAF airbases.
The retaliatory attacks targeted “more than 26” locations and damaged “equipment and personnel” at at least five airbases, according to Colonel Sophia Qureshi of India’s Army Signal Corps.
The damage was sustained at air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur, Bhuj and Bathinda, Col Qureshi said, according to Times of India.
India’s attack India launched missiles and drones in its late-night attack, which were shot down by ground defence systems in Punjab and Sindh.
The strikes targeted Nur Khan air base, Rawalpindi; Murid air base, Chakwal; and Shorkot air base, Inter Service Public Relations (ISPR) DG Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at a press conference.
 


Two missiles fired by India at the Shorkot airbase were shot down by the air defence system, officials said.
The debris of destroyed missiles fell near a government primary school in Pirmahal village.
No casualties were reported, while Zahoor Ahmad, 70, received minor injuries after being hit by falling debris.
A drone fired by India fell in open fields in the Ahmad Nigar village on on Chiniot-Sargodha Road.
A large number of locals gathered at the site to view the wreckage of the fallen drone.
Debris of three downed Indian drones also fell in fields in Islam Nagar village, Chak Noor Muh­ammad 11/SP and Bheela near village 13/SP during the past 36 hours.
It was collected by the police officers who took it away for further analysis.
Drones were also intercepted in Sargodha.
One of the drones fell in the area of Kirana Hills and another in open fields in Chak 48 SB village.
No casualties were reported in any of these localities.
At least four drones were also shot down in different areas of Jacobabad, Sindh, on Saturday, according to Deputy Commissioner Sameer Hussain Laghari.
The debris of scattered drones fell near the Jacobabad Institute of Medical Science and the Shah Abdul Latif Numaish (Exhibition) Ground.
Locals reported sounds of explosions as smoke filled the sky, as drones were intercepted by the ground defence systems.
According to DC Leghari, at least eight people were injured after being hit by fragments of destroyed drones. One man, who was critically injured, had been transferred to Larkana for treatment.
He added the debris had been taken into custody by the authorities.
Shelling at border
At least six people were martyred and five injured as India fired shells in Tanda and Karianwala areas of Gujrat.
The deceased included three members of a family, including a man and his two sons.
They were killed after mortar shells hit their house in Jalalpur Sobtian village of Karianwala early on Saturday morning.
The victims were identified as Nisar Ahmed, 45; Habeebur Rehman, 18; and Naeem, 12.
Mr Ahmed’s third son, Muneeb, 17, was injured and undergoing treatment at the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital.

DEBRIS is strewn across the runway and lounge of Sheikh Zayed International Airport after it was hit by a missile fired by India on Saturday.—Dawn

RAHIM YAR KHAN: The Sheikh Zayed International Airport (SZIA) in Rahim Yar Khan district of Punjab — a landmark viewed as a symbol of friendship between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates — was struck by an air-to-surface missile fired by India in the early hours of Saturday, causing significant damage to its infrastructure, including the Royal Lounge used by the UAE president and his family.
Deputy Commissioner Khuram Javed confirmed that India targeted the airport with both a missile and a drone.
He said the airport is occasionally used by the Abu Dhabi royal family, as commercial flight operations have been suspended since 2023.
The attack destroyed the Royal Lounge, and a 10-foot-wide crater was left at the apron area of the airport.
The deputy commissioner also confirmed that the UAE embassy has been informed about the damage caused to the airport.
 


Locals living near the airport reported hearing loud blasts around 4:15am on Saturday, which caused many to wake up in alarm.
Named after the late UAE president Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the airport serves as a vital part of Pakistan’s aviation network and carries diplomatic importance because of its ties to the Gulf nation.
According to Civil Aviation Authority’s website, the airport played a vital role during 1973 and 2010 floods for logistics support, including food and other supplies, as well as transportation of flood victims.

MUZAFFARABAD: In yet another night of devastation along the Line of Control (LoC), Indian troops resorted to intense artillery shelling past midnight on Saturday and continued firing in intervals until noon, leaving 13 more civilians martyred— including a three-year-old girl — and over 55 others wounded across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
According to the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the latest casualties raised the death toll to 30 since Indian missile strikes targeted two cities in AJK, followed by heavy and indiscriminate shelling in several border areas.
Officials said the shelling intensified after Fajr prayers, targeting civilian population with heavy guns, causing massive damage.
In Poonch district, three people were killed in Chaffar village of Abbaspur tehsil. The victims were identified as Areesha, 26, her three-year-old daughter Hadia, and Rehman Jan, 60.

In Kotli, Robila Javed, 35, was martyred in Bandli village of Khuiratta tehsil. Also, Kaneez Begum, 50, was martyred in Thalla Laat neighbourhood, while Muhammad Fazil, 70, was martyred in Seri Tangar village of Nakyal tehsil.
 
 

Four men and two women suffered injuries in the district.
In Neelum valley, Ali Ahmed Butt, 20, lost his life in Bugna village. Three men and two women were injured in the valley.
Although no fatalities were reported in Jhelum valley, three men and a child were injured in different areas. In Haveli district, four people, including a child, suffered injuries.
The heaviest toll, however, was reported from Barnala tehsil in Bhimber, where six people identified as Muhammad Junaid, 18; Allah Log, 65; Ms Shahmeen, 50; Nabeel, 15; Moon Shah, 18; and his 13-year-old sibling Aitraz Shah were martyred and 16 others, including five women and a child, were injured.
Indian troops were still fiercely firing artillery in Barnala, Moyel, Kot Jaimal, Watala, Nandpur, and Thub after the ceasefire, confirmed a police official.
An administration official independently confirmed the ongoing shelling, also requesting anonymity.
In Neelum valley, scepticism ran high over the ceasefire announcement, with many residents citing “the Indian side’s treacherous track record”.

The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times since Wednesday, when India launched missiles into Pakistan, triggering a series of hostilities.
On Saturday evening, the Pakistan Airport Aut­hority (PAA) announced that the airspace has been fully restored for all types of flights and issued a fresh notice to airmen (NOTAM).
“All airports in the country are available for normal flight operations,” a spokesman for PAA said. He requested passengers to contact the airline for the latest flight schedule.
However, the normalisation of flight operations is expected to take time as passenger aircraft and other equipment were shifted to safe locations as a precaution during escalating tensions between Pakistan and India.
Officials have said the aircraft are being brought back to the operational area for routine operations.
The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also resumed flight operations following the reopening of the airspace.
The national carrier’s flight PK750, coming from Paris to Islamabad, which was diverted and landed in Quetta early on Saturday, will return to its original destination at 9pm, said PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan.
Other operations of PIA would also resume from 10pm and all grounded or delayed flights would become operational, he said.
Passengers who had returned to their homes or hotels are being contacted to return to the airport. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers due to the air closures and affected flight operations, but caution was necessary given the circumstances,” the statement added.
The disruption of flight operations for days stranded hundreds of travellers in Pakistan and abroad.
Earlier, Pakistan had closed the airspace to all flights from 3:15am to 12pm and extended the closure till Sunday noon.
 
 

The action was taken after India targeted PAF bases in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Shorkot. The military said all Air Force assets remained safe in the attack before Pakistan launched it operation in retaliation.
On Friday, India had closed 32 airports across northern and western regions, including Srinagar and Amritsar, for civilian flight operations till May 15.
As tensions escalated, several global carriers, including Air France and Germany’s Lufthansa, cancelled or rerouted flights crossing Pakistan’s airspace.
Last month, Pakistan closed its airspace for Indian airlines, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country in the wake of a deadly attack in Pahalgam.

He knows the art of virality. The zappy Rizwan has a punchy remark for all situations, but that night he was compelled to repeat the very words he had uttered after it became all but certain that Pakistan would not go beyond the group-stage of a home Champions Trophy under his captaincy. 
“I do not like to be dependent on the results of the other teams,” the Multan Sultans captain said after Quetta Gladiators condemned his team to the largest defeat in terms of balls remaining in the history of the Pakistan Super League (PSL). They needed to win all the remaining matches and had to hope for other results to go in their favour after Sultans had lost six out of seven matches and had a negative net run rate of 2.355. 
Two days later, Karachi Kings thrashed Multan Sultans by 87 runs. The result effectively eliminated Rizwan’s side — that still had two more matches to play — from the playoffs race with still as many as 10 group matches remaining.  
Sultans lifted the PSL trophy in 2021 and since have played every final, establishing themselves as a dominant force in the six-team competition. But, the 10th edition of the PSL — in which they have also faced the biggest defeat in terms of runs remaining and have been skittled under 100 for the first time — has tarnished that legacy. 

Multan Sultans had played in the finals of the last four seasons of the Pakistan Super League, building a reputation as one of the most consistent sides in league. This season, they became the first team to get knocked out. What went wrong?

Eos looks at how it all came crashing down for the Multan Sultans. 
An ‘unfavourable’ schedule
Competitive advantage plays a significant role in top-flight cricket and, while the PSL is yet to experience the authentic flavour of home and away matches, Multan Sultans have been the lucky side to be afforded proper home advantage. 
The Multan Cricket Stadium — or the ‘Sultans Fort’, as the team refers to it — staged 13 PSL matches before this season. Those games, spread across three seasons (three in 2020 and five each in 2023 and 2024) and played in tandem, provided Sultans a home base, shielding them from travel fatigue and the need to acclimatise to the ever-changing conditions which, frankly, are the most challenging factors that the teams have to brave in such tournaments. 
Before this season, Sultans had a near-perfect record in Multan, as they had won 11 of those 13 games — hence, the ‘Sultans Fort’. This year, however, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) divided the five Multan games into two legs, of two and three matches, with the away games before and after the first leg. 
It irked Multan Sultans and their owner Ali Khan Tareen lamented the schedule in various podcasts before and during the PSL season, as playing all home games on a bounce had contributed significantly to their success in the previous seasons.
After starting their last two PSL campaigns with five consecutive matches at home, Sultans played three away games before their first home fixture and arrived at the Multan Cricket Stadium with three losses. 
The respite in the shape of the victory over Lahore Qalandars in the first home game was short-lived as Islamabad United thrashed them in their second home game. Multan Sultans never recovered from that defeat. 
Getting the draft wrong 
There are certain cheat codes to developing a squad in franchise cricket and one of them is to have the team’s core based on the local players. This not only guarantees availability of the players throughout the tournament but also brings in the much-desired players who have the experience of the local grounds and conditions. 
Sultans, however, released Khushdil Shah and Abbas Afridi ahead of the player draft. 
With his middle-order batting firepower and handy contributions with the ball, Khushdil had been one of the core players for the Sultans since 2020. Despite batting for a limited number of balls, the left-handed later order power-hitter’s 658 runs at a strike rate of 142.42 were the sixth most for the franchise since its inception in 2018 and his 23 scalps at 20.83 are the seventh most.
Abbas’ ability to deliver crucial middle and death overs in Sultans colours earned him a spot in the national side. His 37 wickets at 19.46 are the most wickets for a bowler to have played for Multan Sultans after Imran Tahir and Usama Mir. 
The two were placed in the Diamond category after the category renewals in December 2024. The Sultans could have offered the players brand ambassadorship or mentorship to lower their categories, a move that the franchises practise widely to retain their best talent and make sure that the players’ cheques reflect their actual worth. 
Sultans, instead, gave brand ambassadorship and mentorship to Iftikhar Ahmed, who has fallen out of national selectors’ favour in the twilight of his career, and David Willey, who retired from international cricket after the 2023 World Cup, to slot them in the Diamond Category along with Usman Khan. 
Curiously, young left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram, one of Sultans’ seven retentions, did not play a single match during the entire time they were mathematically in the playoffs race. 
And, it does not stop here. They used the ever-crucial ‘right to match’ card on Tayyab Tahir, to snatch him from Lahore Qalandars, only to keep him on the bench. By the completion of the Sultans’ eighth game, Tayyab had warmed the bench in seven matches and did not face a ball in the one match he played. 
Trailing in every aspect
Multan Sultans’ squad boasted an assistant coach, dedicated fast and spin bowling coaches, a power-hitting coach, a fielding coach and his assistant, a performance coach (whatever that is), and as many as three analysts under Abdul Rehman, the head coach. 
The team, however, failed in every possible metric. Statistician Kamran Muzaffer provided some brilliant insights for this piece. By the completion of match 22, Sultans had the worst economy of any side in the history of the tournament, as no team had ever leaked runs at 10.61 in an edition. On average, their pacers leaked 10.97 runs an over and their spinners 9.93 in the PSL 10. 
They had the worst net team run rate (calculated by subtracting the batting and bowling run rate) of negative 1.92. Peshawar Zalmi (-0.09) was the only other team with a negative net run rate. 
They also faced way more dot balls than they bowled, as the net dot ball percentage was just a shade under negative four. And they conceded way more boundaries than they hit, reflected by a negative boundary percentage of 6.89. Sultans’ were the worst net dot ball and boundary percentages.
Bowling Michael Bracewell in the powerplay backfired heavily as the off-spinner gave away 12.56 runs an over and his two wickets cost Sultans 56.50 runs in the first six overs. The decision was a curious one anyway, as the New Zealander has given almost 10 runs an over and taken just two wickets at a woeful 60.50 in the 12.4 powerplay overs since the start of 2024.
Following their eighth game, Rizwan admitted to the host broadcaster that his side had just not been good enough to go beyond the group stage. The ‘Sultan Supremacy’ — built over four years of consistent performances — had been shattered. Rizwan knew it.
