<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/101721067d8007c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960312/pti-announces-national-conference-on-dec-20-21-as-war-of-words-with-ruling-pml-n-and-its-allies-continues' target='_blank'><strong>PTI announces ‘national conference’ on Dec 20-21 as war of words with ruling PML-N and its allies continues</strong></a><br><p>As members from the ruling PML-N and its allies continued their tirade against the PTI on Wednesday, the opposition party announced that it would hold a “national conference” later this month, where a “national agenda” would be presented.
The announcement was made by PTI leader Asad Qaiser after a meeting of his party’s parliamentary group at the Parliament House.
Speaking to the media outside Parliament, he said the conference was scheduled for December 20-21.
The announcement comes amid boiling temperatures and continuing war of words between the ruling allies and the opposition. The tensions have particularly intensified in recent days after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6, in response to Imran’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Politicians from various parties have rallied behind the armed forces since, chastising the PTI. Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution calling for a ban on Imran and his party, terming them “anti-state”.
‘Things have reached a point of no return’
Earlier today, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that “things have reached a point of no return”.
Addressing a press conference, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.”
“All doors to talks are now closed,” Wali said.
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour, and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what [else] can be done”.
Wali alleged that “PTI, in its four years in power, had done nothing,” challenging the party to “show at least one university, hospital or dam” they built.
“It was a blessing from God that the Centre, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan have remained safe from the PTI’s dirty politics,” he remarked, warning that the government “will now set KP free as well.”
‘Common sense should prevail’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then […] We sat in Parliament, believing that our voices will be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties will be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years.
But, he continued, “at some point, common sense should prevail”.
Seemingly referring to the bar on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he added: “If you keep parents in jail, […] how can the children sit together with you? And if you don’t understand this, then probably the public will make you understand.”
He again stressed that the use of force would not yield any results. “Common sense should prevail.”
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” In this connection, he also claimed that Imran had the support of at least 70 per cent people in the country.
“Don’t enrage the people of Pakistan,” he warned, adding that “we haven’t done anything in violation of the Constitution”.
He emphasised that meetings with Imran should be allowed, pointing out that the high court had also issued an order, directing that meetings with the former prime minister be permitted.
“If you create hurdles [in this regard], then we don’t know what your intentions are. But if you get a response from the other side, the country and democracy would suffer a loss,” he warned, adding that whether the government did not want the PTI to sit in Parliament.
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
‘Meeting necessary for dialogue’
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside Parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan.
“How can we negotiate without his permission?”
Referring to the PTI’s sit-in outside the Adiala jail the previous night for Imran’s visitation rights and the alleged use of force by authorities to disperse the protesters, he said the leg of PTI parliamentary leader in the National Assembly Shahid Khattak “had been broken”.
He warned, “If the public rises, everything will burn down. Before destruction strikes, we should move towards dialogue.” And for that, he reiterated, meetings with the PTI founder should be allowed.
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “national conference” on December 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.“
Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adialia jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
Moreover, he demanded that merit should be considered in cases concerning Imran, further stating: “We are united; we will not be afraid.”
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addresses a press conference, assailing the PTI its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give General Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?”
The senior minister stressed that PTI’s narrative “hinged only on the release of Imran and the party coming back into power,” adding that “they did not care about the common people.”

The last item on the day’s agenda was a calling-attention notice from First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and other PPP lawmakers, intended to draw the defence minister’s attention to the delay in naming the New Islamabad International Airport after former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in recognition of her services to democracy and the country.
However, as the day’s proceedings continued, acting speaker Ali Zahid, who belongs to the PML-N, ended the session abruptly during the question hour while PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel was speaking.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi pointed out the lack of quorum while Patel spoke, prompting the speaker to have the members counted.
“63 members are present, the house is not in order,” Zahid said, ending the session early.
With their mics switched off, PPP lawmakers staged a noisy protest on the floor of the house.
Addressing the media after the session’s abrupt end, PPP MNA Shazia Marri termed the move “a conspiracy” against the PPP, alleging that “it appeared as if the PML-N and PTI were colluding.”
“This reeks of a conspiracy […] the session ended at 11-11:15, not even an hour had passed, and we are now standing here holding a press conference.”
Addressing the media, she said, “Qadir Patel also went to the speaker and spoke to him,” she said, adding that “now that we are standing here with you, it does feel like a conspiracy and intentional”.
“PTI is already quite non-serious[…]however, we were not expecting this from PML-N,” the PPP leader lamented.
The PPP leader, in a veiled warning to the coalition partner, said that “given the state of the country, […] the PML-N ought to be more careful”.
“Meting out such treatment to a party that is mature and sensible is unacceptable,” she said.
Separately, Patel, while speaking to the media afterwards, alleged that PML-N leaders were “sitting in the lobby” while the quorum was called, also terming it a “well-thought-out conspiracy.”
“My question had not yet been completed during the question hour, so how was a member allowed to point out a lack of quorum?” he asked.
“If the location of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Airport has been changed, then why can the name not be changed?”
“Shaheed Benazir does not need any praise; these people are small-minded, and they will remain as such,” Patel said.
Patel vowed that, in case the government does not respond, “the party will decide its future course of action during its next meeting”.
‘Petty tactic’
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Aseefa expressed disappointment “at the behaviour of acting NA speaker,” terming the move a “petty tactic.”
“It has become a mockery to constantly suspend the session despite having quorum. Many had heard the speaker was given instructions to avoid my calling attention notice. A very petty tactic,” the first lady said.







The New Islamabad International Airport (IIAP) was inaugurated by then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on May 2, 2018.
In February this year, PPP leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor, Faisal Karim Kundi, in a letter to the prime minister, had requested that the airport be renamed to honour the former prime minister, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Governor Kundi emphasised that the old Islamabad airport was originally named Benazir Bhutto International Airport on June 21, 2008, following her assassination in December 2007,” the report said.
“However, in April 2018, the Aviation Division renamed the newly constructed airport as New Islamabad International Airport, removing Bhutto’s name,” it added.</p><small>2025-12-10 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10130334680927a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960310/russian-bombers-join-chinese-air-patrol-near-japan-as-tokyo-beijing-ties-strains' target='_blank'><strong>Russian bombers join Chinese air patrol near Japan as Tokyo-Beijing ties strains</strong></a><br><p>Japan has scrambled jets to monitor Russian and Chinese air forces conducting joint patrols around the country, the Japanese defence ministry said late Tuesday, amid rising tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.
Two Russian Tu-95 nuclear-capable strategic bombers flew from the Sea of Japan toward the East China Sea to rendezvous with two Chinese H-6 bombers, and performed a “long-distance joint flight” in the Pacific, the ministry said.
Four Chinese J-16 fighter jets joined the bombers as they made a round-trip flight between Japan’s Okinawa and Miyako islands, it added. The Miyako Strait between the two islands is classified as international waters.
Japan also detected simultaneous Russian air force activity in the Sea of Japan, consisting of one early-warning aircraft A-50 and two Su-30 fighters, the ministry said.
Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said in a post on X on Wednesday that the Russian and Chinese joint operations were “clearly intended as a show of force against our nation, which is a serious concern for our national security.” 
Japan’s fighter jets “strictly implemented air defence identification measures,” Koizumi added.
Russian news agencies reported that the Russian-Chinese joint flight near Japan lasted for eight hours, citing Moscow’s defence ministry.
South Korea’s military also said on Tuesday that seven Russian planes and two Chinese planes had entered its air defence zone.
Japan said on Sunday that Chinese carrier-launched fighter jets aimed radar at Japanese military aircraft a day earlier, an claim Beijing disputed.
Beijing’s rising military actions near Japan follow Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comment last month that Tokyo could respond to any Chinese military action against Taiwan that also threatened Japan’s security.
China and Russia have been ramping up military cooperation in recent years elsewhere, conducting joint operations such as an anti-missile training on Russian territory and live-fire naval exercises in the South China Sea.</p><small>2025-12-10 12:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10165926f14aff3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959555/gardening-going-wild-for-strawberries' target='_blank'><strong>GARDENING: GOING WILD FOR STRAWBERRIES</strong></a><br><p>Growing up in Karachi in the 1990s, it was unthinkable for most of us to have access to fresh strawberries. All one came across were artificial strawberry flavours and essence, which were generously used in chocolates, biscuits, ice creams, desserts, jams, jellies and custard, to name a few convenience products.
Pushcart fruit vendors selling strawberries were unheard of and only a lucky few would find fresh strawberries at any of the handful of supermarkets that existed in the city in those days.
To our family’s delight, my father would sometimes purchase a can of strawberries from the then-renowned chor bazaar, a flea market where smuggled items were also available. The only fresh strawberries that we were exposed to in those times were the ones we saw being consumed on television. It is no surprise, then, that these factors added to our eagerness to not only consume fresh strawberries, but also to grow them.
Fast forward to the 2020s and, during its fruiting seasons, different sizes and varieties of strawberries are available at bargain prices throughout Karachi and across the country. A host of different berries, including strawberries, are being grown across Pakistan, especially in colder regions such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. These fruits have proved to be economically beneficial for local growers as well.

In 1990s Karachi, fresh strawberries were nearly impossible to find. Today, they are everywhere and you can even grow them at home

The bright red, aromatic, bite-size, juicy fruit, which is globally adored, is scientifically known as Fragaria x ananassa and hails from the popular Rosaceae family. Technically, strawberry is not a berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit. Botanically, the red and juicy fleshy part that we love to eat is a swollen stem and not a fruit. Scientifically, the seeds that we see on the strawberry are the fruits. The red part, or the stem, is an enlarged receptacle, while the seemingly minute seeds, or the fruits, are known as achenes.


Strawberry plants grown via runners results in better growth and fruiting| Photos by the writer

It warrants mentioning that a gardener can use either the seeds or the strawberry runners — the long stem that grows from a mother plant — to grow strawberry plants. To add to the confusion, the achenes, or strawberry fruits that are generally mistaken as seeds, contain a single strawberry seed within. Every strawberry that we gulp down contains roughly 200 achenes and, therefore, an equal number of edible seeds that are nutritious.
In ideal conditions, seeds usually germinate when the temperature is around 10 to 18 degrees Celsius. Even then, its germination rate is comparatively lower than growing runners. Usually, the seeds are sown during the months of November to January. However, as the winters ahead are almost non-existent, this can affect the germination rate of the seeds and, eventually, plant growth. This is one of the reasons why one seldom finds stores selling strawberry seeds here.
Despite these hindrances, gardeners who want to grow the strawberry plant using seeds should prepare a well-drained potting mix, which has been boosted with a fine layer of compost. The seeds should be sprinkled gently on the soil surface and covered with a thin layer of compost. Water should be very carefully sprayed, so it does not disturb the original sowing positions of the seeds. The container should be placed in a cool, dry area and covered with plastic to ensure moisture retention. Even with a diminished germination rate, strawberry seeds can take between two to four weeks to germinate, depending upon the weather and the quality of the seeds.
Strawberry growers and small-scale farmers mostly opt for strawberry runners to grow a crop instead of seeds. One of the best aspects of growing a strawberry plant via runners is that it requires a temperature between 20 to 25 degrees Celsius for optimum growth. This range is ideal for growers in Pakistan.



This is one reason why consumers often come across online vendors selling strawberries grown from runners in dozens and even batches of hundreds. These runners are small strawberry plants, about three to six inches long, and sellers wrap them in newspaper before shipping, to keep them dry and prevent damage.
Green runners are more viable and have better survival chances to grow into a strawberry plant. Gardeners can also opt for runners that have completely dried, which are usually brown to black in colour. These are likely to be dead. If the roots are still intact, rehydrating these runners with water may help in bringing them back to life.

The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
“The Basant festival will be held in Lahore from Feb 6 to 8, 2026,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told Dawn on Wednesday.
The festival would be “completely safe, regulated, and strictly monitored,” she added.
In a post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said, “CM Punjab Maryam Nawaz has approved the revival of our beloved Heritage Basant Festival on February 6th, 7th and 8th, celebrated across Lahore after 25 years, a tradition rooted in history and admired worldwide.“
On CM Punjab’s directions, a city-wide campaign to install safety antennas on all motorbikes would start tomorrow, she said, adding that “every motorbike in Lahore will have an antenna for safety before and during Basant.”
“Spring returns to the city of heritage and festivals. Lahore’s skies will speak in colour again, reclaiming our glory for the world,“ she added.







Bokhari said, “Strict conditions have been imposed to prevent any potential loss of life during the three-day Basant festival.”
Last week, the Punjab government lifted the ban on Basant celebration thro­ugh an ordinance — the Punjab Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025.
Under the ordinance, police officers of the rank of sub-inspector were empowered to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants on credible information.
The ordinance has been submitted to the Punjab Assembly for enactment.
Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Historically, in the 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh held an annual Basant fair and introduced kite flying as a regular feature. The association of kite flying with Basant soon became a tradition centred in Lahore, which remains the regional hub of the festival throughout Punjab even today. However, the festival has also traditionally been celebrated in other parts of Punjab, including Indian Punjab. Over time, the festival began to be celebrated across the country.
During the festival, the city sky is filled with colourful kites of all shapes and sizes flown from rooftops. The kites are controlled with strings usually embedded with thin shards of glass, which help cut the threads of competing kites more effectively.</p><small>2025-12-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10160900cc242aa.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960316/machado-will-be-in-oslo-for-nobel-peace-prize-nobel-institute-says' target='_blank'><strong>Machado will be in Oslo for Nobel Peace Prize, Nobel institute says</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela’s Maria Corina Machado is safe and will be in Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in a statement on Wednesday.
Earlier, the organisers said the Venezuelan opposition leader, who lives in hiding, will not attend Wednesday’s Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and the award will be accepted by her daughter.
Machado has only been seen once in public since going underground in August last year, amidst a tense showdown with President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuela’s attorney general has said the 58-year-old would be considered a “fugitive” if she left the country to accept the award.
It was not known in the hours before the ceremony whether Machado was in Norway for the event due to start at 1pm (5pm PKT). The Nobel Institute finally confirmed that she would not be there.
“It will be her daughter Ana Corina Machado who will receive the prize in her mother’s name,” Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken told Norway’s NRK radio. “Her daughter will give the speech that Maria Corina herself wrote.” Harpviken said he “simply” did not know where Machado was.
Few people were informed of Machado’s movements because of the nature of Maduro’s “repressive regime, which is willing to use absolutely all means against the opposition”, he said, noting that she “lives under a death threat from the regime”.
Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, are in Norway for the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.
‘Fugitive’ laureate
While organisers said Machado had previously indicated she would attend, suspicions had already been raised when a traditional press conference with the award winner on Tuesday was first postponed and then cancelled.
Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, which she was banned from. Her claim is backed by much of the international community.
Machado has been hailed for her efforts in favour of democracy, but she has also been criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel Prize.
The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug smuggling boats.
Maduro insists that the goal of the US operations —  which Machado has said are justified —  is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.
Since going into hiding, her only public appearance was on January 9 in Caracas, where she protested against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.
The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.
Machado was awarded the Nobel on October 10 for her efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, challenging Maduro’s iron-fisted rule since 2013.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said last month the opposition leader would be considered a “fugitive” if she travelled to Norway to accept the prize.
“By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,” Saab told AFP, adding that she is accused of “acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism”.
“It has happened multiple times in the history of the Peace Prize that the laureate has been prevented from attending the ceremony, and on those occasions it’s always been the case that close family members of the laureate will receive the prize and give the lecture in the place of the laureate,” Harpviken explained this week.
Doubts had been raised about how Machado would return to Venezuela.“She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialised in Latin America at the University of Oslo.
On the other hand, “she is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change, and she would gradually lose political influence,” she added.
Both pro- and anti-Machado protests are expected in Oslo on Wednesday.
The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics will receive their prizes at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-12-10 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1013165959b1052.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960311/elon-musk-says-doge-somewhat-successful-but-would-not-do-it-again' target='_blank'><strong>Elon Musk says DOGE ‘somewhat successful’ but would not do it again</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency was only “a little bit successful”, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on a podcast on Tuesday, adding that he would not lead the project again.
The billionaire, who is founder of electric car company Tesla, was a major donor to Trump’s presidential election campaign and became a close ally and adviser to his administration.
Musk led the DOGE team in seeking to slash the federal government’s budget and workforce in the first five months of Trump’s second term.
But the role and his political rhetoric sparked a backlash against him and Tesla, including vandalism of Tesla cars. “I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars,” Musk said on the podcast with former Trump administration official Katie Miller.



“We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful. We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was entirely wasteful,” Musk said.
Asked if he would go back and lead DOGE again, Musk said: “No, I don’t think so.” Musk’s work for DOGE also sparked concerns among investors that he was not paying enough attention to Tesla as it faced slowing sales.
Musk and Trump had a bitter public falling out around midyear over the president’s sweeping tax and spending bill. But there have been some signs of reconciliation.
DOGE has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, the Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month.
DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditure, but it was impossible for outside financial experts to verify that because the unit did not provide detailed public accounting of its work.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091613477d9993a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959376/from-fake-profiles-to-deepfake-porn-the-war-pakistani-women-cannot-win-alone' target='_blank'><strong>From fake profiles to deepfake porn: The war Pakistani women cannot win alone</strong></a><br><p>Shukria Ismail, a young woman from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s conservative Kurram district, faced an uphill battle convincing her family to let her pursue journalism as a career. After her parents half-heartedly allowed her, she made sure to follow all the cultural norms expected of a Pathan woman: keeping her dupatta on and being careful about what she said or did.
She threw herself into her work, attending training sessions, reporting from the field, appearing on-screen, and building professional networks. Things were going well for her. She was happy.
In March 2024, however, her world came to a sudden halt when her sister discovered a fake Facebook profile in Shukria’s name. The profile picture was a screenshot of her reading news on TV, while the cover photo carried a sexually explicit image. “At first, I brushed it off as something common in our field,” she says. “But then my sister told me that obscene messages were being sent to our relatives and even to people who had old property disputes with my father and uncle.”
The targeting was precise, suggesting someone close to her was behind it. Eventually, she found out a relative was involved, acting out of a personal grudge. “They attached indecent images to my photos and spread them online,” Shukria recalls.
The harassers didn’t stop there. Her family began receiving calls insinuating she was having affairs or questioning her character simply because she was a journalist. Even her younger brother’s college was dragged into the mess, with texts sent to his classmates saying she was involved in “questionable activities.”
“It was clear they wanted to push me towards suicide or provoke an ‘honour killing,’” she adds.
Through it all, her family stood by her, never blaming or abusing her. Yet the biggest blow came when they forced her to quit journalism entirely. “Being on air, reporting, writing — journalism became a crime in my own home. My parents forbade me from going to work. That was the day I died mentally,” she says.
Rising cost of being a woman online
Shukria is one of thousands of women whose lives have been upended by technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV). The term refers to acts of violence committed, assisted, aggravated, or amplified by the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) or digital media against a person because of their gender.
This year, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV runs from November 25 to December 10, under the UN theme “UNiTE to End Digital Violence against All Women and Girls,” spotlighting cyber harassment, deepfakes, and attacks that spill into real-world harm.
In Pakistan, the damage rarely stays online: it hits mental health, careers, and, for women like Shukria, can end professional lives altogether.
The Digital Rights Foundation’s Digital Security Helpline Annual Report 2024 shows a sharp rise in online harassment and TFGBV in the country, with 3,171 new cases recorded. Per the report, the year began with a surge in gendered disinformation and AI-generated images targeting women politicians and journalists during the February elections, aimed at humiliating and discrediting them both personally and professionally.

Women journalists also faced false blasphemy allegations, a tactic carrying severe offline risks, including mob violence. One journalist told DRF she feared for her life for the first time, while another faced a hacked X account and coordinated attacks on her identity and credibility.
Pakistan remains one of the world’s most dangerous countries for women, and rising internet access has extended violence into digital spaces. Despite broadband reaching 58.6 per cent of the population, a gender gap persists: only 33pc of women regularly use the internet, and 23pc access it via someone else’s phone, leaving many without the knowledge or tools to protect themselves from TFGBV, the report said.

The increasing accessibility of technology, combined with deep-seated misogyny, has enabled more sophisticated attacks, from deepfakes to doxing. Gender minorities face even greater risks due to online anonymity and weak accountability.

Journalists encounter heightened hostility as well. Pakistan dropped two places to 152 on the 2024 World Press Freedom Index. Women journalists face sexualised threats, gendered disinformation, and image-based abuse, including AI-generated content.
DRF research shows 55pc of women in media have experienced online abuse, yet only 14.2pc sought help; 70pc fear misuse of their images online, and 40pc report stalking or harassment.

Meanwhile, data from the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW)’s 2023 report shows that almost 40pc of Pakistani women surveyed had faced digital cyber-bullying or harassment. Conviction rates remain low: only 92 cybercrime convictions were secured out of 1,375 cases in 2023.
As the nature of online abuse grows more complex, those on the frontlines are seeing the impact most clearly. Digital rights expert and DRF founder Nighat Dad told Dawn that the organisation was witnessing “a disturbing new frontier of gender-based violence,” noting that the Digital Security Helpline had seen a steady rise in cases involving deepfake pornography, doctored images, voice manipulation, and AI-powered impersonation, especially targeting women and mostly women public figures.
“These aren’t just new tools; they are intensifying old patriarchal patterns of control, blackmail, and public shaming,” she said.
She added that “AI has lowered the barrier for abuse. With just a photo and a free app, anyone can manufacture a scandal. That level of scale and invisibility makes it harder than ever for survivors to find redress.
We urgently need stronger platform-level safeguards, quicker takedown mechanisms for synthetic media, and gender-sensitive digital safety policies. But just as importantly, we need a survivor-centric ecosystem where helplines like ours are resourced, trusted, and recognised as vital for frontline support in fighting this evolving form of violence.”
Smear campaign without borders
Prominent journalist and prime-time anchorperson Mona Alam from Islamabad also faced a different but equally vicious online smear campaign that took a heavy toll on her mental health.
“The campaign against me, involving the circulation of pornographic videos, began in December last year. It wasn’t a morphed image or a superimposed video; it was a real video of a sex worker filmed years ago. That same video had previously circulated on the dark web under the title ‘Nimra Mehra’s leak video,’ to malign a British-Pakistani singer, and that wasn’t Nimra either — just a woman who slightly resembled her. In December 2024, it was made viral again, this time labelled as ‘Mona Alam’s leaked video.’
“I became aware of it because the campaigners were Pakistani. It was deliberately pushed in WhatsApp and Facebook groups, especially media groups with journalists, politicians, and professional contacts. Among the initial campaigners were individuals affiliated with political parties and some media professionals. Soon, others began making vlogs and videos, amplifying it further.”
The journalist immediately approached the police and the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cybercrime wing in Islamabad, saying she was grateful to the then–DG FIA, Ahmed Ishaq Jahangir, who pursued the case diligently.
“He had the initial campaigners arrested, kept in FIA custody for a few days, questioned, and their mobile phones confiscated for forensic examination. Courts eventually granted bail. Thanks to the ex-DG, the case was progressing well.”
However, in February 2025, at a critical stage when all the phones had been seized and forensic work was pending, the DG was removed, and the FIA “abandoned the case”, she claimed. Despite repeated follow-ups, the case did not move.
She did not give up and repeatedly contacted FIA Additional Director Ayaz Khan. Later, at a ceremony in the Presidency, she explicitly asked Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for help. “He listened at first, but as soon as I mentioned the FIA’s negligence, he walked past me without answering. I had hoped he would intervene, but he offered no help.”

The campaign quickly shifted abroad. “When the initial campaigners were arrested, they moved it to Dubai and India, where they had accounts with millions of followers.
Indian tabloids, social media accounts, and Bollywood-style gossip pages — all amplified it aggressively. Despite Pakistani officials’ usual reactions to Indian attacks, this malicious campaign received no attention here.”
Mona was also disappointed by the silence of Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. “Although I didn’t explicitly ask him for help, he didn’t offer any either.” Dawn reached out to both Naqvi and Tarar for comment, but neither responded.
Women politicians equal targets
While Mona received no support from the political elite, even senior women lawmakers face similar treatment.
Case in point is Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari, whose sexualised deepfake video circulated in 2024, leaving her deeply distressed.
Deepfakes, digitally manipulated videos or images that superimpose a person’s likeness onto another or fabricate content, are increasingly weaponised against women in the public sphere, particularly in conservative societies like Pakistan.

 

Despite her position as a senior minister, Bokhari endured the same online harassment and character assassination as countless other women, illustrating how digital violence affects women across all levels and exposing the systemic nature of gendered abuse online.

Speaking to Dawn, Bokhari said her deepfake did attract attention, but she does not believe it produced the “desired results.”

“Unless such cases are treated as test cases, where at least one perpetrator is actually punished, nothing will change,” she said, pointing out that Punjab now has dedicated defamation courts, which are civil in nature.

“Cases like mine should go to such defamation courts. And once pursued, courts must show zero tolerance. No matter what the investigation does, the ball eventually lands in the court’s court,” she said.
Bokhari stressed that without strict judicial action, digital violence cannot be curbed. She also warned that “if we turn such incidents into political issues, granting favours, or portraying someone as a victim to secure their release, this problem will never end.”
Unseen scars of digital abuse
For a non-public figure like Maria, a pseudonym, a deepfake cost her a potential marriage. Maria, a marketing professional from Karachi, had been in a relationship with a former boyfriend during university, but they parted ways and didn’t stay in touch.
“I didn’t have any contact with him for two years. I was about to get married in three months and shared an engagement photo on Instagram. That’s when he suddenly messaged me, angry and jealous, and began threatening me that I had ‘betrayed him.’ He said he had kept my intimate pictures on his phone, claiming, ‘I had saved them for such an occasion only, and I will teach you a lesson.’”
Though her images did not contain nudity, just photos of her hugging him, he sent them to her fiancé after doctoring them, sparking a huge fight that ended her engagement. “At that time, I was devastated and depressed for months.
I was scared. I told my family, and though they were disappointed, they supported me. I told them that if this ever happens again, I would face it without fear. My biggest fear is over. The marriage is called off, but my izzat is intact. I did nothing wrong. If anyone is to blame, it’s him,” she said.

The psychological impact of such harassment is severe and long-lasting. Huma Pervaiz, clinical psychologist and lecturer at Karachi’s DHA Suffa University, explained that manipulations like deepfakes “tend to demean, silence, or discredit women, particularly those in social or professional positions. Cyberbullying, trolling, and doxing create a constant sense of insecurity, which can harm mental well-being, erode self-confidence, and blur the line between online and offline abuse.”
Samiha Sajid, clinical psychologist, added that even a single threatening message or manipulated image can trigger anxiety, hypervigilance, shame, and withdrawal from social spaces.

“What makes this crisis even more concerning is the low conviction rate for cybercrimes. When only a fraction of perpetrators are held accountable, women internalise a dangerous message: that their safety, dignity, and voice are negotiable in digital spaces.”

She continued: “We must recognise online harassment as a serious mental-health threat. Pakistan needs stronger, gender-sensitive reporting systems, public awareness campaigns, and digital-literacy initiatives. Protecting women online is not just a legal responsibility, but it is essential for their psychological well-being and their full participation in society.”
Journalist Gharida Farooqi, herself a victim of AI-fuelled harassment campaigns, told Dawn, “Artificial intelligence or automated insolence? Yet another unsafe space for women across the globe. Having been a victim of fake campaigns and real threats myself since 2014, even when AI was distant, it feels nothing has changed in 2025, rather intensified manifold for women.”
She said that before stricter laws and implementation, the sensitisation and sanitisation of minds—both human and AI—towards women is urgently required, “so that the benefits of modern-day technology are harnessed and shared not just by mankind, but by all of humankind.”
Threat of AI-driven misogyny
The rise of AI has not only accelerated online abuse but reshaped how misogyny is produced, amplified, and weaponised in Pakistan’s digital spaces. Experts warn that without urgent systemic safeguards, women will face an increasingly hostile environment online.
Digital rights activist Usama Khilji has been warning for years that technology would eventually supercharge the violence women face online. That moment has now arrived. He describes deepfakes and AI-generated intimate images as “a huge, huge risk,” especially in intimate relationships where former partners weaponise fabricated content to keep women silent or under control.

“Such tactics are becoming so normalised that one abuser even boasted he no longer needed to throw acid on a woman as an AI video can destroy her without leaving a trace”.

Political networks, he added, have also begun deploying deepfakes to discredit women journalists and public figures, using misogyny as a strategic tool. Yet the cybercrime system remains ill-equipped. “Threats to create a deepfake don’t fall neatly into any section,” he told Dawn, noting that most women receive no meaningful legal protection despite the severity of the harm.
Tech journalist Sindhu Abbasi sees the same pattern unfolding across the digital ecosystem, where AI has lowered the barrier for large-scale manipulation. Her research has taken her from AI “nudifier” apps — “Meta has already taken legal action against some of these developers,” she pointed out — to professional settings where photos are altered without consent.

She cited a LinkedIn case where a woman’s standard headshot was modified to add cleavage before being posted publicly. “If companies are using AI, they should let you know,” she emphasised. “It affects your reputation and your professional image.”
Abbasi also highlighted a rising trend of doctored YouTube thumbnails featuring Pakistani actresses, the unchecked spread of sexualised images, and the dangerous access gaps within state surveillance systems. In one case she investigated, a government officer used data from a woman’s official application to locate her home and assault her daughter. “What could go wrong? Possibly everything,” she said.
For journalist and researcher Annam Lodhi, these incidents are not anomalies. Rather, they are the logical outcome of a gendered digital culture that predates AI but is now amplified by it. Her research on tech-facilitated gender-based violence shows just how vulnerable women remain.
“All women in Pakistan’s digital space are highly vulnerable because they are the rare ones who voice their opinions,” she explained. Journalists, activists and political workers face the harshest climate, operating in spaces where harassment is already “widespread and normalised.”
Lodhi noted that even before AI, morphed images caused serious harm. Now, she said, “AI makes harassment faster, more personalised, and harder to trace.”
One interviewee told her that abusers were able to find her residence through “minor details shared over the years,” illustrating how AI-driven data scraping collapses the line between digital and physical danger. Deepfakes, Lodhi argued, weaponise cultural stigma around honour: “A woman’s face can be lifted from a profile photo and placed onto sexualised content within minutes.”

Her survey of 439 users found that 73pc of women on X had faced harassment, and many now self-censor or withdraw altogether.
For her, AI isn’t creating misogyny but “it magnifies it,” making harmful gender norms appear socially acceptable and widely endorsed.
System struggling to protect women online
For Ambreen, another pseudonym, the terror began quietly after a stranger began using her photos to create fake profiles, messaging her at random, disappearing instantly, and reappearing with new accounts. “He’d message me at 3am and then immediately deactivate his account so we couldn’t trace him,” she recalled. The man repeatedly pushed her to get on a Skype call, something she didn’t fully understand at the time but instinctively felt was unsafe.
Isolated and afraid, she first approached the DRF, followed by the FIA’s cybercrime office in Islamabad. “I was in university at the time, studying, so I was very scared but also brave enough to take that step,” she said. She kept the ordeal hidden from her family, relying instead on friends and the few responsive officers she encountered.
Eventually, with DRF’s support and multiple complaints filed, the harassment stopped. “Since I took multiple steps at once, I don’t know which one worked, but the messages stopped, and all the fake pages were taken down,” she said.
This, however, was not the case with Ayesha, who chose to be identified by her first name only. She told Dawn that her harasser kept reappearing with “obscene profiles and lewd messages for five years before I mustered the courage to tell my husband.”
“My husband was very upset with all this and did not agree to go to the FIA to complain,” she said. “He thought we would make matters worse by involving the police.”
Ayesha’s experience reflects a broader failure of systems meant to protect women, a reality high court advocate Syed Miqdad Mehdi sees regularly. He said that while Pakistan’s cybercrime law, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016, has evolved, its implementation still lags behind the scale of abuse. “Law is evolving with the change of modern challenges… but public awareness raising is very important, and capacity building is essential, especially with regards to GBV and TFGBV,” he said.

He stressed the critical need to sensitise officers, build trust, and create victim-friendly mechanisms so women can report cases without fear of humiliation. “There is no doubt that the FIA… has been getting a lot of successful stories,” he acknowledged, “but despite this, there is a lot of pendency and a lot of load on their work.”

With limited staff, long distances to reporting centres, and a lack of specialised GBV-focused infrastructure, many victims lose confidence before their cases even begin.

“The specialised courts need to be sensitised,” he added, stressing that TFGBV cases often fall through the cracks of existing legal structures.
For Fauzia Yazdani, a gender and governance expert with over three decades of experience, the core issue lies deeper, in social norms and the pace at which digital harms evolve.
“When you come into the digital space, your socials and social apps were curated to be gender-blind,” she said. As new forms of online violence emerged, laws were drafted, “but as the digital space is evolving at such a speed, oversight and rules and regulations are not evolving.”
Despite the presence of strong laws, from the Pakistan Penal Code to the women protection acts, “are they being implemented? That’s where the issue is,” she said.
Yazdani described deepfakes, harassment bots, and algorithm-driven amplification as “crude corners of digital space that need to be monitored and regulated,” warning that the gap between law, oversight, and reality is widening.
She argues that the surge in TFGBV is inseparable from Pakistan’s social and political climate. “Our societal narrative is tilted towards gender inequality… it stereotypes women, it categorises or typecasts them into certain roles,” she explained. The result is a landscape where political polarisation and misogyny intertwine and where women’s visibility, whether as journalists, politicians, or ordinary citizens, can become a liability.
“It’s very convenient… you’re anonymous, you can harass someone, you can generate bots behind them… and still remain anonymous.”
Turning tide against online GBV
Technology-facilitated gender-based violence is not just a digital threat. It can change lives, careers, and families. As Yazdani explains, “For transformational change, we have to change the society’s narrative, we have to change the society’s thought process.”
Without shifting norms, strengthening oversight, and bringing more women into tech, she warns, the country will continue to see TFGBV grow faster than the systems meant to contain it.
Yet even with awareness, enforcement, and advocacy, the human cost is clear. Shukria’s story brings this painfully to life: nearly two years after being targeted online and forced out of journalism, she remains unable to write, speak publicly, or practise her profession.
“I am engaged to be married soon, but I feel like I am sitting in a cage, only dreaming of the life I once had,” she says. “I hope that once I am with my husband, I can revive the career that was forcibly taken from me.”

Demographic databases, including projections by the US Census Bureau and the United Nations, show Pakistan’s population density at 333 persons per square kilometre, underscoring the scale of pressure on land and public services.
The data depict a country facing one of the most complex population transitions in South Asia — caught between rapid numerical expansion and slow human-development gains.

 

Despite decades of policy debate, Pakistan is still adding millions of people each year. Its annual population growth rate stands at 1.82 per cent, lower than in previous decades but high enough to keep total numbers rising steeply for at least another generation, the report said,
It added that the total fertility rate (TFR) — the average number of births per woman — has fallen to 3.25, yet remains well above the replacement level of 2.1, ensuring continued expansion through what demographers describe as population momentum.

 

At the same time, social indicators remain weak. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 60.5 years, among the lowest in the region, while the under-five mortality rate stands at nearly 65 deaths per 1,000 live births, reflecting persistent shortcomings in maternal health, child nutrition, disease prevention and primary healthcare access, per the report.
Together, these figures underline the uneven nature of Pakistan’s demographic transition, in which family size is shrinking faster than improvements in health and longevity.
How Pakistan compares with its neighbours
A regional comparison highlights the scale of Pakistan’s challenge. India, now the world’s most populous country with about 1.46–1.47 billion people, has already crossed below replacement fertility, with a TFR of around 1.9.
While India’s absolute numbers will continue to rise for several decades due to its large youth cohort, its growth rate is slowing rapidly, and attention is shifting toward labour-force ageing, pension systems and productivity.
Bangladesh, often cited as a demographic success story, has pushed fertility down to around replacement level despite extreme land pressure. With a population of about 175–176m packed into one of the world’s highest population densities, Bangladesh has achieved sharp declines in child mortality and steady gains in life expectancy, largely through female education, family planning outreach and primary healthcare investments.
In contrast, Pakistan, with far more land per person, continues to lag on several of these indicators.
Afghanistan, at the other extreme, remains trapped in a high-growth, high-mortality cycle. With a population now estimated at over 44m, fertility remains above four births per woman, while child mortality and life expectancy are among the worst in the region.
Afghanistan’s demographic trajectory resembles Pakistan’s own profile from several decades ago, reinforcing how conflict and weak state institutions delay demographic transition.
A young country under immediate strain
Pakistan’s population structure remains heavily weighted toward the young. A broad base of children and working-age youth means that pressure on schools, universities, housing, transport and employment will intensify through the 2030s and 2040s. Even as fertility declines, the large size of today’s child and teenage population guarantees continued high demand for jobs and public services for decades.
Economists warn that without sustained economic growth and large-scale job creation, this youth bulge could become a source of long-term instability rather than a demographic dividend. Urban centres are already showing the strain through informal housing expansion, transport congestion and widening access gaps in health and education.
The global backdrop: growth slows everywhere
Globally, the world’s population continues to grow, but at its slowest pace in modern history. With the global total now exceeding eight billion, projections suggest that the world population will approach nine billion by the late 2030s and may peak near the end of the century before stabilising or declining.
This slowdown is being driven by sharp fertility declines across East Asia, Europe and much of Latin America, with even South Asia now firmly on the same downward path.
An unfinished transition
Demographers note that Pakistan is now at a critical midpoint of its demographic transition. Fertility is declining, but not fast enough to reduce near-term population stress. Mortality is falling, but not fast enough to lift life expectancy to regional standards. Meanwhile, urbanisation is accelerating without the infrastructure needed to support it.
Without major gains in girls’ education, reproductive healthcare, nutrition, clean water, and employment, Pakistan risks entering the second half of the century with both an ageing population and weak human capital — a combination that could severely strain public finances, pension systems and healthcare services.
Experts argue that the coming two decades will be decisive. If investments in health, education and economic productivity accelerate, Pakistan could still convert its youth bulge into sustained growth. If not, the same numbers could amplify unemployment, migration pressures and fiscal strain well into the latter half of the century.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10071006401ee52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960130/water-cannons-used-to-disperse-pti-protesters-staging-sit-in-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Water cannons used to disperse PTI protesters staging sit-in outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>The PTI said early on Wednesday that authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier.
In a post on X at 3:58am, the party said, “Pakistani authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala Jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.







In another post, the party said that Imran’s family was deliberately blocked from meeting him, which led to the sit-in.
It said that the use of water cannons was “not only a shameless violation of Imran Khan’s prisoner rights but also an outright assault on the constitutional rights of people who gathered to protest the regime’s atrocities”.
“International human rights organisations and champions of democracy must not stay silent in the face of such inhumane and authoritarian actions in Pakistan,” the party said.
In yet another post, Imran’s sisters Aleema, telling drenched participants of the sit-in, “Kids, ghabrana nahin hai (don’t panic) … its just water, don’t panic because of water.”







PTI stages sit-in
The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration.
Police had contacted Imran’s sisters twice and suggested that they leave. Later, a heavy contingent of police was deployed at the scene.







The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.
Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison on Tuesday, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal.
“If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said,







She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months.
“What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets.
“What sort of system is this?”







Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police.
Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video.
“This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law.
“We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.”







Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”.
“We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.”
“There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.”
Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility.
He left the area without meeting the PTI founder.
PTI Secretary General Raja said there was no excuse to bar Imran’s sisters from meeting him, as it is one’s right to meet relatives.
“No one can deny the right to meet by saying that Imran Khan’s message was shared outside,” he said.
PTI provincial president Akbar said that a large number of party workers and supporters reached Adiala Jail because of a challenge from Senator Faisal Vawda.
“We have come here prepared and are willing to sit here the whole night,” Akbar said. “We hope that the meeting will be arranged, but workers are charged and we are ready for a prolonged sit-in.”
He added that the distance between people and state institutions is increasing, stating that the PTI does not want the gap to grow.
“People have started hating you, so you should think wisely,” said Akbar. It remains unclear whom he was addressing.
Similarly, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak said that they were peaceful people and would demonstrate peacefully.
“I am a parliamentary leader of the PTI in the National Assembly and it is my right to meet Imran Khan,” he said. “Workers have arrived here just because they love Imran Khan and they think that only he can address the issues of Pakistan.”
Khattak also said that a policy should be made to address the issue of military operations in tribal areas.
“We have no objection to drone attacks, but drones don’t strike the right targets, due to which civilians are being killed. I suggest that the elders of tribal areas be involved in negotiating with the terrorists. In the past, we were having tea in Afghanistan and now Afghans have been declared enemies,” the MNA added.
Meanwhile, KP MPA Shafiullah Jan said that in the mainstream media, someone was saying that nobody would reach Adiala Jail.
“He should see that we have reached here,” he stated. “I think anger has grown among workers after the press conference of DG ISPR. We will sit here unless one of the sisters is allowed to meet with Imran Khan.”
Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother.
When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”.
Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code.
“There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.
That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.
The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly.
The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1012061053eef9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960305/ecp-rejects-cm-bugtis-plea-for-postponement-of-local-govt-polls-in-quetta-elections-to-be-held-on-dec-28' target='_blank'><strong>ECP rejects CM Bugti’s plea for postponement of local govt polls in Quetta; elections to be held on Dec 28</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) rejected on Wednesday Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti’s petition seeking the postponement of local government elections in Quetta that were scheduled to be held on December 28.
Bugti had filed the petition on Monday, and informed sources told Dawn that he cited the precarious law and order situation in the provincial capital and the suspension of internet services as reasons for postponing the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) elections.
In its written order today, seen by Dawn, the ECP said the plea was being rejected for “being devoid of force” and that the electoral body had decided to hold local government elections in Quetta on the already scheduled date of Dec 28.
However, in the majority decision, one of the six members of the commission that considered the plea was in favour of the postponement of local government elections.
In its order, the ECP directed the Balochistan government to assist the commission and “all other functionaries who have been entrusted responsibilities for the conduct of local government elections in District Quetta in every possible manner”.
It also instructed that “foolproof security arrangements” be made for the safety and security of voters, contesting candidates, the general public and polling staff, as well as to ensure the smooth conduct of polls in Quetta.
ECP, in its order, noted that the chief minister had filed an appeal on Dec 8 seeking the postponement of elections, stating that elections should be rescheduled to a time when “when weather, security, administrative preparedness, constituency demarcation & voter rolls accuracy are ensured.”
The commission took up the matter on Dec 9 for a review, it said.
Addressing “irregularities” regarding constituency demarcation, ECP clarified that, “the process of delimitation of constituencies was completed after observing all legal processes, i.e. publication of preliminary list of constituencies for inviting proposals, objections on preliminary lists and the same was finalised after hearing and deciding the objections/representations.”
It also recalled a Balochistan High Court (BHC) order, which on October 10, had dismissed petitions filed on the same ground and directed the commission to hold elections “as soon as possible.”
ECP further maintained that “the appellant has wrongly calculated the term of expiry of local government elections in Balochistan”.
“As per Section 26 of the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, the term of local government election is for four [years]. In the present case, the members and chairman/vice chairman of union councils, municipal committees and municipal corporations took oath on February 9, 2023, for which the expiry of term is February 9, 2027.
“However, the members and chairman/ vice chairman of district councils took oath on July 6, 2023, for which the term of expiry is July 5, 2027.”
The order added that the commission had “carried out the process of reconciliation of electoral rolls wherever required to adjust voters in accordance with census blocks, wards and delimitation through door-to-door verifications”.
“For the purpose, vide publicity was given to facilitate the voters and inspiring contesting candidates for registration and transfer of their votes,” it said, adding that the election schedule was issued after the completion of this process.
The order noted that ECP had completed the delimitation process “twice” and “after a number of meetings with the provincial government of Balochistan, issued the election programs twice”.
However, the elections could not be held despite “efforts” of the commission, the order noted.
On the matter of law and order situation and harsh weather, the ECP recalled a request made by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government in Oct 2021 — on the same grounds — where the Supreme Court (SC) had upheld the electoral body’s decision to proceed with the elections.
The SC directed the provincial government to proceed with the local government elections in the case.
It also noted that the “process of printing of ballot papers has been already started, and [the] maximum number of ballot papers have been printed out.”
In his dissenting note, ECP member Shah Muhammad Jatoi, while agreeing with the commission’s decision on delimitation, electoral rolls and term, maintained that harsh weather conditions could lead to a “low” voter turnout as most residents during December “migrate from the district (Quetta) to [other] districts”.
He further noted: “I am also of the considered view that the law and order situation in the province of Balochistan is not conducive for [the] conduct of local government elections in the present scenario.”
Quetta local polls
The Balochistan government had previously requested the election commission on November 2 as well to postpone the polls in Quetta, citing similar reasons. However, the request was turned down a day later.
Prior to that on Oct 6, a bench of the BHC had rejected constitutional petitions filed by numerous individuals regarding the postponement of the elections and directed the election commissioner of Balochistan to hold the local government elections as soon as possible.
In view of the BHC orders, the election commission had started preparation for holding elections in Quetta and announced the schedule for it on November 13.
Elections will now be held in 172 union councils and 641 wards, with 2,710 candidates contesting the elections in Quetta district.
The previous local bodies, elected in 2015, had completed their tenure on January 27, 2019.
Under the Elections Act 2017, local body elections should be held within 120 days after the expiry of the term. However, the polls were held in May 2022, more than three years after the expiry of the previous term.
The delay primarily resulted from a lack of consensus among political parties over proposed amendments to the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, and issues concerning the delimitation of constituencies.
The LG elections in two major districts with sizeable urban populations in the province, Quetta and Lasbela, were delayed because of issues with the delimitation of wards.
While the LG elections in Lasbela were held at the end of 2022, the elections in Quetta could not be held due to pending litigation in the BHC over the delimitation of wards in the district.</p><small>2025-12-10 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10111559561ef9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960300/mob-torches-water-tanker-after-collision-leaves-motorcyclist-dead-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Mob torches water tanker after collision leaves motorcyclist dead in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>A man riding a motorcycle was killed on Wednesday morning after a water tanker collided with his vehicle in Karachi, prompting a mob to torch the tanker.
According to a statement by Khawaja Ajmer Nagri police, the incident took place near 4k Chowrangi in North Karachi.
The statement said the motorcyclist sustained severe injuries in the accident, following which he was rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
The tanker’s driver managed to escape, leaving his vehicle. The tanker was then set on fire by a mob, the statement added.
Separately, a bus ran over a 45-year-old woman in the Baldia-8 area of Karachi on Wednesday morning, a statement by Saeedabad police said.
The body was rushed to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, it said, adding that the driver and conductor of the bus managed to escape.
Today’s incidents come two days after a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi.
Last month, angered citizens also set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it met with an accident, resulting in the death of a man.

The two Southeast Asian nations have each blamed the other for the clashes that started on Monday, and remain at odds on a diplomatic solution to the border tensions that have been simmering for months.
Thailand’s foreign minister said in an interview on Tuesday that he saw no potential for negotiations, adding the situation was not conducive to third-party mediation, while a top adviser to Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet told Reuters his country was “ready to talk at any time”.
Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday evening, Trump listed a number of wars that he claimed he helped stop, including between Pakistan and India, and Israel and Iran, before commenting on the renewed conflict in Southeast Asia.
“I hate to say this one, named Cambodia–Thailand and it started up today and tomorrow I am going to have to make a phone call. Who else could say I’m going to make a phone call and stop a war of two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia.”
Asked about the prospect of Trump intervening again, Cambodian government spokesperson Pen Bona said Phnom Penh’s position remained the same, that it wanted only peace. A Thai government spokesperson said he did not know if the prime minister had spoken to Trump, as he was in parliament.
Claims civilian areas hit
Cambodia on Wednesday withdrew its athletes from the Southeast Asian Games in Thailand, citing safety reasons and serious concerns from the team’s families.
Thailand’s military said BM-21 rockets fired by Cambodian forces landed near the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin district on Wednesday morning, forcing the evacuation of patients and staff to a shelter.
It also said drones, BM-21 rockets and tanks were used at other border points, including near the contested Preah Vihear temple complex.
“Our forces destroyed an anti-drone position to the south of Chong Chom in order to support operations to clear Cambodian elements in a mango plantation that has been planted across the line of operations,” the military said in a situation update.
Cambodia’s military said Thailand had used artillery fire and armed drones to launch attacks in Pursat province, fired mortars into civilian residences in Battambang province, and Thai F-16 fighter jets had entered Cambodian airspace and dropped bombs near civilian areas.
Land mine allegations raised tensions
Trump has previously spoken to leaders of both countries and been central to the fragile truce between them since five days of fighting in July, which killed at least 48 people and was the heaviest clashes between the two in recent history.
In July, Trump used the leverage of trade negotiations to broker a ceasefire. Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow told Reuters on Tuesday he did not think the threat of tariffs should be used to pressure his country into talks.
Thailand last month suspended de-escalation measures that were agreed at an October summit in Trump’s presence, after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine that Bangkok said was newly laid by Cambodia, which rejects the allegation.
Both countries have said they have evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from border areas.
As of Tuesday night, Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said nine civilians had been killed since Monday and 20 seriously injured, while Thai officials said four soldiers had been killed and 68 had been injured.</p><small>2025-12-10 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0919541180fb69d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960131/women-reporters-drop-to-4pc-in-pakistan-from-16pc-in-2020-study-finds' target='_blank'><strong>Women reporters drop to 4pc in Pakistan from 16pc in 2020, study finds</strong></a><br><p>Women reporters in Pakistan fell to four per cent in 2025, down from 16pc in 2020, according to the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), the Uks Research Centre said in a statement on Wednesday, highlighting how progress on gender equality in the news has largely stalled in the country as well as in 94 others.
The GMMP takes place once every five years and captures a snapshot of news content from one global monitoring day. This year marks the fourth cycle in which Uks has served as GMMP’s national partner, monitoring and contributing Pakistan’s data to the world’s longest-running study on gender representation in the news.
GMMP 2025 was monitored around the world on May 6, 2025, a day on which Pakistan’s news agenda was dominated by India-Pakistan military tensions. The conflict shaped the media landscape that day and left very limited space for gender-related reporting.
“No women reporters were recorded in television, radio, or internet news on May 6,” the statement said, which was issued ahead of the release of the GMMP report and Pakistan’s National Report.
“The overwhelming focus on cross-border shelling, political statements, and military assessments meant that women’s stories almost disappeared from the news cycle. While the conflict skewed 2025’s data, the long-term trend still shows biases that continue to limit women’s visibility and voice in Pakistani media.”
Regarding news on gender-based violence (GBV), the statement said that “across all media monitored on the monitoring day, only one story on GBV appeared,” adding “the sole story focused on intimate partner violence, portraying the woman strictly as a victim.”
“No human rights lens or legal framework was applied,” it stated.
The statement further revealed that this year, women made only 13pc of news subjects, down from 18pc in 2020. “All stories that included women as subjects were reported by men.”
“These numbers show a clear reversal of progress made over previous cycles and highlight how deeply women’s representation is tied to editorial priorities and news routines,” it added.
It, however, added that the only area where women’s representation showed an increase in Pakistan was in social and legal news, where their presence rose to 20pc from 14pc in 2020.
Global highlights
Progress on gender equality in the news largely stalled across 94 countries, according to the statement.
“Women make up 26pc of people seen or cited in traditional news, and 29pc in digital news. These figures have barely shifted in a decade. The structure of news continues to prioritise male-dominated political and economic coverage, in both traditional and digital media.”
It added that women’s visibility improved over time in political and economic stories, but remained extremely low in sports (15pc).
“Women continue to be portrayed as victims at twice the rate of men, with 2025 showing a shift toward domestic violence and other crimes as the primary victim categories,” it said.
“Women remain underrepresented in expert roles, although digital news shows rising numbers of women experts. Stories by women journalists continue to feature more women sources and are more likely to apply a gender lens.”
Globally, it added, less than 2pc of news stories cover GBV. While the stories tend to apply a clearer gender perspective, the volume is too low to influence broader narratives.
“The 2025 findings show a media environment where change has slowed significantly, and existing approaches are not delivering meaningful improvements in gender equality,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-10 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10113152b6e2ad0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960301/ihc-grants-10-day-protective-bail-to-youtuber-rajab-butt-tiktoker-nadeem-nani-wala-after-they-surrender-in-court' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants 10-day protective bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt, TikToker Nadeem Nani Wala after they surrender in court</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt and TikToker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, on Wednesday in multiple cases related to gambling apps, cybercrime and other allegations after they surrendered before the court.
Justice Raja Inam Ameen Minhas approved the bail after the social media influencers appeared before the IHC after reaching Pakistan from the United Kingdom.
The development comes a day after the IHC granted protective bail to the two till December 10 (today), in response to a petition filed by Butt and Mubarak’s relatives, to ensure the content creators were not arrested upon their arrival in Pakistan.
Their counsel informed the court yesterday that Butt and Mubarak had been abroad for several months and feared arrest upon landing at Islamabad International Airport.
He argued that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other departments had registered several cases against them, but under the law the petitioners were entitled to seek relief from the relevant forum before any arrest.
After hearing the arguments, the court approved one-day protective bail and restrained the authorities from arresting the petitioners at the airport. The judge further directed both influencers to appear before the IHC today to mark their presence so that proceedings in the pending cases could move forward.
Meanwhile, it was also reported that Butt was being deported from the UK after British authorities cancelled his visa. However, his lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq said in a post on social media platform X that the YouTuber had not been deported from the UK and was returning to Pakistan of his own free will.







Cases against social media influencers
According to official records, the two are nominated in several FIRs registered under various cybercrime provisions, including allegations related to operating or promoting gambling applications, misuse of digital platforms and online harassment. The FIA had earlier issued multiple notices, but their stay abroad meant no substantial progress could be made in the investigations.
In September this year, Butt was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for allegedly promoting online gambling apps on social media.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car.
On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, IK-804, which is said to be the prisoner number allotted to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, in March, Butt was also booked under blasphemy and cybercrime laws due to a “religious stir” caused by the launch of his perfume brand that allegedly mocked Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Butt launched his “295” perfume, which refers to the namesake blasphemy law in the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last December, the YouTuber found himself in legal trouble when he was arrested for illegally keeping a lion cub and weapons at his residence. He pleaded guilty in January this year to owning an undocumented wild animal after accepting the cub as a wedding gift.
He avoided jail by promising a judge to post animal rights videos for a year.</p><small>2025-12-10 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10112755fbd2735.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960217/accused-in-doctor-murder-case-remanded-to-police' target='_blank'><strong>Accused in doctor murder case remanded to police</strong></a><br><p>ABBOTTABAD: An anti-terrorism court handed over the accused in the Dr Warda Mushtaq murder case to the police here on Tuesday on a three-day physical remand amid street protests against the medical doctor’s brutal killing in various parts of the province.
Waheed Billa, husband of accused Rida, and others were presented before the ATC, which remanded them in police custody.
In order to prevent any untoward incident in light of the people’s anger, the district administration sealed all cloth shops in the city belonging to Billa’s family. The key accused in the case, Shamrez, is still at large, increasing people’s resentment against police.
Dr Warda was laid to rest in the cantonment area graveyard on Monday night after funeral prayers were offered at 10pm.
Medical staff members of the hospital were among the people who took the body toher house for final rituals.
A pall of gloom descended over the place, with most people having teary eyes. With the doctor’s children, father, brother and other relatives present, some of them fainted. Fellow doctors went to Dr Warda’s grave and placed wreaths.
DIG of Hazara police Nasir Mahmood Satti said the investigation into the murder would consider all aspects.
A special police investigation team under the patronage of DPO Haroonur Rashid has already been formed.
Those named in the case have been arrested, while special teams have been formed to arrest crime facilitators.
“We will fulfil all legal requirements and bring killers and their facilitators to justice,” he said.
Meanwhile, the DPO removed Sub-Inspector Zubair Khan from the post of the SHO at the Cantonment Police Station and appointed Inspector Ali Jadoon in his place.
Health minister Khaliqur Rehman visited the deceased’s house and offered condolences to the family. He pledged all possible support to it.
“The brutal murder of Dr. Warda Mushtaq is a big tragedy. The government is taking it very seriously and will ensure dispensation of justice at all costs. The accused won’t get off scot-free,” he said.
The minister later visited the Benazir Teaching Hospital Abbottabad and met the representatives of the doctors association.
“The safety of doctors is the top priority of our government. Those serving in the health sector are a valuable asset to us,” he said.
He said a JIT had been formed to conduct a transparent investigation into the murder and it was discharging its responsibility in a completely professional manner.
Doctors at the Benazir Shaheed Hospital observed a complete strike.
A condolence reference was also held to pay tribute to the deceased. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees participated and prayed for Dr Warda. They also demanded exemplary punishment for the killers.
The doctors of Ayub Medical Complex staged a protest sit-in on the Silk Road. Along with nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees, they demanded that the killers and their facilitators be brought to justice. The protesters shouted slogans against the district administration and police and demanded the arrest of the SHO of the Cantonment police station and DSP (Cantt).
Also, medical staff members at the tehsil headquarters hospitals in Havelian and Lora staged street protests.
In Mansehra, doctors, paramedics and nurses from across upper parts of Hazara Division observed a complete strike, suspending all health services, except emergency for patients.
They also took to the streets and demanded exemplary punishment for the killers.
Healthcare professionals at public-sector facilities in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts participated in the strike.

According to an official statement, City DSP Paras Bakhrani, her Garhi Yasin counterpart, Zahoor Soomro, and two other members of the police team received critical wounds in the gun battle.
Sharing details of the whole episode with the media, Shikarpur SSP Shahzaib Chachar said that the police team led by the two DSPs had gone to the Manchhar area after receiving information about presence of a smaller gang that had robbed Rs2.6m from a grain trader in the city’s Anaj Mandi a day earlier.
The SSP said that the robbery suspects, along with their several other heavily armed associates, were spotted there and challenged. The suspects opened an indiscriminate fire on the police team and were given a matching response, he added.

He said that in the gun battle, 10 of the embattled suspects were gunned down while the two DSPs and two constables were critically wounded. Several other suspects might also have been wounded but all surviving outlaws fled the Manchhar area.
He said that reinforcement was called in and adjoining areas were cordoned off to apprehend all of them.
A house-to-house search was being carried out in and around the Manchhar area, he said.
The SSP said that eight of the killed suspects were identified as Gul Mohammad and his two sons, Shahzado alias Shaddo and Shahmore; Sajid, brother of Gul Mohammad; Imdad and his brother Ayaz, and Owais, s/o Abdul Jabbar — all belonging to the Shaikh community — and Ghulam Mohammad, s/o Sadiq Bakhrani. Two others were yet to be identified.
All the wounded police officers and personnel were rushed to the Ziauddin Hospital in Sukkur for treatment.
Sukkur DIG, SSP visit under treatment police officers
Sukkur DIG retired Captain Faisal Abdullah Chachar, along with Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal, visited them at the hospital and prayed for their speedy recovery. He issued necessary directives to the hospital administration regarding their best possible treatment.
Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also called for all possible medical assistance to them and held out the assurance that the provincial government would extend every possible cooperation to them.
The minister saluted the police team, especially the two DSPs, for the bravery it demonstrated in the fight against the gangsters. He said the officers and personnel risked their lives in the line of duty as well as for the safety and security of citizens.
He also congratulated the Shikarpur SSP and his subordinates for the successful police action.
He emphasised that operations against dacoit gangs and other criminals in Shikarpur district must continue.
The Sindh government stood with the police in the eradication of crime from society, he added.
Faryal Talpur speaks to DSP Paras
MPA Faryal Talpur made a telephonic call to under treatment DSP Paras and inquired about her health.
She prayed for her speedy recovery and praised her “unparalleled bravery and dedication to duty”.
She also prayed for early recovery of DSP Zahoor Soomro and the two injured policemen.
Doctors who were treating DSP Paras said that she had received one bullet each to her chest and abdomen.
Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon called in Police Surgeon Dr Fiza Jafri from Karachi and requested her to supervise the surgery. Dr Jafri flew into Sukkur by an air ambulance and proceeded straight to the Ziauddin Hospital to undertake the task.
The police authorities directed the hospital administration and other concerned to keep ready an air ambulance so that DSP Paras could be taken to Karachi for proper treatment, if need be.
On the request, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Haider Shah immediately arranged an air ambulance and put it at the disposal of the hospital administration.
A late evening report, however, suggested that the condition of DSP Paras was stable after surgery.
Meanwhile, the Shikarpur police were in the process of locating the bodies of two unidentified suspects killed during the gun battle. A picture released by the police showed bodies of eight suspects.
They named one of the two injured constables as Noor Brohi. Despite repeated requests by Dawn, they could not identify the other constable.

In a determination, Nepra said the 33 paise per unit higher charges would be applied to all consumers across the country, including K-Electric, under the quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for 1QFY26. The authority has allowed the positive quarterly adjustments of Rs6.067 billion to be applicable to all consumer categories, except lifeline consumers and prepaid consumers, in three months starting December, it said.
In a separate determination, the regulator also allowed the Power Division to notify its incremental consumption package for industrial and agricultural electricity consumers of ex-Wapda Distribu­tion Companies (Discos) and K-Electric.
Under the package, the reduced rate of Rs22.98 per unit — the marginal cost of power supply — would be applicable to industrial and private agricultural consumers, including both Time-of-Use and Non-ToU categories on their peak and off-peak incremental consumption over the corresponding reference period.
A Power Division spokesperson welcomed the decision and added that under the new tariff structure, the price of additional units for agriculture and industry had been reduced to Rs22.98 per unit from their existing rates of Rs38 and Rs34 per unit, respectively.

 

The package will remain applicable for three years on a monthly basis and the reference months for determining incremental consumption shall be from December 2023 to November 2024. The incremental package is subsidy-neutral for both but will be subject to positive Fuel Cost-Adjustments (FCAs). Further, Quarterly Tariff Adjustments (QTAs), Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) and negative FCAs shall not be applicable on incremental consumption for eligible consumers.
Nepra also released an additional note of its member, technical Rafique A Shaikh, exposing the deep-rooted inefficiencies, theft and mismanagement of power plants, including inadequate utilisation of cheaper plants and greater capacity payments.
Mr Shaikh, who completed his two terms at the regulator, in his departing note said such unnecessary costs arising from inefficiencies should not be passed on to consumers. “Transferring such costs to consumers may lead to an industrial slowdown, reduced GDP growth, increased unemployment, pressure on the current account deficit, weakened socio-economic activities, and an overall deterioration in the quality of life across the country”, he said and demanded that the concerned companies and organisations should bear these inefficiencies themselves.
He pointed out that QTAs primarily reflected variations in the Power Purchase Price (PPP), including the impact of T&D losses. The data clearly showed lower plant factors for thermal power plants operating under ‘Take-or-Pay’ capacity contracts.

The directive came from the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, who expressed displeasure over rising taxes on mobile phones, noting that these institutions have wrongly classified mobile phones as luxury items.
The chairman urged both the FBR and Tax Policy Office to review current tax rates on mobile phone imports under the personal baggage and registration schemes. Mr Qamar said the report should be prepared by March 2026, enabling the committee to examine the matter comprehensively ahead of the next budget.

 

MNA Qasim Gilani criticised the heavy taxes on mobile phones, noting that consumers are forced to pay taxes again if their phones are lost or stolen. He highlighted that smartphones are already very expensive, citing a tax of Rs35,000 on older iPhone 6 models and Rs100,000 on iPhone 12 imports. “People are using smartphones for content creation, video sharing, and e-commerce,” he said, stressing their role in livelihoods.

FBR chairman claims smartphone taxes, prices have declined overall

MNA Sharmila Faruqi pointed out that the latest iPhone costs Rs350,000, with an additional tax burden of Rs190,000. FBR officials clarified that levies are applied on the price of devices rather than on specific models.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig said that a clear mechanism for taxation is essential, rejecting the notion that smartphones are exclusively for the wealthy.
The PTA chairman informed the committee that only six per cent of high-end phones are imported, while the majority are locally manufactured. He also announced that 5G licences are expected to be issued by February-March next year.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that smartphone prices and taxes have declined overall, except for a few major brands. He reported that Rs82 billion in tax revenue was generated from mobile phones in the last fiscal year.
The committee suggested placing smartphones under the Eighth Schedule to provide relief to consumers. Tax officials explained that the Ninth Schedule currently applies to telecom, while the Eighth Schedule offers concessions. They added that, apart from Apple, most smartphones are now manufactured domestically.

A Chinese delegation headed by the Group’s Chairman, Wang Jianbin, accompanied by representatives of China-Pakistan Business Forum, met Minister for the Board of Investment (BoI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, on Tuesday. The delegation conveyed its intention to invest billions of dollars in Pakistan’s solar energy and other high-tech sectors.
Welcoming the proposal, Mr Sheikh said it was “a great time and a golden opportunity for investment in Pakistan”. He highlighted the government’s commitment to improving the business environment, citing recent reforms launched by the prime minister to ease of doing business, including the new single-window Business Facilitation Centre (BFC) process for business facilitation.
As part of its facilitation package, the BOI informed the delegation that the government is prepared to allocate 6,000 acres of land for investment. The minister also briefed the visitors on Special Economic Zones (SEZs), which offer various incentives, including zero income tax for the first 10 years.

Chairman Wang Jianbin meets BOI Minister Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh; proposes multi-billion-dollar investment in solar and high-tech sectors

Mr Sheikh noted that Pakistan is on a path to economic stabilisation, with the stock market index having risen nearly four-to-five-fold over the past year. He reiterated that sectors such as agriculture, solar energy, information technology, chemicals, and manufacturing offer significant growth and export potential for foreign investors.
The meeting also reviewed outcomes of the second edition of the Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference held in Beijing in September this year, which resulted in agreements and joint ventures worth $8.5 billion across multiple priority sectors.
The minister reaffirmed the BOI’s commitment to supporting Chinese investors and called for expediting feasibility studies and joint-venture agreements.
He emphasised that Pakistan remains a strategic partner for China and welcomes high-quality, green-tech investments that will generate jobs and promote sustainable economic growth.

A meeting of the ECC, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also tightened rules for second-hand vehicle imports and restricted the import of chloroform solely to drug companies certified by the regulator.







A senior government official told Dawn that the ECC approved a Rs1.22 per litre increase in profit margins for OMCs and Rs1.34 per litre for petroleum dealers, to be implemented in two equal instalments.
The first increase — 61 paise per litre for OMCs and 67 paise per litre for dealers — will take effect with the upcoming fortnightly price revision. This will immediately raise the OMCs’ margin to Rs8.48 per litre and that of dealers to Rs9.31 per litre.
The second equivalent increase will come into force on June 1, 2026, subject to digitalisation of sales and stock networks and their live connectivity with government bodies, including the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Federal Board of Revenue and Petroleum Division.
After this increase, OMCs will charge Rs9.10 per litre while dealers will receive about Rs9.98 per litre, compared to the current Rs7.87 and Rs8.64, respectively.
An official statement said the ECC had approved revising margins for OMCs and petroleum dealers on petrol and high-speed diesel in line with the National CPI for 2023-24 and 2024-25, with increases capped between 5pc and 10pc.
It added that half of the margin increase would be paid immediately while the remaining half would depend on progress in digitalisation, with the Petroleum Division to report back by June 1, 2026.
Vehicle import procedure
The ECC also approved amendments to the vehicle import procedure, retaining only the Transfer of Residence and Gift Schemes, as proposed by the commerce ministry in consultation with other ministries. The Personal Baggage Scheme has now been discontinued.
Under the revised framework, commercial-import safety and environmental standards will apply to these schemes, the allowed import period will be extended from two to three years, and imported vehicles will remain non-transferable for one year.
The changes follow widespread misuse of the Personal Baggage, Transfer of Residence and Gift Schemes under the Import Policy Order (IPO) 2022 — originally intended for genuine overseas Pakistanis — and pressure from local assemblers facing quality competition and foreign exchange concerns.
The decision includes a one-year non-transferability condition for imported vehicles, though enforcement of such rules has historically been weak.
It also increased the minimum stay abroad requirement to three years with at least 850 cumulative days, and retains the condition that vehicles under the Transfer of Residence Scheme must be exported from the same country where the sender resides.
The ECC also approved restrictions on chloroform imports due to its toxic and carcinogenic nature, deciding that Trichloromethane (chloroform) will only be imported by pharmaceutical companies with a no-objection certificate from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap).
The move follows demands from the Pakistan Footwear Manufacturers Association (PFMA) and the Pakistan Chemical Manufacturers Association (PCMA) for a complete ban, arguing that chloroform was being used as an adhesive in the footwear industry and posed serious health and environmental risks.
The ministries of industries and production, climate change, national health services regulations and coordination and FBR supported a complete ban, but Drap argued that chloroform was essential as a laboratory reagent and for quality control testing in pharmaceutical industries.
The ECC also rejected a concessionary gas/RLNG tariff claim by M/s Ghani Glass, saying that such subsidies were no longer permissible and that broader export-support initiatives were already underway.
The meeting approved a Rs1.28bn supplementary grant for the Pakistan Digital Authority to support digital transformation and technological innovation across government departments, and another Rs5bn supplementary grant for the Ministry of Housing and Works.
It also approved, in principle, the release of budgetary allocations for PIA Holding Company Ltd to meet pension and medical expenses of PIACL employees.

“Following the understandings and a directive of the political echelon, starting tomorrow (Wednesday) the transfer of goods and aid from Jordan to the area of Judea and Samaria and to the Gaza Strip will be permitted through the Allenby Crossing,” an Israeli official said in a statement, using the Israeli Biblical term for the West Bank.
“All aid trucks destined for the Gaza Strip will proceed under escort and security, following a thorough security inspection,” the official added.
Israel closed the crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, in September. The crossing in the Jordan Valley reopened to travellers a few days later, but not to humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip, devastated by more than two years of war.
Since the closure at Allenby, Jordan said it had been able to send some aid to Gaza via the Sheikh Hussein crossing, north of the occupied West Bank.

Hamas says Gaza ceasefire plan cannot proceed to its second phase as long as Israeli violations persist

The Allenby crossing is the only international gateway for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank that does not require entering Israel, which has occupied the territory since 1967.
Israeli continues ceasefire violations
In a related development, Hamas said on Tuesday that the Gaza ceasefire plan cannot proceed to its second phase as long as Israeli “violations” persist and called on mediators to pressure Israel to respect the agreement.
The US-sponsored ceasefire, in effect since October 10, halted the Israel-Hamas war, but it remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of breaches.
Hamas political bureau member Hossam Badran accused Israel of failing to respect the Gaza ceasefire deal, noting that under its terms, Israel should have reopened the Rafah crossing with Egypt and increased the volume of aid entering the territory.
He urged the mediators, who include Egypt, Qatar and the US, to pressure Israel “to complete the implementation of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement”.
Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians committed to releasing the remaining 48 living and dead Israeli prisoners held in the territory. All of the prisoners have so far been released except for one body.
In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians in its custody and returned the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians.
The first phase of the truce also stipulates significantly more aid enter Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects the second phase of the deal to begin soon but Badran said it could not start “as long as the occupation (Israel) continues its violations”.
Under the initial steps of the ceasefire plan, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-called “Yellow Line” in Gaza, though they remain in control of more than half of the territory.
As Israel’s military chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, was quoted as saying that the demarcation line was the “new border line”, Badran slammed the comments. “The statements… clearly reveal the criminal occupation’s lack of commitment to the ceasefire agreement,” he said.
The second stage of the truce plan concerns disarming Hamas, the further withdrawal of Israeli forces as a transitional authority is established, and the deployment of an international stabilisation force.
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Israeli premier’s office said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet President Donald Trump in the United States on December 29.
It will be Netanyahu’s fifth visit to meet Trump in the US since the start of the year.

The organisations, inclu­ding Amnesty Interna­tional, Save the Children, Human Rights Watch and church groups, urged the government to bring the roughly 1,800 Afghans to Germany from Pakistan before the end of the year.
Those affected must be evacuated in the coming weeks to protect them from deportation back to Afghanistan, the groups said.
The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government, but have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
Around 350 people on the scheme have been able to come to Germany after winning legal challenges against the government in German courts.

UNHCR survey shows only 1.2m of 2m Afghans in Pakistan are registered

According to the open letter sent to the German government by the NGOs on Tuesday, most of those left in Afghanistan are women and children.
“Especially now, during the Christmas season, we remember humanity and compassion. Therefore, we appeal to you: finally bring those to whom we have promised protection to safety,” the letter said.
Those affected include those who served with German armed forces in Afghanistan, as well as journalists and human rights activists.
Germany says it has received assurances from the Pakistan government that the Afghans on the scheme would not be deported before the year end, but this deadline cannot be extended.
UNHCR data
According to the UN refugee agency data released on Tuesday, a population count of Afghans living in Pakistan revealed that they number over 2.18 million, out of whom 1.22m are registered, with only 35pc of registered Afghans living in refugee villages.
It shows over 1.09m registered Afghan refugees holding PoR cards. According to the UN body, this figure does not include 138,701 unregistered members of registered families.
The number of asylum seekers registered with the UNHCR is 115,652, out of which Afghans number 115,390. Others are from Yemen, Iran, Somalia, Myanmar and Syria.
“The statistics of registered asylum seekers have been revised as a result of verification exercise,” the UN refugee agency says.

Additionally, an outdated criminal justice system and institutional overreach contribute to civil rights violations. What lies ahead for Pakistan’s children is the more pressing aspect. Not only are millions without essential services — food, education and health — they are also forced into labour and illicit trade. Even their existence is ignored by the state: The Human Rights Review noted that only 42pc of children under five were registered at birth. Pakistan, with some 26m children out of school, has allowed the education emergency to persist. Education statistics show that 40pc of children have only a slim chance of acquiring a primary education. This is worsened by the displacement and destruction wrought by both extreme weather patterns and turmoil in KP and Balochistan. According to a World Bank report, poverty caused by climate change will hover over 49m people in South Asia by 2030. Every statistic signifies a future adult lost to exploitation and indigence. 
For a society that has rearranged itself around uncertainty and scarcity, this year’s theme, ‘our everyday essentials’, which upholds food, water, “peace and justice as core rights, not abstract ideas”, is a distant dream. Climate and economic calamities, conflict and an increasingly polluted environment have brought Pakistan to the brink of a hunger crisis. As per new estimates, 11m people are likely to face food insecurity, with elevated levels of severe malnutrition in Sindh and KP. This is a fearsome state of affairs that has led to a sense of deprivation among citizens. Human rights are crucial entitlements upheld with enforceable laws. Instead of restricting its focus to economic misfortunes, the state must intervene with urgent pro-people policies that prioritise nutrition and shelter for women and children, alongside climate-resilient agriculture and access to clean water. Moreover, educational and healthcare reforms cannot be postponed. As transforming these structures is an extended process, mobile units must ensure steady learning and well-being for affected children. The state’s inability to realise that a human rights system is only possible when politicians are answerable for rights excesses, has left our young wedged between deprivation and illiteracy.
