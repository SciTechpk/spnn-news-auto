Speaking at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York yesterday, the PM told interviewer Ayman Mohyeldin that the attack on the Israeli soldiers was “basically a violation by the Palestinian party”, pointing out that while Hamas has put out a statement that they are not in communication with this group, there is no “verification if this is true or not”.

It is important to note, however, that following the attack on the soldier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “powerful” retaliatory strikes on Gaza.
The attacks killed 104 people, mostly women and children, Al Jazeera reported, citing Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel claimed its strikes targeted senior Hamas fighters, killing dozens, and then said it would start observing the ceasefire again mid-Wednesday.
“We’ve been engaging in a very intensive way with both parties in order to ensure that the ceasefire holds,” Qatar’s PM stated. “The US engagement, of course, was key in that. And I believe that what happened yesterday [Tuesday] was a violation.”
He pointed out that there had been discussions about Hamas trying to “delay the transfer of bodies”. “We made it very clear for them that this is part of the commitment that we needed to be fulfilled,” he added.
“From our perspective, since the start of this, since October 7 until today, if you look throughout the process, we went through a lot of challenges, a lot of obstacles, and it wasn’t an easy road,” he said.
“We tried our best to navigate and to make sure that we achieved the first [ceasefire], the second one, and now the ceasefire that hopefully will last,” the PM added.
Referring to the incident as “very disappointing and frustrating”, Al-Thani said they are trying to contain it. “We mobilised right away after this and in full coordination with the United States. And we have seen that the US is also committed to the deal.”</p><small>2025-10-30 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30191240a7257ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952175/first-time-offenders-caught-by-e-ticketing-system-can-have-fines-waived-after-apology-sindh-cm' target='_blank'><strong>First-time offenders caught by e-ticketing system can have fines waived after apology: Sindh CM</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said on Wednesday that first-time offenders caught by the newly implemented traffic e-ticketing system can have their fines waived within 10 days by appearing in person and submitting an apology, according to a press release.
The CM inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) on Monday.
He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance.
According to the press release, CM Shah received a report from Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon detailing traffic rule violations under the new system, which has issued fines to 35 official vehicles for various infractions.
“According to the report, e-challans were issued for offences such as not wearing seatbelts, running red lights, using tinted windows, and operating mobile phones while driving,” the press release stated.
The report revealed that a police vehicle was fined for a seatbelt violation on the Lyari Expressway at 1:36pm on Tuesday. Traffic Deputy Inspector General Peer Muhammad Shah informed the chief minister that the vehicle’s driver was twice observed not wearing a seatbelt between Garden and Lyari Expressway, triggering the automated system to issue a Rs10,000 fine, according to the press release.
“The CM said that first-time offenders can have their fines waived within 10 days by appearing in person and submitting an apology,” the press release stated.
“Even the police must comply with traffic regulations. This system upholds fairness and accountability for all citizens,” CM Shah was quoted as saying.
The press release added the provincial chief executive underlined the importance of traffic law compliance for public safety and directed that while first-time offenders can have their challans waived, repeat offenders would pay fines without exception.
“All citizens have equal rights under the law — compliance must be ensured across the board,” CM Shah added.
On Tuesday, more than 2,650 electronic challans were issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the inauguration of the new e-ticketing system. According to the Sindh police, 1,535 challans were issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving.
Additionally, seven challans were issued for putting tints on vehicle windows, five challans each for improper parking and parking in a no-parking zone, four for stop line violation, and three each for lane line violation and driving on the wrong way.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.</p><small>2025-10-30 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301855534d920da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952174/pakistan-seeks-peace-with-all-neighbours-but-will-not-allow-cross-border-terrorism-from-afghanistan-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks peace with all neighbours, but will not allow cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan: COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Thursday that Pakistan sought peace with all neighbours, including Afghanistan, but reiterated that the country will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil.
According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Field Marshal Munir made the comments during a trip to Peshawar, where he held an interactive session with a jirga of tribal elders. Later on, he was given a comprehensive briefing at Headquarters 11 Corps on the prevailing security environment, operational preparedness and ongoing counter terrorism efforts to maintain peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border.
Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have worsened sharply in recent weeks, marked by border clashes and mutual accusations. Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul against permitting the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to use Afghan territory for attacks — an allegation the Taliban reject. After a ceasefire, both sides initiated talks in Turkiye to develop a mechanism for monitoring Taliban measures to curb cross-border assaults, but discussions have so far reached a stalemate.
While addressing the jirga, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that “despite the continuation of cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan, Pakistan, over the last few years has exercised patience and extended multiple diplomatic and economic overtures to Afghanistan, aimed at improving Pak-Afghan bilateral relations.”
“However, instead of acting decisively against Indian-sponsored terror proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan, [the] Afghan Taliban regime has been providing all possible assistance to these groups,” the statement said.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
It added that during the interaction, the COAS assured the tribal elders that Pakistan, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, will be “cleansed of the terrorists and their abettors.”
The army chief also appreciated the “steadfast and unconditional support” rendered by the tribal people to the security forces during the recent standoff between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.
“He paid rich tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of the brave people of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in [the] war against terrorism,” the statement said, adding that the tribal elders reiterated their “full support to the armed forces against terrorism and also against the Afghan Taliban.”
Per the statement, the tribal elders appreciated the candid discourse by the COAS and expressed their unwavering commitment to peace in Pakistan and highlighted that the “twisted ideology” of the Fitna al Khwarij had no acceptance among the tribes of KP.

A first information report (FIR) — seen by Dawn.com — was filed against two landowners who allegedly attacked and mutilated a cow that crossed onto their land under Section 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant, who is the owner of the cow, alleged that the suspects struck its front leg with an axe, severely injuring it. They fled the scene while threatening the complainant.
Jhelum District Police Officer Tariq Aziz Sindhu told Dawn.com that both suspects had been arrested, one of whom was apprehended from a forested area near the scene of the incident.
“Police have registered a case under Section 429 of the PPC and investigations are underway,” the DPO said
“Cruelty against animals is intolerable and after proper investigation, those found guilty will be presented before the court of law,” the DPO added.
The FIR read that the cow had been shifted to a veterinary hospital in Chak Aka for treatment.
Animal cruelty is not a new phenomenon in Pakistan.
On Sunday, a landlord and his son were charged with animal cruelty after they tortured a buffalo and tried to cut off its legs for entering their home in Minchinabad, in Bahawalnagar.
Police said that a farmer from Munshi Hathar owned some cattle and one of them accidentally entered the house of a landlord while grazing on October 18.
The landlord allegedly trapped the animal and, along with his son, tried to cut off its legs with axes and stabbed it repeatedly. They allegedly left the buffalo on the road in a critically injured state. After video footage of the incident went viral on social media, police took action and arrested the main suspect.
In September, a female camel, allegedly tortured by a landowner in Sukkur, was handed over to a private animal shelter in Karachi.
According to an FIR, the complainant alleged that when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor, causing severe injuries.
Last year, a magistrate in Sanghar remanded six suspects into police custody in connection with the mutilation of a camel that saw the animal’s right leg chopped off in Mund Jamrao village. The incident took place when a landlord allegedly chopped off the camel’s leg as punishment for foraging into his field for fodder.
In July this year, that camel stood up for the first time since the incident with the help of a prosthetic leg.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30175544d08f36c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952166/kp-cm-denied-adiala-meeting-with-imran-for-4th-time-despite-ihc-order' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM denied Adiala meeting with Imran for 4th time despite IHC order</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was on Thursday denied a meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for the fourth time since assuming office.
The denial comes despite the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last week directing the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for the former prime minister.
Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister earlier this month.
Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, Afridi said he was yet again prevented by the police from meeting Imran.
He was flanked by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was approved by the IHC as the designated person to provide the jail officials with the list of individuals named to meet Imran.
 






Afridi highlighted the various legal steps he had taken in order to secure his meeting with Imran, including letters written to the Punjab Home Department and the federal government, along with approaching the IHC.
“Imagine that someone in Pakistan is so powerful that they are considering themselves beyond the scope of the law and the Constitution, so now we are in a quandary about what to do next,” he said.
The chief minister added that the PTI leadership will gather to discuss the matter and announce a plan of action.
In a video statement, Senator Aon Abbas Buppi, flanked by Afridi, said they both were listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today and had departed for Adiala jail.
However, Buppi claimed, they were stopped by the Punjab Police while on their way to the prison.
“What will be bigger shamelessness than this. The Islamabad High Court’s chief justice is ordering the CM in writing that go and meet your leader, and a jail superintendent — a Grade 17-18 officer — said ‘I do not acknowledge any court’,” the senator said.
Without disclosing where they were, Buppi said they were waiting for someone to “come to their senses and allow the meeting”.
 






Earlier today, CM Afridi told reporters in Peshawar that if barred again from meeting the PTI founder, he would file a contempt case against the Adiala jail administration for not following the IHC directives.
A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait.
CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others.
 
 

Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not do so again.
Most recently, the KP CM visited Rawalpindi on Tuesday but was denied to meet the imprisoned ex-premier for the third time.
Delay in forming KP cabinet
Having faced criticism from KP opposition MPAs over the delay in forming the provincial cabinet, Afridi said earlier today that he would announce a “compact” cabinet later today.
Considering the multiple failed attempts to meet Imran in person, the latter’s sister, Uzma Khanum, told the newly appointed CM on Tuesday he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
 
 

“I direct Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi to establish a compact, need-based cabinet. The selection of ministers is entirely his prerogative, as I have proposed no names,” a post on Imran’s official X account quoted him as saying.
KP opposition members have said government affairs had come to a halt due to the failure to form the cabinet.
The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30144743f67a5bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952154/israel-demanded-google-amazon-use-secret-code-to-bypass-legal-obligations-investigation-reveals' target='_blank'><strong>Israel demanded Google, Amazon use secret code to bypass legal obligations, investigation reveals</strong></a><br><p>Tech giants Google and Amazon agreed to use a secret code to evade legal obligations in countries around the world to serve Israeli interests, a report by The Guardian has revealed.
The joint investigation, conducted with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, highlights how a $1.2 billion cloud-computing deal in 2021 (known as Project Nimbus)  between Israeli government and the tech firms had an “unusual demand”, i.e., agree to use a secret code as part of an arrangement that would become known as the “winking mechanism”.
Project Nimbus was a joint contract that aimed to provide cloud computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI) and other technology services to the Israeli government and its military, which has faced condemnation for its war on Gaza, described by United Nations experts and several countries as a genocide.
Google employees based in the United States also staged protests last year at the tech giant’s offices in New York City, California and Seattle to oppose the contract.
The unusual demand as part of the Project Nimbus, according to the Guardian, was born out of Israel’s concerns that data it moves into the global corporations’ cloud platforms could end up in the hands of foreign law enforcement authorities.
“Google and Amazon’s cloud businesses routinely comply with requests from police, prosecutors and security services to hand over customer data to assist investigations,” the report points out. However, “the process is often cloaked in secrecy”.
“The companies are frequently gagged from alerting the affected customer their information has been turned over. This is either because the law enforcement agency has the power to demand this or a court has ordered them to stay silent,” the report states.
But for Israel, losing control of its data to authorities overseas was a significant concern. “So to deal with the threat, officials created a secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.”
According to the report, “Israeli officials inserted into the Nimbus deal a requirement for the companies to send coded message, a “wink”, to its government, revealing the identity of the country they had been compelled to hand over Israeli data to, but were gagged from saying so”.
The report refers to leaked documents from Israel’s finance ministry, which include a finalised version of the Nimbus agreement suggesting the secret code would take the form of payments (referred to as special compensation) made by the companies to the Israeli government.
Citing the documents, the Guardian details that the payments must be made within 24 hours of the information being transferred and correspond to the telephone dialling code of the foreign country, amounting to sums between 1,000 and 9,999 shekels.
The report highlights the mechanism of the deal as follows:


If either Google or Amazon provides information to authorities in the US, where the dialling code is +1, and they are prevented from disclosing their cooperation, they must send the Israeli government 1,000 shekels.


If, for example, the companies receive a request for Israeli data from authorities in Italy, where the dialling code is +39, they must send 3,900 shekels.


If the companies conclude that the terms of a gag order prevent them from even signalling which country has received the data, there is a backstop: the companies must pay 100,000 shekels ($30,000) to the Israeli government.


Moreover, “Israeli officials also feared a scenario in which its access to the cloud providers’ technology could be blocked or restricted,” the report says.
“In particular, officials worried that activists and rights groups could place pressure on Google and Amazon, or seek court orders in several European countries, to force them to terminate or limit their business with Israel if their technology were linked to human rights violations.”
The Guardian investigation refers to government documents prepared after the deal was signed, where Israel inserted controls into the Nimbus agreement which Google and Amazon “appear to have accepted”.
“The documents state that the agreement prohibits the companies from revoking or restricting Israel’s access to their cloud platforms, either due to changes in company policy or because they find Israel’s use of their technology violates their terms of service,” the report emphasises.
The Guardian further cites an Israeli official familiar with the project stating that there can be “no restrictions” on the kind of information moved into Google and Amazon’s cloud platforms, including military and intelligence data.
“The terms of the deal seen by the Guardian state that Israel is entitled to migrate to the cloud or generate in the cloud any content data they wish,” as per the report.
“Israel inserted the provisions into the deal to avoid a situation in which the companies decide that a certain customer is causing them damage, and therefore cease to sell them services,” the Guardian cites one document as noting.
Last month, Microsoft disabled a set of cloud and AI services used by a unit within the Israeli Ministry of Defence after an internal review found preliminary evidence supporting media reports of a surveillance system in Gaza and the West Bank.
However, under the terms of the Nimbus deal, “Google and Amazon are prohibited from taking such action as it would discriminate against the Israeli government,” the Guardian points out. “Doing so would incur financial penalties for the companies, as well as legal action for breach of contract.”
The report quotes the Israeli finance ministry spokesperson who said Google and Amazon are “bound by stringent contractual obligations that safeguard Israel’s vital interests”, adding that these agreements are confidential and “we will not legitimise the article’s claims by disclosing private commercial terms”.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30165236a25ecbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952145/pti-backed-khurram-zeeshan-wins-senate-seat-vacated-after-shibli-farazs-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan wins Senate seat vacated after Shibli Faraz’s disqualification</strong></a><br><p>PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots.
A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat.
Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes.
Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, eight lawmakers did not cast their ballots, including four Awami National Party (ANP) leaders. One vote was rejected.
“Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account after his win.
“Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran.
Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan.
 






The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO).

Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year.
Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion.
 
 

Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature.
Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls.
Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court.
CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today
Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded.
This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier.
 
 

Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”.
Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today.
He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives.
During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”.
 
 

The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors.
CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.”
“This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations.
The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.

People across the Bahamas and nearby Turks and Caicos hunkered down as the passing storm pummelled them with dangerous gusts and rain. Around 600 miles (970 km) northeast of the storm’s last position, Bermudans prepared for its approach, expected by the evening.
Authorities across the region, struggling to keep track of the devastation, confirmed 25 deaths in Haiti - 10 of them children - and four in Jamaica.
As of 1200 GMT (5pm PKT) Melissa was packing winds of close to 105 miles per hour (165 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Centre, downgraded from its peak to a Category 2 hurricane.
Wading barefoot through mud
It was expected to keep accelerating northeastward and “pass to the northwest of Bermuda” later on Thursday, before likely weakening on Friday, the Florida-based forecaster said.
Bermuda will close its causeway on Thursday night and all schools and ferries on Friday, among other measures, “out of an abundance of caution,” National Security Minister Michael Weeks said in a statement.
“I implore all residents to remain vigilant while we navigate another natural threat to our way of life,” he said. People should check on their neighbours and stay off roads until further notice, he added.
Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday as the strongest-ever hurricane to directly hit its shores, with sustained winds of 185 mph, far above the minimum strength for a Category 5, the strongest classification for hurricanes.
In a neighbourhood of the island’s Montego Bay, 77-year-old Alfred Hines waded barefoot through thick mud and debris as he described his narrow escape from the rising floodwaters.
At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,” he told Reuters on Wednesday.
“I just want to forget it, and things come back to normal.” The capital Kingston, was spared the worst damage, and its main airport was set to reopen on Thursday.
But US forecaster AccuWeather estimated Melissa could cost $22 billion in damages and economic loss, and that rebuilding could take a decade or more. “DEVASTATION,” read the front page headline on Thursday’s Jamaica Observer newspaper.
Evacuations and floods
Melissa was the Caribbean’s third-most intense recorded hurricane, as well as its slowest-moving, which made it particularly destructive, AccuWeather said.
Across the Bahamas archipelago, the government flew out nearly 1,500 people as the storm approached, in what it called one of its largest evacuation operations.
High winds shook palm trees and whipped up waves at a resort near George Town, video showed on Wednesday.
The storm did not directly hit Haiti, the Caribbean’s most populous nation, but lashed it with days of rain. Authorities reported at least 25 deaths, largely due to floods in Petit-Goave, a coastal town 64 km west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.
At least 10 children were killed and 12 people are missing there, Haiti’s disaster management agency said, adding that more than 1,000 homes have been flooded nationwide and nearly 12,000 people moved into emergency shelters.
In Cuba, at least 241 communities remained isolated and without communications on Wednesday following the storm’s passage across Santiago province, according to preliminary media reports, affecting as many as 140,000 residents.
Across eastern Cuba, authorities evacuated around 735,000 people as the storm approached.
Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30171441f7add25.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952168/missing-nccia-islamabad-official-turns-up-in-fia-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Missing NCCIA Islamabad official turns up in FIA custody</strong></a><br><p>Another missing official of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Deputy Director Muhammad Usman — who was reportedly abducted from Islamabad earlier this month — has turned out to be in the custody of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in connection with a case of misusing authority and extortion, it emerged on Thursday.
Last week, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted the police one more week to trace Usman. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
However, according to an Oct 29 short order from Lahore Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo, Usman was in the FIA’s custody and remanded to three days in physical custody with directions to produce him before the district court on Saturday.
According to the remand request from the FIA’s investigating officer, the NCCIA official was arrested on Wednesday in connection with a case of colluding with other NCCIA officials, misusing their authority and extorting bribes.
Usman was nominated in the case registered on Monday by Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who was arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
Apart from Usman, six NCCIA officials from Lahore and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan and Inspector Salman Aziz were also nominated in the case.
The first information report (FIR) was registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman and the inquiry into his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to “extort Rs9m” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman’s judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added that Riaz gave Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping, while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via Muhammad Usman and Ayaz, the two NCCIA deputy directors in Islamabad, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen was assigned the investigation of the case.</p><small>2025-10-30 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300720535f583ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952131/trump-tells-pentagon-to-immediately-resume-testing-us-nuclear-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>Trump tells Pentagon to immediately resume testing US nuclear weapons</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump ordered the US military on Thursday to immediately resume testing nuclear weapons after a gap of 33 years, minutes before beginning a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump made the surprise announcement on Truth Social while he was aboard his Marine One helicopter flying to meet Xi for a trade negotiating session in Busan, South Korea. He said he was instructing the Pentagon to test the US nuclear arsenal on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers.
“Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump wrote in a social media post.
“Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”
 






The move comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Moscow had successfully tested a nuclear-capable underwater drone, in defiance of Washington’s warnings.
A senior Russian lawmaker said Trump’s decision would herald a new era of unpredictability and open confrontation, state news agency RIA reported.
China’s foreign ministry called for the US to abide by its commitment to a moratorium on nuclear testing and uphold the global strategic balance and stability.
 
 

It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to nuclear-explosive testing, which would be carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration, or flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles.
No nuclear power, other than North Korea, has carried out explosive testing in more than 25 years.
Russia insists weapons tests ‘not nuclear’
Moscow sought to cool rising nuclear tensions with Washington after the two weapons tests, stating that its testing of nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons did not constitute a direct test of an atomic weapon.
“Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, including AFP, during a daily briefing.
“This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,” he added.
The Kremlin implied that it would also test nuclear warheads if Trump ordered a live test of an atomic weapon.
“If someone departs from the moratorium [on nuclear weapon testing], Russia will act accordingly,” Peskov said.
Nuclear testing sites to be determined later
Later, on his way back to Washington, Trump said testing was needed to ensure the US keeps up with its rival nuclear powers.
“With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said on board Air Force One, adding that nuclear test sites would be determined later.
Asked whether the world was entering a more risky phase around nuclear weapons, Trump dismissed the threat, saying US stocks were “well locked up” before adding he would welcome denuclearisation.
 


“I’d like to see a denuclearisation because we have so many and Russia’s second and China’s third and China will catch up within four or five years,” he said.
“We are actually talking to Russia about that and China would be added to that if we do something.”
China more than doubled nuclear arsenal in last 5 years
Trump’s decision to restart nuclear weapons testing follows a rapid expansion by China of its nuclear stockpile in recent years.
It also comes just after Russia announced a “successful“ test of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable cruise missile as well as a nuclear-powered torpedo, which military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells.
Trump addressed the Russian moves on his way to Asia earlier this week, telling reporters that Putin should be working to end the war in Ukraine “instead of testing missiles“.
Beijing has more than doubled the size of its arsenal to an estimated 600 nuclear weapons in 2025 from 300 weapons in 2020, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank.
 
 

It said US military officials estimate that China will have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030. A Victory Day parade in September revealed five nuclear capabilities that can all reach the continental United States, CSIS said.
The Washington-based Arms Control Association (ACA) says the US has a stockpile of 5,225 nuclear warheads and Russia has 5,580.
As Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
‘Will blow apart nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’
The reaction to Trump’s announcement on testing was swift.
Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said on X: “I’ll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.”
 






ACA Director Daryl Kimball said it would take the US at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada.
“Trump is misinformed and out of touch. The US has no technical, military, or political reason to resume nuclear explosive testing for the first time since 1992,” Kimball said on X.
Trump’s announcement could “trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty”.
Apart from providing technical data, a US test would be seen in Russia and China as a deliberate assertion of Washington’s strategic power.
 






Putin has repeatedly said that Russia will test if the US does.
In August, Trump said he had discussed nuclear arms control with Putin and wanted China to get involved.
 
 

Beijing responded by saying it was “unreasonable and unrealistic” to ask the country to join in nuclear disarmament negotiations with the two countries, since its arsenal was much smaller.
Trump had first laid out his intention to pursue nuclear arms control efforts in February, saying he wanted to begin discussions with both Putin and Xi about imposing limits on their arsenals.
Most major nuclear powers, except North Korea, stopped explosive nuclear testing in the 1990s. North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in 2017. Russia’s last confirmed test was in 1990, followed by the last US test in 1992, and by China’s in 1996.
The US opened the nuclear era in July 1945 with the test of a 20-kiloton atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and then dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to force Japan to surrender in World War Two.</p><small>2025-10-30 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301646068220b26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952167/india-remains-committed-to-afghanistans-sovereignty-territorial-integrity-and-independence-foreign-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>India remains committed to Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence: foreign ministry</strong></a><br><p>Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday said that India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan, amid Kabul’s heightened tensions with Pakistan.
Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks amid border clashes and mutual accusations. Islamabad has long been warning Kabul against allowing the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil — a claim the Taliban deny. Following a ceasefire, talks in Turkiye began to establish a mechanism to monitor Taliban efforts to curb cross-border attacks, but have so far resulted in an impasse.
At a press briefing, the spokesperson received questions asking why Pakistan was blaming Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij for terrorist attacks on its soil and  Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks about Kabul fighting a proxy war on behalf of Delhi.
“In my last briefing, I had elaborated our point of view; our thoughts on this particular matter. Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its territories,” Jaiswal replied. “Pakistan seems to think it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity. Its neighbours find it unacceptable.
“India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaiswal said.
 


In response to a question about Indian projects in Afghanistan, Jaiswal referred to Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India and the joint statement issued afterwards.
“As part of the visit, we had issued a joint statement between both countries,” the spokesperson said. “This joint statement clearly emphasises that India stands ready to support all efforts of Afghanistan that are directed towards the sustainable management of water resources, including hydroelectric projects.”
Border skirmishes and failed talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.</p><small>2025-10-30 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30161338dcaa44e.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952165/ncsw-hails-justice-ayesha-maliks-landmark-marriage-dissolution-ruling-terms-it-a-progressive-step' target='_blank'><strong>NCSW hails Justice Ayesha Malik’s landmark marriage dissolution ruling, terms it a ‘progressive step’</strong></a><br><p>The National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) on Thursday welcomed a marriage dissolution judgment authored by Supreme Court Justice Ayesha A. Malik, terming it a “progressive step“ to an “equitable and gender-sensitive” interpretation of family law, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
On October 25, in a 17-page ruling, Justice Malik set aside a Peshawar High Court (PHC) ruling over a divorce case, terming psychological abuse as cruelty, based on which a marriage can legally be dissolved, along with highlighting the “deeply patriarchal” approach of the court in such cases.
NCSW chairperson, Ume Laila Azhar, in a statement, called the verdict “a progressive step towards a more equitable and gender-sensitive interpretation of family law.“
According to APP, she noted that the “court’s acknowledgement of emotional and psychological cruelty as equally serious as physical abuse marks a significant milestone in safeguarding women’s dignity and well-being within marital relationships.”
“This ruling upholds the constitutional and Islamic principles of justice, equality, and human dignity by reaffirming that Khula is an independent and inalienable right of a woman — not contingent upon the husband’s consent,” Azhar was quoted as saying.
“It strengthens the jurisprudence of women’s right to self-determination and ensures that their mental and emotional health receives due consideration in family courts,“ she added.
The commission, in its statement, also commended the “SC emphasis on adopting gender-sensitive language and eliminating patriarchal reasoning from judicial discourse,” as per the report.
The Judgement
The judgment — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com —  pertains to a case involving a woman seeking the dissolution of her marriage on the following grounds: “cruelty, non-payment of maintenance during the subsistence of marriage, and on (her spouse) taking an additional wife.”
Justice Malik’s judgment came in response to a 2024 PHC ruling, which had dismissed the petitioner’s application for dissolution of her marriage and granted her a Khula instead, without her consent.
In the judgment, Justice Malik noted, citing the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (DMMA), that dissolution of a marriage means that the “marriage can be brought to an end at the instance of the woman if she is able to successfully establish one or more of the statutory grounds provided within the DMMA.”
These include: husband’s disappearance, failure to provide maintenance, imprisonment, impotence, insanity, cruelty and the taking of an additional wife.
On the matter of cruelty, Justice Malik ruled that, as per the DMMA, “cruelty can range from physical assault, to mental or emotional abuse, to interference with property or religion, to inequitable treatment in the context of a second marriage.”
She went on to say: “As per our jurisprudence, courts have defined cruelty as being behaviour which is not limited to physical abuse but involves behaviour which can result in mental and emotional abuse.”
In a marriage, cruelty can also be any act that makes “it impossible for the wife to live with dignity and security within the marital home and relationship,” she said.
Referring to the case, Justice Malik highlighted that the family court “failed to
examine the mental and emotional abuse and the impact of the cruelty on the petitioner,” and rather “fell into error by insisting upon documentary or
medical proof.”
Further, on the matter of the petitioner enduring physical abuse at the hands of her husband, Justice Malik noted that, “The Family Court also proceeded on an incorrect premise by discarding the statements of the witnesses of the petitioner on the ground that she was never beaten in front of them.”
She continued: “It is important to note that abuse within the marital home is often a bedroom crime, which is committed in private and for which there are no witnesses.
This crime remains largely unreported due to socio-cultural barriers, economic dependency and the lack of information on the issue.“
“As a consequence, victims remain silent and endure for the sake of the family or the children,” she added.
Regarding the family court’s decision to grant the petitioner Khula without her consent, Justice Ayesha remarked that the reasoning “such reasoning conflates two separate legal remedies” and “undermines the purpose of the DMMA.”
On that note, she also highlighted that “the law demands that women’s choices, words, and rights be respected as a matter of principle, not presumption.”
Justice Malik called for “a gender lens” in deciding such matters, stating that “it helps the court understand the social realities in which women
experience cruelty.”
“Seeing the case through a gender lens also means understanding the different ways women experience harm,” she added.
Addressing the language used for the petitioner in the court’s ruling, such as  “disobedient wife” and “self-deserted lady”, she said, “using language loosely or without thought stigmatises women, trivialises abuse, and reinforces the same patriarchal thinking that the law seeks to overcome.”
“When judgments rely on stereotypes or excuse unlawful conduct, they perpetuate inequality and shape social attitudes in ways that deny women dignity, fairness, and justice,” she stressed, adding that the language used “represented a deeply patriarchal mindset.”
She continued: “It shifts the discussion from cruelty towards the woman and the exercise of her autonomy to her obedience and disobedience.
“These are social judgments disguised as findings of law,” she said, adding that “it is therefore necessary to address and correct such language as a matter of substantive justice.”</p><small>2025-10-30 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3015191431a2aa3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952163/ioc-removes-saudi-arabia-as-host-of-inaugural-esports-olympics' target='_blank'><strong>IOC removes Saudi Arabia as host of inaugural Esports Olympics</strong></a><br><p>The inaugural Esports Olympics scheduled to be held in 2027 will no longer be hosted by Saudi Arabia, the International Olympic Committee announced on Thursday.
The IOC and the Saudi National Olympic Committee “mutually agreed that they will end their cooperation on the Olympic Esports Games”, a statement said.
The first Esports Games was originally slated to be held this year in Riyadh but
were postponed in February.
 






The Saudis were guaranteed the hosting of the Games for 12 years from 2025, when the agreement was first announced by the IOC in July last year.
Then-IOC president Thomas Bach had been influential in the creation of the event but has since been replaced at the helm by Kirsty Coventry.
Olympic Esports Series competitions, smaller virtual sports events run by the IOC, were held in 2021 and 2023. They were widely panned by gaming critics over the lack of traditional esports titles.
“Recently, the two parties and the Esports World Cup Foundation sat down again and reviewed this initiative,” the IOC statement added.
“They mutually agreed that they will end their cooperation on the Olympic Esports Games. At the same time, both parties are committed to pursuing their own esports ambitions on separate paths.”
The first two editions of the Esports World Cup, which includes many of the world’s most popular games, was held in 2024 and earlier this year in Riyadh.
It is organised by Saudi Arabia.
“This approach will be a chance to better fit the Olympic Esports Games to the long-term ambitions of the Olympic movement and to spread the opportunities presented by the Olympic Esports Games more widely, with the objective of having the inaugural Games as soon as possible,” the IOC said.
Saudi sports events are routinely accused of being used as a distraction from human rights violations, a practice dubbed “sportswashing”.
The kingdom has invested heavily in sport over the last few years, though critics, including women’s rights groups and members of the LGBTQ community, allege it is using its Public Investment Fund (PIF) to sportswash its human rights record.
The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.</p><small>2025-10-30 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30145912f1c987e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952161/what-the-us-resumption-of-nuclear-testing-could-mean-for-the-rest-of-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>What the US resumption of nuclear testing could mean for the rest of the world</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he had instructed the Department of Defence to immediately resume the testing of nuclear weapons on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers, in a move that could potentially destabilise the nuclear treaty under which countries have been constrained for decades.
The move has raised concerns about the threat of nuclear power being wielded by multiple countries, including the risk of the collapse of the nuclear disarmament treaty that keeps this power under strict control.
Why is the US resuming nuclear testing?
Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social early this morning the news of the announcement, saying that the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country as a result of his first term in office.
“Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but I had no choice!” he said, adding, “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”
 






The Associated Press (AP) reports, contrastingly, that Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the US has 5,225. The two countries account for nearly 90 per cent of the world’s atomic warheads.
In his post, the president attributed the decision to other countries’ testing programmes, saying he had ordered the resumption of testing “on an equal basis” to these countries.
He was possibly alluding to the successful test of the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo by Russia as announced by its president Vladimir Putin yesterday.
There are a few confirmed details about the Poseidon, but Reuters has called it a “nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone”. Military analysts have said this torpedo is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells, while arms control experts say it breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules.
The US also has a nuclear weapons rivalry with China, which AP reports is building more ground-based nuclear missile siloes. In particular, under President Xi Jinping, NYT says that China has been rapidly building up its nuclear arsenal after decades of maintaining a comparatively modest force.
After the earlier remarks, Trump had met Xi today on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and struck a deal to reduce his harsh tariffs on China, in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases; analysts now express concern about the consequences of ratcheting up nuclear competition between the countries.
According to NYT, “Trump’s combative words alone could reinforce wariness in Beijing about US nuclear intentions. Nuclear weapons are one area where distrust between China and the United States has deepened, with little prospect for quick agreement.”
However, NYT added that when asked later about his remarks on nuclear weapons testing, Trump suggested that they were not related to China. “It had to do with others,” he said, without naming any countries. “They seem to all be nuclear testing.”
Nuclear treaty under stress
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has been signed by 187 states and is one of the most widely supported disarmament treaties in the world, according to The Conversation. Although the US has yet to ratify the treaty, it is legally bound not to violate its spirit and purpose as a signatory for decades.
According to Business Insider, the US last conducted a nuclear weapons test in 1992, when Congress pushed to halt such experiments after the Cold War’s conclusion. Former US President George H.W. Bush signed the moratorium on tests in October of the same year.
Under the treaty, both the US and Russia have agreed to keep their deployed warheads to a maximum of 1,550. However, China’s rapid buildup of weapons has led to the fear from Washington that China will soon reach the same number of nuclear weapons, turning two-way negotiations into a three-cornered struggle.
The New York Times reports that moves toward renewed explosive tests of nuclear warheads could “further endanger the treaty that for decades has constrained all but a handful of countries from carrying them out”.
A new arms race
AP reports that, if the US restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be.
Nonproliferation experts have warned that any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by backlash. They also point out the possibility that the decision will serve as a “starting gun” for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing.
If the United States follows through with resuming nuclear testing, “it would effectively give, I think, China and Russia a carte blanche to resume full-yield nuclear testing, which is something that neither country has done in a number of years,” said Ankit Panda, author of The New Nuclear Age and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, according to NYT.
Panda added that the nuclear nonproliferation regime was “under tremendous stress”, saying, “Russia, China, the United States can’t even agree on the basic principles of what really makes the nonproliferation regime tick.”
Meanwhile, Business Insider reports that some advisors have urged the US to pursue more aggressive nuclear policies and introduce additional modern methods of nuclear attack as a show of strength. As a result, concerns have been growing among nuclear analysts in Washington that the world is on the cusp of a new arms race.

Discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had begun in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern of terror attacks emanating from Afghanistan had been a bone of contention, resulting in a stalemate.
“While the talks have not begun [again], our delegation is still in Istanbul,” Asif said in an exclusive interview with Geo News.
He added that “discussions could still restart” if there was “some development that indicates a material change in Kabul’s attitude on the insistence of these two friendly countries (Turkiye and Qatar)”.
“Our stance, that there will not be any attacks on us (Pakistan) from their land and they will not back such attacks, is a sticking point. If an understanding can be reached on that, [well and good], it will be a good thing,” Asif said.
 


The minister noted, “There has been no breakthrough so far. There has been no development that you can have high hopes from.”
However, he added that the defence ministers and intelligence chiefs of the mediating countries were making efforts to end the stalemate in talks.
Asif said the Pakistani delegation had even reached the airport in Istanbul to depart, but a request was made by Turkiye and Qatar to “give us one more chance”. He said Turkish officials offered to speak to Kabul’s delegation and “pave a way out”.
The minister noted that bilateral trade and investment should take place, but added that it was in the “hands of Kabul if it wanted to play a constructive role in this”.
“But if they are stubborn or are insisting on becoming a proxy of India and backing the destruction of Pakistan’s peace, then so be it,” Asif added.
 
 

The defence minister’s comments come after security sources earlier today said Pakistan had agreed to resume talks with the Afghan Taliban at the request of mediators.
A security official said the Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was about to return, but would extend its stay there.
However, the source stressed that the discussions will be held on Pakistan’s “main demand” that Afghanistan takes “clear, verifiable and effective action” against terrorists.
It was decided to “give another chance to peace” by continuing the talks, the security official said. They added that Pakistan again underscored that Afghan soil will not be used to carry out terrorist attacks against Pakistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides over the past few weeks engaging in border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
A first round of Pak-Afghan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19 had extended an initial 48-hour truce between the neighbouring countries. The Doha talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
The second round of dialogue in Istanbul failed to “bring about any workable solution”, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said late on Wednesday after four days of deliberations. The statement was followed by strongly worded remarks by Asif, who warned Kabul of strikes deep in Afghanistan if terrorist activities continued to target Pakistan.
Obstacles in reaching agreement
According to Asif, the Afghan Taliban acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”.
However, the other side “was not ready” to give the assurance in writing, despite agreeing with them, the minister told reporters at Parliament House yesterday.
Asif stated that Pakistan was not offered to include the TTP in the talks, and even if it had been, the proposal would not have been accepted. He said the Afghan delegation was in continuous contact with Kabul, which was colluding with India and preventing an agreement.
In a separate interview with Al Arabiya, the minister said he had evidence to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
 
 

Asif asserted that “India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score“ after the May conflict with Pakistan, where it was “defeated”.
The talks in Turkiye had began with the aim of finalising a mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
The agenda included dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad had planned to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing. Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
Additional priorities included securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.</p><small>2025-10-30 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301237486cc4d4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952156/imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chattha-indicted-in-case-pertaining-to-controversial-social-media-posts' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha indicted in case pertaining to controversial social media posts</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Thursday indicted human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case related to controversial social media posts.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
 
 

Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the case, in which Mazari and Chattha both denied guilt.
The court summoned all prosecution witnesses for the next hearing and ordered Chattha to once again submit bail bonds, to which Mazari responded, “If you want to arrest us, reject my bail as well.”
The judge replied, “My principle is that if I respect you, I will get respect.”
Mazari’s advocate, Qaiser Imam, pointed out that the accused also had to appear in other cases, “sometimes at the Islamabad High Court (IHC), sometimes in Rawalpindi”.
However, in response, Judge Majoka said that he had “adjourned the hearing three times on their request for that reason”.
The court then adjourned the hearing till November 5.
Yesterday, Chattha had been arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom” on social media platform X.
 






He has now been released.
Speaking to reporters outside the court today, Chattha claimed that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”, saying, “This was not according to any law.”
He added that Majoka had recalled his “illegal order” even before they could argue against it today, but had insisted that they submit another Rs10,000 bail bond as the previous one had been forfeited. He also recalled this order after Chattha refused to comply with it, the advocate said.
“The principle is this … you are running a court, you are a judge; how are you so far removed from the four corners of law?” he said while speaking to the media. “Why do you feel that doing this (specifically targeting the two accused) will get you praise?”
Chattha also said that the era of the courts intimidating people with the threat of jail time or punishments was over, saying, “Nowadays, word spreads very quickly. People are present — witnesses are present and they see this.”
 






Asked what proceedings had been delayed yesterday and whether they had taken place today, the advocate said that only four days after the supply of copy, the court wanted to frame the charge. According to him, the judge had told the accused beforehand that if there were cases against them, they could come in at the end of the day as he was there until 3:30pm.
“Imaan went first in the morning, then at 11am, then sat there waiting for him from 2-2:30pm,” he said. “He did not leave his chamber.”
Chattha added, “The moment I got back from cases in Pindi, I was present in court before 2:35pm. And he got angry that I had appeared at the end of the day, so he couldn’t indict me … So he forfeited the bail bonds and issued the warrant to my face and had me arrested from the courtroom.”</p><small>2025-10-30 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300923053ae7f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952142/ttp-commander-among-4-terrorists-killed-as-security-forces-thwart-infiltration-attempt-at-pak-afghan-border-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>TTP commander among 4 terrorists killed as security forces thwart infiltration attempt at Pak-Afghan border: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday that a “high-value target” identified as a commander of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was among four terrorists killed after security forces thwarted an attempt to infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that last night the movement of a group of khwarij attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was picked up by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.
“Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted khwarijs’ attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, four khwarij, including kharji leader, a high-value target kharji Amjad alias Mazahim, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement further said that the militant leader was the deputy of TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and the head of Rehbari Shura of Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
The ISPR said the militant leader was wanted by law enforcement agencies and the government had allocated a bounty of Rs5 million on him as he remained “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan”.
“It is pertinent to highlight that the leadership of Fitna al Khawarij, while residing in Afghanistan, is orchestrating infiltration attempts into Pakistan — primarily to project an impression of domestic presence and to raise the diminishing morale of their khwarij in Bajaur and Mohmand because of effective operations of security forces,” the ISPR said.
“It is once again reiterated that the interim Afghan government must take concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by kharji proxies to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
“It also validates our stance that Afghan soil is continuously being used as [a] safe [haven] by khwarij belonging to Fitna al Khwarij against Pakistan,” it said.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded security forces for foiling the infiltration by India-backed Fitna al-Khwarij in Bajaur. In a post on social media platform X, he praised the troops’ courage and reaffirmed that the nation stands united under Azm-i-Istehkam to eliminate all terrorist elements.
 






18 terrorists killed in 2 separate operations in Balochistan
Earlier in the day, the ISPR said that 18 terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan. In a statement, the ISPR said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists.
 






“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country.
President Zardari, in a statement posted on X, paid tribute to security forces for eliminating 18 militants. He said that the operation was a reflection of security forces’ determination to eradicate terrorism.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said the entire nation stood with the country’s security forces in the fight against terrorism. In a statement, he also reiterated the firm commitment to eradicating terrorism in all its forms from the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
In a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to security forces for thwarting the infiltration attempt.
“The nation takes pride in the skill and bravery of the security forces,” Naqvi said, vowing to “stand side by side” with them.
 






Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.</p><small>2025-10-30 09:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3012271710cb9ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952151/sc-constitutional-bench-refers-plea-against-mahrangs-detention-to-practice-and-procedure-committee' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench refers plea against Mahrang’s detention to Practice and Procedure Committee</strong></a><br><p>A five-member Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Thursday referred a plea against the detention of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Mahrang Baloch to the Practice and Procedure Committee, which forms benches and fixes cases under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
The plea, filed by Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi in June, urges the SC to set aside an April 15 order of the Balo­ch­istan High Court (BHC) that rej­ected a petition against Mahrang’s detention under the Main­tenance of Public Order— a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order initially for a period of 30 days. Mahrang is currently detained at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta on charges of attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting people to violence.
The plea filed by her sister was taken up by the CB today. The CB was headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprised Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi Shakeel Ahmad.
During the hearing, Nadia’s counsel Siddiqui argued that “this case should be fixed before a regular bench and not a constitutional bench”.
At this, Justice Mazhar said, “Since you have challenged the MPO, that makes this a case for the CB.”
Siddiqi responded by saying that he did not ask for “an interpretation of the law” and had only challenged the MPO order.
Subsequently, the court referred the case to the Practice and Procedure Committee.
Appeal
Mahrang, whose advocacy group has been working against enforced disappearances since 2018, has been in detention since March 22.
Nadia had initially filed a petition in the BHC against her sister’s detention. However, in its April 15 order, the BHC disposed of the application and directed the petitioner to approach the Balochistan Home Department.
Subsequently, Nadia had approached the apex court. The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state were named as res­pon­dents in her petition filed in the SC.
The plea contended that the April 15 BHC order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts.
The petition alleged that Mahrang’s repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
 
 

It stated that Mahrang’s father and brother, too, were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.
The appeal further said that in December 2023, the “Baloch Long March”, organised and led by the detainee and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force.
The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge.
The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO.
It recalled that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority.
The petition further contended that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case.
The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner, by issuing the MPO order, acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister.
BYC leaders’ detention
Mahrang and other BYC leaders, including Sibghatullah Baloch, Beebow Baloch, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, were arrested under the MPO in March and have remained in custody since, having been remanded multiple times.
They were initially taken into custody for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, their detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order for their detention.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-10-30 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301247574742954.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952155/indian-state-backed-refinery-halts-russian-oil' target='_blank'><strong>Indian state-backed refinery halts Russian oil</strong></a><br><p>Indian state-backed refiner HPCL-Mittal Energy has halted purchases of Russian crude after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two largest oil companies, the firm said.
Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil.
Trump has claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to cut his Russian oil imports as part of a prospective US trade deal — something New Delhi has not confirmed.
HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL), a joint venture between steel tycoon Lakshmi Niwas Mittal and state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), said it had “taken the decision to suspend further purchases of Russian crude”.
The statement, issued on Wednesday, said last week the decision came after “recent announcements of new restrictions on imports of crude oil from Russia” by the United States, European Union (EU) and United Kingdom.
“HMEL’s business activity is in-line with [the] Indian government and energy security policy”, the statement added.
Reliance Industries, the privately-owned main Indian buyer of Russian crude, said last week it was assessing the implications of Washington’s restrictions, as well as those imposed this week by the EU.
“We will comply with the EU’s guidelines on the import of refined products into Europe,” a spokesperson for the company said, and with any guidelines from the Indian side.
The EU’s new curbs include a complete ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2026.
Reliance said it was confident that its “time-tested, diversified crude sourcing strategy” would ensure stability in refinery operations for meeting the domestic and export requirements, including to Europe.
On Wednesday, an investigation by London’s Financial Times reported that HMEL had received several shipments of Russian crude transported via vessels later blacklisted under US and EU sanctions.
HMEL said it did not charter the vessels and had limited visibility over the transport chain. It said that the ship that delivered the crude to India “was not under” US sanctions at the time of delivery.
India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85pc of its oil needs.
Traditionally reliant on Middle Eastern producers, New Delhi started buying heavily discounted Russian crude in 2022, taking advantage of Western sanctions that limited Moscow’s export options.</p><small>2025-10-30 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3012424531709f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952152/teenage-australian-cricketer-dies-after-being-hit-by-ball-during-training' target='_blank'><strong>Teenage Australian cricketer dies after being hit by ball during training</strong></a><br><p>A promising 17-year-old Australian cricketer died on Thursday after being struck by a ball, with his family saying they were “utterly devastated”.
Ben Austin was in the nets with a helmet on before a Twenty20 game in Melbourne on Tuesday when he was hit in the neck while facing a ball-throwing device.
He was rushed to hospital in critical condition.
 






“We are utterly devastated by the passing of our beautiful Ben, who died earlier on Thursday morning,” his father Jace Austin said in a statement.
“This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers — going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.
“We would also like to support his teammate who was bowling in the nets.
This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well.”
Austin was an emerging bowler and batter, considered by his Ferntree Gully Cricket Club as a “star cricketer, great leader and an awesome young man”.
Deaths in cricket are rare.
 
 

The most recent high-profile one in Australia came in 2014 when Test star Phillip Hughes was killed when hit in the neck by a rising ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield game.
His death stunned Australia and the world cricket community, sparking an outpouring of grief and ushering in stronger protocols around concussion and better safety equipment.
Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins told broadcaster ABC there were similarities between the two tragedies.
“The ball hit him (Austin) in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,” Cummins said.
Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird said his heart “was broken” and lessons needed to be learned.
“Clearly there are things we have to learn from this,” Baird told reporters. “But right now we are concerned about the family and trying to support them in every way. “</p><small>2025-10-30 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3012140722d794c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952149/pakistan-win-silver-in-boys-volleyball-after-straight-set-defeat-to-iran-at-asian-youth-games' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan win silver in boys volleyball after straight-set defeat to Iran at Asian Youth Games</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s unbeaten streak at the Asian Youth Games came to an end on Wednesday night when Iran dominated the boys volleyball final in three straight sets to win gold, leaving the Green Shirts to take home a silver medal.
Pakistan put up a tough fight in all three sets but ultimately lost 25-21, 25-23, 25-23 to Iran.
The silver was Pakistan’s second medal at the ongoing games so far, with the boys Kabaddi team winning bronze last week.

The Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) said the team’s silver brought “immense pride and honour to the nation”.
“The team’s performance throughout the tournament was
exceptional — Pakistan did not lose a single match before the final, defeating teams like Mongolia, Bahrain, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and China with dominating performances,” the PVF said in a press release.
“The final match was a display of determination and courage, where the Pakistani players pushed hard in every set but were unfortunate to miss the gold medal by a close margin.
“Nevertheless, finishing undefeated until the final stands as a historic achievement for Pakistan volleyball at the youth level.”
Throughout the tournament, standout performances were delivered by Muhammad Yahya, Muhammad Anas, Muhammad Irfan, and Ajmal Junaid, PVF said.
The federation emphasised that the success was part of its “long-term development plan that started four years ago — from the U16 Asian Championship (Gold Medal) to the U18 Asian Championship, then the U19 World Championship, and now the Silver Medal at the 3rd Asian Youth Games 2025.”

Asif expressed these views during an interview with Al Arabiya English that was released late on Wednesday. His remarks are a continuation of the censure he has been directing toward Kabul in connection with terror incidents in Pakistan, recent border hostilities and the subsequent failure of talks with its Taliban rulers.
He was asked during his interview with Al Arabiya about the evidence he had to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
“When it comes to showing the evidence, or tabling the evidence, we will do that. We have the evidence,” Asif replied, highlighting that the Afghan foreign minister was visiting the Indian capital when border clashes began between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 


He went on to say that there was no doubt about Afghanistan having become an “Indian proxy”.
“And India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score [after] the last round we had around six or five months back, when they were squarely defeated. And they lost seven planes.
“The president of the United States has, on several occasions, mentioned — he even mentioned it yesterday — that seven beautiful planes were lost in the clash between India and Pakistan,” he added.
The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it had downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, and later raised the tally to seven.
US President Donald Trump has also mentioned the downing of seven jets during the conflict on multiple occasions, but has stopped short of elaborating on which side lost the jets.
When Asif again referred to the May episode in the context of hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the interviewer remarked that him saying India was trying to take revenge using another country was a very bold statement.
At that, Asif replied, “You want me to reiterate that statement? I will do that. I have no problem with that.” He continued that Kabul and New Delhi had a “relationship irrespective of the regimes in both countries”.
“There is a continuity to the relationship between the two countries, and it has always been to the detriment of Pakistan.”
Responding to a subsequent question, he also warned that in case of any violation on Pakistan’s eastern or western border — frontiers that the country shares with India and Afghanistan — Islamabad would respond effectively.
The defence minister further commented that Afghanistan had “chosen to become a stooge or proxy of India”.
Asked whether he saw a “broader or full-blown war” with Afghanistan on the horizon, the defence minister replied: “I won’t speculate about this, that there could be a full-blown war. But, there is a risk of [things] heating up, at least on the border. And obviously, if we have evidence of indulgence from across the border, we will retaliate. We will go inside and settle the score with them.”
The interviewer also asked him where Pakistan stood with regards to sending troops to become part of an international force in Gaza.
“We [have] already [said] on record that if need be we will be part of that force to maintain […] peace and tranquility and […] normalisation [of situation] in Gaza. Pakistan will always be willing to render its services in this regard,” replied Asif.
In response to a question about online “chatter” that Pakistan had tested a hypersonic missile over Quetta, the defence minister said it was just speculation.</p><small>2025-10-30 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301019359955960.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952144/trump-says-strikes-deal-with-chinas-xi-on-tariffs-rare-earth-exports' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says strikes deal with China’s Xi on tariffs, rare earth exports</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said he had struck a deal to reduce tariffs on China on Thursday in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit trade of fentanyl.
His remarks after the face-to-face talks with  China’s leader Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.
The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red carpet send off at the airport.
 






Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said the meeting with Xi yielded an extendable one-year deal on the supply of crucial rare earths.
“All the rare earths has been settled, and that’s for the world,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that the deal was for a year and would be re-negotiated annually.
He also described his meeting with Xi as a “great success” and said he would head to China in April for new talks.
“I’ll be going to China in April and he’ll be coming here sometime after that, whether it’s in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, DC,” Trump said.
“A lot of things we brought to finalisation” at Thursday’s talks in Busan, South Korea, added Trump, praising Xi as a “tremendous leader of a very powerful country”.
Chinese stocks climbed to a decade high and the yuan currency to a near one-year peak against the dollar as investors hoped for an easing of trade tensions that have upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence.
World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo have hit record highs in recent days.
Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates.
But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last.</p><small>2025-10-30 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300805556b6b650.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952137/china-plans-to-have-a-pakistan-astronaut-on-short-term-missions' target='_blank'><strong>China plans to have a Pakistan astronaut on short-term missions</strong></a><br><p>China has announced it will arrange for a Pakistan astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions, state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday.

It further reported that the arrangement for the astronaut was according to medium-term planning and cooperation progress of China’s space station mission. It added that the astronaut from Pakistan will train alongside Chinese astronauts.
 






China’s Global Times also reported that during the mission, the astronaut will not only participate in the crew’s routine work but will also conduct experiments on behalf of Pakistan.
 






In March, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and the CMSA had signed a cooperation agreement for sending Pakistan’s first manned mission to China’s space station.
At the time, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had stated the agreement was “another wonderful gesture” from the Chinese government to further deepen bilateral cooperation in the field of space.
In April, the premier had also Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology. He also stressed that Pakistan was “giving utmost importance to the space technology sector”, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.</p><small>2025-10-30 05:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30072607452ff60.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952096/punjab-hands-over-tlp-mosques-seminaries-to-moderate-clerics' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab hands over TLP mosques, seminaries to moderate clerics</strong></a><br><p>• CM Maryam orders release of ‘innocent’ supporters of proscribed outfit

The administration led by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had earlier announced giving the administrative control of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries run by the TLP in the province to the Auqaf department.
Besides, CM Maryam ordered the release of TLP prisoners, who were fount innocent during the investigations.
At least eight people, including a policeman, were killed and over 1,600 injured in clashes between police and TLP supporters in Muridke earlier this month.
 
 

The Punjab police had arrested over 6,000 TLP activists so far following the violence, which was sparked by the outfit’s attempt to hold an anti-Israel demonstration outside the US embassy in Islamabad.
On Wednesday, a meeting of the Ittehad Bainul Muslimeen Committee was held with CM Maryam Nawaz in the chair.
Religious leaders from all schools of thought expressed full support for the Punjab government’s stance against the TLP and endorsed its efforts for maintaining peace.
 






In the meeting it was decided that the administration of the TLP-run mosques and seminaries would be handed over to the Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahle Sunnat Pakistan led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
“Those who misuse religion for personal agendas are not serving the faith,” the CM noted.
“The mosques and seminaries are being handed over to Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman’s organisation for proper management,” she added.
Release of TLP supporters
The CM also ordered the immediate release of the TLP supporters, who were proven innocent, and instr­ucted officials to escort them home with “dignity”.
She dismissed the claim that 400 to 600 people were killed during the TLP protest in Muridke.
Referring to jailed former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, the Punjab CM said: “A person sitting in Adiala Jail tweets that 400 to 600 people died [in Muridke].”
She added that Mr Khan had been in jail for the last two years and still not stopped inciting sedition. “The lie of hundreds of people being killed was falsely spread. If it were true, where were the dead bodies?” she asked.
The CM further raised the question as to which hospitals provided medical treatment if thousands were injured.
“No videos of the injured and killed came to surface, but only those of raids and recoveries emerged,” she noted.
“When a police inspector was martyred, his funeral was held and everyone watched,” she continued, asking why were matters brought to such a tragic point that parents, wives, husbands and children were deprived of their loved ones.
The Punjab CM said everyone was surprised to see such a large number of weapons being recovered from TLP activists and supporters.
During police raids, she stated that modern weapons were recovered from TLP activists, including ones that even law enforcement agencies did not possess. “These arms were meant to be used against the state and the police.”
She denounced the harsh statements being made on social media about security personnel, adding that the agenda of those behind them was only to “defame religious and political parties”.
‘Miscreants creating divisions’
The CM observed that some people in religious groups were pious, guiding followers toward the truth. However, she asked: “who are those destroying property and taking innocent lives.”
She criticised the elements creating divisions among religious groups. She said certain miscreant groups were formed only to discredit and harm religious organisations.
“It is the state’s responsibility to protect the lives, property, and honour of citizens and to ensure daily life is not disrupted,” she added.
“The state was forced to act [against the TLP],” she said, continuing that while the world rejoiced over the Gaza ceasefire, some people in the country were calling for a march on Islamabad.
“Not once did these agitators [TLP] speak for Palestine. Instead, they incited violence against the police.”
She said using women as shields and hiding weapons in mosques was inhumane, referring to the TLP tactics.
The meeting was inf­o­rmed that all personnel deployed for the CM’s sec­urity were being screened following the crackdown against the TLP.
Besides, the security of the CM and some other members of her cabinet has been beefed up.
The CM announced a stipend of Rs25,000 per month for a prayer leader (imam) of each of the 65,000 mosques in the province.

• ‘N’ vows to support the motion, not PPP’s candidate
ISLAMABAD: While a joint no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.
Informed sources told Dawn that although only 14 signatures are required to submit a no-confidence motion, the number of signatories is much higher. Those who have signed include PML-N’s AJK chief Shah Ghulam Qadir, its parliamentary leader in AJK Legi­s­lative Assembly Raja Far­ooq Hai­der, and all six members of the forward bloc aligned with AJK Pr­e­sident Barrister Sultan Mehmood.
The PML-N has agreed to support the motion but, according to party sources, will not vote for the new prime minister from the PPP. The party’s ministers are expec­ted to resign after submission of the motion, and will sit on the opposition benches.
A day after a meeting at the Presidency in Islamabad decided that the PPP would form the government in AJK after unseating Anwarul Haq, 10 members of the forward bloc joined the PPP ranks, placing the party in a position to remove the AJK prime minister even without PML-N’s backing.
The development has raised the PPP’s strength from 17 to 27 members, matching the magic figure need­ed for a majority in the 53-member house.
Also, Muh­a­mmad Iqbal, a UK-based busi­nessman elected on a rese­rved seat for overseas Kashmiris, reportedly resigned.
With PML-N’s support, the total number of members ready to vote out Anwarul Haq rises to 36. A PPP source, however, claimed that the party already enjoyed the ‘open support’ of 37 members, with more in contact.
TV channels, citing party sources, reported that the PPP finalised Chaudhry Yasin, the president of PPP AJK, as its nominee for the office of prime minister, though he denied the media reports later in a post on X. He said the PPP leadership had not formally announced its nominee.
Sources said the formal announcement of the PPP nominee will be made after a meeting between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which could not take place on Wednesday.
In a related development, President Zardari chaired a meeting of senior party leaders, attended by PPP Chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Chaudhry Yaseen, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, and former AJK prime minister Sardar Yaqoob Khan.
The meeting focused on the political situation in Azad Kas­hmir, particularly the no-confidence motion against Anwa­rul Haq and the formation of a PPP government.
A meeting of PPP’s AJK parliamentary party will be held on Friday (tomorrow) at Zardari House. According to informed sources, the meeting will be chaired by PPP chairman, and the name of the next AJK PM will be announced afterwards.
