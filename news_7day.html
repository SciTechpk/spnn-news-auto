The announcement comes after California’s attorney general launched an investigation into Musk’s xAI — the developer of Grok — over the sexually explicit material and multiple countries either blocked access to the chatbot or launched their own probes.
X said it will “geoblock the ability” of all Grok and X users to create images of people in “bikinis, underwear, and similar attire” in those jurisdictions where such actions are deemed illegal.







“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” X’s safety team said in a statement.
“This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.”
In an “extra layer of protection”, image creation and the ability to edit photos via X’s Grok account were now only available to paid subscribers, the statement added.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU’s digital watchdog, earlier said it had taken note of “additional measures X is taking to ban Grok from generating sexualised images of women and children”.
“We will carefully assess these changes to make sure they effectively protect citizens in the EU,” European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said in a statement, which followed sharp criticism over the nonconsensual undressed images.
‘Shocking’
Global pressure had been building on xAI to rein in Grok after its so-called “Spicy Mode” feature allowed users to create sexualised deepfakes of women and children using simple text prompts such as “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes”.
“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said earlier Wednesday.
“We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material.”
Bonta said the California investigation would determine whether xAI violated state law after the explicit imagery was “used to harass people across the internet.”
California Governor Gavin Newsom said that xAI’s “vile” decision to allow sexually explicit deepfakes to proliferate prompted him to urge the attorney general to hold the company accountable.
Further adding pressure onto Musk’s company on Wednesday, a coalition of 28 civil society groups submitted open letters to the CEOs of Apple and Google, urging them to ban Grok and X from their app stores amid the surge in sexualised images.
Indonesia on Saturday became the first country to block access to Grok entirely, with neighbouring Malaysia following on Sunday.
India said on Sunday that X had removed thousands of posts and hundreds of user accounts in response to its complaints.
Britain’s Ofcom media regulator said on Monday it was opening a probe into whether X failed to comply with UK law over the sexual images.
And France’s commissioner for children Sarah El Hairy said on Tuesday she had referred Grok’s generated images to French prosecutors, the Arcom media regulator and the European Union.
Last week, an analysis of more than 20,000 Grok-generated images by Paris non-profit AI Forensics found that more than half depicted “individuals in minimal attire” — most of them women, and two per cent appearing to be minors.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/15111846956c523.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967090/trump-reiterates-desire-for-greenland-following-high-stakes-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Trump reiterates desire for Greenland following high-stakes meeting</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the United States needs Greenland and that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island, even as he said that “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish overseas territory.
The remarks, which came after a high-stakes meeting between US, Danish and Greenlandic officials, indicate that there are still fundamental, if not intractable, differences between how Washington, Copenhagen and Nuuk see the political future of the island.
“Greenland is very important for the national security, including of Denmark,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the problem is there’s not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there’s everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela,” he said.
After meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt said the US and Denmark would form a working group to discuss a broad array of concerns regarding the island that could meet in the coming weeks.
Greenland ‘not for sale’, Copenhagen and Nuuk say
But they also made clear that Washington had not budged on its position that it must acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that is strategically located and rich in minerals. Rasmussen and Motzfeldt described such an outcome as an unacceptable breach of sovereignty.
“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen told reporters outside the Danish embassy in Washington. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.”
Trump has not ruled out taking Greenland by force. Before the two-hour meeting, he argued on social media that Nato would become far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the US. “Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote.
In recent weeks, he has frequently repeated longstanding claims that acquiring Greenland is a national security imperative and that Denmark is not capable of warding off Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic region.
Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, that threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark, a member of the Nato alliance.
Ahead of the meeting, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in close cooperation with Nato allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defense.
Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked, footage showed. The Danish military will support the preparation of exercise activity, according to the nation’s Joint Arctic Command.
Germany, Sweden and Norway have also announced that they would send military personnel to the island.
The increased military presence would include a range of exercise activities throughout 2026, according to the Danish defense ministry.
Avoiding a Zelensky moment at the White House
In their remarks to reporters, Rasmussen and Motzfeldt called the meeting respectful and emphasised that Denmark shared US concerns about Arctic security. But they firmly rejected the idea of the island becoming American.
While Trump has at times portrayed the island as besieged by Russian and Chinese ships, Rasmussen rejected that characterisation, saying “it is not a true narrative that we have Chinese warships all around the place.” The meeting presented an opportunity for Copenhagen and Nuuk to de-escalate the crisis and find a diplomatic path to satisfy US demands for more control, analysts said.
Noa Redington, an analyst and former political adviser to previous Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said concerns were high in Denmark and Greenland that Motzfeldt and Rasmussen could be treated in the same way as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when he suffered a public humiliation in a meeting with Trump — and Vance — at the White House in February 2025.
“This is the most important meeting in modern Greenland’s history,” he told Reuters.
Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two Nato allies. But Denmark’s Rasmussen said Vance had also wanted to participate.
European diplomats had said the White House had for months brushed off Denmark’s attempts to engage on Greenland at a high level. Wednesday’s meeting was the first principal-level encounter between US and Danish officials on the issue.
Anxiety has been high in Greenland.
“I have been sleeping very, very badly, really,” said Liv Aurora Jensen, a craftswoman and designer in Nuuk, right before she watched the Motzfeldt and Rasmussen press conference on television.
“I was talking to my sister yesterday and I told her: ‘I’m trying not to get a panic attack.’”
‘We stand with the kingdom’ of Denmark, Greenland says
Greenlandic leaders appear to be shifting their approach to handling the diplomatic crisis. Until recently, they were stressing Greenland’s path to independence, but now their public statements put more emphasis on Greenland’s unity with Denmark.
“It’s not the time to gamble with our right to self-determination, when another country is talking about taking us over,” Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told Greenland daily Sermitsiaq in an interview published on Wednesday.
“That doesn’t mean that we don’t want something in the future. But here and now we are part of the kingdom and we stand with the kingdom,” he said.
Motzfeldt had a similar message.
“We choose the Greenland we know today as part of the Kingdom of Denmark,” she said in a statement released by the Danish ambassador to the US late on Tuesday.
Trump’s desire for Greenland contrasts with Americans’ opposition to annexation of the Arctic island, according to a new poll.
Just 17 per cent of Americans approved of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, and substantial majorities of Democrats and Republicans opposed using military force to annex the island, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
Some 47pc of respondents disapproved of US efforts to acquire Greenland, while 35pc said they were unsure, in the two-day poll which concluded on Tuesday.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/151056348f03fbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967089/pakistani-passport-ranking-improves-by-two-places-now-ranked-98th' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani passport ranking improves by two places, now ranked 98th</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistani passport’s ranking has improved on the Henley Index in 2026, rising from 103 in 2025 to 98 this year, according to figures released on Thursday.
According to the latest rankings, Pakistan’s travel document was placed 98th on the list, tied with Yemen.
It ranked higher than Iraq (99), Syria (100) and Afghanistan (101).
The ranking showed that Pakistan’s passport allows visa-free access to 31 countries, including e-visa and visa on arrival.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi took to X and hailed the development.
He termed it a “strong achievement” and vowed that the “momentum will continue”.







Singapore ranked the highest, with visa-free access to 192 countries, followed closely by Japan and South Korea with 188.
Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland tied for the third spot with visa-free access to 186 countries.
Last year in October, the Pakistani passport ranked the fourth worst for the fifth straight year, with a ranking of 103.
Pakistan’s passport has been declared the world’s fourth-worst since at least 2021 on the Henley index, which calculates countries’ “visa-free score” — the number of destinations travellers can access without a prior visa, or with a visa on arrival.
The travel document was ranked 100th in 2024 and 2023, 109th in 2022 — when it allowed entry into 32 countries without a prior visa — and 107th in 2021 with the same visa-free score.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/142135075f6aa7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944/us-announces-suspension-of-immigrant-visa-processing-for-pakistan-74-other-countries-from-jan-21' target='_blank'><strong>US announces suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, 74 other countries from Jan 21</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The US has announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.
The State Department said the freeze will remain in place until authorities can ensure that new immigrants will not draw on American taxpayer resources.







Officials described the measure as part of the administration’s “America First” approach.
“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” an official said.
State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement that his department “will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people“.
“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.
Among the countries affected by the freeze are Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, covering regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. All categories of US immigrant visas — including family, employment, and diversity visas — are impacted.
Impact on Pakistanis
The suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.
Public-charge rule
The visa freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials said the scope of this action is unprecedented.
No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1509010635c9537.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967052/trump-says-killings-in-iran-have-stopped-tehran-reopens-airspace-after-temporary-closure' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says killings in Iran have stopped; Tehran reopens airspace after temporary closure</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he had been told the killings of protesters in Iran had been halted, but added that he would “watch it and see” about threatened military action.
Trump had repeatedly talked in recent days about coming to the aid of the Iranian people over the crackdown on protests.
But in a surprise announcement at the White House, Trump said he had now received assurances from “very important sources on the other side” that Tehran had now stopped, and that executions would not go ahead.







“They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place - there were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won’t take place - and we’re going to find out,” Trump said.
He offered no details and noted that the United States had yet to verify the claims.
Asked by an AFP reporter in the Oval Office if US military action was now off the table, Trump replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later said there would be “no hanging today or tomorrow,” in an interview with US network Fox News.
“I can tell you, I’m confident that there is no plan for hanging,” Araghchi said, also accusing Israel of orchestrating violence.
‘Full control’
But Araghchi said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation.”
Iran also struck a defiant tone about responding to any US attack, as Washington appeared to draw down staff at a base in Qatar that Tehran targeted in a strike last year.
Iran targeted the Al Udeid base in June in retaliation for US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack.” Fears of possible US military action continued to rile the region.
The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed,” while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations.
Trump has threatened to intervene militarily in Iran several times since the protest movement that has shaken the country began in late December.
Iran’s judiciary chief vowed fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression.
In Tehran, authorities held a funeral for more than 100 security personnel and other “martyrs” killed in the unrest, which officials have branded “acts of terror.”
Iran reopens airspace
Iran reopened its airspace after a near-five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights.
Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 2215 GMT on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website.







The notice was removed shortly before 0300 GMT, according to tracking service Flightradar24, which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country.
At a similar time last week to the airspace closure there had been dozens of planes in the air over Iran, Flightradar24 said.
The United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the Middle East, a US official said on Wednesday, after a senior Iranian official said Tehran had warned neighbors it would hit American bases if Washington strikes.
Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic.
Indian airlines among those affected
India’s largest airline, IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure. Air
India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations.







A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data.
Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region.
The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries.

Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week.
“Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information.
“The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.”
A Ukraine International Airlines jet was downed by Iran’s military in 2020, killing all 176 passengers and crew.
Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until
Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight. Some flights could also be canceled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement.
Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week.
‘Unprecedented level of brutality’
G7 nations said Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued.
Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 156 hours.







Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined.
A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said.
Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God.” State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details.
India tells citizens to leave Iran
India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and arrested thousands of people.
India’s foreign ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 citizens in Iran.







“Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian Embassy in Tehran said, in a post on social media late Wednesday.
AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction
AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions.
US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests - created by both pro - and anti-government actors - that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms.
Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests.
One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views.
Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump.
One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.”
Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic.
The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos.
In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said.
“There’s a lot of news - but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez.
“Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.”
The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news.
AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis.
AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979.
One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.</p><small>2026-01-15 05:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/15094944fce7a76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967066/despite-scepticism-mayor-confident-to-dismantle-water-tanker-network' target='_blank'><strong>Despite scepticism, mayor confident to dismantle water tanker network</strong></a><br><p>• Wahab asks KWSC to draft citywide water plan before phasing out tanker services, shutting hydrants• Says goal is equitable water distribution, not politics• Utility sources say closure of hydrants would hit DHA the hardest• Claims decision, if implemented, won’t improve city’s supply
KARACHI: While Mayor Murtaza Wahab outlined his plan to eventually dismantle the decades‑old water‑tanker system, officials at the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) voiced scepticism, saying it would not be possible to entirely shut down hydrants and end tanker services given the existing water infrastructure.
Talking to the reporters on Wednesday after inaugurating the Jehangir Road rehabilitation project, the mayor, who is also the chairman of the KWSC board, said that water tankers and hydrants have been operating in Karachi for decades, largely filling gaps where the piped water supply does not reach.
However, he stressed that the system has created inequities, with benefits flowing to select groups while blame is unfairly placed on the city administration.
“There is water in the city, but the real issue is its unjust distribution,” the mayor said, adding that his administration has already “shut down” several illegal hydrants.
He said that the contracts of seven legal hydrants have expired, leaving the city with a choice: renew the contracts or permanently close the hydrants.
Mr Wahab said that he had proposed a third option — the gradual dismantling of the hydrant and tanker system — but emphasised that such a step could not be taken without a comprehensive alternative plan.
“If hydrants are closed, how will water reach areas that depend on tankers? I have asked officials of the KWSC to develop a practical and citywide water supply strategy. We want to end this system, but responsibly,” he said.
According to the mayor, once the KWSC finalises its proposal, it will be presented to the City Council for approval. Only after formal approval will tanker services be phased out, and work on this strategy is currently underway.
Rejecting political motives behind the move, he said that his party had no hidden agenda. “This hydrant system was inherited. The beneficiaries are someone else, but the accusations are directed at us,” he said.
He acknowledged that Karachi faces a genuine water shortage but reiterated that equitable distribution remains the administration’s key objective.
‘Hydrants closure may hit DHA hardest’
According to sources who spoke to Dawn, the mayor was told in a meeting with the water utility’s senior management that a decision had to be made on renewing the hydrant contracts, which had already expired about seven months earlier.
They said the mayor had instructed the KWSC to consider shutting down the city’s hydrants in order to achieve a fairer distribution of water.
The sources said that closing the hydrants would not improve the city’s water supply, as only 15-20 million gallons of water daily (MGD), or 3.5 per cent of the total 650 MGD, was delivered through tankers.
They said that the proposed closure of hydrants would hit Defence Housing Authority’s 5, 6, 7 and 8 phases the hardest, because these areas relied almost entirely on tanker deliveries to meet their daily water needs.
A DHA resident said that people in those phases already faced limited line supply and were forced to buy water from tankers, and the situation would worsen if hydrants were shut down.
Published in Dawn, January 15th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-15 04:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6968561d1176e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967024/end-of-stability' target='_blank'><strong>End of stability</strong></a><br><p>AROUND the same time last year, I wrote the economy has reached what I called “peak stability”. This was a stage where all the measures taken to stabilise the economy had delivered their results, and had now reached the end of their line. A few indicators had begun to show a little stress, but around the middle of the year, in June 2025 specifically, a large inflow of almost $5.25 billion suddenly shored up the reserves and allowed the government to end the fiscal year with their State Bank reserves almost $500 million above the target set in the IMF programme.
2025 saw a moderate trade deficit and surging remittances, which helped the current account balance significantly. Between January and November, the months for which data is available, the trade deficit came in around $30.5bn while remittances (including other transfers) came in at $38.8bn. Seems like a nice balance there, until you realise that something ate up $8bn out of the balance-of-payments because the overall surplus was just about $263m.
That something was interest payments on external debts. In 11 months of 2025, Pakistan paid $7.1bn in interest payments on its external debt. For almost a decade, from 2013 to 2022, this figure oscillated between $1.5bn to $4.0bn. Then it began to climb. Some of the increase was due to rising interest rates as the returns on 10-year US Treasury paper spiked from a Covid-era low of 1.44 per cent to 4.35pc in 2025. This was a sharp hike without doubt, and it weighed heavily on the balance-of-payments of all countries.
But in Pakistan’s case there was something more. In June of every year for the past few years, Pakistan has been borrowing heavily from private commercial lenders in the closing month of the fiscal year to shore up its reserves. In June 2023 and 2024, for example, they borrowed almost a billion dollars from commercial creditors. Then came June 2025 and this figure leapt to $3.4bn, nearly 65pc of the inflows of that month.

A stagnant economy cannot afford high prices, high taxes and high debt burdens for long.

The story is quite simple. Pakistan has balanced its external account by throttling its external trade, choking its economy and heavy borrowing, including private borrowing. Since 2023, for example, total private commercial borrowing by the country has been $7.5bn. It is not known what the maturity of these loans was, and therefore not possible to say how much has been retired and how much is still on the stock of total external debt now. But the scale of borrowing from private commercial lenders has increased massively in the past few years, just as the current account deficit has also diminished massively, if not disappeared altogether for many months at a stretch.
The stability in the economy cannot last much longer however. It has been earned via high taxes, a high energy price burden due to misplaced investments in the energy sector coupled with massive misgovernance. It has also been sustained through expensive borrowing, reflected at least in part by the rising burden of interest payments the economy is carrying. A stagnant economy cannot afford high prices, high taxes and high debt burdens for long.
In truth, we had hit peak stability a year ago. That was the moment to start transitioning out from stabilisation towards growth, on the back of some sort of reform agenda. But no reforms came. Nothing happened. The government was content to simply proclaim success on the back of stabilisation alone, thinking its job was done. All of 2025 was a grind, as a result, slogging ahead in a high-cost, high-tax and high-debt environment, with no end in sight.

 

All governments in the past have done what they are going to do in the first year or two of their tenure. Whether it was the signature reform of the federation through the 18th Amendment and the associated NFC Award in 2009 of the PPP government, or the CPEC investments and associated growth spurt of the PML-N government from 2013 to 2018, the work was largely done in the first two years, and in the latter case, took the another two years before the ribbons started being cut on the highways and power plants. The Musharraf regime spent two years stabilising the economy, and unfurled its reforms in 2002 via the telecom sector, the power reforms, and the privatisations.
But the present government has spent its first two years doing nothing discernible. And now they announce the return of Mr Ishaq Dar as the exports czar, as the man who will be tasked with bringing about an export surge from here forward. This ought to be easy for him. During his finance ministership, Pakistan’s exports plummeted. Maybe, if he does the opposite of whatever he did while in power we will have an export surge.
By now, announcements are coming with an increasing regularity, of a new committee or a new goal being set. But it is too little, too late. By now it has become clear that this government cannot punch its way out of this paper bag. They are stuck in a gruelling adjustment, weighing heavily on the citizenry and on owners of capital alike. They have juiced this lemon for all it is worth. From here on, some sort of a vision needs to kick in. Some way to unlock the growth potential of Pakistan that is tied down by layers and layers of mismanagement, bad pricing and bad legacy. But there is nothing.
The only way they can end this economic stalemate is with some sort of bilateral or other external injection of liquidity. It was the same way the Musharraf regime did it. Except they had 9/11 as the bonanza. We wait to see what these guys will get.

The challenge is paradoxical: protecting relations with the US without abandoning multilateralism and climate commitments. This dilemma will reshape Pakistan’s domestic and international climate architecture. What opportunities can emerge for Pakistan from this crisis? How can Pakistan benefit from a new redistribution of power and resources? Can it navigate this shift to diversify partnerships, secure climate finance and advance economic and strategic interests amid global realignment?
Global fallout: The US is the only nation to completely withdraw from international climate efforts. The UNFCCC is a bedrock treaty that underpins every climate negotiation, emissions commitment and dollar of climate finance that flows from the developed to the developing world. The decision extends to the IPCC that has provided the authoritative voice on climate science for decades. This will diminish the quality and comprehensiveness of future assessments, particularly in complex areas of importance like agricultural emissions and land-use change.
The withdrawal undermines the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities that has been the moral foundation of Pakistan’s climate negotiations since Rio in 1992. The US as the largest historical contributor to greenhouse gases bears a unique responsibility for the warming that threatens billions of lives and livelihoods. By walking away, Washington sends an unmistakable message: the world’s most powerful economy will prioritise short-term political expediency over planetary survival.
Europe has responded with a mixture of moral indignation and pragmatic determination, making it clear that European climate ambition will continue unabated. The European Green Deal, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and continental commitments to net-zero by 2050 proceed regardless of US participation. In effect, Europe is preparing to lead a climate coalition without its traditional transatlantic partner.

 

Perhaps the most significant geopolitical consequence is the vacuum created for China, which has already positioned itself as a champion of multilateralism and international cooperation. The US exit hands China an unprecedented opportunity to claim leadership on the defining challenge of the 21st century. Former climate envoy John Kerry rightly called Trump’s decision “a gift to China”.

America’s withdrawal from the UN climate treaty must be treated as an opportunity.

China dominates the supply chains for solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicle batteries. It leads in renewable energy (RE) deployment and clean technology innovation. By maintaining its commitment to the UNFCCC while Washington retreats, China can leverage green diplomacy, based on its experience with Pakistan, to strengthen ties with developing nations, present itself as a responsible global power, and capture the economic benefits of the estimated $23 trillion clean technology market.
This presents a delicate challenge for Pakistan that has carefully balanced its ties between Washington and Beijing. The US exit tilts that balance. If climate cooperation increasingly flows through Chinese channels through initiatives like Panda or Dim Sum Bonds, CPEC, and the BRI or bilateral agreements, Pakistan might be drawn further into Beijing’s orbit, with all the economic and strategic dependencies that it entails.
Pakistan’s moment: For Pakistan, these developments arrive at a moment of vulnerability. The catastrophic 2022 floods offered a glimpse of our climate future: one-third of the country underwater, 33 million people affected, economic losses exceeding $30bn. Our updated NDCs require an estimated $565bn by 2035, the vast majority of which must come from international sources. What, then, should Pakistan do in the face of the US exit? We must pursue a strategy grounded in diplomatic diversification, domestic mobilisation and regional cooperation.
First, we must diversify our climate partnerships. The EU and UK have recommitted to climate action and international cooperation, despite budgetary pressures. They should become our primary partners for technical assistance, technology transfer and climate finance. We should aggressively leverage our green taxonomy to attract European capital while advancing our own emissions reduction goals. The CBAM, rather than being feared as a trade barrier, should be seen as an incentive to accelerate our own decarbonisation.
Second, we must recognise that America’s exit makes China an even more critical partner. The CPEC already includes RE projects, but we should push for cutting-edge, greening investments. We should insist on offshore solar and wind parks, mass transit systems and hydroelectric projects that enhance our energy sovereignty while meeting our climate commitments. This requires difficult conversations with Beijing, but our leverage lies in framing climate action as economic modernisation rather than environmental virtue.
Third, we must accelerate domestic resource mobilisation, instead of waiting for international finance to materialise. Simultaneously, we should work towards aligning with China’s domestic emissions trading market as we develop our own local ecosystem for carbon trading. This will build institutional readiness and encourage cleaner industrial practices. Finally, we must expand our Panda Bond portfolio to reach $5bn by 2030 to support such projects as the Living Indus Initiative and climate-resilient agriculture.
Fourth, we should revitalise regional cooperation in South, Central and Southwest Asia through platforms like SCO. Regardless of US participation, we share common threats that demand common responses. Regional trading systems and resuming the Indus Waters Treaty can still proceed with Washington’s blessing.
Finally, we must recalibrate our diplomatic approach to the US itself. The Trump administration clearly favours bilateral deals over multilateral commitments and frames issues through the lens of national security. When engaging with Washington, we should present our climate needs as infrastructure, job creation and security projects that advance mutual interests, rather than as environmental obligations.
The longer view: The US exit from the UNFCCC won’t last forever. When the US rejoins, nations that maintained commitments will be remembered. Pakistan should be among them. This crisis creates an opportunity: international climate architecture including UNFCCC, IPCC and the Paris Agreement will survive, but power and resources will be redistributed. Pakistan must navigate this shift strategically, not passively, to advance development and avoid becoming collateral damage.

It is organised and increasingly led by those in power. A new report by the India Hate Lab documents 1,318 hate speech events across the country in 2025 — an average of four a day — with Muslims the main targets in almost every case. This is a pattern that reflects how politics in India is now being done.
What stands out is where this hate is happening. Nearly nine out of 10 incidents took place in states ruled by the BJP or its allies. In opposition-run states, such incidents fell sharply. That contrast matters. Law and order is the state’s responsibility, and the data shows clearly that where the BJP governs, hate is allowed to flourish.
This is also no longer limited to election seasons. Even in a non-election year, hate speech remained high and widespread. That signals a shift. Communal hostility is no longer just a tool to mobilise voters; it has become part of everyday governance. Rallies, religious processions and public meetings are repeatedly used to paint Muslims as outsiders, threats or enemies within.
The language used is not just offensive, it is dangerous. Nearly a quarter of recorded speeches openly called for violence. Others urged social and economic boycotts, demanded the demolition of mosques and churches, or encouraged people to arm themselves. Muslims were regularly described as “parasites”, “termites” or “invaders”. Such words strip people of their humanity and make violence easier to justify.
Senior BJP leaders feature prominently in this ecosystem. Chief ministers, cabinet ministers and party figures were among the most frequent speakers. They promoted conspiracy theories such as “love jihad”, “population jihad” and “vote jihad” — claims that Muslims are secretly plotting to dominate India through marriage, childbirth or elections. These ideas have no basis in fact, but they serve a political purpose: to turn fear into votes and prejudice into policy.

 

The BJP often claims it cannot control what fringe groups say. But the report shows a clear division of labour. Allied organisations mobilise on the ground, while political leaders set the tone from above. Police action is rare. Social media platforms amplify the speeches. The result is impunity.
The cost of this strategy is high. It weakens India’s constitutional promise of equality, deepens social divisions and puts millions of Muslims at risk of discrimination and violence. It also damages India’s standing as a democracy governed by the rule of law at a time when global scrutiny is intensifying.
Hate does not spread by accident. It spreads when those in power find it useful and refuse to stop it. India’s leadership must decide whether it will pull the country back from this path, or continue to lead it down a darker one.

In a statement issued on the sidelines of the revised tariff notification for all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, the Power Division said the debt surcharge, currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit, would be withdrawn in five to six years once the circular debt is cleared.
“Once the circular debt is cleared, the debt surcharge currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit will be withdrawn, providing further tariff relief to consumers,” it said, adding that the government had introduced a surplus power package under which industrial and agricultural consumers can avail additional electricity at a concessional rate of Rs22.98 per unit for three years, helping reduce average industrial tariffs.

 

In addition, a circular debt settlement plan has been launched to eliminate outstanding debt within five to six years.
The Power Division also conceded that the growth of off-grid solar consumption had distorted subsidy requirements, with the number of protected consumers doubling from 11 million in 2021 to 22m recently due to hybrid consumption patterns.

 

“This has not only strained fiscal resources but has also increased the cross-subsidy burden on industrial and commercial users, undermining their competitiveness,” it said, adding that commercial, bulk supply and high-consuming domestic consumers were currently bearing a significantly higher cross-subsidy burden than the industrial sector.
Responding to criticism over higher energy costs — also highlighted by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as one of the key reasons for the exit of foreign firms from Pakistan and export challenges — the Power Division said it would explore additional options to further reduce the cross-subsidy burden on industrial consumers, including subsidy reforms and debt refinancing, in addition to the tariff reduction measures already in place.
It added that data showed the industrial cross-subsidy burden had been reduced from Rs225 billion (Rs8.9 per unit) in March 2024, when the current government assumed office, to Rs102bn (Rs4.02 per unit) at present, reflecting a reduction of Rs123bn.
“Industrial electricity tariffs (including taxes) have declined from Rs62.99 per unit in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per unit in December 2025, while the national average tariff has fallen from Rs53.04 to Rs42.27 per unit,” it said.
Moreover, to reduce electricity tariffs, the government has terminated inefficient power plants and successfully renegotiated contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). These measures have resulted in tariff reductions, and further negotiations with the remaining IPPs are underway, the Power Division said.

The committee was informed by the Railways ministry officials that despite the growing strain on rolling stock, corrective measures including improved maintenance, modernisation plans, and enhanced funding are underway to stabilise operations and improve passenger services.
The officials also shared with the committee plans for the overhauling and modernisation of diesel-electric locomotives.
The committee meeting, chaired by Ramesh Lal, was further briefed on the availability of passenger coaches in Pakistan Railways, and it was clarified that the shortage of coaches faced since June 2025 has largely been overcome through improved efficiency of workshops and the restoration of under-repair coaches.
The availability of coaches has increased from 1,016 in September 2025 to 1,105, against a requirement of 1,100, and the requirement is expected to reach 1,150 by June 2026.
The committee was further inf­o­rmed that Pakistan Railways ach­ieved record passenger earnings of Rs48.832 billion during fiscal year 2024-25, while earnings during the first six months of the current fiscal year have shown a 7 per cent increase compared to the correspo­nding period of the previous year.

 

Secretary of Pakistan Railways briefed the committee in detail on issues relating to the restructuring and outsourcing of various sections of PR with a view to improving efficiency and enhancing passenger services. Following the briefing, the committee constituted a sub-committee to further examine the matters.
Regarding service quality, the committee reviewed the issue of non-functional air-conditioning units in passenger coaches. It was stated that failures have increased due to overaged AC units; however, the replacement process is underway.

Presided over by Chief Justice of Pak­istan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the commission met at the conference room of the Sup­reme Court to make recommendations regarding the confirmation of additional judges as permanent judges of the PHC.
By a majority of its total membership, the JCP recommended the confirmations after due consideration of the relevant data forms, antecedents and evaluation of material placed before it.
The judges confirmed as permanent judges are Justice Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Justice Abdul Fayaz, Justice Salahuddin, Justice Sadiq Ali, Justice Syed Mudasser Ameer and Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah.

Extends tenure of four others; PTI representatives skip com­mission’s sitting

Similarly, by a majority of its total membership, the commission recommended the extension of tenure for six months of four additional judges of the PHC, namely Justice Farah Jamshed, Justice Inamullah Khan, Justice Sabitullah Khan and Justice Aurangzeb.
PTI representatives Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar as well as Law Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Aftab Alam Afridi did not attend.

 

On Thursday, the JCP will meet again to consider the confirmation of 13 additional judges of the Lahore High Court.
In a separate development, the CJP, who is also president of the advisory board of the Al-Mizan Foundation, presided over a high-level meeting to review the ongoing projects spearheaded by the foundation.
The meeting was attended by retired Justice Mushir Alam, former judge of the Supreme Court and chairman of the administration committee; retired Justice Muhammad Tariq Abbasi, vice chairman; and the secretary of the Al-Mizan Foundation.
The meeting focused on reviewing the foundation’s welfare mandate and its alignment with sound policy, governance and financial sustainability. Established in 1995 as a welfare institution, the Al-Mizan Foundation provides structured support to serving and retired judges of the district judiciary, court staff and their families, including dependants of deceased beneficiaries.
The foundation operates under a defined governance framework to ensure transparency, accountability and long-term institutional viability.
The forum deliberated on key policy and administrative issues affecting the effective delivery of welfare services, including asset management, contractual and legal arrangements, financial compliance and taxation matters.
Particular emphasis was placed on adopting sustainable policy solutions to optimise the use of institutional assets and to ensure that welfare initiatives —especially in the sectors of health, education and employee facilitation —remain resilient, efficient and responsive to emerging needs.
The CJP also expressed appreciation for the forward-looking leadership of retired Justice Mushir Alam, noting that his stewardship has significantly strengthened the governance, policy coherence and institutional integrity of the Al-Mizan Foundation.
He also commended the contribution of Zia-ur-Rehman, the incumbent secretary of the foundation, for his professional diligence, administrative competence and reform-oriented approach.
It was acknowledged that the clarity of vision and disciplined oversight during this phase of institutional consolidation have contributed meaningfully to enhancing the foundation’s credibility, responsiveness and long-term sustainability as a welfare institution.

These include a 17 per cent unconditional and 33pc conditional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 30pc increase in electric vehicle adoption, and a shift to 60pc renewable energy.
Meeting these ambitious goals will depend heavily on mobilising green-aligned investments, making frameworks like the Pakistan Green Taxonomy and robust ESG disclosure practices essential for guiding capital toward sustainable projects.
This was revealed during a session on Pakistan Green Taxonomy (PGT) and ESG Disclosure Guidelines hosted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI), which was attended by top business executives and industry stakeholders on Wednesday.







According to OICCI’s press release, the session was held in the backdrop of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan’s issuance of the revised ESG Disclosure Guidelines for listed companies, formally aligning them with the Pakistan Green Taxonomy. The move is aimed at strengthening sustainability reporting, enhancing transparency, and supporting Pakistan’s climate transition and environmental commitments.

 

The Pakistan Green Taxonomy (PGT), launched by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in 2024, provides a clear classification system for identifying activities that actively contribute to environmental objectives, including climate change mitigation, sustainable water use, ecosystem protection, pollution prevention, circular economy, and land management. Complementing this, the ESG Disclosure Guidelines, which will transition to mandatory reporting between 2029 and 2031, establish standardised metrics for financial and non-financial sustainability reporting.
On green financing, Farrukh Rehman, an expert on climate regulatory compliance, emphasised that integrating PGT into ESG reporting is a roadmap for businesses to align their operations with national climate objectives. Transparent and structured reporting will attract sustainable investment and enable companies to contribute to Pakistan’s environmental and social goals.

“We will make an appropriate order and may seek assistance from the parties if needed,” observed Justice Aamer Farooq, adding that the major issue before the court was how to proceed further in the matter.
Justice Farooq was heading a two-judge FCC bench hearing the case, which was initially taken up suo motu by the Supreme Court.
Earlier, the case was heard by a five-member SC bench in December 2022.

Court cites ‘slow investigation’, MLA agreement with Kenya

However, following the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amend­ment, it was first transferred to a six-member constitutional bench of the SC and later to the FCC after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Arshad Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple sedition cases were registered against him in different cities.
On Wednesday, the FCC expressed its intention to close the proceedings after Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman informed the court that a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) agreement had been signed between the governments of Pakistan and Kenya in September last year. He added that a request had already been sent for the Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT), constituted specifically for the probe, to visit the crime scene.
The AAG recalled that the SJIT’s report had already been submitted to the court, adding that the Kenyan government had initially refused to assist in the investigation.
The law officer explained that the government would dispatch the SJIT once the Kenyan government allowed it to inspect the crime scene for further investigation. He added that the team would probe the journalist’s murder based on the evidence provided by the Kenyan government.
‘Slow investigation’
Justice Farooq observed that there was a difference in the manner in which the government and the court approa­ched the matter, adding that the investigation process had been slow, though blame could not be placed on anyone.
He questioned what further action the court could take now that a legal assistance agreement between the two countries had been signed.
During the hearing, the murder of MQM leader Imran Farooq in the United Kingdom was also referenced, with Justice Farooq recalling how Pakistani and British police jointly investigated that case.
However, the AAG argued that the nature of the Imran Farooq murder case was quite different than that of Arshad Sharif, adding that two suspects had already been nominated in the journalist’s murder.
He further stated that both the nominated suspects were still in Kenya and Pakistan had issued red notices through Interpol for their arrest and repatriation for further investigation.
The law officer said investigation on part of the investigating agencies in Pakistan has been completed for now. He also recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had spoken with Kenyan President William Ruto on the phone about Arshad Sharif’s murder case in 2022.

LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday announced a complete ban on the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles across its departments, allowing only electric or hybrid modes of transportation in a move aimed at cutting emissions and accelerating the transition to clean transport.
The announcement was made by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman in a statement issued here. However, it added that vehicles deployed for field duties had been exempted from the restriction.
Mr Zaman noted that a comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) policy for the province was expected to be announced shortly. He said the policy would reflect the provincial government’s commitment to environmental protection and the promotion of green energy.
New petrol pumps
As part of the same initiative, the approval of no-objection certificates (NOCs) for new petrol pumps has been made conditional on the installation of electric vehicle charging units.
“No new petrol pump will be allowed to operate without EV charging facilities,” the chief secretary stated.

 

The statement added that NOCs had already been issued through the e-Biz Portal for 170 new petrol pumps across 31 cities in Punjab, all of which are required to install EV charging units.
These include 29 petrol pumps in Faisalabad, 14 in Lahore, 10 in Bahawalpur, nine each in Khanewal and Bahawalnagar, eight each in Rawalpindi and Jhang, and seven each in Toba Tek Singh, Mianwali, Kasur, and Chiniot.
However, the chief secretary did not respond to a question on whether the policy decision banning the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles was taken at any formal forum or was merely a statement.
S&GAD yet to notify move
It is learnt that no notification regarding the policy change banning the procurement of petrol and diesel vehicles and promoting the procurement of electric and hybrid vehicles has been issued by the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD).
When contacted, an S&GAD Transport Wing official told Dawn that the department had neither received any formal approval for the change in policy nor issued any notification in this regard.
Answering a question, the official said discussions on shifting to electric and hybrid vehicles had been underway in the department for quite some time, in line with environmental and climate change initiatives.
The official added that the policy would take effect once formal approval is granted by the chief minister following the required process. The S&GAD would then issue a formal notification to launch the new policy.
‘Combating smog’
During a meeting with American business leaders, Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the provincial government would now purchase only hybrid and electric vehicles as part of its smog mitigation measures.
“The government has decided to replace petrol vehicles in the official fleet with hybrid and electric vehicles,” she said.
According to a statement, the US delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s vision and policy initiatives. It added that the American business leaders commended CM Maryam’s governance reforms and environmental policies.
They were informed about the provincial government’s policies and enforcement measures related to the shift towards electric and hybrid transport, brick kiln mechanisation, e-transport, official use of super seeders, and other practical reforms.
“For the first time, sectoral-level anti-smog measures have been introduced in Lahore, with the Planning and Development Department designated as the central policy hub,” Ms Aurangzeb said, adding that the city’s air quality had shown marked improvement.
To combat smog, she said, 41 monitoring stations had been installed, with the number set to reach 100 by June. The minister added that surveillance was being carried out through drones and thermal cameras. “A Smog War Room is monitoring industries, brick kilns, and vehicles around the clock, while Punjab Climate Watch is fully operational.”
The minister told the delegation that to control crop burning, 5,000 super seeders had been provided to farmers at a 60 per cent subsidy.
“A Nasa [US space agency] report has confirmed a 60 per cent reduction in smog levels.,” she said.
She further said 1,000 e-buses had been added across Punjab, with a decision taken to procure an additional 10,000 this year.

The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) held a meeting in the federal capital under the chairmanship of Mahm­ood Khan Achakzai, wherein the participants expressed concerns over the deteriorating regional situation. The participants urged the government to call an urgent joint session of parliament to form a national policy through collective wisdom.

 

They claimed that the international order was changing: the Israeli aggr­ession in Palestine and the conduct of the United States in Latin America have severely undermined international law.







They observed that imperial and colonial powers were tightening their grip around Pakistan’s neighbouring country, Iran, while the western media was creating an environment that could be used as a pretext to undermine Iran’s sovereignty.
The TTAP proposed that in view of the seriousness of the potential crisis and its possible impact on the region, the government should also convene a meeting of neighbouring countries to develop a joint and coordinated strategy to address these challenges.
PTI slams action against Adiala protesters
Meanwhile, the PTI denounced the use of force by the Rawalpindi police to disperse its sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesday night. The police, in a midnight operation, had used force to disperse the participants.
In a statement, the PTI said these actions constituted a grave assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and fundamental human rights, and reflected a systematic campaign of political victimisation designed to silence dissent. The party vowed that such conduct was unacceptable in any democratic society and would be vigorously challenged at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum.
The party claimed that family members of Imran Khan and party workers were present outside the jail to exercise their constitutional and legal right to meet their incarcerated leader, but the police suppressed this activity using force, intimidation and harassment.
“Peaceful party leaders and workers, along with Imran Khan’s sisters, were subjected to baton charges, manhandling and abuse. As a result of this inhumane operation, 11 male party workers were detained at the Rawat police station, while three women—Zulekha, Dr Asma and Sanaiya Safeer—remained in the custody of Rawalpindi Police,” it claimed. Similarly, the PTI stated that Advocate Raja Yasir, Adil, and Tanveer were also arrested.
Furthermore, the party stated that the Raw­alpindi police established checkpoints near Bahria Town, where citizens returning from Adiala were subjected to searches, with mobile phones snatched, women’s vehicles seized, and the windows of several cars smashed. The PTI alleged that the citizens were coerced into paying money to recover their mobile phones and vehicles from the police, while those who refused to pay bribes had their vehicles confiscated.

WASHINGTON: Tensions flared across the Middle East on Wednesday as the US began withdrawing personnel from crucial bases in the region, while Tehran warned that it would retaliate against American bases in the Gulf, if Washington initiated an attack.
The catalyst for the showdown is the violent protests within Iran. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters, declaring in a Tuesday interview that “help is on the way” and vowing “very strong action” if executions of demonstrators continue.

 

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in a press conference late on Wednesday night he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests were subsiding and that he believed there was currently no plan for large-scale executions.
The New York Times also reported that the Pentagon is considering a broader array of strike options than previously disclosed, potentially targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities and ballistic missile sites.
European officials also cautioned that an American strike could be imminent. “All the signals are that a US attack is imminent, but that is also how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes. Unpredictability is part of the strategy,” a Western military official said.
Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official said regional countries — including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — had been informed that American bases within their borders will be targeted if the US strikes Iran.
Direct contact between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff have also been suspended, the official added.
As of Wednesday, Britain was also withdrawing some personnel from an air base in Qatar, according to British media reports, though the defence ministry in London offered no immediate comment.

 

A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was pulling some personnel from bases in the region as a precautionary measure given the heightened friction.
Qatar confirmed that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the largest US military hub in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions.”
Facing the threat of regional crossfire, Saudi Arabia moved to insulate itself. Two sources close to the kingdom’s government said Riyadh explicitly informed Iran that it would not permit its territory to be used for offensive operations.
In light of the threats, the US Embassy in Saudi Arabia issued a directive urging staff and citizens to “exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region.”

Personalised registration marks are vehicle number plates bearing a personalised number that automobile owners can retain even after selling their vehicles.
The KP Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control Department had earlier issued an advertisement in newspapers, seeking potential bidders interested in purchasing the choice number plates.
Minister for Excise and Taxation Syed Fakhar Jahan told Dawn today that the “Imran Khan-804” and “Imran Khan-1” were among the choice numbers being put for auction as “many people showed interest in it”.
The number 804 is associated with incarcerated PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan as it is the same number that has been assigned to him in jail.
Jahan said that the bidding for the personalised numbers would take place in Nishtar Hall in Peshawar, on January 27, and the PRMs to be put for auction would have a base price of Rs1 million.
The minister said that bidders could also suggest personalised numbers, including other politicians’ names, and authorities were open to such proposals. However, the authorities had not received any suggestions in this regard so far.
Jahan said that the KP cabinet had approved the PRM scheme.</p><small>2026-01-14 19:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141521252a56273.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966922/pakistan-signs-mou-with-donald-trump-linked-world-liberty-finance' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs MoU with Donald Trump-linked World Liberty Finance</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan said on Wednesday it had signed an agreement with a firm connected to World Liberty Financial, the main crypto business of US President Donald Trump’s family, to explore using World Liberty’s stablecoin for cross-border payments.
The Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said in a statement that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with SC Financial Technologies, a little-known company it described as an “affiliated entity” of World Liberty, would enable “dialogue and technical understanding around emerging digital payment architectures”.







The announcement represents one of the first publicly announced tie-ups between World Liberty, a crypto-based finance platform launched in September 2024, and a sovereign state. It also comes amid a warming of ties between Pakistan and the United States.

 

Under the agreement, SC Financial Technologies will work with Pakistan’s central bank to integrate its USD1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments structure, allowing the token to operate alongside Pakistan’s own digital currency infrastructure, a source involved in the deal said.
World Liberty CEO visits Pakistan
The announcement of the memorandum came during a visit to Pakistan by Zach Witkoff, son of US special envoy Steve Witkoff and co-founder and chief executive of World Liberty.
Zach Witkoff is also CEO of SC Financial Technologies. The company, registered in Delaware, co-owns with World Liberty the USD1 stablecoin brand, according to documentation on the stablecoin’s reserves from July 2025.

Witkoff met with “senior Pakistani stakeholders” to discuss how digital payment infrastructure, cross-border settlement and foreign exchange processes, the statement said.
“Our focus is to stay ahead of the curve by engaging with credible global players, understanding new financial models, and ensuring that innovation, where explored, is aligned with regulation, stability, and national interest,” said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Separately, the federal government said in a post on X that a delegation of World Liberty Financial called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who shared his vision for Digital Pakistan, particularly the importance of digital payments and financial innovation for connectivity, transparency and growth.







He also appreciated the rising global interest in Pakistan’s digital financial markets.
Stablecoins, digital tokens typically pegged to the dollar, have ballooned in value in recent years. Under Trump, the United States has introduced federal rules widely seen as beneficial to the sector, and countries across the world are beginning to examine the potential role of stablecoins in payments and financial systems.

 

World Liberty fuelled a sharp increase in income for the Trump family business, known as the Trump Organisation, including from foreign entities, in the first half of last year, Reuters reported in October.
Last May, MGX, a state-controlled Abu Dhabi investment company, used the World Liberty stablecoin to buy a $2 billion equity stake in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.
Pakistan has been exploring digital currency projects as it seeks to reduce cash usage and improve cross-border payments such as remittances, a key source of foreign exchange.
Its central bank governor said in July it was preparing to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets.
Witkoff calls on Field Marshal Munir
In a statement later today, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that a delegation led by Witkoff called on Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
According to the ISPR, their meeting reflected the growing interest of foreign private investors in Pakistan’s economy and signalled rising global confidence in the potential of financial technology in the country, alongside aims to strengthen financial inclusion and cross-border digital finance.
“Mr Witkoff highlighted the immense economic potential Pakistan holds and lauded the efforts of Pakistan’s leadership in embracing futuristic technologies to realise the full possibilities of its economic prowess,” the statement read.
The ISPR said that Field Marshal Munir emphasised Pakistan’s commitment to economic stability, investor confidence and enabling a conducive environment for responsible private sector participation in national development.

The president had arrived in Bahrain’s capital on Tuesday on a four-day state visit.
A post on the Presidency’s X account said Zardari was accorded a guard of honour upon his arrival at the royal residence, Al-Qudaibiya Palace, where the meeting was held.
“Talks covered trade and investment, defence [cooperation], support for the Pakistani community, and regional and global issues,” the post said.







A later statement issued by the Presidency said President Zardari and Bahrain’s king held comprehensive discussions aimed at “further strengthening the close and fraternal relationship” between the two countries.
“The talks reflected a shared resolve to deepen cooperation and give practical momentum to bilateral engagement,” it said.
The statement noted that First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla and Balochistan Agriculture Minister Mir Ali Hassan Zehri also accompanied the president.
The statement added that King Hamad conferred the Order of Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa First Class, Bahrain’s highest award, on President Zardari in recognition of “his services and contribution to strengthening Pakistan–Bahrain relations”.
It said that during a one-on-one meeting, the two leaders reviewed the overall state of Pakistan–Bahrain relations and “expressed satisfaction over their positive trajectory”.
President Zardari conveyed appreciation for the warmth and extraordinary hospitality extended to him and his delegation and acknowledged the king’s enduring goodwill towards Pakistan, the statement said.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to broadening cooperation across political, economic, defence and cultural fields and reiterated the invitation for the king to undertake an official visit to Pakistan, it added.
Later, during an extended meeting, the two sides discussed “concrete ways to enhance trade and investment cooperation”.
“The president emphasised Pakistan’s desire to translate strong political relations into increased trade and deeper investment linkages. He invited Bahraini investors to explore opportunities in Pakistan’s priority sectors, including agriculture and food security, information technology and digital services, healthcare, tourism and infrastructure, and highlighted the facilitative role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council in supporting foreign investors,” the statement said.
President Zardari underlined that Pakistan viewed Bahrain as an “important economic partner and expressed confidence that closer collaboration could unlock mutually beneficial opportunities”. He noted Pakistan’s economic potential, connectivity and skilled workforce and encouraged joint ventures that contribute to sustainable growth and shared prosperity, the statement added.
“The president also highlighted the long-standing defence and security cooperation between the two countries, describing it as a pillar of the bilateral relationship. He noted the close institutional linkages between the armed forces of Pakistan and Bahrain and reaffirmed Pakistan’s desire to further strengthening this partnership,” the statement added.
While exchanging views on regional and international developments, President Zardari observed that the international community was passing through a difficult period marked by uncertainty and rapid change, it said.
“He stressed that nations must stand together to face the challenges of an emerging global order, noting that instability affecting one could have wider consequences for others. He underlined unity, perseverance, wisdom and restraint as essential virtues in the period ahead, and said that through collective resolve, countries could not only endure but also prosper,” it added.
President Zardari also paid tribute to the Pakistani community in Bahrain, describing them as a vital bridge between the two nations. He thanked the Bahraini leadership for the respect, opportunities and support extended to more than 116,000 Pakistanis living and working in the kingdom, and appreciated their positive contribution to Bahrain’s development and to people-to-people ties, the statement said.
He also acknowledged the establishment of the King Hamad University for Nursing and Allied Medical Sciences in Islamabad as a gracious gift from the king, regarding it as a “lasting symbol of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bahrain”.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to peace, stability and multilateralism and underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in addressing regional challenges. Both sides agreed on the need for coordinated efforts at international forums, including the United Nations, particularly on issues of shared concern to the Muslim Ummah,” it said.
Speaking at the banquet hosted in honour of President Zardari, King Hamad described Pakistan and Bahrain as brotherly countries bound by historic relations rooted in mutual respect, Islamic brotherhood and shared interests, the statement said.
“The king termed the president’s visit a significant milestone in further strengthening bilateral ties and reaffirmed Bahrain’s commitment to expanding cooperation with Pakistan across political, economic, commercial and developmental fields,” it said.
“He appreciated Pakistan’s consistent support for Bahrain, lauded the positive contribution of the Pakistani community to the kingdom’s development, and acknowledged Pakistan’s role in supporting the causes of the Arab and Islamic nations, as well as its efforts to promote regional and international peace and stability,” it added.
According to the Foreign Office, President Zardari will also meet with Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who serves as the prime minister as well, during his trip.
“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” the FO said earlier this week.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Bahrain’s interior minister also visited Pakistan in September, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-14 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14223816db42177.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966947/us-says-phase-two-of-gaza-plan-beginning-with-goal-of-hamas-demilitarisation' target='_blank'><strong>US says ‘phase two’ of Gaza plan beginning with goal of Hamas demilitarisation</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s envoy said on Wednesday that a ceasefire plan for Gaza was now entering its second phase with the goal of disarming Hamas, despite several Israeli strikes in the Palestinian territory during the truce that became effective in October last year.
“We are announcing the launch of phase two of the president’s 20-Point plan to End the Gaza conflict, moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction,” envoy Steve Witkoff wrote on X.







The second phase will also include the setup of a 15-person Palestinian technocratic committee to administer postwar Gaza. Its formation was announced earlier on Wednesday by Egypt, a close US ally and mediator.
Phase two “begins the full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorised personnel”.
“The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage. Failure to do so will bring serious consequences,” Witkoff said.</p><small>2026-01-14 18:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/142221463c63827.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966945/denmark-greenland-in-crunch-white-house-talks-as-trump-ups-pressure' target='_blank'><strong>Denmark, Greenland in crunch White House talks as Trump ups pressure</strong></a><br><p>Denmark and Greenland’s top diplomats held high-stakes talks at the White House on Wednesday, with US President Donald Trump warning it was “vital” for the United States to take control of the Arctic island.
Shortly before the meeting with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Denmark announced it was immediately boosting its military presence in strategic Greenland.
Footage from CNN showed Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt arriving at the White House campus, while AFP journalists saw Rubio and Vance heading into the talks.
Trump’s escalating threats over Greenland — a vast and sparsely populated autonomous territory belonging to Nato ally Denmark — have deeply shaken transatlantic relations.
The 79-year-old Republican insisted ahead of the talks that Nato should support the US effort to take control of Greenland, saying it was crucial for his planned Golden Dome air and missile defence system.
“Nato becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote on his Truth Social network.



“IF WE DON’T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!” added Trump.
Vance, who slammed Denmark as a “bad ally” during a visit to Greenland last year, is known for a hard edge, which was on display when he publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last February.
“If the US continues with, ‘We have to have Greenland at all costs,’ it could be a very short meeting,” said Penny Naas, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington think tank.
Trump has derided recent Danish efforts to increase security for Greenland as amounting to “two dogsleds”. Denmark says it has invested almost $14 billion in Arctic security.
Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen sought to further ease US concerns on Thursday, telling AFP his country was boosting its military presence in Greenland and was in talks with Nato allies.
The Danish defence ministry then announced that it would do so “from today,” hosting a military exercise and sending in “aircraft, vessels and soldiers”. Swedish officers were joining the exercise at Denmark’s request, Stockholm said.
‘Big problem’
Denmark’s Rasmussen said ahead of the meeting that he was hoping to “clear up certain misunderstandings”. But it remains to be seen if there is a chance of de-escalating the situation.
Greenland’s leader said on Tuesday that the island prefers to remain part of Denmark, prompting Trump to say “that’s going to be a big problem for him.” Shortly after the White House talks, a senior delegation from the US Congress — mostly Democrats, but with one Republican — will visit Copenhagen to offer solidarity.
Trump has appeared emboldened on Greenland — and on what he views as the US backyard as a whole — since ordering a deadly January 3 attack in Venezuela that removed President Nicolas Maduro.
The White House has said that military action against Greenland remains on the table. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an attack on a Nato ally would end the alliance that has been the bedrock of Western security since World War II.
It is a founding member of Nato, and its military joined the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the latter to much criticism.
An agreement with Denmark currently allows the United States to station as many soldiers as it wants on Greenland. It also has a “space base” at Pituffik in northern Greenland.
Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, meanwhile, said ahead of the Washington talks that “Greenland does not want to be part of the United States.” But Trump has been insistent that he wants to acquire Greenland wholesale, repeatedly insisting on what he calls the threat of a takeover by Russia or China.
The two rival powers have both stepped up activity in the Arctic, where ice is melting due to climate change, but neither claims Greenland, which is home to 57,000 people.</p><small>2026-01-14 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141920540ee30ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966941/local-govt-polls-ecp-takes-serious-view-of-punjab-govts-failure-to-meet-deadlines' target='_blank'><strong>Local govt polls: ECP ‘takes serious view’ of Punjab govt’s failure to meet deadlines</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday said it had “taken a serious view” of the Punjab government’s failure to meet deadlines for tasks that would pave the way for the long-delayed local government (LG) polls in the province and decided to fix the matter for hearing.
Sources told Dawn that according to the promised timelines, the Punjab Local Government (Delimitation of Union Councils) Rules, were to be finalised by October 27 last year. The input for the finalisation of the rules had been provided by the ECP but a notification by the relevant authorities was still awaited, the sources said.
They said November 15, 2025 was the deadline for the provision of the Punjab Local Government (Conduct of Elections) Rules. The draft for the rules had been shared with the ECP by the provincial government and the former had given its input as well, but a notification was yet to be issued, the sources said.
Likewise, the notification of Demarcation and Classification, showing the limits of local areas, was due by December 22, 2025 but was still awaited.
A deadline of December 31, 2025 for the notification of the number of union councils that are to be delimited within local areas has also been missed.
Moreover, authenticated maps showing census charges, census circles and census blocks as per the 2023 census were to be provided by January 10, but are still awaited.
The sources said a letter expressing the ECP’s disappointment had been sent to Punjab’s Local Government and Community Development Department secretary.
The letter, seen by Dawn, says the matter was discussed at the highest level and the ECP took a “serious view” of the Punjab government’s failure to meet the set deadlines and fulfil the assurances given to the ECP.
“Further, the matter has been left open-ended without any timelines being given for completion of all above metioned activities,” the letter read.
The letter said, “Keeping in view the situation and the fact that the conduct of the local government election in the province has already been considerably delayed, the commission has decided to fix the matter for hearing and take appropriate steps with regards to the conduct of the local government election in the province.”
“Due date for the hearing shall be conveyed soon.”
LG elections in Punjab have been delayed for long and the matter goes back to 2019. In April that year, the then PTI-led Punjab government had dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
This meant that LG elections in Punjab were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time.
Last year, on Oct 8, the ECP ordered LG polls in December 2025 and asked Punjab to immediately start the delimitation exercise and complete the same within two months.
This order, however, was reversed in a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Oct 21, 2025 in light of the promulgation of a new LG law, the Punjab Local Government Act 2025 (PLGA), after a request by the Punjab government.
The ECP withdrew its original delimitation schedule for the elections issued under the 2022 local government law, giving the provincial government four weeks to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules.
On October 31, 2025 the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year as the commission would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year.
The prerequisites were scheduled to be in place by January 10, following which the ECP was to begin the delimitation process.</p><small>2026-01-14 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14170449bef3774.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966935/oppression-injustice-pti-condemns-latest-police-action-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>‘Oppression, injustice’: PTI condemns latest police action outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the police action against its protesters outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi yesterday, terming it “oppression” and “injustice”.
The condemnation comes a day after the police dispersed a sit-in staged by PTI supporters and party founder Imran Khan’s sisters at Factory Naka near the prison after the authorities did not allow them to meet the incarcerated former prime minister.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the party said it condemned the “government’s oppression, use of force through police, and unlawful actions” outside Adiala in the “strongest terms”.







Detailing the alleged arrests, the PTI said 11 men were detained at the Rawat police station and three women — Zuleikha, Dr Asma and Sanaya Safeer — were taken into custody by the Rawalpindi police.
“Similarly, Advocate Raja Yasir, [MNA] Shahid Khattak’s brother Adil, and Tanveer have also been arrested,” it added.
In a list of demands, the PTI sought the immediate release of “all arrested men and women”. It added that “immediate criminal proceedings should be initiated against the responsible police officials”.
The PTI asserted that Imran’s family and party workers were exercising their constitutional and legal right when they had gathered outside the prison to meet him.
“[However], the government used force, violence and harassment to crush this peaceful and lawful activity,” it added.
The party alleged that the baton charge, pushing and mistreatment continued late into the night “without any regard for women and children”.
Furthermore, it alleged that the Rawalpindi police set up a checkpoint at Bahria Town on the route returning from Adiala, where they “snatched mobile phones from citizens, forcibly seized women’s vehicles and smashed the windshields of several cars”.
According to the PTI, the mobile phones and vehicles were returned after “taking money” from the citizens, while those who “refused to pay bribes” had their vehicles impounded.
The PTI claimed that “several citizens’ vehicles remained illegally impounded” at the Bahria Town checkpoint, with no first information report (FIR) registered so far.
It demanded the return of all vehicles and mobile phones allegedly seized, and called for judicial inquiries into the “open extortion, vandalism and violations of human rights”.
“This fascist conduct by the Rawalpindi police has been continuing in the same manner for the past many weeks,” the party lamented.
“This is not merely political victimisation, but organised government hooliganism, looting and violation of law by the Maryam-led government,” it said, referring to the Punjab chief minister.
It insisted that the aim of such actions was to “deprive Imran Khan and his family of their constitutional right to meetings and spreading fear among the public”.
In the end, the PTI also demanded that Imran’s family members and lawyers be allowed to meet him without any obstruction.
The PTI, in their statement, assured the public that the voice would be raised against this “oppression, injustice and government-backed strong-arm tactics at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum”.
“This country is not the personal fiefdom of any police officer or authoritarian government, but a trust of the people, and those who plunder this trust will be held accountable,” the party said.
PTI begins street mobilisation in AJK
Separately, the PTI also announced that its Azad Kashmir president and former prime minister of the region, Sardar Abdul Qayyum, has launched a street movement from his constituency of Sehnsa.







In December last year, the PTI announced it was launching a fresh countrywide street movement under Imran’s directives.
The party initiated the movement from Lahore, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s visit. On Monday, he concluded his four-day visit to Sindh for the same purpose, announcing that his next stop will be areas in KP.
The street mobilisation is aimed at garnering momentum in the lead-up to the opposition’s planned February 8 protests, which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.</p><small>2026-01-14 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/142017439d233e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966927/several-countries-actively-engaged-in-talks-with-pakistan-for-its-fighter-jets-confirms-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Several countries ‘actively’ engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets, confirms PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed on Wednesday that several countries were “actively” engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets.
In recent weeks, reports had surfaced of Pakistan being in talks with several friendly countries for a deal on the JF-17, a light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan.
Addressing a federal cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz recalled Pakistan’s victory in a war last year — ostensibly a reference to the four-day military conflict with India in May 2025 — and said the demand for Pakistan’s fighter jets had increased since then.
“There are several countries that are actively engaged in talks with Pakistan on this, and this will boost our defence production and benefit our economy,” the premier added.
Earlier, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj also told BBC Urdu that Pakistan is engaged in discussions with “multiple” countries for the sale of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets.
“These negotiations are taking place and they take some time. Many countries have shown interest in these aircraft,” the minister was quoted as saying in an interview with BBC Urdu, published on Tuesday.
“I cannot take the name of any country. Neither can I tell on what level our negotiations are with any country,” he told the British broadcaster.



“When these jets are exported, then the world will know which countries have bought them,” the report quoted him as saying.
He stressed that such matters were a country’s “jealously guarded secrets”.
Harraj further said, “Firstly, we must ensure that we only sell [JF-17s] to those who are our friendly countries. So they are not used against us.”
He added that China is on board whenever Pakistan signs such a deal with any country.
The defence production minister highlighted that the jets were battle-tested during the four-day conflict with India last year: “The entire world’s air forces saw these jets’ performance during that time and praised it.”
The minister termed the price of the jet “an important” aspect, detailing that while the average value of such planes around the world was $250-350 million, the JF-17 Thunder was cheaper.

 

Asked about the exact value, he told BBC Urdu, “Its value is around $40-50m; this depends on the jet’s features, and the price can also be higher than this.”
When enquired about whether China also received a share from the sale, Harraj was quoted as saying, “A lot of matters are discussed on the table. China is definitely included in them; it should be and it is their right.”
‘Production capacity a secret’
On a question about Pakistan’s production capacity, especially considering the interest of several countries, the minister told BBC Urdu, “This is a question related to our national defence. These are our secrets, let them remain secrets.”
He stressed that producing such “state-of-the-art” jets was a time-consuming task.
According to the minister, “some portion of the jet is readied in Pakistan, and some portion is readied in China”.
Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at China’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), told BBC Urdu that “technology” involved in the jet was likely controlled by China. Therefore, any sale pact would be a joint agreement, with Beijing being a “senior partner”.
“China might even increase Pakistan’s defence production, but all this will be in Beijing’s control,” the expert was quoted as saying.
Earlier this month, the air chiefs of Pakistan and Bangladesh held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17s.
Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also visited Iraq this week, where he met with the air chief, who expressed a “keen interest” in the fighter aircraft.
Recently, Reuters, citing two Pakistani sources, reported that Islamabad and Riyadh were in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 deal.
Indonesia’s Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin also visited Pakistan last week, holding meetings with the army chief and ACM Sindhu. The military’s media wing said that the minister expressed Jakarta’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad.
Defence cooperation with KSA, Turkiye
According to BBC Urdu, Harraj refrained from disclosing details about the Pak-Saudi defence pact signed in September 2025.

 

“This is a defence agreement between the field marshal, the prime minister and the Saudi government. I cannot tell any more than this,” he explained.
Last week, Bloomberg reported that Turkiye was seeking to join the pact.
“From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.”</p><small>2026-01-14 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141826461ad1b6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966939/some-powers-want-sindhs-rights-and-resources-transferred-to-islamabad-alleges-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>‘Some powers’ want Sindh’s rights and resources transferred to Islamabad, alleges Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>HYDERABAD: PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday alleged, without naming anyone, that “some powers” wanted to rob Sindh of its rights and transfer its resources to Islamabad on the pretext of claims that the provincial government had performed poorly.
He made this statement while speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the first phase of Tharparkar Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology in Tharparkar.
“Efforts are made, a campaign is run to assassinate the character of not just Tharparkar but your entire province as part of a conspiracy and for a particular objective. Some forces want to rob your province of its rights and resources and have them transferred back to Islamabad on the pretext that the Sindh government has not done anything,” he alleged.
He added, “I believe that the answer to this false narrative is Tharparkar. You can see how Tharparkar was before 2008, before the 18th Amendment, and how it is in 2026. Yes, there are problems, but the Tharparkar of 2026 is before you all [to see].”
Bilawal further stated that the people of Thar had “always supported the PPP in every election”, terming this trend an expression their love for the party and late prime ministers, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto.
The PPP, he continued, reciprocated this fondness by “always striving to develop Tharparkar”.
“Tharparkar’s progress is essential for Pakistan’s progress, just the way the progress of all four provinces is essential for the entire Pakistan”, he said.
Bilawal further stated that coal was an asset for the people of Tharparkar, adding that Tharparkar had as much coal as Saudi Arabia had oil. But unfortunately, the government “does not have the power to utilise these resources, and whenever Benazir Bhutto tried to do so, her efforts were sabotaged as part of a conspiracy”, he said.
He said it was the misfortune of the entire country that the economic development that should have been witnessed in the province in 1993 kept eluding it until 2008.
“But the people witnessed that just one project led to an economic revolution in Tharparkar,” Bilawal said. “The economic benefits of the electricity produced here are seen in Faisalabad as well.”
In this connection, he further said that the “very first megawatt [of the electricity produced in Tharparkar] was transferred to the national grid for use by industrial centres. This is how strong federal governments work”.
The PPP chairperson said economic development in Tharparkar also triggered a “social revolution”.
“This area didn’t have basic health units, dispensaries and hospitals, but now, with the government’s investment, we have laid a health network in Tharparkar. While coming to Thar, I saw the Thar Foundation, which receives a share from the profit generated from coal to ensure that social work continues and to run a hospital.”
About the Tharparkar Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology, he recalled that the Nadirshah Edulji Dinshaw University of Engineering & Technology initiated the project in 2019.
“The chief minister has promised that by the time the current [provincial] government completes its term, this campus will be running as a university,” Bilawal said. “The same way, we will keep working in Sindh. We think about the interests of the people of Sindh and will keep executing projects.”
He claimed the number of universities in Sindh had doubled since 2008, further stating: “We would like to compete with other provinces because Sindh has excelled in [the] health and education sectors.”</p><small>2026-01-14 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14172425011f93a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966932/geo-economic-confrontation-emerges-as-top-risk-for-2026-world-economic-forum' target='_blank'><strong>Geo-economic confrontation emerges as top risk for 2026: World Economic Forum</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The World Economic Forum (WEF) finds geo-economic confrontation as the top risk for 2026, followed by interstate conflict, extreme weather, societal polarisation, and misinformation and disinformation, its report said on Wednesday.
The Global Risks Report 2026, a premier source of original global risks data for Switzerland-based WEF, warned that the multilateral system is under pressure.
“Declining trust, diminishing transparency and respect for the rule of law, along with heightened protectionism, are threatening longstanding international relations, trade and investment and increasing the propensity for conflict,” it read.
Geo-economic confrontation topped the near-term rankings, with 18 per cent of respondents viewing it as the risk most likely to trigger a global crisis in 2026. It was also ranked first for severity over the next two years, up eight positions from last year.
State-based armed conflict followed in second position for 2026, dropping to fifth position in the two-year timeframe.

In a world of rising rivalries and prolonged conflicts, confrontation threatened supply chains and broader global economic stability as well as the cooperative capacity required to address economic shocks.
When it comes to the geopolitical outlook, 68pc of respondents expected a “multipolar or fragmented order” — in which “middle and great powers contest, set and enforce regional rules and norms” — over the next decade, up four points from last year, the report said.
Economic risks showed the largest collective increase in the two-year outlook.
Economic downturn and inflation risks both surged eight positions, to 11th and 21st respectively, while “asset bubble burst” rose by seven ranks to 18th position.
“Over the next two years, mounting debt sustainability concerns coupled with potential economic bubbles – in a context of rising geoeconomic confrontation – could herald a new phase of volatility.”
Misinfo, disinfo 2nd-highest short-term risk
Misinformation and disinformation ranked second on the two-year outlook, while cyber insecurity ranked sixth.
“Adverse outcomes of artificial intelligence” (AI) showed the starkest trajectory, climbing from 30th in the two-year horizon to fifth in the 10-year horizon, reflecting anxiety about implications for labour markets, societies and security.
Societal polarisation ranked fourth in 2026 and third by 2028, while inequality is in seventh position in the two- and 10-year outlooks.

Inequality was also selected by respondents as the most interconnected global risk for a second year running.
Economic downturn was the second-most interconnected issue that underlined concerns about cost-of-living pressures and “K-shaped economies” — in which there is a growing disparity between the rich and the poor — becoming entrenched.
With short-term concerns overtaking long-term objectives, environmental risks declined in ranking in the two-year outlook.
Extreme weather dropped from second to fourth, pollution from sixth to ninth, while critical change to Earth systems and biodiversity loss fell seven and five positions respectively.
All environmental risks declined in severity score, representing an absolute shift, not just a relative one.
Misinformation and disinformation were of particular concern in the online world.

 

The integrity of online news and broader information was increasingly under threat as distinguishing between authentic and synthetic content, whether video, audio, or written, was becoming progressively more difficult.
While citizens had traditionally relied on government institutions, academia and the media to obtain and process information, widespread use of social media was reshaping the ways in which information was accessed and interpreted.
“Recent elections in the United States, Ireland, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Japan, India and Argentina have all had to contend with such fabricated content on social media, depicting fictional events or discrediting political candidates, blurring the line between fact and fiction,” the report stated.
Extreme weather top risk in next 10 years
Yet, over the 10-year period, they remained the most severe — the top three being extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and critical change to Earth systems.
Three-quarters of respondents expected a turbulent or stormy environmental outlook, the most negative of any category.

The outlook from leaders and experts showed deep concern.
Half of those surveyed anticipated a “turbulent or stormy outlook” over the next two years, up 14pc points from last year. A further 40pc expected the two-year outlook to be “unsettled” at the very least, while 9pc expected “stability” and 1pc predicted “calm”.
Predicting the outlook for the next 10 years, 57pc expected a turbulent or stormy world, 32pc expected things to be unsettled, 10pc predicted stability and 1pc anticipated calm.
“The Global Risks Report offers an early warning system as the age of competition compounds global risks – from geoeconomic confrontation to unchecked technology to rising debt – and changes our collective capacity to address them. But none of these risks are a foregone conclusion,” said WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi.
“The challenges highlighted in the report underscore both the scale of the potential perils we face and our shared responsibility to shape what comes next.”
The report analysed risks across three timeframes: immediate (2026); short-to-medium term (the next two years); and long term (the next 10 years). In the near term, armed conflict, the weaponisation of economic tools and societal fragmentation are colliding.
As these immediate risks intensify, longer-term challenges from technological acceleration to environmental decline are also creating knock-on effects.
‘New competitive order taking shape’
“A new competitive order is taking shape as major powers seek to secure their spheres of interest,” said WEF President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Borge Brende.
“This shifting landscape, where cooperation looks markedly different than it did yesterday, reflects a pragmatic reality: collaborative approaches and the spirit of dialogue remain essential.”
Rising societal and political polarisation is intensifying pressures on democratic systems, as extremist social, cultural and political movements challenge institutional resilience and public trust.
The growing prevalence of “streets versus elites” narratives reflected deepening disillusionment with traditional governance structures, leaving many citizens feeling excluded from political decision-making processes and increasingly skeptical that policy-making can deliver tangible improvements to livelihoods.
Across the world, there were deep divisions between those who were trying to preserve one value system and the institutions built around it, and others who held opposing views. Groups that had not benefited from the prevailing political, societal and economic orders were playing a more pivotal political role.
Last year’s Global Risk Report revealed an increasingly fractured global landscape, where escalating geopolitical, environmental, societal and technological challenges threaten stability and progress.</p><small>2026-01-14 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141645453ff59f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966931/danish-badminton-player-withdraws-from-india-open-citing-extreme-pollution-in-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>Danish badminton player withdraws from India Open citing ‘extreme pollution’ in Delhi</strong></a><br><p>Danish badminton player and world number three Anders Antonsen has announced his withdrawal from the India Open due to “extreme pollution” in New Delhi.
“Many is [sic] curious as to why I have pulled out of the India Open for the third consecutive year,” the 28-year-old said on his Instagram stories early on Wednesday morning.



“Due to the extreme pollution in Delhi at the moment, I don‘t think it’s a place to host a badminton tournament.
“Crossing my fingers that it will be better in the summer when the World Championships will take place in Delhi,” Antonsen, who was seeded sixth in the tournament, added.
He added that the Badminton World Federation had “once again” fined him $5,000 as a result of his withdrawal from the tournament.
In another Instagram story, Antonsen posted a screenshot of air quality monitor IQAir, which showed Delhi’s AQI at 348, falling in the “hazardous” category, at 3:30am local time.



Delhi and its neighbouring districts are prone to a thick smog every winter as cold, heavy air traps construction dust, vehicle emissions and smoke from agricultural fires, leaving many of its residents struggling with respiratory illnesses.
In the past, authorities have closed schools, halted construction work and placed restrictions on private vehicles to tackle the problem.
Following Antonsen’s decision, the number of shuttlers who have withdrawn from the ongoing India Open, which carries a prize pot of $950,000, has increased to four. Antonsen is joined by compatriot and 2025 champion Viktor Axelsen, Li Shi Feng of China, and Arnaud Merkle of France.</p><small>2026-01-14 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14141130c72b667.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966923/karachi-mayor-says-water-hydrant-system-to-be-abolished-soon-kswc-to-develop-alternative-strategy' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor says water hydrant system to be ‘abolished’ soon, KSWC to develop alternative strategy</strong></a><br><p>Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday announced that the city administration would soon end the supply of water through hydrants, saying he had directed the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) to develop an alternative water distribution strategy.
Karachi faces an acute water shortage as the metropolis requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD), but gets only 650MGD. Many parts of the city are supplied via water tankers from hydrants.
Speaking to the media after the inauguration of the Jehangir Road Rehabilitation project, Mayor Wahab outlined plans to “abolish” the hydrant system and directed KWSC officials to develop a strategy for fair distribution of water across the metropolis.
“The contract period for each hydrant is two years, and that period for the city’s seven hydrants has expired,” the mayor said, adding that when deciding if the contracts should be renewed, he recommended that the hydrants should be closed instead.
“There should be fair distribution of water in the city,” he said.
He further said that KSWC officials were currently working on a proposal for developing an alternate system.
“When they complete the proposal, I will present it to the City Council,“ he said.
“Once the City Council gives approval, we will stop tanker services.”
The mayor maintained that the hydrant system had been inherited, and “the beneficiary is someone else”.
“There is a shortage of water, but it should be distributed fairly,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-14 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14145403291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966929/journalist-aslam-shah-granted-bail-in-defamation-case' target='_blank'><strong>Journalist Aslam Shah granted bail in defamation case</strong></a><br><p>Journalist Aslam Shah was granted bail on Wednesday, a week after his arrest on the charges of “defamation through social media” under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
In a hearing held today on his bail application, Judicial Magistrate (South) granted Shah bail and directed him to submit surety bonds of Rs30,000.
A large number of journalists were present at the hearing, while the lawyer representing the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Shiraz Rajper, appeared as well.
On January 7, the NCCIA arrested Shah on charges of “defamation through social media”.
Shah had moved an application through his counsel, Nasir Ahmed, before the Judicial Magistrate (South), seeking post-arrest bail in the case.
On January 12, the magistrate took up the bail plea, but an NCCIA official appeared and informed the court that the investigating officer was on leave and that the case file was not available with the prosecution. He requested that the matter be adjourned to Jan 14.
In the application, counsel Ahmed submitted that the case against Shah had been registered with malafide intent, alleging that he had been implicated solely to “take revenge” and to save the complainant.
He argued that the applicant had 30 years of experience in journalism and had worked with recognised print and wire media organisations.
The counsel further submitted that Shah was protected under Section 7 of the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021.
The case was registered on December 29, 2025, on the complaint of Tabish Raza Husnain, said to be an official of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), under Sections 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person) and Section 24 (cyberstalking) of Peca.
In the FIR, the complainant had alleged that Shah was doing “defamation propaganda” against him and his senior, Colonel Anjum, on social media groups.
He also alleged that he had used abusive language, which caused him significant distress and damage to his reputation.
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting showed its concern over registration of cases against journalists under the controversial Peca and called for urgent action to address growing concerns of media persons regarding FIRs and arrests of journalists.</p><small>2026-01-14 11:47</small></div><hr>
