<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23131658217cbfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975194/opposition-leaders-hold-sit-in-outside-supreme-court-demand-immediate-scheduling-of-imrans-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition leaders hold sit-in outside Supreme Court, demand immediate scheduling of Imran’s cases</strong></a><br><p>Members of the opposition protested outside the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday to demand that the cases of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was convicted in another case regarding state gifts recently.
His health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Senate Opposition leader Allama Nasir Abbas and PTI leader Salman Akram Raja participated in the protest, as well as other members of the assembly, including Amir Dogar, Shafiullah Jan, Muhammad Hussain and Shahid Khattak.
The protest participants also demanded that “a complete medical examination be conducted through his personal doctors”, according to a post by the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on X.
A video shared by the TTAP showed the parliamentarians sitting on the lawn outside the SC and talking amongst themselves.







Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the SC’s intervention earlier this month led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting outrage and protests from the opposition against his treatment.
The TTAP had held a sit-in at the Parliament House the previous week for the fulfillment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination, eventually calling it off after five days in deference to the holy month of Ramazan.
Meanwhile, PPP leader Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday said that Imran Khan’s release was “in his own hands” as it depended on his party’s “attitude”.</p><small>2026-02-23 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23135500ce00d78.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975195/ecp-to-hear-plea-against-victory-of-ppps-ali-hassan-zehri-from-hub-in-feb-8-elections' target='_blank'><strong>ECP to hear plea against victory of PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri from Hub in Feb 8 elections</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is set to hear a unique case on Tuesday (February 23), involving an increase of 10,000 in the number of polled votes and over 13,000 in the number of rejected votes for a Balochistan Assembly seat following a controversial recount.
The recount at 39 polling stations of PB-21 (Hub) took place two months after the Feb 8, 2024 general elections. The recount had declared PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri the winner, even though the original count had not even declared him the runner-up.
The original winner, Balochistan Awami Party’s (BAP) Muhammad Saleh Bhootani, who had secured more than double the votes obtained by Zehri, was pushed down to the third spot. After the recount, the percentage of polled votes had also changed from 55.15 per cent to 58.48pc.
It is worth mentioning that the significant change in the electoral figures was linked to a saga involving the arrest of five individuals from the strong room where the electoral record had been stored.
They were allegedly found with three plastic bags containing fake ballot papers and were attempting to tamper with ballot papers on Feb 11, 2024, hours after the ECP ordered a recount at 39 polling stations for the first time.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of rejected votes exactly matched the decrease in the votes originally secured by BAP’s Bhootani.
The votes secured by Bhootani were reduced from 30,910 to 17,403, translating into a difference of 13,507. The number of rejected votes increased from 3,648 to 17,155, also a rise of 13,507.
Meanwhile, the number of polled votes jumped from 76,976 to 87,483, showing an increase of 10,507 votes. Of these, 9,854 were secured by Zehri originally, taking his total from 14,120 to 23,974.
A further 441 votes were added to the tally of Rajab Ali, the initial runner-up, keeping his position unchanged, while the remaining 212 votes were distributed among other candidates, except Bhootani.
Zehri was notified as the winner from PB-21 on Dec 19, 2024. The ECP initially ordered a recount on Feb 11, 2024, but the process was marred by violence, arrests, and allegations of fake ballots. After multiple rounds of litigation, the Supreme Court on Nov 20, 2024, annulled all proceedings and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh.
Despite this, the electoral watchdog on Dec 16, 2024, in a split 3-2 decision, upheld the recount and notified Zehri as the winner, prompting Bhootani to approach the Balochistan High Court and later the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
Earlier this month, the FCC suspended Zehri’s notification and directed the ECP to re-examine the pending requests for a recount.
In its judgment, the FCC observed: “Recounting is always allowed on the basis of some material establishing illegality and irregularity in the count, and the powers to recount should be exercised sparingly after satisfaction, on the basis of material or evidence, that there has been any inclusion or exclusion of ballot papers in the count.
“The sanctity of the ballot is sacrosanct and, therefore, should not be permitted to be violated on frivolous, vague or indefinite allegations not supported by adequate statements of detailed material facts. It should only be allowed to do full justice between the parties, without a roving inquiry aimed at fishing for material to declare the election void,” it said.
It should be mentioned that last week, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail removed Zehri from the Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial cabinet with immediate effect. Zehri had earlier submitted his resignation to the chief minister.</p><small>2026-02-23 10:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231349386d961f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975192/another-meltdown-at-psx-as-kse-100-loses-over-5400-points' target='_blank'><strong>Another meltdown at PSX as KSE-100 loses over 5,400 points</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark index KSE-100 began another week on a low note, losing more than 5,400 points during intraday trade on Monday.
The KSE-100 index declined 5,478.63 points, or 3.16 per cent, to stand at 167,691.08 points from the previous close of 173,169.71 points.
The index reached its intraday high of 174,336.85 points at 9:38am — higher than its previous close — but then plunged to an intraday low of 166,886.63 points at around 1:24pm, before regaining some ground to 167,691 points by market close.
The top active stocks were led by K-Electric Limited, falling 4.61pc to Rs7.66 with 36,062,769 shares traded; followed by Worldcall Telecom Limited, falling 4.35pc to Rs1.32 with a volume of 33,673,161; and Bank of Punjab, falling 8.63pc to Rs30.19 with a volume of 26,673,106.
The top advancing stocks were led by Itanz Technologies Limited, rising 10.01pc to Rs13.96, followed by Kohinoor Industries Limited, rising 10.00pc to Rs50.60, and S.S. Oil Mills Limited, rising 10.00pc to Rs563.62.
The top decliners were Trust Securities & Brokerage Limited (R), down 17.31pc to Rs0.43; First Capital Securities Corporation, down 15.74pc to Rs4.39, and LSE Capital Limited (Right), down 14.91pc to Rs0.97.



Monday’s bloodbath marks at least the third major meltdown at the PSX in the past two weeks, with KSE-100 previously losing 5,149.80 points on February 16 and 6,683 points — the steepest single-day decline in history — on February 19.
Last week, the PSX endured a difficult week as geopolitical strains between the United States and Iran, compounded by domestic political noise, triggered a significant sell-off, pushing the KSE-100 index below the 174,000-point level.
Analysts have been cautious but hopeful about the market’s near-term direction.
AKD Securities believed that geopolitical developments and the outcome of the upcoming IMF review mission, due to arrive next week, will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.
Additionally, the corporate results season may offer some upside, especially if earnings surpass expectations.</p><small>2026-02-23 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231401521aecdf9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975196/increased-risk-of-glacial-floods-in-gilgit-baltistan-due-to-above-normal-temperatures-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Increased risk of glacial floods in Gilgit-Baltistan due to above-normal temperatures: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), in its February-April weather outlook for northern areas, on Monday warned of a “high probability” of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) in Gilgit-Baltistan, owing to “sustained above normal” temperatures.
Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property, and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in GB and KP are vulnerable to the phenomenon, according to the Ministry of Climate Change.
The PMD, in its outlook, noted that due to reduced rain and “persistent clear-sky conditions”, temperatures across GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) from Feb 1 to 22 recorded an increase.
“Daytime (maximum) temperatures were recorded 3–5°C above normal, while nighttime (minimum) temperatures remained 1–3.5°C above the 1981–2010 climatological average,” the PMD said, adding that the highest warming was recorded in the regions of Gilgit and Bunji.
“Chilas and Bunji have shown notable increases in minimum temperatures, reducing overnight refreezing,” it added.
The PMD predicted that the “above normal” temperatures were “accelerating snow and glacier melt, particularly at mid to lower altitudes”.
“Reduced nighttime cooling further enhances meltwater runoff into glacial lakes,” it added.
The weather body warned that the rapid melting increases “water accumulation in both moraine and glacier-dammed lakes, raising the likelihood of Glof events in downstream valleys”.
PMD noted that if the warming trend continued, “the risk of glacier melt acceleration and potential Glof occurrences may increase in vulnerable areas such as Gilgit, Ghizar, Hunza, Bunji, Chilas and Astore”.
It added that PMD was monitoring the “temperature trends, glacier melt conditions, and hydro meteorological parameters and will issue timely advisories to relevant authorities and communities”.
Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.</p><small>2026-02-23 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23144829eba1944.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975200/iran-says-any-us-attack-including-limited-strikes-would-be-act-of-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says any US attack including limited strikes would be ‘act of aggression’</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Monday that any attack by the United States, including limited strikes, would be an “act of aggression” that would precipitate a response, after US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran.
“With respect to your first question concerning the limited strike, I think there is no limited strike,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said at a briefing in Tehran attended by an AFP journalist.
“An act of aggression would be regarded as an act of aggression. Period.
“And any state would react to an act of aggression as part of its inherent right of self-defence ferociously so that’s what we would do.”
Trump said on Friday he was considering a limited strike if Tehran did not reach a deal with the US.
“I guess I can say I am considering that,” he replied following a question from reporters.
The two countries concluded a second round of indirect talks in Switzerland on Tuesday under Omani mediation, against the backdrop of a major US military build-up in the region.

 

Further talks, confirmed by Iran and Oman but not by the US, are scheduled for Thursday.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the negotiations for Iran, while the United States is represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
Trump is wondering why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military deployment, Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday.
Baqaei responded on Monday by saying that Iranians had never capitulated at any point in their history.

The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the FO said in a press release.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will hold a bilateral meeting with Sheikh Tamim, “covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership, and people-to-people exchanges”, the FO added.
“The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export.”
The FO highlighted that both countries shared a “longstanding partnership characterised by mutual trust and close coordination at regional and international forums”.







“The visit will also provide an opportunity for both leaderships to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest, reaffirming their resolve to work closely for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” the statement added.
“The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between the two countries and underscores their shared commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation,” the FO noted.
The premier will be accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other ministers, and senior officials, according to the FO.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
PM Shehbaz undertook two visits to Doha in September 2025 — one to express solidarity after Israeli attacks on the country and a second to attend a joint summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
He had held meetings with the Qatari emir on both occasions, reaffirmed Pakistan’s “all-out support and solidarity” for the Gulf state.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2311514103d92db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975189/another-tejas-jet-lost-as-indian-air-force-grounds-fleet-for-inspections-reports-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Another Tejas jet lost as Indian Air Force grounds fleet for inspections, reports local media</strong></a><br><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) has lost another Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Tejas light combat aircraft after it overshot the runway at a frontline airbase, sustaining major damage to its airframe, Indian media, including The Hindu reported.
The incident, believed to have been caused by a brake failure, took place on February 7, and the pilot ejected safely, according to The Times of India.
Following the accident, the entire fleet of about 30 single-seat Tejas jets was grounded to undergo comprehensive technical inspections, The Hindu added.
The latest mishap comes amid delays in the delivery of the Tejas Mk‑1A variant, according to Indian media outlets. HAL has faced repeated delays in supplying the jets, mainly due to GE Aerospace missing deadlines for engine deliveries.
The IAF has not released an official statement regarding the incident.
This is reported to be the third Tejas aircraft lost since induction. The first crash occurred near Jaisalmer in March 2024 after a firepower demonstration, with the pilot ejecting safely.
The second incident was reported in November 2025, when a Tejas jet crashed during an aerial display on the last day of the Dubai Airshow, the Middle East’s biggest airshow.
In February 2021, India’s Defence Ministry signed an INR480 billion contract with HAL for 83 Tejas Mk‑1A jets, followed by a separate INR623.7bn deal in September 2025 for 97 additional aircraft, Indian media outlets reported.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/230926362f4a3fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975150/security-forces-kill-five-terrorists-including-suicide-bomber-during-ibo-in-balochistans-pishin-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill five terrorists, including suicide bomber, during IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Pishin district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber Kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored Khwarij were hunted down and sent to hell.”
Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
The spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement.
He added that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”.
He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism.







Last week, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On February 5, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The operation was initiated as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across the province on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
During simultaneous operations, around 180 suspects were arrested and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized by Frontier Corps and police, officials said.

The leaders — Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mahmoodur Rasheed and Ejaz Chaudhry — jailed for involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots issued the statement through their lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar Umar, from Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore.
The statement said that a multi-party conference should be held immediately on the “Palestinian issue”, saying that sustainable peace was not possible in the region without a “two-state solution and justice”.
It called on all parties to reiterate their support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
“Since the ceasefire was announced through negotiations, more than 600 deaths have been reported in Gaza as a result of continuous ceasefire violations,” the statement pointed out.
“Israel’s decision to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, its unilateral actions to change the legal, demographic and historical status of the occupied Palestinian territories, its refusal to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip, its refusal to allow reconstruction work before Hamas disarms, and its continued obstruction of the uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid are all undermining the 20-point peace plan.”
The leaders further highlighted a need to discuss why four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) were not ready to be part of United States President Donald Trump’s new Board of Peace, ostensibly established to settle the Gaza conflict.
“Is it fair that Israel should be given membership of the Peace Board while the Palestinians are kept out?” they asked, pointing out that Israel’s violations of international law and the UN Charter had further escalated Middle East tensions.
The US president’s board met for its inaugural session in Washington on Thursday, with a number of countries pledging money and personnel for rebuilding, more than four months into a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. However, the meeting offered no timeline for Hamas to lay down its weapons or for Israel’s army to withdraw from the shattered enclave.
The statement also addressed the recently brewing conflict between the US and Iran, expressing concern that Tehran’s failure to reach an agreement with Washington within 10 days “could push the region towards war”. It highlighted the significant consequences of instability in Iran and its impact on Pakistan.
“Since there has been no meaningful debate in parliament on the Palestinian issue and the rising tensions in the Middle East, an urgent multi-party conference is the need of the hour to build a national consensus for peace and stability in Gaza and the wider region,” the statement concluded.
The UN said on Thursday that Israel’s increased attacks and forcible transfers of Palestinians “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it added.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699ba3bc7e66a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975091/us-pulls-troops-out-of-qatar-bahrain-as-iran-tensions-mount' target='_blank'><strong>US pulls troops out of Qatar, Bahrain as Iran tensions mount</strong></a><br><p>

• Trump asking why Tehran has not ‘capitulated’ in the face of military build-up, US envoy Witkoff says• Iranian commander claims ‘enemy’ movements being monitored round the clock• Talks expected on Thursday if nuclear proposal furnished ‘in next 48 hours’• Washington ‘offered’ opportunities for investment in Iran’s oil industry
DUBAI: The United States has evacuated hundreds of troops from key bases in Qatar and Bahrain in what is described as a precautionary move as tensions with Iran continue to escalate, according to a report by The New York Times.
The withdrawal, which involved personnel stationed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and facilities linked to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, comes amid growing concern in Washington over the possibility of military confrontation with Tehran and the risk of Iran’s retaliatory strikes across the region.
Al Udeid, the largest US military installation in the Middle East, hosts around 10,000 troops and plays a central role in American air operations in the region. Officials said the redeployment was intended to reduce exposure of forces in the event of a sudden escalation.
The move has been widely interpreted as part of a contingency planning rather than a signal of imminent conflict.
US forces remain deployed across a network of bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE.
Meanwhile, US negotiators are ready to hold another round of talks with Iran on Friday in Geneva if they receive a detailed Iranian proposal for a nuclear deal in the next 48 hours, Axios reported on Sunday, citing a senior US official.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday officials of Iran and the US are expected to attend Oman-mediated talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, noting that there is still “a good chance” of diplomatic solution to Tehran’s nuclear ambition.
Later, Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi in a post on X confirmed “US-Iran negotiations are now set for Geneva this Thursday, with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalising the deal.”







Trump asks why Iran has not capitulated
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal. In a Fox News interview, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”

 

Witkoff’s comments come after Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days. Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
Iran monitoring ‘enemy’ movements
An Iranian commander said on Sunday that his country’s forces are monitoring “enemy” movements around the clock amid rising tensions with the United States, according to an Anadolu report.
“All enemy movements are continuously monitored,” Ground Forces Commander Ali Jahanshahi said during a visit to a military unit in the city of Piranshahr in West Azerbaijan province near the Iraqi border.
“Thanks to their advanced capabilities, our soldiers will not allow any hostile action against this land,” he added in his comments cited by local media.
Iran and the US have differing views over sanctions relief in talks to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday.
“The last round of talks showed that US ideas regarding the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief differ from Iran’s demands,” the official said.
“Within the economic package under negotiation, the US has also been offered opportunities for serious investment and tangible economic interests in Iran’s oil industry,” the official said. However, he said Tehran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and ordered non-essential vehicles off city roads from Sunday night to noon Monday, saying plows and emergency crews needed the streets clear as snowfall intensified.
The city is under its first blizzard warning since 2017.
City offices will close for in-person services, and non-essential municipal employees may work remotely. “I’m urging every New Yorker to please stay home,” Mamdani said.
New York City, the nation’s largest school district, ordered all public school buildings closed for a traditional snow day, with no remote instruction and all after-school programs cancelled.
The storm has already snarled travel along the East Coast from Washington to New England, with airlines canceling thousands of flights and officials urging people to stay off the roads.
Winter weather in the Northeast may also slow the processing, transport and delivery of mail and packages, the US Postal Service said.



Regional emergencies
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had activated 100 National Guard members to assist in Long Island, New York City and the Lower Hudson Valley — areas expected to bear the brunt of the heavy snow and coastal winds.
The storm also forced closure of the United Nations (UN) headquarters complex in Manhattan on Monday.
Parts of the Northeast could see up to two feet of snow and wind gusts could reach 70 mph, raising the risk of falling trees and power outages, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
In an update on Sunday, the agency said despite its ongoing funding lapse, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (Fema) disaster‑response work continues uninterrupted, including staff travel, emergency operations, and critical assistance for people affected by active disasters, with life safety and property protection remaining top priorities.
Last week, Reuters reported that US President Donald Trump’s administration had ordered Fema to suspend the deployment of hundreds of aid workers to disaster-affected areas around the country while the DHS is shut down.



Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey declared an emergency and told state workers to stay home. Connecticut barred commercial vehicles from limited-access highways Sunday evening, exempting only emergency and essential deliveries.
New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill declared a statewide emergency effective noon Sunday and urged residents to take the storm seriously. “People need to take this very seriously,” she told CNN.
Travel disruptions
Air travel was among the earliest casualties. Flight-tracking site FlightAware showed more than 5,000 flights already canceled for Monday.
Aviation analytics firm Cirium said more than 25,000 flights were scheduled to depart from the United States on Monday, with cancellations also rising for Tuesday, especially at major Northeast airports.
NJ TRANSIT suspended bus, light rail and Access Link service Sunday evening and halted statewide rail service by Sunday night, with operations resuming only when conditions allow.
In New England, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority said it would suspend all service — including its RIde paratransit program — from Sunday night through Monday and would announce plans to resume service only when conditions improve.

“Pakistan has always chosen the path of dialogue and peaceful coexistence. But when Afghan soil continues to be used for proxy attacks, we have no choice but to defend our homeland. National security is non-negotiable,” Chaudhry said in a statement.
The PML-N MNA affirmed that the people of Pakistan “stand firmly” with their armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
He urged the Afghan government to take “decisive action to prevent its land from being used for cross-border militancy”, warning that lasting peace in the region depended on the “complete dismantling of terrorist sanctuaries”.
Noting that the recent operation “successfully neutralised militants involved in attacks on Pakistani soil”, Chaudhry stressed: “This action was aimed solely at those responsible for violent attacks inside Pakistan. Every precaution was taken to protect innocent lives.”
He also pointed to Afghanistan’s emergence as a “sanctuary for multiple terrorist groups”. Referring to a United Nations report, he noted that militants from 21 terror outfits were operating from Afghan territory, posing a serious threat to regional stability.
He specifically called out India’s “continued support for terrorist networks”.
“India is actively funding and training these groups, equipping them to carry out cross-border attacks against Pakistan. Such elements deserve no concessions,” the parliamentary secretary asserted.
His remarks came after Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation targeting groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.
The strikes killed “more than 80 terrorists”, according to security sources.
The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur, and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians. Authorities described the operation as intelligence-based and proportionate, aimed solely at those responsible for the attacks.
‘Decisive struggle against terrorism’
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi asserted that the country will “not allow our soil to be destabilised by forces operating from across the border in Afghanistan”.
In a post on X, he said: “The citizens of Pakistan, especially the resilient people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our armed forces and security institutions in the defense of our homeland.”
He further said: “The sacrifices of our martyrs bind us together as one nation. In this decisive struggle against terrorism, Pakistan stands united, resolute, and unwavering.
“Our sovereignty is non-negotiable, and the people of this country stand shoulder to shoulder with the state to protect it at all costs.”

Thousands of party elites have packed the capital Pyongyang for a once-in-five-years summit of the ruling Workers’ Party, a gathering that directs state efforts on everything from diplomacy to war planning.
The congress offers a rare glimpse into the political workings of reclusive North Korea, and is widely seen as a forum for Kim to flex his grip on power.
Military top brass made a “pledge of loyalty” to Kim as delegates rubber-stamped his re-election as general secretary on Sunday, the Korean Central News Agency said.
The congress singled out Kim’s efforts to keep unnamed foes at bay by “radically” improving its “nuclear forces”.
“He has energetically led the work to turn the Korean People’s Army, the pivot of national defence and pillar of safeguarding peace, into an elite and powerful army,” read a party statement.
“And thus (he has) built the revolutionary armed forces capable of coping with any threat of aggression on their own initiative and fully prepared for any form of war.”

China’s President Xi Jinping hailed a “new chapter” in relations with North Korea after Kim’s re-election.
In a striking display of his elevated status on the world stage, Kim appeared alongside Xi and Russia’s Vladimir Putin at a military parade in Beijing last year.
Kim is expected to unveil the next phase in North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme later in the days-long congress.
Under Kim, North Korea’s nuclear arsenal has been transformed from a source of mild global concern to something treated as a genuine threat.
It has been more than eight years since North Korea’s last nuclear test triggered a man-made earthquake underneath the northern Hamyong mountains.
Pyongyang’s atomic scientists have worked since then to harness this power in portable warheads that can be attached to long-range missiles.
Kim unveiled a battery of huge nuclear-capable rocket launchers just days before the congress opened.
Friend or foe
Photos released by state media showed dozens of launch vehicles parked in neat rows on the plaza of Pyongyang’s House of Culture.
It is just the ninth time the Workers’ Party congress has convened under North Korea’s decades-spanning Kim rule.
The meeting was shelved for decades under Kim’s father Kim Jong Il, but was revived in 2016.
Analysts will scour photographs to see which officials are seated closest to Kim, and who is banished to the back row.

Particular attention will be placed on the whereabouts of Kim’s teenage daughter Ju Ae, who has emerged as North Korea’s heir apparent according to Seoul’s national intelligence service.
At the previous congress five years ago, Kim declared that the United States was his nation’s “biggest enemy”.
There is keen interest in whether Kim might use the congress to soften this stance, or double down.
US President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was “100 per cent” open to a meeting.
Kim has so far largely shunned efforts to resume top-level diplomatic dialogue.</p><small>2026-02-23 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23090919a4801df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975148/mexican-drug-lord-killing-sparks-revenge-attacks-cars-and-businesses-set-ablaze-highways-blocked' target='_blank'><strong>Mexican drug lord killing sparks revenge attacks; cars and businesses set ablaze, highways blocked</strong></a><br><p>Within hours of the killing of Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, better known as El Mencho, in a military raid on Sunday, gunmen suspected to be his supporters blocked highways across several states and set cars and businesses ablaze.
In some towns, tourists and residents were urged to stay indoors, while truckers were advised to take safe routes or return to their depots until the violence abated.
Several airlines, including Air Canada, United Airlines and Aeromexico, on Sunday cancelled flights to Puerto Vallarta, a beachside resort town where stunned tourists filmed plumes of smoke rising into the sky from fires.
The burst of violence across more than half a dozen states painted a familiar scene for Mexicans who have spent two decades watching successive governments wage war on drug cartels, ravaging broad swaths of the country.
A member of Oseguera’s Jalisco New Generation Cartel told Reuters that the blazes and sporadic gunfire were carried out in revenge for the government’s killing of Oseguera, and warned of further bloodshed as groups move to take control of his cartel.

“The attacks were carried out in revenge for the leader’s death, at first against the government and out of discontent,“ the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“But later, the internal killings are coming, by the groups moving in to take over.”
In Mexico’s Pacific coast, a five-hour drive from the military operation in the town of Tapalpa that took down the leader of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, stunned beachgoers on a pier in Puerto Vallarta took out their cell phones to film thick waves of smoke obscuring blue ocean views, showed a video shared with Reuters.
Daniel Drolet, a Canadian who has wintered in Puerto Vallarta for years, said in a phone interview that he was concerned about a new era of violence taking root in the typically placid resort zone.
“I have never seen anything like this before,” he said.
In the state of Jalisco, authorities reported that gunmen had attacked a base for the National Guard military police, and recommended guests remain inside hotels and suspended public transit.
Other scenes of criminal activity and military response were captured in videos shared by government security sources with Reuters: A green military tank made its way through a residential neighborhood in the state of Aguascalientes.
Roadblocks paralyzed the highly transited Mexico-Puebla highway. In the state of Colima, cartel members standing in pick-up trucks blocked a road.
A trucking industry group said in a statement it was “profoundly worried” by the highway violence and recommended that truckers keep to safe areas or return to their operating yards until conditions improved.

The state of Guanajuato, a CJNG stronghold, reported 55 incidents across 23 municipalities, with 18 arrests, but said by evening all incidents were under control.
Carlo Gutierrez, who lives in Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital, said that friends on WhatsApp groups were encouraging people to stay home.
“There is fear and a lot of caution,” he said of the city, one of three main Mexican venues for World Cup soccer matches this summer.
Former cop turned kingpin
Oseguera, a former police officer, founded and oversaw the rapid rise of the CJNG, named for the western state of Jalisco that is home to one of Mexico’s biggest cities, Guadalajara.
In recent years, CJNG has expanded into one of Mexico’s most powerful cartels, known for violent tactics including forced labor and forced recruitment.
Under El Mencho’s leadership, CJNG also became a highly diversified criminal enterprise, expanding from drug trafficking to fuel theft, extortion, human smuggling, and complex financial frauds.

The cartel pioneered use of drones in attacks against civilians in remote regions of western Mexico as part of its rapid territorial expansion.
Sunday’s raid was one of Mexico’s highest-profile blows against drug gangs responsible for smuggling billions of dollars of drugs - including fentanyl - into the US.
In recent years, the leaders of the rival Sinaloa Cartel - Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada- were captured alive. Both are now in US prisons.
President Donald Trump’s administration lauded El Mencho’s killing, but the domestic violence it triggered highlighted the political balancing act Sheinbaum must strike as her government escalates its cartel offensive.
Security experts were watching whether the raid and death of the cartel boss will fracture CJNG leadership and trigger bloody infighting.
“There will definitely be skirmishes between the various factions, and these spasms of violence could last for years,” said Carlos Olivo, a former US Drug Enforcement Administration assistant special agent in charge and an expert in CJNG.
Violence in wake of cartel arrests, killings
Authorities have not reported any casualties beyond several cartel members and officials killed during the military operation.
Previous cartel arrests and killings have led to outbreaks of violence - whether by members avenging their fallen leader or rival gangs muscling in on their territory — prompting Mexican authorities to hesitate before launching major campaigns.

In 2019, Ovidio Guzman, a son of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, was detained but quickly released, setting off widespread gun battles. His arrest in 2023 set off more violence.
The 2024 arrest of Sinaloa Cartel boss Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada triggered a bloody power struggle in the criminal group that continues unabated more than a year later.
“I’m watching the scenes of violence from Mexico with great sadness and concern,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who previously served as ambassador to Mexico, in a post on social media.
“It’s not surprising that the bad guys are responding with terror. But we must never lose our nerve.”
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum in a social media post acknowledged the violence, but struck a tone of calm.
“In most of the national territory activities are happening with absolute normalcy,” she said.
Killing wins US praise
Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, previously ambassador to Mexico, said Oseguera’s killing was a “great development” for the US and Mexico, as well as the rest of Latin America.

In January after the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said “the cartels are running Mexico,” and warned “we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels.”
Sheinbaum said she would strengthen efforts to cooperate with the US to fight cartels., but vowed to uphold Mexico’s sovereignty and warned against any unilateral military action by the U.S. in Mexico.
Sheinbaum, in a social media post on Sunday, said security officials would provide information on the operation.</p><small>2026-02-23 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23081657d8fa2d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975104/cm-maryam-unveils-free-land-scheme-for-farmers' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam unveils free land scheme for farmers</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced that free state land will be provided to peasants from April under the “Apna Khet, Apna Rozgar” initiative, in a major push to strengthen the province’s agricultural sector.
In a statement, the chief minister said that all cultivable government land across Punjab would be leased to peasants for 10 years, with each beneficiary receiving up to five acres free of cost. No lease charges would be collected, she added.
She said farmers will also receive financial assistance along with land allocation to help them immediately begin cultivation. The initiative aims to boost agricultural productivity and support the rural economy.
The scheme was first announced on February 4 during her address at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Rajanpur, where she stated that around 250,000 acres of land would be distributed among deserving and underprivileged individuals.

Cultivable govt land to be leased for 10 years ‘free of cost’

Detailed guidelines and the application procedure are expected to be issued soon.
Separately, speaking at the launch ceremony of the CM Green Tractor Programme Phase-III, the chief minister formally initiated the balloting process and congratulated successful farmers.
She said that while 20,000 tractors were distributed over the past 25 years, her government has provided 31,000 tractors in just two years, setting a new record.
During the ceremony, she personally called selected farmers, including Hamza Liaquat from Bahawalpur, informing him of his success in the draw.
The chief minister said the Green Tractor Scheme was transforming the Punjab’s agricultural landscape, adding that the provision of modern machinery would significantly enhance crop yields. She reaffirmed that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz remained committed to farmer-friendly policies and would continue to prioritise agricultural development.

An Indian army statement said three fighters were killed during a military operation in the high-altitude Kishtwar district after it received “credible intelligence of a rebel presence” in the area.
It added that security forces had recovered weapons from the site.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the youths were killed in the Chatroo forest area. It added that additional troops were deployed to the area. “All entry and exit points have been sealed,” it reported.
An attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Paha­lgam on April 22 last year resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the Indus Waters Treaty in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.

WORDS are never just words. They carry history, suspicion and memory. A single sentence, spoken casually in Washington or by an American official, can travel thousands of miles and land like a strategic signal.
When US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told podcaster Tucker Carlson in an interview that “It would be fine if they (Israelis) took it all (Arab lands),” he may have intended a theological remark.
But in Arab capitals and the broader Muslim world, it was heard as something else — an endorsement of the ‘Greater Israel’ vision, peddled by Israeli Zionists.
The reaction was not scattered, rather collective. Fou­r­teen governments — among them Pakistan, Eg­ypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Türkiye, Indonesia and the State of Palestine — joined hands with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, League of Arab States and Gulf Cooperation Council to denounce the remarks.
Their joint statement did not hide behind soft language, expressing “strong condemnation and profound concern” and affirming “categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.”
This is not how governments usually react to a casual gaffe by an official. This is how they react when they feel something foundational is being questioned.
The controversy began when Mr Huckabee referred to the biblical promise of land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. When asked if Israel had the right to that territory, he replied that it would be fine if Israel took it all.

 

The map implied by that verse in the book of Genesis includes not only the occupied Pale­s­t­inian territories but also parts of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Sovereignty and international law
There were several reasons for the sharp reaction from Arab and Muslim states.
Firstly, it relates to the core issue of sovereignty of other states. In a region that has witnessed occupation and annexation, even rhetorical acceptance of territorial expansion triggers deep anxiety.
The second reason is the long-running Palestine dispute as the two-state formula, though weakened, remains the diplomatic touchstone. Arab governments see the ambassador’s remark as undermining any claim that US still backs a political horizon for Palestinian statehood.
Thirdly, the fear of domestic backlash forced Muslim leaders to react promptly. Cairo, Amman, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh justify cooperation with the US on the understanding that the US guarantees their territorial integrity. But when a senior American official app­e­a­rs to bless expansion, that understanding fades.
Fourthly, the statement meant setting a precedent. Diplomacy works on signals. An ambassador’s words are not treated as personal musings; they are read as indicators.
International law is clear on the basic principle that territory can’t be acquired by force. The UN Charter rests on sovereign equality and territorial integrity.
“The ambassador’s remarks regarding Isr­ael’s territorial acquisitions in the Middle East are deemed unwarranted and represent a clear contravention of established international norms… Furthermore, as an accredited envoy, he is precluded from endorsing aggressive act­i­ons,” Ahmer Bilal Soofi, president of the Res­earch Society of International Law, told Dawn.
The dispute over West Bank or East Jerusalem, notwithstanding, there is no legal doctrine to validate scripture-based territorial claims. Borders in the modern state system can only be changed by treaty or mutual deal.
“Arab leaders don’t expect Israel to cross the Jordan River, but the real question is whether the West Bank will be fully annexed. The full annexation of the West Bank would be a problem for normalisation,” said Adam Weinstein of the Quincy Institute’s Middle East Programme.
That is why the joint statement framed the issue in legal terms besides noting that such remarks contradict the stated vision of de-escalation and a political settlement leading to an independent Palestinian state.
Implications for US policy
For Washington, the implications go beyond one interview.
American influence in the Middle East does not run on aircraft carriers alone; it is anchored in the carefully maintained belief that Washington, despite its tilt towards Israel, still values stability. Egypt’s strategic location, Jordan’s role, Saudi Arabia’s oil leverage and the Gulf states’ security partnerships, all rest on that understanding.
If the Arab public concludes that US quietly supports territorial expansionist visions, their governments will face a higher political cost in sustaining cooperation with Washington. The consequences may not lead to dramatic breakups, but may yield hesitation, reduced diplomatic flexibility, and greater openness to other powers such as China and Russia.
Trust in this region is thin and expensive. Once eroded, it cannot be easily restored.
Mr Huckabee later attempted to clarify what he said. He argued that Israel does not want such territory and that his remarks were theological, not policy-related.







On social media, he also denounced the so-called Khazar theory as an “odious conspiracy theory” and accused “Islamist accounts” run from countries like Pakistan and Turkiye of spreading false smears about Israel. In doing so, he reframed the backlash as the product of anti-Semitic disinformation. By naming Pak­istan and Turkiye, both signatories to the con­demnation, he personalised the dispute.
That may satisfy the domestic audience in US, but it will do little to calm the Middle East, or even wriggle his government out of the tight spot he has put it in.
“The Ambassador’s statement has placed his sending state in a precarious position. Should the government endorse… this irresponsible statement… [it] would potentially incur significant costs… Conversely, if the government disavows his comment… he would have demonstrably exceeded his authority as an envoy under the Vienna Convention,” Mr Soofi explained.
In such a scenario, dissociation from his irresponsible views would necessitate his removal as an envoy as a minimum measure,” he maintained.

The capital Kyiv, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified assaults amid freezing winter temperatures.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said of the attack on social media, adding that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway.” The intense barrage came the same day Hungary said it would block the EU’s latest package of sanctions against Russia, unless Ukraine re-opens a key oil pipeline that supplies the country.

Drone attacks prompt suspension of operations at Moscow airports for hours

Ukraine says the Druzhba pipeline that crosses its territory to deliver Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary was damaged late January by Russian strikes.

 

In Kyiv and its region, the Sunday overnight strikes killed one man and wounded a dozen more, among them four children, Ukraine’s national police said.
This news agency saw rescuers sifting through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Kyiv’s suburb of Sofiivska Borshchagivka.
“I felt the building shaking. It was clearly a hit, and the force (of the explosion) was strong. I jumped up because my dog got scared too,” Olga, a 48-year-old woman who lives in the settlement, said.
Anton, also from the area, said there were no military installations in Sofiivska Borschagivka. “Only people live here — schools, kindergartens, private houses — so it’s definitely not connected to any military facilities or any kind of industry,” he said.
Moscow airports
Moscow airports were back in operation on Sunday evening after hours-long suspensions imposed by aviation regulator Rosaviatsia over drone attacks which the city’s mayor said had been repelled.
Rosaviatsia said all major Moscow airports were open for arrivals and departures, subject to consultation with authorities.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, in a succession of posts on Telegram, said 20 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed or intercepted en route to Moscow from about 3pm.
‘Act of terrorism’
The Russian army said it had carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine’s military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
The Russian bombardment on Ukr­aine, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heigh­tened vigilance across the country, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine’s energy ministry said consumers in six eastern and southeastern region were without power after the strikes.
Authorities in Russia’s western Belgorod region, meanwhile, said two man died after a Ukrainian drone strike. Poland’s Operational Command said it scrambled jets after detecting “long-range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
In one attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western Ukrainian city near the Polish border far from the front line that has been largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break-in. Hours later, law enforcement said it had detained a Ukrainian woman suspected of carrying out the bomb attack, adding that an investigation was ongoing.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” mayor Andriy Sadovyi said. Ukraine’s interior ministry later said “there is every reason to believe that the crime was committed on the orders of Russia”.

ISLAMABAD: Amid alerts already raised by two key federal ministries, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has invited expert and public opinion on a rather quick and upfront four-year payback period for a $432 million government-to-government inve­stment bet­ween state-owned entities of Pakistan and Azerbaijan in the oil sector.
Ogra has scheduled a public hearing for March 2 and sought comments from stakeholders, including the general public, on “whether the proposed payback period of four years is justified” and whether the project would affect regional transportation costs compared to existing road movement.
The project has to mostly use local resources and dollar-based returns to cover full investment in four years, which has already been objected to by the Ministry of Finance.
The proposal involves a 20-inch, 256-kilometre pipeline from Faisalabad to Thallian (Section I) near Islamabad to carry about seven million tonnes per annum (MTPA), extendable to 10 MTPA.
It would then convert to a 12-inch line for 172km to Tarujabba near Peshawar (Section II) with a capacity of five MTPA, and an eight-inch, 9km line from Thallian to Faqirabad (Section III).
The cost of Section I has been put at $320m, followed by $94m for Section II and $17.5m for Section III. According to Ogra, the project life is 30 years.
The regulator has also sought public input on whether the claimed throughput volumes are fair and justified, whether the proposed capacities for the three pipeline sections can handle the intended volumes over the project life, and whether the proposed storage capacity — 60,000 tonnes each at Faisalabad and Thallian and 50,000 tonnes at Tarujabba — is appropriate for the projected throughput.
The project cost cleared by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet five months ago was $300m, while two ministries had raised reservations over guaranteed returns in dollar terms on the transportation of petroleum products.
The Machike-Thallian-Tarujabba white oil pipeline is to be developed on a government-to-government basis with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR, the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and Pakistan State Oil through a joint project company. The project, being pursued as a “strategic investment” from Azerbaijan, has long been pushed by the FWO through local resources.
The ECC had “approved the terms and conditions” proposed by the Petroleum Division to enable the launch of this strategic project, which was expected to strengthen bilateral friendship, trade and investment ties between Pakistan and Azerbaijan by the end of August 2025.
Power Minister Awais Leghari had cautioned against guaranteed return in dollar terms, saying the government should have learnt lesson from the experience of independent power producers (IPPs).
He advocated that “all aspects of the investment proposal should be checked thoroughly for cost and internal rate of return (IRR), keeping in view the instance of independent power producers”, according to official minutes of the meeting.
SOCAR had set a “ship or pay” condition for investment in the project on the pattern of “take or pay” in power purchase agreements with independent power producers that required full payment for the pipeline capacity (about 7-8 MPTA) even if petroleum products are unable to be moved for some reason.
Moreover, the Ministry of Finance raised questions over the upfront payback period and noted that “dollarised return was being considered only in the context of foreign investment and should not be applicable in the event that foreign investment does not materialise”.
There was a view that returns being secured for foreign investment could not be allowed on local investment, and payback should be of a longer term.
The Ministry of Finance also demanded rationalising the interest rate assumptions, a more rational weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and an increase in payback period to seven years instead of four to avoid a higher tariff impact at the early stages of the project.
It also wanted the Petroleum Division to finalise the technical details relating to inland freight equalisation margin and declaration of default mode of transport, instead of Ogra, considering the peculiar needs of the sector.
However, the Petroleum Division argues that such amendments would make the key project unattractive.
Therefore, the ECC has overruled the finance ministry’s demand for rationalising payouts and containing other liabilities as well as the power minister’s views and “observed that the project would open new vistas for future investment and hence, must be seen in a larger strategic perspective and be understood as an investment opportunity”, according to the official record.
The FWO had originally sought 14.6 per cent IRR and 25pc equity IRR.
The ECC has, nevertheless, agreed to the cautions to the extent that “dollarised return would be applicable only in the event of foreign investment coming into the project”.
At present, approximately 70pc of petrol and diesel is transported by road, whereas 28pc is being moved through an existing pipeline from Karachi to Machike and 2pc is carried by railway.
A revised version also provided for guaranteed quantities for oil transportation, for which Ogra would allow a transportation tariff. The tariff will be in US dollars with optimal utilisation of pipeline capacity in “default mode of transportation”.
Under this, all oil marketing companies would be bound to commit minimum annual pipeline volumes and shortfall would be covered against their inland freight equalisation margin.
According to the agreed mechanism, Ogra will design a regulatory framework to ensure optimal utilisation of the pipeline by declaring it a default mode of transportation.

A senior police officer said the armed men barged into the construction company’s camp in Mula area, some 60 km from Khuzdar, and kidnapped 11 workers including a project manager.
“Six labourers belonged to Sindh province who were working with the com­pany while five others are residents of Khuzdar and other areas of the province,” the police official said.
He said the armed men attempted to take away arms and ammunition of the police station but police personnel offered resistance, forcing the kidnappers to flee.
Six out of 11 labourers have been identified as Project Manager Gul Sher, Ghulam Sarwar, Abdul Malik Bugti, Maulana Bakhsh, Muhammad Irfan and Ikhtiar.
Security forces reached the area after getting information of the incident and launched a search operation in the area. However, no arrest of kidnappers or recovery of labourers was reported despite the passage of 24 hours.
The second kidnapping incident took place in Barkhan district where officials said over 30 armed men attacked the crushing plant in Dhola Nadi area and after damaging the plant they kidnapped three workers and fled from the area.
“Armed men abducted three labourers working at the crashing plant in Musakhail area,” Barkhan deputy commissioner Abdullah Khosa said, adding that the kidnappers also damaged the plant.
They also took away three police personnel posted at a check post along with their weapons.
Soon after the incident, SSP Barkhan Dr Saad Afridi reached the area along with a heavy police contingent and launched a search operation.
“Prompt response of the police forced the armed men to release the kidnapped police personnel and escape to nearby mountains along with three labourers,” the SSP said, adding that the operation is continuing in the mountainous area. “Soon the labourers will be recovered,” he said.

After a counter-attacking 63 by David Miller and some late hitting from Tristan Stubbs took South Africa to 187-7, the defending champions were all out for 111 in 18.5 overs, failing badly in their first chase of the tournament.
Left-arm quick Marco Jansen finished with 4-22, while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 as the South African bowlers exposed India’s fragile batting line-up.
“Great performance. Very different type of wicket to what we’ve had here, so great to see the boys assess that pretty early and adapt their skills to execute their plans,” said South Africa captain Aiden Markram.
“We’re really pumped for the bowling group. They’ve been working hard, started the comp a bit tough, but the way they rocked up tonight was a great effort.” Hot favourites to defend their crown on home soil, India will need to win their two remaining Super Eight games against Zimbabwe and the West Indies to have a chance of qualifying.
But the magnitude of the defeat means they will take a poor net run rate forward and that could prove pivotal if their Super Eights group is tight.
“We bowled really well, but we could have batted a little better,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav.

Fans silenced
“Sometimes you’ve got to think, if you’re chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it.
“We lost too many wickets in the power play.” Both teams were unbeaten in group phase and the game was a rematch of the 2024 T20 World Cup final in Barbados, which India won.
India’s unbeaten run in the tournament had stretched back to their defeat in the semi-final against eventual winners England in 2022.
South Africa struck immediately in India’s chase when Markram opened the bowling and dismissed Ishan Kishan with his off-spin.
Abhishek Sharma got his first runs of the tournament, after three ducks, with a four off Markram to get the 82,000 crowd on their feet in the cavernous stadium, which has a reported capacity of 130,000.
The joy of Indian fans was short-lived, and they were silenced as left-arm quick Marco Jansen had Tilak Varma caught behind for one in the next over and removed the left-handed Abhishek for 15.
India needed a partnership, but Corbin Bosch dismissed Washington Sundar and Suryakumar, who toe-ended to midwicket, as the hosts slumped to 51-5.
Left-arm spinner Maharaj took three wickets in one over to dismiss Hardik Pandya (18), Rinku Singh (0) and Arshdeep Singh (one) to shut the door on India.
Shivam Dube made 42 at the end, but it was too little too late, and when he fell off Jansen, last man Jasprit Bumrah followed the next ball.
Batting first after winning the toss, South Africa slipped to 20-3 before Miller and Dewald Brevis, who hit 45, put on 97, to guide South Africa to 187-7.
Tristan Stubbs had a late cameo that saw him crash an unbeaten 44 off 24 balls and launch the final two balls of the innings both for six off Pandya.
India’s Jasprit Bumrah took 3-15.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22094546e08ecf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974894/over-80-terrorists-killed-as-armed-forces-strike-7-camps-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border' target='_blank'><strong>Over 80 terrorists killed as armed forces strike 7 camps along Pakistan-Afghanistan border</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani airstrikes on Afghanistan killed “more than 80 terrorists,” security sources said on Sunday, in a retaliatory operation against groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.
Pakistan struck seven “terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of [Fitna al Khwarij] and its affiliates and [the Islamic State-Khorasan Province] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced in a post early Sunday on the social media platform X.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Security sources said late Sunday evening that, “Last night, Pakistan’s intelligence-based airstrikes destroyed seven centres of Fitna al-Khawarij TTP in three provinces of Nangarhar, Paktika and Khost, in which more than eighty Khawarij have been confirmed killed, while more are expected.”
They added that the centres targeted included “New Centre No. 1 and New Centre No. 2 in Nangarhar, Khwariji Maulvi Abbas Centre in Khost, Khwariji Islam Centre, Khwariji Ibrahim Centre in Nangarhar, and Khwariji Mullah Rahbar and Khwariji Mukhlis Yar in Paktika.”
Per the information ministry, the action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad, one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan.”
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the ministry said.

 

It asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”.
“Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the ministry noted.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security.”
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, stated that the strikes by the “Pakistan Air Force were retribution for the innocent lives lost to terrorism”.
He maintained that the strikes were an “answer to the tears of every mother who has sacrificed her son for the homeland”.
Chaudhry issued a stern warning, stating that while “Pakistan desired peace, it would not make compromises on its safety, land, and people”.
“Whoever looks at us with evil intent, we will destroy them, and no one will be spared,” the minister said.







Kabul protests
Meanwhile, the Taliban regime in Kabul called the strikes a violation of its sovereignty, saying “an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”, Reuters reported.
The news agency quoted the Afghan foreign ministry as saying that it had summoned Pakistan’s ambassador over what it described as violations of Afghan airspace and the bombing of civilians, calling the strikes “a provocative act”.
A Taliban spokesperson also claimed the attacks had killed and injured dozens of people, but Pakistani authorities termed such claims a “false and malicious narrative designed to create cover for terrorist sanctuaries”.
They maintained that TTP terrorists routinely blended into civilian areas and used non-combatants as human shields, adding that Pakistan’s operational planning accounted for this, and forces took measures to reduce or eliminate any collateral damage.
They described the actions as a “limited, proportionate response to an ongoing terror wave”, which saw mass casualty attacks inflicted on Pakistani civilians and security forces.
Photos from Nangarhar’s Bihsud district – one of the locations Afghan authorities claim were targeted by Pakistan – showed people using a bulldozer to search to clear the rubble of a destroyed building, which was being guarded by Taliban fighters.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.

 

Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
Not the first time
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699a097370155.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974764/history-the-freedom-fighter-who-became-stateless' target='_blank'><strong>HISTORY: THE FREEDOM FIGHTER WHO BECAME STATELESS</strong></a><br><p>

During the hardening positions in the 1940s of the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Muslim League (ML) on the creation of a new state for the Muslims of India, there were other groups and parties that envisioned different resolutions to the “Muslim Question.” 
Among these voices was that of the Communist Party of India (CPI), which was aligned with the INC in the late 1930s, yet slowly diverged from it in the 1940s. A major figure who articulated the CPI’s perspective on Muslim politics was Dr Kunwar Mohammad Ashraf — whose contribution has remained somewhat marginal in the received history of this period. 
THE PALS OF MEWAT
Dr Ashraf was of Rajput stock from the Mewat region and hailed from a lower middle-class family that had settled in United Provinces (UP) in the 19th century. The Mewat region extends across Haryana and Rajasthan, where the majority population were Muslims (called Meo) and Chattriya (Rajput). A distinctive feature of the Meo community was that those Hindus who abided by the rules of the pals (the tribal groupings) were incorporated into the group, with loyalty to the pal overshadowing religious belonging. 
Studies of the Mewat area from the early 20th century have shown how — in matters of birth, death and marriages — the pals would follow rituals and ceremonies of both religious communities. 
Dr Ashraf’s grandfather, originally from Alwar in Rajasthan, had settled in the town of Daryapur near Hathras (Aligarh district) after 1857. The family had followed the tradition of intermarrying with Hindus and keeping Hindu names — Dr Ashraf’s father was born Murlidhar Singh, only changing his name to Murad Ali Khan when he passed the entrance examination for railway service as a guard.

A scholar, a communist and an anti-colonial activist, Dr K.M. Ashraf spent his life arguing that India’s Muslims and Hindus shared a future — and paid for it with exile, imprisonment and marginalisation from history

Dr Ashraf was born in 1903 in Daryapur, where he spent his early childhood before moving to Moradabad for schooling. At school, he was influenced by teachers who inculcated the spirit of anti-colonialism in their pupils. In due time, Dr Ashraf joined political activist Ubaidullah Sindhi’s group, Hazb Allah, and took an oath to fight the colonisers. 
In 1918, Dr Ashraf passed his intermediate exams from MAO College in Aligarh and re-entered for his BA degree in 1920. These were the days of the Khilafat Movement, led by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, which was joined by Mohandas Gandhi, with his call for boycotting English goods and Satyagraha (non-cooperation) that would lead to Swaraj (independence). 
Dr Ashraf joined the non-cooperation movement and, along with his friends, agitated for the MAO College to not take aid from the British sarkar [government]. In retaliation, the college administration expelled the students. This expulsion led to the founding of Jamia Millia Islamia (October 1920) as a nationalist alternative to MAO College, which Dr Ashraf and his friends joined. 
However, Gandhi’s withdrawal from Satyagraha due to the Chauri Chaura incident — in which riled demonstrators killed 22 policemen — and the abolishing of the Ottoman caliphate by Turkish revolutionary Mustafa Kamal — both in 1922 — ended the non-cooperation/ Khilafat movement. 
This curtailment brought a period of disillusionment for many of the movement’s cadres and Dr Ashraf returned to MAO College in 1923. He completed his BA honours and MA, and topped his class in the LLB course by 1927.

LONDON AND THE MAKING OF A MARXIST
During the college’s jubilee celebrations in 1927, Dr Ashraf was introduced to one of the guests, the Maharaja Jain Singh of Alwar state. In his address as vice president of the student union, he reminded everyone of Aligarh’s secular tradition and spoke of his own ancestral ties to Alwar. 
The impressed Maharaja arranged a scholarship for his studies; Dr Ashraf joined Lincoln’s Inn for his Bar-at-Law and enrolled as a PhD candidate in mediaeval history at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, UK.
During this first trip to Britain, Dr Ashraf lived with Maulana Mohammad Ali, also supported by the Maharaja for medical treatment in the UK. Through the Maulana, he was introduced to Shahpurji Saklatvala (1874-1936), the Communist Party of Great Britain’s (CPGB) member elected to the British parliament. 
In 1928, the Maharaja of Alwar invited Dr Ashraf and Maulana Mohammad Ali back to Alwar for his jubilee celebrations. Dr Ashraf was made in-charge of the preparations and oversaw the entire event. After the celebrations, Dr Ashraf was offered the position of personal adviser to the Maharaja, but declined — having witnessed firsthand the wealth, wastage and oppression of a major princely state. In 1929, Dr Ashraf received a scholarship from a foundation in Hyderabad and, with some support from his father, he returned to the UK to complete his PhD. 
This time he had a more economically difficult life but he was connected to a range of young radicals studying in Britain, who were also his friends and comrades. They included Dr Z.A. Ahmad, Shaukat Omar, Sajjad Zaheer, Mahmuduzzafar, Hajra Begum (the only female in the group) and Imtiaz Ali Khan. Under Shahpurji Saklatwala’s initial guidance, this group started to work closely with CPGB in organising Indian students on nationalist grounds. 
While involved in these activities, Dr Ashraf defended his PhD thesis (University of London) in the early 1930s. The thesis, Life and Conditions of the People of Hindostan (1200-1550 CE), was a pioneering work of social history regarding the Sultanate and early Mughal period in India.

THE MUSLIM QUESTION AND THE COMMUNIST ANSWER
Due to his affiliation with CPGP, Dr Ashraf returned as a committed Marxist to India in 1932-33 and soon joined the CPI under the leadership of P.C. Joshi. In 1935, he joined Aligarh University as a history lecturer. 
From the mid-1930s, the CPI had aligned itself with some progressive section within Congress — figures like Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and Jayprakash Narayan — who were trying to lead Congress in a potentially revolutionary direction. Therefore, when Jawaharlal Nehru was elected president of the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in 1936, Dr Ashraf accepted a position at Nehru’s office in Allahabad, becoming secretary of the political bureau and also responsible for the Muslim Contact Cell of the INC.
In his writings, Dr Ashraf argued that the ML could exploit the resentment among Muslim masses stemming from the halted non-cooperation movement of 1922, compounded by the Nehru Report’s (1927) rejection of separate Muslim electorates and rising communal tensions. Yet he emphasised that his invitation was for Muslims to join the progressive groups within Congress. As a communist, he maintained that politics was organised essentially around class interests, which drove the exploitation of the poor and the marginalised.
In a 1938 letter to a friend, Dr Ashraf forcefully defended his work for INC, despite understanding the major reservations that a large portion of the Muslim population held against Congress politics. 
In a nuanced position on Muslim politics, he suggested that his friend need not join INC and continue to work with the ML (despite Dr Ashraf’s reservations), provided he could steer the League toward holding democratic elections within the primary bodies of the party, increase its membership and organise it at the local level. For Dr Ashraf, this would lead to the Muslim community to stand up against British imperialism and not be subordinate to its dictates.
The Congress ministries resigned in October-November of 1939, as they opposed the British government’s action of declaring India as a party in the Second World War without consulting the Indian elected representatives.
The start of the War tested the alliance between the Congress and the CPI. Both parties initially labelled the war as anti-imperialist, yet the CPI went further, calling for a national revolution and mass insurrection to achieve independence. By 1941, this somewhat radical line led to the British detaining scores of CPI members, including Dr Ashraf, in the notorious Deoli Concentration Camp.
By early to mid-1940s, the CPI had also started to rethink the issue of Muslim separatism (exemplified by the 1940 Lahore Resolution), being put forward by the newly invigorated ML. In response to this shift in Muslim politics, Dr Ashraf (representing CPI) had started to hint at the nationalities question and the idea of self-determination, which would be developed later as a major policy agenda by the CPI. 
According to the CPI, the linguistic and religious diversity of India had brought forward two major issues in Indian politics: the Hindu-Muslim divide and the linguistic-states problem. Was India one nation or were Hindu and Muslims separate nations and, similarly, did Bengalis or Tamils deserve different or autonomous states? 
CPI’s more overt support of the ‘Muslim Question’ followed its policy of openly opposing Congress’ Quit India Movement. Although all communist members of the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) at the Bombay session in August of 1942 voted against the resolution, it was passed by an overwhelming majority.
The CPI vote was reflective of how, by 1942, the party had reversed its earlier line, moving from calling the War an ‘Imperialist War’ to a ‘People’s War.’ It now linked itself to the international drive against Germany’s fascist regime. This led to the unbanning of the party and the release of the leaders. Dr Ashraf was also released in 1943, though his health had suffered due to prison hardships and a prolonged hunger strike.
After their leadership’s release, the CPI condemned the British imprisonment of nationalist leaders while simultaneously urging Congress to collaborate with the ML and accept it as the representative voice of India’s Muslims. 
In September of 1942, the CPI, echoing Dr Ashraf’s earlier formulation on self-determination, presented a resolution that sought to take the question of India not as a cultural whole, but as constituting various cultures, language groups and national sentiments. In this larger context, for the CPI, the slogan for Pakistan was understood as a call for self-determination and democracy for all nationalities.
Clearly, the right of self-determination came with the right of sovereignty, equality and the right to secession. Following this argument, the CPI’s manifesto for the 1945-1946 elections demanded immediate independence and transfer of power not only to two governments (India and Pakistan), but to 17 interim ‘sovereign’ national assemblies.
However, by late 1946, the CPI had started to change its position on the partition of British India. The party was critical of both the Congress and the ML for accepting the Partition plan.  Eventually, although the CPI finally accepted the creation of Pakistan by arguing for the division of the party itself (in 1948), a deep suspicion of ML politics and the agony over British India’s division was the overwhelming sentiment that was shared by most party workers.

STATELESS 
The violence during the partition of British India did not spare the Mewat area. The harmony and coexistence that was the hallmark of the Meo palbandi system was breached during the months of August and September of 1947, when unexpected communal riots broke out. Within this atmosphere, rumours circulated that Dr Ashraf was mobilising a large group of Meos to create a “mini-Pakistan” in the Mewat area.
Based on the policy of self-determination related to linguistic and ethnic identities, Dr Ashraf and Syed Mutalabi (an activist and friend) in 1942 had put forward the idea of a province that included Mewat and adjoining areas (not dissimilar to the creation of new provinces in post-independence India). Closer to independence, this idea included the abolition of princely states (especially of Alwar and Bharatpur). 
The Maharajas of these two states and their right-wing allies used the idea of the “Pal Province” to instigate communal riots and broke the Hindu-Muslim unity that had been guaranteed through ages by the palbandi process; a community of historically mixed religious heritage was being forced to leave. In return, Dr Ashraf was accused by the police of instigating communal violence and a case was made to arrest Syed Mutalabi and him. It was decided that both travel to Pakistan for some time. 
As Dr Ashraf travelled to Pakistan, his name was sent to the Pakistan intelligence services as someone wanted as a member of the CPI, along with the additional charge of spreading communal violence. Soon after his arrival, he was detained at Karachi Central Jail, even as he battled ill health. 
In prison, his health condition further deteriorated. The government of Pakistan only agreed to release Dr Ashraf on the condition that he leave the country. At this juncture, the government of India did not give him permission to return. The only option was that he left for the UK as a British subject.
While in the UK, his health remained unwell, but he put himself through a gruelling routine of research in the British Library on archives related to mediaeval India, his area of expertise. After spending five years in the UK (1949-1954), he returned to India as a British subject, with a six-month visa. On arrival, he requested Maulana Azad, his mentor and friend, to assist him in staying in India. At the expiry of his visa, no action was taken. 
Dr Ashraf spent two years in Kashmir working on a state history of the region and was later appointed as visiting professor of mediaeval history at Kirori Mal College at the University of Delhi. In 1960, with his college contract not renewed, he travelled to Humboldt University in East Berlin (GDR) to conduct research and take a position as visiting professor of mediaeval Indian history. 
In his later writings, Dr Ashraf reflected on the 1940s and was critical of the division of British India due to the communalist politics propagated by the British. However, he did maintain that, to fight colonial imperialism, CPI’s policy (and his own) of bringing Jinnah and Gandhi together, and to give due respect to ML’s emerging popularity among Muslims, some concessions had to be offered to their demand for a separate region.
Dr Ashraf’s close relatives were practising Hindus, including his paternal aunt, instilling in him a lived sense of coexistence and mutual respect that he carried directly into his politics. His youth and early middle age were dedicated to the struggle for the freedom of his country, and for equal rights and social justice for the masses. He bore all kinds of sufferings, deprivations and imprisonment. However, once colonial rule ended, Dr Ashraf found himself stateless and exiled in London, without income and with very little social support. Yet he persevered and continued to write and teach in Delhi and then in Berlin. 
A mesmerising public speaker, a scholar of Arabic, Persian and Urdu, who wrote poetry, short stories and plays, Dr Ashraf passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 59 in East Berlin on June 7, 1962. 
He is buried at the Cemetery of the Socialists in Berlin-Friedrichsfelde, where he lies with the likes of Rosa Luxemburg and others who fought for democratic rights, against fascism and for socialism.
