The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India since the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
Iqbal presided over a preliminary meeting today under the prime minister’s directions to celebrate this year’s Independence Day with “full national spirit and renewed resolve”.
Senior representatives from the Inter-Services Public Relations, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of National Heritage and Culture, Ministry of Education and Professional Training, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination and other departments participated in the meeting to discuss how to make the day “truly reflective of the feelings, aspirations and pride of the people of Pakistan”, according to a press release.
Iqbal said that this year’s Independence Day was being dedicated to the theme of “Marka-i-Haq” to “honour the courage, faith, and resolve of the nation”.
He said that the celebrations would send a “clear message to the world that Pakistan stands proud, strong and committed to its sovereignty”.
The minister added that at the same time, the government aimed to highlight the steady progress being made in economic recovery, defence resilience and international recognition of the country’s leadership, financial stabilisation and expertise, showing that Pakistan’s journey was “not just about survival but about rising to its full potential”.
While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, the minister emphasised that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.
“A robust discussion took place where the committee members shared the planned activities and innovative ideas for celebrations at the federal and provincial levels,” the press release said, adding that Iqbal said that a comprehensive plan should be developed with budgets.
“This year, we are not just commemorating another Independence Day; we are marking a moment of national revival. A moment that reflects the resilience of our people, the resolve of our state, and the rise of Pakistan as a global voice of strength, peace, and purpose. The world has seen that while Pakistan is a peace-loving nation, it will never compromise on its sovereignty. Our recent defence of our territorial integrity showed our maturity, strength, and our determination to protect regional stability without weakness.
“We must use this opportunity to honour the spirit of ‘Marka-i-Haq’, a defining chapter in our history where our armed forces, our citizens, our government, and every institution stood together. We are also seeing concrete gains across the board: inflation is down, exports are growing, digitisation is transforming governance and innovation is thriving. This is the time to celebrate Pakistan across every field, including military, economic, cultural and scientific and to tell our story to the world with pride and ambition.”
He emphasised that the celebrations must be unified. “One voice, one pride from every district, every province and every corner of the globe where Pakistanis live, so the world hears the unmistakable confidence of one nation standing tall.”
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said while addressing the meeting’s participants: “The nation stands as one united, unshaken, and ready to defeat any designs against it. Our civil and military forces are shoulder to shoulder. These celebrations will reiterate to the world what they are already telling us that we are united and strong,”
Information Minister Ataullah Tarar shared that extensive plans were underway with song competitions, special programming and a documentary. He assured the meeting’s members that the celebrations would be reflective of the country’s achievements and “celebrate the global acclaim the country is receiving”.
The participants shared a range of proposals to ensure that the celebrations reflected the “hearts of ordinary Pakistanis and involve everyone” from the cities to the villages, from students to artists, and from businesses to the diaspora.
Plans were also discussed for national songs, dramas, poetry gatherings, documentaries, cultural fairs, public events, school competitions and global embassy activities, “all designed to inspire the nation and tell its story to the world”.</p><small>2025-07-08 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/082234547cc77ec.jpg?r=230001' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922863/iran-says-it-has-not-requested-us-talks-since-war' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says it has not requested US talks since war</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Tuesday it has not made any request for talks with the United States, after President Donald Trump said Tehran was seeking negotiations following last month’s war with Israel.
“No request for a meeting has been made on our side to the American side,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei, according to Tasnim news agency.
Trump said on Monday that Iran was seeking talks with the US and that they had been scheduled, without specifying the time or the location.
“We have scheduled Iran talks. They want to talk,” Trump told reporters in the White House, where he was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“They want to meet. They want to work something out. They’re very different now than they were two weeks ago.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also reiterated Tehran’s position, rejecting talks at this stage.
“Although Iran has in recent days received messages indicating that the US may be ready to return to negotiations, how can we trust further engagement?” the Iranian top diplomat said in a piece he wrote for the Financial Times.
On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians.
 
 

The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The talks have since stalled.
The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people. Israel, in turn, was hit by waves of retaliatory drone and missile fire, which authorities said left at least 28 people dead.
A ceasefire between Iran and Israel has been in place since June 24.
“After agreeing to new negotiations in good faith, we have seen our goodwill reciprocated with an attack by two nuclear-armed militaries,” Araghchi, who was also Iran’s top negotiator during the talks with the US, said in the Financial Times piece.
“Iran remains interested in diplomacy, but we have good reason to have doubts about further dialogue.”
‘Too soft’
On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian came under fire domestically after voicing support for renewed talks with the US, with critics accusing him of being “too soft” in the wake of last month’s attacks on the country.
The backlash followed the release of an interview with US media personality Tucker Carlson, in which Pezeshkian said Iran had “no problem” resuming talks so long as trust could be rebuilt between the two sides.
“Have you forgotten that these same Americans, together with the Zionists, used the negotiations to buy time and prepare for the attack?” said an editorial in the hardline Kayhan newspaper, which has long opposed engagement with the West.
The conservative Javan daily also took aim at Pezeshkian, saying his remarks appeared “a little too soft”.
In contrast, the reformist Ham Mihan newspaper praised Pezeshkian’s “positive approach”.
“This interview should have been conducted a long time ago,” it wrote, adding that “Iranian officials have unfortunately long been absent from the international and American media landscape.”</p><small>2025-07-08 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08191503adbfa5c.jpg?r=191901' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922848/icc-seeks-arrest-of-taliban-supremo-afghan-chief-justice-over-persecution-of-women' target='_blank'><strong>ICC seeks arrest of Taliban supremo, Afghan chief justice over persecution of women</strong></a><br><p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan over the persecution of women, a crime against humanity.
ICC judges said in a statement there were “reasonable grounds” to suspect Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani “have committed … the crime against humanity of persecution … on gender grounds”.
“While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the court said.
 






The court said the alleged crimes had been committed between August 15, 2021, when the Taliban seized power and continued until at least January 20, 2025.
 
 

The Taliban had “severely deprived” girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion, ICC judges said.
“In addition, other persons were targeted because certain expressions of sexuality and/or gender identity were regarded as inconsistent with the Taliban’s policy on gender.”
Taliban authorities rejected the warrants as “nonsense”.
The ICC warrants “won’t affect the strong commitment and dedication to sharia (Islamic law)” of Taliban authorities, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.
“We don’t recognise any such international court, nor do we need it,” he added.
The ICC, based in The Hague, was set up to rule on the world’s worst crimes such as war crimes and crimes against humanity.
It has no police force of its own and relies on its member states to carry out its arrest warrants — with mixed results.
In theory, this means that anyone subject to an ICC arrest warrant cannot travel to a member state for fear of being detained.
- ‘Ongoing persecution’
After sweeping back to power in August 2021, the Taliban authorities pledged a softer rule than their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.
But they quickly imposed restrictions on women and girls that the United Nations has labelled “gender apartheid”.
Edicts in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law handed down by Akhundzada, who rules by decree from the movement’s birthplace in southern Kandahar, have squeezed women and girls from public life.
The Taliban government barred girls from secondary school and women from university in the first 18 months after they ousted the US-backed government, making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans.
Authorities imposed restrictions on women working for non-governmental groups and other employment, with thousands of women losing government jobs — or being paid to stay home.
Beauty salons have been closed and women blocked from visiting public parks, gyms and baths as well as travelling long distances without a male chaperone.
A “vice and virtue” law announced last summer ordered women not to sing or recite poetry in public and for their voices and bodies to be “concealed” outside the home.
When requesting the arrest warrants in January, chief prosecutor Karim Khan said Afghan women and girls, as well as the LGBTQ community, were facing “an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban”.
“Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable,” he added.
Khan warned at the time he would soon be seeking additional warrants for other Taliban officials.</p><small>2025-07-08 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08184428ab9b43f.jpg?r=184506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922841/trump-faces-maga-meltdown-over-epstein-reversal-after-govt-says-sex-offender-did-not-have-client-list' target='_blank'><strong>Trump faces MAGA meltdown over Epstein reversal after govt says sex offender did not have ‘client list’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base is up in arms after his administration effectively shut down conspiracy theories related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that had become an obsession for the US president’s diehard supporters.
Trump’s Justice Department and the FBI said in a memo made public on Sunday that there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful figures.
They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his death by suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.
It marked the first time Trump’s officials had publicly scotched the stories, pushed by numerous right-wing figures, notably including the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) top two officials, before Trump hired them.
The backlash was swift and brutal from his “Make America Great Again” movement — who have long held as an article of faith that “Deep State” elites were protecting Epstein’s most powerful associates in the Democratic Party and Hollywood.
“Next the Department of Justice will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,’” furious pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Alex Jones tweeted. “This is over the top sickening.”
 






Trump has managed to avoid much of the direct blame over the fiasco, with ire instead being directed at FBI director Kash Patel, his deputy Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Bongino and Patel spent years pushing conspiracy theories around the so-called “Epstein list”.
The controversy has clearly rattled Trump, who defended Bongino and Patel on social media as the “greatest law enforcement professionals in the world”, without explaining why he had spoken out.
Bongino reposted Trump’s praise and was deluged with furious responses.
 






But the lion’s share of the fury has been reserved for Bondi, who assured Fox News in February she had the Epstein client list on her desk and would get to the truth — in remarks endorsed by the White House.
Bondi was already on thin ice with MAGA after distributing binders labelled “The Epstein Files” to influencers at the White House that turned out to contain largely already public information and no new revelations.
‘Embarrassment’
“President Trump should fire [Bondi] for lying to his base and creating a liability for his administration,” far-right influencer Laura Loomer posted on X.
“She is an embarrassment and she doesn’t do anything to help Trump.”
 






White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed about the controversy and said that Bondi was actually talking about Epstein-related paperwork as a whole, sparking even more MAGA fury.
“This is what happens when the dog catches the car. Or, to put a finer point on it, when you and the people around you become the very ‘Deep State’ you have spent years attacking,” CNN analyst Chris Cillizza wrote on his Substack newsletter.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking.
Trump — who has denied visiting the US Virgin Islands home where prosecutors say Epstein sex trafficked underage girls — said ahead of his election he would have “no problem” releasing files related to the case.
It is one of a number of schisms that have opened in the MAGA movement in recent days, with supporters angry over Trump’s announcement that weapons supplies to Ukraine would resume.
 
 

Trump’s fiercely isolationist base was already upset at the president’s bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites and his statements calling for an easing of immigration raids on farms.
Beyond its insights into the power dynamics that animate Trump’s supporters, the affair has raised concerns that MAGA disillusionment will damage Republican prospects in the next election cycle.
The row comes with Trump under pressure from the launch of a new political party by his estranged former close aide Elon Musk, who had a bitter public split with the president over federal spending.
When the Trump-Musk feud blew up last month, Musk alleged that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.
Trump was named in a trove of depositions and statements linked to Epstein that were unsealed by a New York judge in early 2024, but the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Supporters on the conspiratorial end of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base allege that Epstein’s associates had their roles in his crimes covered up by government officials and others.
They point the finger at Democrats and Hollywood celebrities, although not at Trump himself.
“What’s the time?” the world’s richest man posted on his social media platform X on Monday, alongside an image of an Epstein countdown clock.
“Oh look, it’s no-one-has-been-arrested-o’clock again! “
‘Exhaustive review’
The DOJ and FBI’s conclusions came after an “exhaustive review” of the evidence amassed against Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking, the agencies said in a joint memorandum.
Six years later, questions continue to swirl around Epstein’s life and death and the multi-millionaire hedge fund manager’s connections to wealthy and powerful individuals.
The memo, first reported by Axios, squarely rejected one of the leading conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein — that he did not commit suicide but was murdered while being held in jail.
“After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell,” it said.
Video footage from the area where he was being held did not show anyone entering or attempting to enter his cell from the time at night when he was locked in till when his body was found the next morning, it said.
Extensive digital and physical searches turned up a large volume of images and videos of Epstein’s victims, many of them underage girls, the memo said.
“This review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one thousand victims,” it said, but did not reveal any illegal wrongdoing by “third parties”.
“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” the memo said. “There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”
Epstein’s former assistant, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the only former associate of his who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.
Maxwell, the daughter of British media baron Robert Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in New York in 2021 of child sex trafficking and other crimes.
Among those with connections to Epstein was Britain’s Prince Andrew, who settled a US civil case in February 2022 brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed he sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
Giuffre, who accused Epstein of using her as a sex slave, died by suicide at her home in Australia in April.</p><small>2025-07-08 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/082200485f8452a.jpg?r=221022' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922825/fact-check-rana-sanaullah-said-pakistan-should-follow-the-muslim-worlds-position-on-the-abraham-accords' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Rana Sanaullah said Pakistan should follow the Muslim world’s position on the Abraham Accords</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users on social media platform X on July 3 shared a post from digital media outlet Siasat.pk that attributed a statement to Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah that Pakistan should follow the Arab position on the Abraham Accords. However, the PML-N leader actually said that Pakistan should follow the position of the Muslim world on the issue.
The Israeli offensive, which began in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attack on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and hospital infrastructure in the enclave.
The Abraham Accords, brokered by the United States in 2020, are landmark agreements for diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. These accords paved the way for formal ties, such as embassies and trade deals, underpinned by mutual interests in security, economic collaboration, and technology exchange. While celebrated as a diplomatic shift in the Middle East, the accords also sparked debate and resistance in Pakistan. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif have both affirmed that Pakistan will not join, asserting that any recognition of Israel would contradict its longstanding support for a two‑state solution and could only be considered if it served Pakistan’s national interest.
On July 3, a post from Siasat.pk on X shared a visual with the following quote attributed to Sanaullah: “Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran should make a joint decision regarding the Abraham Accords, Pakistan should align with Arab countries on the Abraham Accords.”
The post gained 15,000 views.
The same visual was also shared by former anchorpersons Imran Riaz and Sabir Shakir, both criticising it and racking up over 100,000 and 7,000 views, respectively.
It was reposted by a user, who, according to his X bio, is a journalist, with the caption: “Why have the ministers suddenly caught the fever of the Abraham Accords?”
It was shared on X by a user who is known for criticising PTI and, more recently, the PML-N.
The caption of the post questioned its authenticity, asking: “Did Rana sahib really make this statement, or is it just a stunt?”
The post was viewed by more than 29,000 users.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to keen public interest in the Abraham Accords and because many PML-N supporters were observed contesting the post.
Scanning the QR code in Siasat.pk’s post redirected to a July 2 X post by journalist Nadeem Malik, who had shared a 4:30-minute clip from his show ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, which featured Sanaullah as a guest.
The caption of his X post also attributed the same quote to the official as the post from Siasat.pk.
 






The transcript of the clip is provided below:
Nadeem Malik: “Rana Sahib, what is your opinion on the Abraham Accords? How should Pakistan move forward?”
Rana Sanaullah: “Look, the party or the government currently can’t have an opinion on the matter because this issue has not been presented or discussed at that level. As my two respected [fellow guests] have shared their personal opinion, I can share mine too. In my personal opinion … there has been a lot of bloodshed and injustice in Palestine. All Muslim countries and the world should establish peace there and the daily bloodshed must stop.
“For this purpose, if there is any kind of accord there, whether it is the Abraham [Accords] or any other kind of agreement between those forces and people directly involved there … and if it is acceptable to the group (Hamas) representing the Palestinians and the Arab countries sharing the border and then are agreed then I think Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and if Iran is included as well, these are major countries, there is Malaysia too, then they should make a joint decision and Pakistan should go with the Muslim world.
“If Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and Iran make a decision, and the Arab states directly impacted by this matter make a decision, then Pakistan should go along with it.”
Reviewing the clip makes it clear that Sanaullah said Pakistan should go along with what the majority of the Muslim world and its major regional players in the Middle East decide regarding the Abraham Accords.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that PM aide Rana Sanaullah said that Pakistan should follow the Arab position on the Abraham Accords is misleading.
The official said that Pakistan should follow the position of the Muslim world on the issue, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkiye, Malaysia and the Arab states directly impacted by the situation in the Middle East. To omit the names of the other countries or the mention of the Muslim world has the potential to misguide the public into thinking he said Pakistan should follow the Arab position on the matter, making it seem as if he was arguing for Pakistan’s subservience to its Arab allies.

Due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have triggered flash floods and landslides in various areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to the extreme weather.
Mansehra Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Amir Khadam told Dawn.com, “An eight-year-old boy, Ibrahim, drowned in the Jabba nullah due to a sudden surge in the water flow in a dried stream.”
He said the search for the drowned boy continued, and Rescue 1122 teams were making efforts for it.
Torghar Rescue 1122 spokesperson Atiqullah Afridi said, “A young man, Mohammad Zamin, drowned in the River Indus due to an increase in the water flow of the river.”
He said the rescue divers were in the field and struggling to retrieve the body of the man.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Assistant Director Imtiaz Ali said that floods hit multiple areas in the Diamer region and heavy flooding was reported in Ghushay nullah, Batogah nullah, and Khinar nallah, which washed away water supply schemes and other infrastructure. However, he added that the damage from the floods was being assessed.
He continued that the Karakoram Highway was blocked at five different locations after flash floods brought massive debris and mud between Gilgit and Chilas of GB, suspending the traffic on both sides of the crucial route.
The GBDMA official said that the heavy machinery was being engaged in the road clearance work, and work was underway.
He added that no human loss was reported from anywhere in the area due to flooding.
Zubair Ahmad Khan, GBDMA assistant director for Hunza in Nagar region, said that it was reported that the main road leading to Hopper valley had been blocked at Supultar Nullah due to a heavy flood, accompanied by mudflow and large boulders.
“The flood occurred intermittently throughout the afternoon,” he said, adding, “The debris flow had now nearly stopped; however, the water level is still high, making it impossible to commence road clearance operations at this stage.”
He further said that the tehsildar, naib tehsildar, and Communication and Works (C&W) Department sub-engineer are present on-site, and the GBDMA excavator is available at the location.
“Restoration and clearance work will start tomorrow morning, subject to further improvement in water conditions,” he added.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan ordered relevant departments to remain alert in view of flood situation, according to a statement by his office.
“Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all relevant departments including the GBDMA and district administrations to remain alert in view of the flood situation in different areas due to melting of glaciers and rise in river levels due to increase in heat intensity,” the statement read.
Deputy commissioners and relevant officers should take timely steps to prevent losses due to floods, Khan said, adding that departments should utilise all resources to initiate the timely rescue and rehabilitation process in any emergency situation.
On Sunday, six people were killed while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and KP, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) in both the provinces.
More than 22 people were killed and 11 others were injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.</p><small>2025-07-08 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0821284843611c9.jpg?r=212939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922858/govt-approves-four-potential-bidders-for-struggling-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves four potential bidders for struggling PIA</strong></a><br><p>The government said on Tuesday it had approved four parties, including business groups and a military-backed firm, to potentially bid for a stake in debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines.
The government has been seeking to sell a 51-100 per cent stake in the struggling national airline to raise funds and reform cash-draining, state-owned enterprises as envisaged under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.
It would be the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Among the bidding groups, one is a consortium of major industrial firms Lucky Cement, Hub Power Holdings, Kohat Cement and Metro Ventures.
Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.
Additionally, Fauji Fertiliser Company, a military-backed conglomerate, and Pakistani airline Airblue have been approved to bid for PIA.
“The pre-qualified parties will now proceed to the buy-side due diligence phase,” Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali said in a statement from his ministry.
The review process is set to last two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025, Ali previously told Reuters.
The privatisation ministry also said that the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved the transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel located in New York, including options for both outright sale and long-term lease.
From the Roosevelt Hotel, Pakistan is expecting over $100 million as a first payment during this year, Ali previously told Reuters.</p><small>2025-07-08 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0818455199135ac.png?r=205424' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922843/german-court-rules-at-risk-afghan-family-must-be-given-visas' target='_blank'><strong>German court rules at-risk Afghan family must be given visas</strong></a><br><p>A German court ruled on Tuesday that the government must issue visas to an Afghan family previously accepted under a programme for those at risk after the Taliban seized power in 2021.
The new government under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz has frozen the programme, but Berlin’s administrative court said the family had been given a “legally binding” commitment and must be allowed to travel to Germany.
About 2,500 Afghans with similar approvals are estimated to be in Pakistan waiting to be able to travel to Germany.
The programme was set up for those who worked with Germany’s army or other institutions in Afghanistan, as well as journalists and activists judged to be threatened by the Taliban.
However, the new government under Merz — who made a crackdown on immigration one of his key election pledges — has said in its coalition agreement it wants to end the programme “as far as possible”.
The family concerned by Tuesday’s decision is currently in Pakistan and had lodged an urgent appeal, telling the court they were about to be deported to Afghanistan where they would be in fear of their lives.
The family was given approval to come to Germany in 2023 under the programme.
They then applied to the German embassy in Islamabad for visas but these have not been issued.
The court said the government had the right “to decide whether and under what conditions the admission programme for Afghan nationals will be continued” and could “abstain from new approvals during this decision process”.
But “it cannot release itself” from approvals which have already been given, it said.
According to the last update given about the scheme given in April 2024, more than 33,000 Afghans have travelled to Germany under the programme.</p><small>2025-07-08 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08202543077f14f.jpg?r=202610' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922850/govt-approves-sugar-import-of-upto-500000-tonnes-to-maintain-affordable-prices' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves sugar import of upto 500,000 tonnes to maintain ‘affordable prices’</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Tuesday approved the import of half a million tonnes of sugar in a bid to maintain affordable prices of the commodity.
A day earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had emphasised the need for a coordinated policy approach to ensure market stability for essential commodities and food items.
He chaired a committee meeting today to assess the sugar situation in the country and evaluate import requirements.
“The committee approved the import of up to 500,000 metric tonnes of sugar to ensure a stable supply and maintain affordable prices nationwide,” said a statement posted on X.
Dar stressed the government’s commitment towards “price stability and safeguarding consumer interests”, the statement said.
The meeting was attended by the food minister, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, the secretary of the food ministry, senior officials from the Ministry of Industries and Production, and industry representatives.
 






The Ministry of National Food Security and Research said in a press release that the government would import sugar and all arrangements were complete, with immediate implementation being initiated.
“This step was taken to maintain balance in sugar prices. The approach to importing sugar represents a different and clearly better strategy than that of past governments. In the past, subsidies were often relied on to create an artificial shortage of sugar, burdening the national treasury. The current government decided to export sugar at a time when sugar was available in abundance,” the ministry said.
It added that sugar was now being imported to stabilise prices.
Last month, the Sugar Advisory Board approved the import of 500,000 tonnes of the commodity, amid concerns over supply chain disruptions and alleged non-compliance by millers.
In March, Dar said that retail sugar prices should not exceed Rs164 after the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) warned sugar mills against price manipulation. Dar said that according to news reports, there was a spike in sugar prices to Rs178 -179, which was “obviously not tolerable” to the prime minister.
The same month, the federal government had decided to import raw sugar to “stabilise prices” in the country.</p><small>2025-07-08 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0819213730a6ab5.jpg?r=195410' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922849/justice-dogar-3-others-take-oath-as-regular-high-court-cjs' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Dogar, 3 others take oath as regular high court CJs</strong></a><br><p>Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the three acting chief justices of the high courts took their oaths on Tuesday as the regular top judges.
The oath-taking ceremonies were held a day after President Asif Ali Zardari appointed them, based on the nominations by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
President Zardari administered the oath of office to Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, who has been serving in an acting capacity since February, during a ceremony held at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Islamabad.
The ceremony was attended by IHC judges, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, ministers, parliamentarians and the legal fraternity, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.

The development comes less than a month after the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, by a majority of 3-2, upheld the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts to the IHC and referred the matter of seniority determination to the president.
The matter of Justice Dogar and two other judges’ transfer to the IHC in February had sparked a controversy as he was made the senior puisne judge, paving the way for his appointment as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC.
Five IHC judges, who were petitioners in the SC case, and four former presidents of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association have challenged the apex court’s ruling.
Oath-takings in Sindh, KP, Balochistan
Meanwhile, the high courts in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also saw their chief justices taking oaths as regular top judges.
In separate ceremonies, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah took oath as the Peshawar High Court (PHC) chief justice, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech was sworn in as Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) top judge, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar took the helm of the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori administered the oath to Justice Ghaffar at a ceremony held at the Governor House in Karachi.
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, fellow SHC judges and members of the Karachi Bar Association and SHC Bar Association were present on the occasion as well.
 


After taking oath, Justice Ghaffar visited the Mazar-i-Quaid, where he laid a floral wreath. Responding to a reporter’s query there, he said the confusion of cases being heard by the regular bench or the constitutional bench would “settle down with time”.
Noting that it was the first time that cases had been categorised in such a manner after the 26th Amendment, Justice Ghaffar said whenever there was a confusion of jurisdiction, a larger bench was formed to decide it.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah assumed the responsibilities as the PHC chief justice in a permanent capacity as KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath to him.
He was serving as the PHC acting chief justice since February 14, following the elevation of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim to the SC.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam, and KP Assembly’s opposition leader Ibadullah Khan attended the ceremony.
KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Masood and other top officials were also present.
In a post on X, Kundi said he held a meeting with Justice Shah after the oath-taking to discuss the “vital role of the judiciary in ensuring justice, peace and stability”.
“I reiterated my full support for stronger collaboration between institutions to uphold the Constitution and address public grievances effectively,” the governor asserted.
 






In Quetta, Justice Barrech, who took the oath as BHC’s acting chief justice last month after the retirement of Justice Ejaz Ahmed Swati, was sworn in to continue that role.
Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Mandokhail administered the oath to Justice Barech at a ceremony held in the evening at the Governor House.
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, and former governor and retired Justice Amanullah Yasinzai were present on the occasion, along with senior lawyers.</p><small>2025-07-08 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08174453d69a35e.jpg?r=174514' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922839/29-schoolchildren-driver-injured-after-van-skids-off-road-in-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>29 schoolchildren, driver injured after van skids off road in AJK</strong></a><br><p>At least 29 schoolchildren and their driver were injured after a van plunged off a treacherous hilly road in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday, police said.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
The van, carrying boys and girls from the private Islamia Public School in Chikar, was returning students to their homes when it met with the accident near a spot known as Tambrial Mor, Jhelum Superintendent of Police (SP) Mirza Zahid Hussain told Dawn.com.
Chikar, a town and hill station in AJK’s Jhelum Valley district, is situated at an altitude of 5,272 feet above sea level and lies about 46 kilometres from Muzaffarabad, the state capital.
As a winter resort, Chikar’s educational institutions do not observe extended summer vacations, unlike other areas.
“It is assumed that after negotiating a bend, the vehicle went out of the driver’s control and fell down the road, causing injuries to almost everyone on board,” the SP said.
He said 16 people that were rushed to Chikar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital were later allowed to go home after treatment while of the 13 students hospitalised in Haitian Bala District Headquarters Hospital, two were kept there, and four others, including the driver, were referred to the Muzaffarabad Combined Military Hospital owing to their serious wounds.
“The rest of the school children were sent home,” he said.
A video clip shared by the SP showed the overturned van resting on a steep, forested slope, surrounded by local residents rushing to help.
“Had it not been for the tall trees that broke the fall, the van could have rolled further down the slope, resulting in heavier losses,” Hussain said.
Last week, six members of a family were killed in AJK’s Neelum valley when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the river, officials had said.
In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police lost their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.</p><small>2025-07-08 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08181615fa18bc2.jpg?r=181651' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922768/implementation-of-cms-orders-punjab-to-set-up-health-vigilance-squad' target='_blank'><strong>Implementation of CM’s orders: Punjab to set up health vigilance squad</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government has decided to set up ‘Chief Minister Health Vigilance Squad’ in the province, besides banning the use of mobile phones by nurses and paramedics.
Presiding over a meeting here on Monday, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also directed implementation of ‘Red & Blue Code Emergency System’ in the hospitals across the province. She ordered that doctors at the public hospitals should be trained in the use of the code system.
“The CM Health Vigilance Squad will visit the hospitals and review implementation of the directives of Ms Nawaz,” the meeting was told.
The chief minister also directed provision of ventilators for children and adults in every teaching and district headquarters hospital.
 






She reviewed the plan to deploy trained doctors in the districts in a phased manner, besides setting up catheterisation laboratories in the hospitals.

Nurses, paramedics barred from using mobile phones

She underscored the presence of consultants and heart surgeons in the district headquarters hospitals until the completion of ‘Cath Lab’ project.
Heart consultants and surgeons should visit the DHQ hospitals twice a week to provide services to the patients, she said, adding that appointment of consultants and surgeons in the DHQ hospitals should be ensured. She also sought a list of specialists required in the DHQ hospitals across Punjab.
She directed regular audits of outsourced services of cleaning and parking facilities in the teaching and district hospitals.
The CM said that protocols for administering injections should be displayed for student nurses in the hospitals, adding that trained and experienced nurses should be assigned duties in the emergency and paediatric wards.
She ordered that pager devices should be introduced for communication among the hospital staff, instead of using mobile phones for the purpose.
The meeting decided to ban the usage of mobile phones by nurses and paramedical staff on duty in the hospitals.
She directed the secretary of primary and secondary healthcare to conduct interviews for the appointment of CEOs and medical superintendents in each district of the province.
She directed the secretary to ensure the presence and functioning of the CT scan and MRI machines in all major hospitals in the districts, along with activation of CCTV cameras in the government hospitals.
She ordered establishment of trauma centres near the emergency wards, adding that availability of life-saving drugs for the patients should be ensured. The meeting also decided to implement life-saving protocols in every hospital as per international standards.

The federal government established the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, operating under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combatting cybercrime in Pakistan.
Sub-Inspector (SI) Waseem Khan of the NCCIA’s Cyber Crime Circle informed the Islamabad judicial magistrate on June 24 that under Section 37 (unlawful online content) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, the department was conducting an inquiry regarding 27 “Youtube channels who are involved in disseminating and propagating fake and misleading information against the state Institutions which is likely to cause fear, panic, disorder or unrest in the general public or society along with defamatory and fake remarks/information, which violates the privacy and harms the dignity of the officials of state institutions”.
Among the 27 channels are those of the PTI, journalists Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor; former anchors Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada .
He further said that the YouTube channels were “found involved in sharing highly intimidating, provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan” and were a “source of publicly disseminating/propagating false, misleading and fake information against the state institutions/officials”.
He said that through their channels, the suspects had “attempted to provoke the general public and armed forces personnel by trying to create a feeling of ill-will among pillars of the state”.
SI Khan had requested the court to issue a warrant/subpoena to Google to remove/block the 27 YouTube channels.
Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah’s June 24 order, available with Dawn.com, said he had heard the inquiry officer (IO) and examined the record on file.
“In the light of facts explained and evidence presented by the IO, this court is convinced that the subject matter constitutes offences punishable under the Peca and penal laws of Pakistan.”
He ordered the “head officer in charge of the security department/custodian of records” to Google block/remove the 27 YouTube channels.
Earlier today, Toor said he had received a notice from YouTube, informing him about the legal request received to remove his channel. “You may choose to act on the said content in terms of the aforesaid court order. If you fail to do so, as per our local law obligations, we may comply with the request without further notice to you,” the notice said.
 






Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested on March 20 in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.</p><small>2025-07-08 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081323329908189.jpg?r=132402' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922803/heavy-rain-expected-countrywide-over-next-two-days-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy rain expected countrywide over next two days: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued an alert for heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Balochistan, for the next two days.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP, and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to rain-related incidents in the past two days. An alert by the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) about a possible flood-like situation in various parts of the country has prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to be prepared to deal with potential emergencies.
In its latest weather update issued today, the Met Office said, “Monsoon rains continue to lash Pakistan, with further downpours expected in upper parts till July 10, 2025.
“Rain-wind/thundershower are expected today (July 8) in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, GB, northeastern and southern Balochistan and Islamabad.”
The Met Office added that “heavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region, and northeastern and southern Balochistan”.
 






“The public is urged to exercise caution and stay informed as rain continues in the coming days,” the weather agency advised.
The low-lying areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar are expected to be submerged due to heavy rainfall, it warned.
Islamabad and other areas will receive downpours with strong winds and thunderstorms, while Karachi and other areas of Sindh’s coastal belt could receive drizzling or light rainfall, it added.
The advisory warned against flooding in rainwater drains and local streams in Galliyat; Islamabad/Rawalpindi; Kashmir; KP’s Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi and Mardan districts; Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan and Murree; and Balochistan’s Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhail, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat districts.
It cautioned that heavy rainfall and downpours could cause landslides, leading to roadblocks and hurdles in traffic flow in the KP districts, Murree, Galliyat and Azad Kashmir.
In 24 hours since 8am yesterday, several cities recorded heavy to moderate rainfall across Pakistan.
In Punjab, Sheikhupura received 48mm of rainfall, Lahore 75mm, Islamabad 37mm (16mm in Saidpur, 12mm in Zero Point, 9mm in Golra), Gujranwala 6mm, Murree 5mm, Faisalabad 4mm, Sialkot 2mm, and 1mm each in Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad, along with traces of rainfall in Toba Tek Singh, Bahawalnagar and Kasur.
In KP, Balakot received the highest amount of rainfall (40mm), while Kakul ranked second with 31mm. Malam Jabba recorded 17mm; Bannu 8mm; Lower Dir 4mm; Cherat 2mm; Upper Dir, Bajaur and Ghalanai 1mm each; and traces of rain in Kalam and Peshawar.
In Sindh, Badin received 4mm of rainfall, Mithi 2mm, while Jacobabad, Larkana, Hyderabad and Karachi received traces. Balochistan’s Kalat recorded 17mm and Ziarat 12mm, with light rainfall in Lasbela.
In Azad Kashmir, Bandi Abbaspur received 7mm, Muzaffarabad 13mm (city area 7mm and airport 6mm), and Rawalakot and Kotli witnessed 1mm each.</p><small>2025-07-08 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08162106f042f17.jpg?r=165111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922833/pm-appoints-qatari-princess-as-brand-ambassador-after-she-scales-nanga-parbat' target='_blank'><strong>PM appoints Qatari princess as brand ambassador after she scales Nanga Parbat</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday appointed Qatari mountaineer and royal family member Sheikha Asma Al Thani as the brand ambassador for Pakistan’s mountains and tourism after she recently successfully summited Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth located in Gilgit-Baltistan region.
Known as the “Killer Mountain,” the 8,126-metre-high peak is considered one of the world’s most dangerous climbs due to its severe weather conditions and rough terrain.
In a post on X, the premier felicitated Sheikha Asma on the achievement.
 






“I am pleased to appoint Her Highness Sheikha Asma Al Thani as the Brand Ambassador for Pakistan’s mountains and tourism.
“My heartfelt felicitations to Her Highness on her recent feat of scaling Nanga Parbat. It is truly inspiring,” he wrote.
“Her achievement sends a powerful message of courage and determination, and stands as a testament to the enduring friendship between Pakistan and Qatar,” he added.
In a post on Instagram, Sheikha Asma described the relentless challenges she faced on her route to the summit and the emotional toll of the ascent.

“My ninth 8000er and one of the toughest climbs I’ve faced. This mountain tested me in ways I didn’t expect, from black ice beneath my feet to rockfall every few seconds. A constant reminder of how fragile life truly is,” she wrote.
“But even in that danger, there was growth. There was surrender and there was strength I didn’t know I still had. I climb not just to reach summits but to return to what matters, to strip away the noise and reconnect with myself,” she added.
“This mountain will stay with me forever.”

“When I reached home, I found my son in a bed with his body bearing marks of brutal torture, and he was dead,” the victim’s father stated in the FIR.

However, the video actually shows a woman confronting a scammer and was shared as far back as October 2024.
On July 4, an X user, who appeared to be anti-government based on his past posts, posted a video showing a woman hitting a man while a small crowd of people could be seen gathered around her.
The post was captioned: “Government of Punjab, Pakistan, The assistant commissioner got angry over allegedly setting up a roadside stall illegally. Is an assistant commissioner authorised to slap a citizen like this? Does any law allow such humiliation of a citizen?”

The video with the same claim was also shared here, here, here, here, here, here and here on X, and on TikTok here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the matter related to an alleged government official’s overreach of authority.
A keyword search for any news reports to corroborate the development did not yield any results.
A reverse image search yielded to a Facebook post by a page named “Viral Kashmir Bazar”, which featured a longer version of the same video.
The post, dated October 5, 2024, was captioned: “Money scam Zahid Mircha from Sopore has taken money from many innocent people. Please be aware of such individuals.”
Sopore is a city in the Baramulla district of India-occupied Kashmir.
In the video, a woman is seen hitting a man, accusing him of swindling 190,000 Indian rupees from her and her ailing brother. The person recording the video also claimed that the man had scammed several others.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows a woman Punjab assistant commissioner slapping a local for setting up an illegal roadside stall is false. The video was shared as far back as October 2024 and shows a woman hitting a scammer.

The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.
“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a dinner with Trump at the White House.

Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.
The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.
In 2024, he insisted that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.
In June, Pakistan had also decided to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after US mediation.
However, as the US joined Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats criticised the move. A resolution was also submitted in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.
A day earlier, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has delivered “wins for the American people” and referenced
Pakistan’s nomination following the US-brokered ceasefire.
 






During a press briefing, she said, “Pakistan nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention to prevent a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.”
 
 

Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.
He campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08155404a0b5719.jpg?r=160037' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922828/k-electric-reappoints-moonis-alvi-as-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>K-Electric reappoints Moonis Alvi as CEO</strong></a><br><p>The board of directors of K-Electric (KE) on Tuesday re-appointed Moonis Alvi as the chief executive officer (CEO), read a statement issued by the power company.
“The board of directors, in its meeting held on July 7, 2025, has re-appointed Syed Moonis Abdullah Alvi as Chief Executive Officer of K-Electric with effect from July 30, 2025,” read a press release by KE.
Alvi joined KE in 2008 and has held key roles in the organisation as the chief financial officer, company secretary and head of treasury prior to his appointment as CEO in 2018, KE said.
“He brings to the helm 30 years of diversified financial experience and has led the creation of a future-ready entity by emphasising digitisation, customer centricity and investments across the energy value chain,” the electricity distribution company said.
In 2020, Alvi and other senior officials of KE were booked after yet another unsuspecting citizen lost their life due to electrocution in Karachi.
The government also constituted a special committee to act as one-window operation for K-Electric and sought the removal of the top leadership of the power utility, including Alvi, over its alleged inability to ensure uninterrupted power supply and address disruptions within reasonable time after that year’s  monsoon rains.
Highly placed sources had said the government members on the K-Electric board of directors had pushed for the replacement of Alvi and the head of the distribution department with highly motivated professionals who could respond to difficult situations and ensure efficient service delivery. “The existing team did not take timely action,” an official said.
Last year in September, Alvi finally appeared before the Sindh Assembly’s Special Committee on loadshedding and excessive billing and categorically told the provincial government to get the company’s licence cancelled and supply electricity itself.
Informed sources had said that the KE CEO appeared to be an “opinionated person” and took an “aggressive stance” from the outset of the meeting, denying any prolonged loadshedding and excessive billing in Karachi.
In May, KE came under criticism for extended hours of power cuts in Karachi at a public hearing presided over by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) chairman Waseem Mukhtar.
Alvi had said that power cuts to areas with illegal connections and low recoveries did take place, but no more than three hours.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08152844e80fe36.jpg?r=154501' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922808/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-other-byc-activists-on-10-day-physical-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC sends Mahrang, other BYC activists on 10-day physical remand</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Tuesday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.
In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch, told Dawn.com that the BYC organiser and five other activists were presented before Judge Saadat Bazai, who approved the state prosecutor’s request for their 10-day physical remand.
The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch. Advocate Shoaib Baloch also appeared in the court as their lawyer.
 
 

The BYC members were presented in the court in “four different” first information reports (FIRs) after the last extension in their MPO detention expired, Israr added.
Advocate Jibran Nasir, who has served as Mahrang’s counsel in a case last month, shared with Dawn.com the FIR numbers provided by Mahrang’s family of the four cases.
According to a BHC judgment from May provided by Nasir, the FIRs included those registered at the Civil Lines police station on March 19 for storming the Civil Hospital and at Brewery police station on March 2 for blocking the Western Bypass Road in Quetta.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Referring to that, Nasir said in a post on Instagram: “After the state ran out of ways to exploit colonial MPO laws the liberty of the BYC leaders is now being infringed by exploiting the ATC and penal laws.”
“Expect long remands, delayed hearing of bail applications, likely dismissal of bail from ATC and when bail would finally be granted, expect another arrest and transfer to another district jail in another,” the renowned rights lawyer wrote.

BYC member Sammi Deen Baloch, in a post on X, called it a “matter of concern” that activists were being taken to court without evidence.
“Such actions not only cause the state to lose its credibility but also render its own legal and judicial system ineffective and meaningless,” she added.
 






While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.
Subsequently, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch appealed the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.
The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a “sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
The same month, the Kech chapter of the BYC launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club in protest of the leadership’s arrests.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08143048eeff7d3.png?r=143056' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922818/imran-bushra-move-ihc-for-early-hearing-of-plea-seeking-suspension-of-sentence-in-ps190m-graft-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra move IHC for early hearing of plea seeking suspension of sentence in £190m graft case</strong></a><br><p>Former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi on Tuesday filed an application in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for an early hearing of the plea for the suspension of their conviction in the £190m Al-Qadir Trust case, in which both of them face a 14-year and a seven-year prison term, respectively.
Imran and Bushra were convicted on January 17 in the case which alleges that the couple obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals from Bahria Town Ltd to legalise Rs50 billion identified and returned to the country by the United Kingdom during the previous PTI government.
On January 27, the couple moved IHC against the decision, asking the court to set aside their conviction, emphasising that the ruling lacked credible evidence and suffered from procedural lapses.
In an application filed on behalf of Imran, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, it was requested that an early hearing be fixed without any further delay, as it is a question of “liberty and freedom”.
It was stated that “an application for suspension of sentence was filed but has not been heard in accordance with the Judicial Policy and Court’s routine, depriving the applicant of his constitutional right to a speedy hearing”, referring to an earlier plea that was filed on behalf of Imran against the conviction in the case.
The appeal called the conviction of the jailed leader a result of “political victimisation”.
The appeal noted that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has “repeatedly sought adjournments in the hearings on the suspension “on the pretext of engaging special prosecutors in the instant matter.”
It stated that the petition filed earlier for the suspension of the conviction under Section 426 of the Pakistan Criminal Procedure Code — the hearings for which were held on May 15, May 27, June 5 and June 26 — gave assurances that an actual date for the suspension hearing will be decided but no specific date for adjudication has been given yet.
The plea further added that on the next hearing, the special prosecutor sought more time and assured the lead counsel of an early date, but no such decision has been made yet.
Stressing the urgency of matters, the statement said that there should be no “legal or procedural impediment in fixing the application for suspension” as it involves the fundamental right of liberty of a citizen under Article 9 of the constitution, which entails that no citizen can be tried without due legal process.
The counsel urged that the applicant is being denied his fundamental right under Article 4 of the Constitution — which ensures that every Pakistani citizen must be treated by the law — due to these delays.
It added that the applicant’s case has been deprioritised without any lawful justification, even though it is standard practice to hear bail matters and suspension applications on priority.
In a similar application, filed on behalf of Bushra Bibi,  who is serving a seven-year sentence in the same case, it was stated that the applicant, being a woman, has faced repeated prosecutions with “malicious intent”, citing her involvement in 13 different cases for which he has been acquitted.
They included the Iddat case — filed by her ex-husband, Khawar Fareed Maneka, who alleged that Imran and Bushra contracted marriage during the former first lady’s Iddat period.
 
 

The petition highlighted that the delays violate Article 4 of the Constitution, particularly in light of the applicant’s gender and the protective provisions of the law favouring women in bail matters.
Under Article 9 of the Constitution, the petition stated that, “as a woman, she is entitled to additional protections under Islamic jurisprudence and Pakistani law, which mandate leniency and priority in bail matters for female detainees.”
In December 2023, the National Accou­n­t­a­bility Bureau (NAB) had filed a corruption reference against Imran and seven others, including his wife, in connection with the Al-Qadir University Trust.
The reference filed by NAB alleged that Imran played a “pivotal role in the illicit transfer of funds meant for the state of Pakistan into an account designated for the payment of land by Bahria Town, Karachi”.
It also claimed that despite being given multiple opportunities to justify and provide information, the accused deliberately, with mala fide intention, refused to give information on one pretext or another.</p><small>2025-07-08 10:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081139202f42649.png?r=120945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922786/4-dead-two-injured-in-peshawar-house-fire-rescue-officials' target='_blank'><strong>4 dead, two injured in Peshawar house fire: rescue officials</strong></a><br><p>Four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazar on Tuesday morning, rescue officials said.
Spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement, “Six people were rescued from the fire in critical condition and taken to the hospital.
“However, four of them succumbed to their injuries. They have been identified as Rafiq, Shehnaz, Riaz and his wife.”
Faizi added that the firefighters and ambulances reached the site of the incident soon after receiving information and started rescue operations.
“The firefighters initially rescued three people trapped in a house adjacent to a market and transported them to the hospital for medical assistance,” Faizi detailed in the statement.
During the rescue efforts, two firefighters fainted due to the blazing flames. They were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital for treatment, where their condition became stable, he said.
Six fire vehicles and 40 personnel participated in the firefighting efforts, the rescue official continued.
“Firefighters faced extreme difficulty as the house was located in a congested area with narrow alleyways. After hectic efforts, the rescue official confirmed that the flames had been brought under control and the cooling process was underway.”
Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires and periodic industrial infernos.
In October 2024, a fire at a tissue paper factory in the Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.
The rescue team said the fire erupted as a huge quantity of polythene was stashed inside the factory, which melted due to the fire, and the blaze was difficult to douse.
 
 

In June 2024, a fire broke out in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.
The officials said the fire erupted at one of the makeshift structures before engulfing the adjacent shops, which mostly dealt in secondhand clothes, shoes and curtains, and a power transformer.
Rescue 1122 workers and firefighters from Peshawar, Nowshera, Khyber and Charsadda districts controlled the fire in six hours with around 80,000 litres of water and foam.
Around 110 personnel took part in the operation. Rescue officials said the wooden cabins caught fire due to strong winds and fire engulfed three markets before being brought under control.</p><small>2025-07-08 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08124311a07c750.png?r=124337' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922789/not-possible-for-govt-to-provide-housing-for-all-residents-of-dilapidated-buildings-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>Not possible for govt to provide housing for all residents of dilapidated buildings: Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly building collapse in Karachi’s congested Lyari neighbourhood that left 27 people dead, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
Speaking to GeoNews, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in “extremely dangerous” condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.
“Orders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents’ safety,” Memon said.
“However, it won’t be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,” the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.
“Nonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,” he added.
“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].”
Memon’s comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.
According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.
Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have condemned the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence” that led to the disaster.
They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.
Previous deadly building collapses
In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.</p><small>2025-07-08 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08100107d93b7bf.png?r=105405' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922778/analysts-say-musks-party-may-be-threat-to-trump-even-without-wins' target='_blank'><strong>Analysts say Musk’s party may be threat to Trump even without wins</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has shrugged off Elon Musk’s plans for a new political party as “ridiculous” — but the announcement underscored the threat the disaffected former ally poses to US Republicans defending paper-thin congressional majorities.
Musk’s weekend launch of the “America Party” came in the wake of Trump signing into law a sprawling domestic policy bill that the tech mogul has slammed overestimates that it will balloon the deficit.
Musk has been light on policy detail but is expected to target a handful of House and Senate seats in next year’s midterm elections, where the sitting Republican voted for Trump’s bill after preaching fiscal responsibility.
“Elon Musk’s America Party is a wild card that could upend the midterms in 2026, particularly for Republicans,” said political analyst Matt Shoemaker, a former Republican congressional candidate and an ex-intelligence officer.
“With bare majorities in Congress, the Republicans should be worried.”
Musk, the world’s richest person, had teased the idea of a new party for weeks, running an informal social media poll in June that showed 80 per cent support among 5.6 million respondents.
 






Unlike previous third parties, his would have almost limitless resources, and a talisman with a large constituency of young American men who see him as a maverick genius and a superstar.
“Musk’s brand appeals to disaffected independents and younger, tech-savvy voters who might otherwise break for Republicans in swing districts,” Shoemaker told AFP.
‘Balance of power’
With a personal wealth estimated at $405 billion, Musk has already demonstrated that he is willing to spend big on politics, lavishing $277m on Trump’s 2024 campaign.
Yet a more recent foray into Wisconsin politics — he spent $20m only to see his candidate for the state supreme court lose handily — has underlined the limits of wealth and celebrity in politics.
And then there is the political difficulty of building support in the American heartland, among voters who are not part of Musk’s Silicon Valley “tech bro” bubble.
Time magazine’s 2021 Person of the Year was once liked by a broad cross-section of Americans, but he saw his numbers plunge after joining the Trump administration as the president’s costcutter-in-chief.
Musk’s net favourability in the most recent rating published by Nate Silver, one of the most respected US pollsters, is underwater at -18.1, compared with a slightly less subaquatic -6.6 for Trump7.
“While you don’t want to paint with too broad a brush, the Republican base and MAGA movement are fairly inseparable in today’s political climate,” said Flavio Hickel, associate professor of political science at Washington College in Maryland.
“And their support for Trump has been unwavering despite recent controversies. It’s hard to imagine any political project associated with Musk syphoning off votes from individuals who approve of Donald Trump.”
‘Fizzled out’
While multiple Republicans and Democrats have switched to independent, wins for third parties have been rare in modern US history.
The Conservative Party of New York State in the 1970s and the Farmer-Labor Party in the 1930s are the only minor parties to win Senate seats in the last century.
Smaller parties saw more success in the House in the early 20th century but have only won one seat since the 1950s.
AFP spoke to multiple analysts who pointed to the many hurdles thrown in front of third-party candidates trying to get onto the ballot in a system designed to favour the status quo.
These include minimum signature requirements, filing fees and other onerous state-specific regulations on age, residency and citizenship.
“Remember in early 2024 the so-called ‘No Labels’ party that was going to chart a middle course for the 2024 elections?” said veteran political strategist Matt Klink.
“They fizzled out in epic fashion.”
Analysts agree that winning seats in Congress may be a stretch, but say Musk can inflict pain on Trump by syphoning votes from vulnerable sitting Republicans or throwing cash at primary opponents of the president’s preferred candidates.
“Elon’s party won’t win seats, but it could cost Republicans plenty,” said Evan Nierman, the founder and CEO of global crisis PR firm Red Banyan.
“In tight districts, even a few points syphoned off from the right could flip control.”</p><small>2025-07-08 05:32</small></div><hr>
