“Twenty people have been received at EMERGENCY’s Surgical Centre in Kabul following an explosion this afternoon in the Shahr-i-Naw area, near the hospital. Among those received were seven people dead on arrival,” the NGO said in a statement.
Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran told AFP that the “explosion occurred in a hotel on Gulfaroshi Street in Shahr-i-Naw”.
He did not share any information about the cause of the explosion.
China’s state news agency Xinhua, citing a hotel employee, reported that two Chinese citizens were seriously wounded in the incident. The agency also reported the death of an Afghan security guard.
No group has claimed responsibility for the blast.
The Shahr-i-Naw area is home to foreigners and is considered one of the most secure areas in Kabul. It also houses large office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies.</p><small>2026-01-19 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191632251220d5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967858/in-pictures-rescuers-comb-through-wreckage-of-karachis-gul-plaza-following-deadly-fire' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Rescuers comb through wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza following deadly fire</strong></a><br><p>Rescue workers on Monday combed through the rubble and debris of Karachi’s Gul Plaza in the aftermath of a deadly fire over the weekend.
The fire started late on Saturday at Gul Plaza, which houses 1,200 shops in a multi-storey complex. The blaze in Karachi’s historic centre raged for more than 24 hours before it was mostly extinguished.
Videos showed flames ripping through the building as firefighters laboured through the night to put out the blaze. On Monday, they began cooling the structure and clearing twisted metal and debris strewn across the street, along with fallen air-conditioning units and shop signboards.

Trump made the remarks in a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, which was published on Monday and whose authenticity was confirmed to AFP by Støre’s office.
A copy of the text of the letter was posted by the foreign affairs and defence correspondent for PBS News, Nick Schifrin, on social media platform X, who said he had obtained it from multiple officials. Schifrin added that the letter had been forwarded to “multiple European ambassadors in Washington”.
“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped eight Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump said in the letter.
“Although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”







As Bloomberg pointed out, the Nobel Peace Prize is not decided by the Norwegian government but rather awarded by an independent committee.
“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway?” the US president added.
“There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.”
Trump also called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) to “do something for the United States”, saying, “I have done more for Nato than any other person since its founding”.
“The world is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!”
Trump has put the transatlantic alliance to the test with threats to take over Greenland “one way or the other”, with European countries closing ranks against Washington’s designs on the vast Danish territory.
German and French leaders denounced as “blackmail” weekend threats by Trump to wield new tariffs against countries which oppose his plans for the Arctic island, and said on Monday that Europe was preparing trade countermeasures.
The European Union said it was holding an emergency summit on Thursday to weigh its response, and that while its priority is to “engage, not escalate”, it is ready to act if needed.
Greenland, for its part, said the tariffs threat does not change its desire to assert its own sovereignty.
“We will not be pressured,” Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post, adding that the autonomous territory “is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions”.
Støre said the statement had been received in response to a message from him and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, where they had “conveyed our opposition” to Trump’s tariff threats.
Bloomberg quoted Støre as saying: “Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, I have several times clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize.”
A request for comment sent to the White House was not immediately returned, the outlet added.
Last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado had given her own medal to Trump in recognition of what she called his commitment to the freedom of the Venezuelan people. However, the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked even if the medal is given away.







Russia, China threat?
Trump has repeatedly said his country needs vast, mineral-rich Greenland for “national security”, despite the US already having a base on the island and security agreements with fellow Nato ally Denmark.
“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,” Trump said in his message to the Norwegian premier, doubling down on that sentiment in a post to Truth Social on Monday.
Denmark’s defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said on Monday that steps had already been taken along with Nato allies to “increase military presence and training activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic”.
Lund Poulsen added that he and Greenlandic foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt would be meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte later on Monday.
‘Blackmail’
This weekend, Trump said that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would be subject to a 10-per cent tariff on all goods sent to the US — a duty which could go higher.
Germany’s vice chancellor Lars Klingbeil slammed the move as blackmail and said on Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures.
French finance minister Roland Lescure, speaking at a press conference alongside Kingbeil, agreed.
“Blackmail between allies of 250 years, blackmail between friends, is obviously unacceptable,” Lecurse said.
Klingbeil said Europe’s response could have three main strands.
First, the current tariff deal with the US would be put on hold, he said.
Second, European tariffs on imports from the US, currently suspended until early February, could come into force.
And thirdly, the EU should consider using its toolbox of instruments against “economic blackmail”, he added.



Europe’s stock markets fell as the week’s trading began on Monday, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warning that a “trade war is in no one’s interest”.
Greenland — whose tiny population of 57,000 has voiced disquiet at Trump’s threats — continued to make its preferences clear on Monday.
Greenland’s dogsled federation (KNQK) said that the new US special envoy to the Arctic island had been disinvited to its annual race.
Jeff Landry had been invited to attend the race by a private Greenlandic tour operator, an invitation the KNQK federation has previously called “totally inappropriate”.</p><small>2026-01-19 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19184604433213f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967821/gul-plaza-inferno-death-toll-rises-to-21-sindh-cm-announces-rs10m-compensation-for-victims-families' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza inferno death toll rises to 21; Sindh CM announces Rs10m compensation for victims’ families</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: As the death toll from the Gul Plaza blaze rose to at least 21 on Monday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah noted dozens were still reported missing and announced Rs10 million in compensation for the victims’ families.
While the fire at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
In separate statements issued shortly after 4pm, Edhi and Rescue 1122 said the death toll from the incident had risen to 21 as more bodies were recovered from the now-gutted shopping plaza. The bodies were being taken to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), the rescue services said.



In a statement, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal said that while “more than 20 bodies have been recovered, the final number of dead cannot be stated at the moment”.
“Some bodies have been recovered in the form of body parts from various locations,” he said.
“Until it is determined through a technical and forensic verification whether these parts are of the same person or different people, confirming the correct number [of deaths] is difficult.”
Meanwhile, addressing a press conference with representatives of the business community, Sindh CM Murad announced Rs10 million in compensation for each deceased person’s family.
“There can be no price tag for a person’s life. Their grief cannot be compensated in any way, but we are announcing Rs10m from the government for each person who lost their life,” the Sindh CM said, adding that the process would begin tomorrow.







“Unfortunately, there has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident,” he said. While he refrained from giving a specific number, he said that it could possible be 80.
“We are all sorrowful. We all share their grief,” the chief minister said, referring to the bereaved families.
Search operation underway
In his statement, the Rescue 1122 COO said an “integrated, organised and fully technical” search and rescue operation was under way.
Dr Jalal noted that Urban Search and Rescue Units, along with disaster response vehicles, were carrying out the operations under an “approved structural safety protocol”.
“At the site of the incident, three simultaneous search operations are under way at five different locations pointed at,” the statement said.
It noted that a special team was “continuously engaged in firefighting and cooling processes” so that the rescue operation could be conducted safely.
The Rescue 1122 officer further said “heavy resources” were being utilised to remove the rubble in a controlled manner and create access to the charred building.
Dr Jalal observed that the mall’s structure has been “affected to a great degree” and is currently unstable. “There is a risk of collapse at any time,” he cautioned.
“The [search] operation is being carried out in a staged and restricted manner, with extreme skill,” the official stressed.
Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, told Dawn in the late afternoon that although the fire has been controlled, smoke was still emanating as it was a “deep-seated fire”.
He noted that for the last 48 hours, their rescue teams were engaged in firefighting and rescue operations.
Shortly after 12pm, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said they had managed to control the flames by up to 95pc, and the cooling phase had been initiated.
“The cause of the fire is still unknown,” he noted. Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit sparked the blaze.

 


“Samples of eight family members [have been] collected for DNA matching,” South DIG Syed Asad Raza said.
“Fire safety operation has been completed. Cooling process has now started with the removal of debris from the site by KMC, TMC and Pakistan Navy personnel,” the police officer added.
According to DIG Raza, the shopping plaza had a total of 16 gates — 13 on the ground floor and three in the basement — out of which only two gates were open on the ground, while one exit was open in the basement.
Earlier in the day, Fire Officer Zafar Khan said that flames were “still present in the inner market”.
“The building’s front and back façades have collapsed, and there are many cracks on the inside as well. So it is extremely dangerous,” Zafar said, adding that rescue teams were conducting “short-term operations” at some spots where they suspected bodies were present.
Rescue 1122’s COO Jalal said that firefighting efforts restarted from the Rimpa Plaza side, as flames emerged from the smouldering debris.



Inquiry committee set up
While addressing the media, CM Murad announced that an inquiry committee was being set up to probe the incident, headed by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi.
He asserted that the inquiry’s aim was not to point blame but to acknowledge and correct one’s mistakes.
However, he added, “If there is any evidence of sabotage, then obviously action will be taken [although] there is no such thing as of now.”
Detailing the ongoing rescue operations, the Sindh CM said rescue personnel had carved out “three ways” to enter the building.
He said 40 per cent of the mall’s building had collapsed, adding that the rest of it was also in a poor state. “Perhaps, we might need to demolish the entire building,” he feared.



CM Murad also expressed the Sindh government’s desire to rehabilitate the affected businesses and make them functional again.
Recalling his meeting with the business community earlier in the day, he said they discussed the short-term and long-term plan of action.
The chief minister recalled the fire incidents at Bolton Market in 2009 — where the federal government’s aid was also sought — and at Timber Market in 2014, where traders were compensated.
In the long-term, CM Murad said, local disaster management authorities will be strengthened and equipped better.
He went on to identify one of the problems, saying that the rescue authorities were not able to “perform their duties freely” and requesting “everyone not to provide their expertise”.
“All of us sitting in this room were involved in that hindrance,” the chief minister said, adding that officials could have inefficiencies.
Responding to a question, he said, “There was a [shortage] of water and there were some difficulties […] I do not want to elaborate [but] the difficulties were that people had blocked the routes, which I also hold myself accountable for.”
Stressing that the authorities were trying to account for the missing, CM Murad said, “I request each institution that considers it has the expertise to help us, to support us.”
Taking note of suggestions to seek external help, the chief minister said, “One does not need to call at such occasions. [They] need to come forward on their own.”
CM Murad vows to rehabilitate affected traders
During his press conference, CM Murad detailed that a separate committee had been formed to assess traders’ losses and make recommendations regarding businesses’ rehabilitation.
The committee includes Zubair Motiwala, Jawed Bilwani, Idress Memon, Junaid Makda and Rehan Hanif.
The chief minister said it was decided to allocate a space temporarily to the affected businesses.
The Sindh CM said shopkeepers’ associations will be asked to install fire alarms, stressing that the first “one to two hours” after a fire occurs were crucial.
Prior to the press conference, CM Murad had held a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community where he vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses.
“We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
“The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire can be known,” CM Murad said, adding that the chief secretary would notify the fact-finding committee.
Highlighting that President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were repeatedly contacting him about the incident, the chief minister said, “The PPP leadership wants the traders of Gul Plaza to be rehabilitated urgently.”
Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the restoration efforts would be undertaken with the advice of the traders.
Commissioner Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated.
He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations.
CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes.
He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy.
Scores missing
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
Gul Plaza Traders Association President Tanveer Pasta said over 40 shopkeepers and salespersons were among those missing in the wake of the incident.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, told the media that “more than 70 people” remained missing. DIG Raza stated the same figure.

“The reports of more than 70 missing persons are extremely alarming and constitute a major tragedy,” said the governor, adding that the incident has now “turned into a national tragedy”.
“Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said.
He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire is necessary, the priority for now is to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders.
Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated.
“My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor.
“His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards.
“Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters.



Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday.
“We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added.
The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.”
Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days.
Traffic police announce alternate routes
In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza.
The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.
Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road.







‘Heartbroken’
United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza.
“May strength be with the community at this time,” she said.







The Turkish Embassy in Islamabad said it was “deeply saddened”.
“The Turkish Embassy stands in solidarity with friendly and brotherly people of Pakistan in this difficult time,” it said, conveying condolences to the bereaved families.







The Russian Embassy also expressed its “heartfelt condolences and profound sorrow” over the fire incident, as well as the recent Sargodha and Ormara traffic accidents.







The German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.”







The French embassy in Pakistan expressed “profound sorrow over the loss of many lives in the devastating fire”.
“We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and stand with the people of Pakistan in this moment of grief,” the embassy said on X.







‘Delayed response’
The terrifying fire that erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but the delayed response and limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours.
Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.

Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.
A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.

She made the remarks in the Senate after Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Senator Khalida Ateeb called the House’s attention to the incident, lambasting the Sindh government for its negligence.
Calling the incident “heartbreaking”, Rehman said that there could be no compensation for all of the lives lost in the incident.
She asserted that the entire Sindh government was active and dealing with the situation. However, she conceded that the fire brigade took time to reach the site after the fire broke out as there was a large crowd gathered at the scene.
She added that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had announced Rs10m as compensation for the affected families.
“Shutting down private enterprise is harmful since this is such a big plaza. But fire safety is necessary for a city like Karachi and one should ask the administration of Gul Plaza about how it happened since they run the market,” she added.
“I am not giving excuses; it was a huge lesson for all of us. It was a tragedy for the whole of Pakistan, not only for Karachi or Sindh,” she said.
“It was a big and tragic incident but there is no need for pointing fingers or engaging in politics,” she stated.
“If there is any aid or assistance that they (the MQM) can extend to us, then I urge them to do that but sadly, it will be politicised,” Senator Rehman added. “Our doors are open for both relief and criticism.”
MQM senator assails Sindh govt
In her remarks, Ateeb took aim at the Sindh government and highlighted that there were no safety or emergency measures at Gul Plaza.
“The whole building collapsed and there was no emergency exit,” she highlighted. “Whose responsibility is this? If people are saying the fire brigade turned up too late, then how did the building authority allow 1,200 shops in a space which only allows for 500?”
“Permission is granted to build the mall but all the things needed for such a building need to be considered,” she emphasised.
“Windows were shut because of air conditioners and were either blocked by items or had grills so people were unable to escape,” she added.
Senator Ateeb stated that the government was responsible for failing to ensure safety measures.
“The government says they will compensate the victims’ families for the damages, but there is no compensation for the lives lost,” she said.
“The people of Karachi are drowning in sorrow right now, yet we are here passing bills and giving speeches on different subjects. This needs to be our priority: the city which gives nearly 70 per cent in taxes to the Centre,” she said.
‘It’s incompetence, but pointing fingers alone will not help’
Speaking right after Rehman, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar agreed with her that the incident should not be politicised. But, he also highlighted that the incident “exposes corruption”.
“Corruption has its price,” he said, recalling that the Supreme Court had also ordered an investigation into authorities related to buildings’ construction in Karachi.
“What’s happening — in Karachi and across the country — is that building bylaws are only on paper,” he remarked.
Zafar said that because of corruption, building maps not meeting legal requirements and lacking features such as fire exits were being approved. “And once the building is constructed, there is no supervision of it, which is also because of corruption.
“This happened in Karachi, Lahore and other cities.”
He added that after incidents such as the Gul Plaza blaze, opposition members would usually hurl criticism and those from the government would defend themselves. “Chief ministers arrive at the site of the incident and express condolences. And compensations are paid from the treasury.
“But this does not solve the problem.”
Zafar urged that the implementation and enforcement of building bylaws, as well as penalties for their violations, be discussed in the upper House of Parliament.
“These are two major issues that we need to address,” he said, further highlighting the need for suggestions to prevent incidents like the Gul Plaza inferno.
“Our MQM senator made a good point, but let’s also give suggestions on how to stop this.”
Terming the Gul Plaza blaze an example of “incompetence” of the Sindh government, he stressed that “pointing fingers alone will not help. The issue will only be resolved once we address this issue.”
‘Extremely tragic’
PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi said the incident was “extremely tragic, disheartening, and saddening”, adding that there were more shops at the mall than had been approved, with “nearly 250 having been illegally set up”.
“The problem is that the building was constructed in the 1990s and only 900 shops had been approved, but approximately another 250 were built illegally,” he claimed.
The senator also noted that the building’s completion certificate was issued around 2003-04 by then-Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim.

Achakzai — who is on a four-day visit to Sindh along with a delegation of opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to mobilise the masses for a nationwide strike and protest rallies scheduled for February 8 — expressed these views while addressing lawyers at the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi.
Apart from him, other TTAP leaders, including Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PTI’s Asad Qaiser, also spoke at the seminar titled “Protecting the Basic Structure of the Constitution of Pakistan”.
“Let’s make Pakistan a democratic country, a country where people have the power, and there is rule of law and the Constitution,” said Achakzai, adding that democracy had not been allowed to flourish in the country.
“The country is ailing like a cancer patient.”
“Let’s comply with the social contract with the people. Injustice breeds disharmony among people. We want the formation of a new Pakistan, where there is no cruelty.”
He also said, “We are a group of decent people,” and that the line of respect should not be crossed in politics. Moreover, he stressed that small provinces had also rendered sacrifices in the freedom movement for Pakistan.
“We are not here to fight people […] Countries are not run at gunpoint,” Achakzai further stated, adding that people of all races and languages should be treated equally. “Our country is facing difficulties because of rogue and arbitrary behaviours. [But] we don’t want a civil war,” he said.
The opposition leader also mentioned that there was no accountability for the expenditure of funds received through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan.
Speaking about the inferno at Karachi’s Gul Plaza shopping mall, he asked why the building did not have emergency exits. “The matter should be investigated and those responsible should be punished.”
Achakzai also asserted that the PTI founder had won the 2024 general election and “blocking his way [to Parliament] is constitutionally and religiously wrong”.
Saying that the “spirit of freedom his being crushed among the youth”, he urged people to stand up “against cruelty”.
Moreover, he said the TTAP protesters would not resort to violence on February 8 and urged the people of Sindh to take to the streets.
“We have come out to save the country, come join us,” he said, concluding his speech.
Before him, TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also addressed the seminar, saying that presently, the Constitution in the country was “controversial”.
He criticised the incumbent government, maintaining that people were losing confidence in the rulers, and the public was facing oppression.
“The entire system is being employed for unlawful acts,” he further alleged.
The senator also mentioned Form 47 — an allusion to the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections — saying that “some people had been given a fake mandate”.
He further lamented the “weakening of the three pillars of the country”. While he did not specify the “three pillars”, this ostensibly was a reference to the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
Abbas said February 8 was a very important day, “when we will show the government the power of the people”.
He also highlighted the importance of Pakistan’s location and called it the “heart of Asia”. The senator claimed that “global powers have always tried to keep [Pakistan] under their control”.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “The way this country is being run, that makes progress impossible.”
He also alleged that presently, there was government interference in lawyers’ bodies, claiming that efforts were being made to “weaken the voice of lawyers”.
Qaiser regretted that the “executive has become an authority over the judiciary”, adding that the trust of people in the judiciary was eroding.
“What option are people left with then?” he questioned.
The PTI leader also lamented the “unfair distribution of resources” in the country, adding that the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan was “chaotic”.
He further said the 1973 Constitution had been discarded, adding that “if you want to commit a robbery, why even let [people] vote?”
Qaiser said the TTAP would need everyone’s support for the February 8 protest, the purpose of which was to “restore the judiciary and establish the Constitution’s supremacy”.</p><small>2026-01-19 13:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19180003d59050c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967863/gul-plaza-sbca-and-the-human-cost-of-bad-governance' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza, SBCA, and the human cost of bad governance</strong></a><br><p>The devastating fire at Gul Plaza, a landmark shopping centre on Karachi’s MA Jinnah Road, is not merely an accident or an unfortunate lapse in safety compliance. It is a grim reminder that poor governance kills.
As rescue operations continue and the death toll rises in the aftermath, what is already evident is that this tragedy was foreseeable, preventable, and rooted in institutional failure rather than fate.
Gul Plaza was an old, densely packed commercial building with hundreds of shops spread across its basement and upper floors, with inadequate emergency exits and fire safety systems. Despite its prominence and heavy daily footfall, reports indicate that the building lacked critical emergency exits and fire-venting infrastructure — features that should have been enforced long ago by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). Ensuring compliance with these standards is not optional; it is the statutory responsibility of the authority charged with public safety.

 

The question is not whether a short circuit or another trigger caused the fire; it is why a structure with known safety deficiencies was allowed to operate for decades. The answer lies in institutional decay and bad governance.
Systemic rot
To be fair to individual officers, the SBCA itself has been rendered structurally weak. Over the last several years, the post of director-general (DG) appears to have been treated as a portable office rather than a strategic leadership position. Multiple DGs have been rotated and replaced in rapid succession, without explanation and with tenures too short to allow meaningful enforcement. When leadership is unstable, accountability collapses. When enforcement depends on personal courage rather than institutional backing, violations become routine.
This pattern reflects a deeper and more troubling reality: appointments and transfers at the SBCA appear to be driven less by considerations of competence, integrity, and public safety and more by pliability to vested interests. Officials who are perceived to attempt to enforce rules, resist illegal conversions, or block unsafe constructions are often seen to be sidelined; those who accommodate vested interests are seen to be rewarded. This is not governance; it is the deliberate hollowing out of regulatory institutions.
In earlier writings, I have argued that bad governance promotes corruption and corruption can kill as surely as bombs and militancy. Corruption is not just about bribery; it is about the systematic erosion of norms and safeguards that protect citizens. When building safety codes are ignored with impunity, when regulators are neutralised by political interference, and when accountability is treated as an inconvenience, the results can be catastrophic. In that sense, corruption kills not only through direct theft but by tearing the safety net that holds society together.

 

This form of institutional sabotage is far more insidious than isolated corruption because it becomes normalised. Over time, citizens come to expect that regulations exist only on paper, that enforcement is negotiable, and that compliance is secondary to convenience. Buildings become death traps not because the rules are unclear, but because enforcement has been deliberately neutralised.
The rot runs deep
The problem is not confined to Karachi. In medium-sized cities such as Hyderabad and Sukkur, and in smaller towns like Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas, and Dadu, master plans are routinely seen to be ignored, residential areas reportedly converted into commercial hubs, and low-rise plots somehow become multi-storey buildings in violation of regulations. Whenever a conscientious officer is seen to enforce planning laws or court-approved master plans, it seemingly results in their swift transfer.
This brings us to the question of accountability. Policymakers who sanction frequent, unexplained transfers of regulatory heads must be held responsible for the consequences of their decisions. When leadership instability becomes systemic, it is no longer an administrative matter; it is a policy choice. And when that choice leads to loss of life, accountability cannot stop at lower-level officials or building owners.
In countries that take governance seriously, such failures trigger criminal inquiries reaching the highest levels of decision-making. In Pakistan, prime ministers have been removed for alleged legal violations. Why, then, is it unthinkable to hold chief secretaries, ministers, or heads of regulatory bodies meaningfully accountable when repeated governance failures result in deaths? Courts have taken suo motu notice of far less consequential matters. Will they now intervene where human lives have been lost?
The case for accountability
Governance is a trust delegated by voters and taxpayers. In an age defined by technology, global competition, and data-driven decision-making, citizens have every right to demand competence, integrity, and continuity in public institutions. Development projects may still be launched and ribbon-cuttings may continue, but at what cost?

 

Putting unqualified or seemingly compromised individuals in charge of complex regulatory systems is like entrusting a multi-billion-rupee project to someone chosen for obedience rather than expertise. Something may be built, but it will not be safe, sustainable, or worthy of public trust.
The fire at Gul Plaza should mark a turning point. Bad governance is not a soft concept — it is a profound threat to life and dignity. Institutional decay weakens national resilience just as surely as any external threat. In another previous newspaper article, I had argued that those who destroy institutions from within, who prioritise pliability over professionalism, and who treat regulatory enforcement as negotiable are not merely negligent; they are intentionally undermining the foundations of the state.
If this tragedy does not prompt serious accountability and structural reform, it will not be the last. And the next fire, collapse, or disaster will again be described as an accident — until we finally accept that bad governance at the highest policymaking levels is the real culprit.

Maneka had filed the plea on January 16, seeking meetings with her mother, who is the wife of jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
The court registrar’s office had, however, objected to the maintainability of the plea, asking Maneka to approach the LHC’s Rawalpindi bench instead.
During Monday’s hearing, Justice Farooq Haider sustained the registrar office’s objection pertaining to territorial jurisdiction, observing that the plea was not maintainable before the LHC’s principal seat.
Maneka’s counsel then withdrew the petition, following which Justice Haider disposed of the plea.
The petition, filed through Lahore High Court Bar Association President Malik Asif Nissoana, listed the inspector general of prisons, the superintendent of Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, and others as respondents.
It said the Adiala jail administration had barred Maneka from meeting her imprisoned mother without providing any written reason to the petitioner.
Despite Maneka being a blood relative of Bushra Bibi and Tuesday being the designated day for meetings, permission had not been granted to the petitioner to visit her jailed mother, the petition said.
It further stated that Maneka was deeply concerned about her mother’s physical, emotional and psychological well-being and argued that jail authorities’ actions amounted to “mala fide intent” and “misuse of authority”.
The petitioner requested the court to issue directives to the respondents for an immediate meeting with her mother.
Bushra Bibi is currently serving a seven-year sentence in the £190 million corruption case. She was also recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana-II case, which contains charges of purchasing an expensive jewellery set gifted to the former prime minister Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-19 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191720457d5b729.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967857/trump-to-charge-1bn-for-permanent-spot-on-board-of-peace-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to charge $1bn for permanent spot on ‘Board of Peace’: reports</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his “Board of Peace” aimed at resolving conflicts, according to US media reports.
The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban and Canada’s Mark Carney.
Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the sum.
“Each member state shall serve a term of no more than three years from this charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman,” stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media.
“The three-year membership term shall not apply to member states that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.”
The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second “executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role.
“The Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” the charter says.
‘Failed institutions’
The document was sent to dozens of world leaders who were invited to join the board, The Times of Israel reported.
It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.
Trump has regularly criticised the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organisations and treaties — roughly half affiliated with the UN.
Membership of the board would be “limited to states invited to participate by the chairman”, according to the full draft charter published by the Times of Israel.
Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-thirds of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman.
The “Board of Peace” began to take shape on Saturday as the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, Argentina and Canada were asked to join.
Trump also named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff as members.
Israel has objected to the line-up of a “Gaza executive board” to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.
Putin invited to join ‘Board of Peace’: Kremlin
Separately, Russia said it was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington, without adding if the Kremlin chief was inclined to join.
Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told AFP in an interview that Putin “also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace”.
Moscow for years tried to balance relations with all major players in the Middle East — including Israel and the Palestinians.
But since the conflict in Gaza and Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Putin has moved away from Israel, boosting ties with its foes like Iran.
Moscow has also sought closer relationships with the Gulf states amid growing Western isolation.
The White House has reached out to various figures around the world, including Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to sit on the so-called “Board of Peace”, chaired by the US president himself.

Putin has previously praised Trump’s efforts to resolve conflicts.
“He’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises, which have lasted for years, even decades,” Putin said last October.
Referring to the situation in the Middle East, Putin said: “If we succeed in achieving everything Donald has strived for, it will be a historic event.”
The assault on Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza have strained Moscow’s traditionally good relations with Israel, home to a large Russian-born community.
The Kremlin has repeatedly criticised Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks and called for restraint.
“The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe in the full sense of the word,” Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency RIA Novosti at a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas last May.
“Russia, as a friend of the Palestinian people, is trying to provide regular assistance,” the Russian president added.</p><small>2026-01-19 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19164932056c4b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967853/pakistans-trade-deficit-widens-pushing-current-account-negative' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s trade deficit widens, pushing current account negative</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s external financing position weakened in December 2025 due to a rise in imports and persistent income outflows that pushed the current account back into deficit.
According to data provided by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Pakistan recorded a current account deficit of $244 million in December, compared with a $98m surplus in November of the same year.
As a result, the cumulative current account position for July to December FY26 rose to a deficit of $1,174m compared to a surplus of $957m during the same time last year.







The monthly decline was driven primarily by changes in trade. Imports of goods rose to $5.74bn in December, while exports stood at $2.75bn.
Trade in services also remained negative. Services exports for the month were $936m while imports were $1.31bn, adding $370m to the deficit.
Overall, strong remittance inflow did provide support, with workers’ remittances amounting to $3.59bn in December.
Other notable findings were that the financing account posted a net outflow of $596m in December, while foreign direct investment showed a net outflow of $135m.
The December data is representative of the fact that Pakistan’s external stability remains heavily dependent on remittances and official financing, imports are rebounding, and export growth seems to be softening, indicating that the balance of payments remains vulnerable to shifts in internal and geopolitical conditions.</p><small>2026-01-19 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191628549bc601e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967852/gul-plaza-blaze-plea-filed-in-shc-seeking-criminal-departmental-proceedings-against-responsible-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza blaze: Plea filed in SHC seeking criminal, departmental proceedings against responsible officials</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A petition was filed in the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday, seeking the initiation of “criminal, departmental and contempt proceedings” against officials found responsible for the Gul Plaza fire.
The fire, which erupted late on Saturday night, raged for almost 24 hours before it was doused. The death toll from the inferno rose to over 20 today from six reported on Sunday as rescue workers continued a search operation for several persons reported missing following the incident.
Meanwhile, a lawyer, Advocate Saleem Michael, and a resident of Karachi, Muhammad Haris, filed a plea in the SHC, stating that the “tragedy was not an unavoidable accident but a direct consequence of gross negligence, failure of inspection, nonenforcement of safety laws, and maladministration by the respondents who are legally bound to ensure building and fire safety”.
The Sindh government, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Karachi’s chief fire officer, the Sindh Emergency Rescue Service director general, South district deputy commissioner and director general of civil defence at the home department have been named as respondents in the plea.
The plea, seen by Dawn, has been filed “in public interest on behalf of affected citizens, traders, shopkeepers and victims of the Gul Plaza fire incident”.
It referred to an SHC order dated December 8, 2020, relating to public safety, fire prevention and protection of human life.
The petition recalled that in the 2020 order, the SHC had directed that the availability and functionality of fire tenders within a stipulated timeframe be ensured and fire emergency helpline 16 be maintained, activated and made fully operational.
The court had also issued directives for “constituting and operationalising divisional, district and sub-divisional task forces with defined inspection mechanisms, mandatory meetings, random inspections, complaint redressal within 48 hours and strict enforcement of fire safety laws”.
The petitioner contended that the respondents in their plea, who were public office-holders, were “expressly bound to comply with the clear, mandatory and continuing directions” issued by the SHC in its 2020 order.
“The directions were neither advisory nor directory, but mandatory in nature, involving issues of fundamental rights, protection of life and dignity of citizens, and constitutional obligations of the state under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution,” the petition said.
It added that despite a passage of more than four years, the respondents “have willfully, deliberately and contumaciously failed to implement the aforesaid directions in their true spirit”.
“The so-called task forces exist largely on paper only; inspections remain sporadic, reports are not acted upon, and enforcement against violators is virtually non-existent,” the plea alleged.
It added: “The recent tragic fire incident at Gul Plaza, Karachi, resulting in loss of precious human lives, serious injuries to several persons and devastating financial losses to shopkeepers, stands as a living indictment of the respondents’ continued defiance, disregard and non-compliance of the binding order dated December 8, 2020.”
The petitioners pled that the court declare that the Gul Plaza incident  occurred “due to negligence, maladministration and failure of statutory duties by the respondents”.
They further sought the court’s directions for the respondents to initiate criminal, departmental and contempt proceedings against responsible officials.
Moreover, they requested the court to order the suspension of negligent officers pending an independent inquiry and issue directives for the payment of  “adequate compensation to the families of deceased victims under the principle of state liability”
They also sought directions for the payment of “state-funded compensation” to traders and shopkeepers for their financial losses.
The petitioners further urged the court to order a judicial or independent technical inquiry into fire safety compliance at commercial buildings across Karachi.
Moreover, the court was requested to issue directives for the “strict enforcement” of the Sindh Fire Safety Act, 2016 and building laws to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies.
The petitioners also requested the court to direct the respondents to submit compliance and inspection reports pertaining to Gul Plaza.
They further sought court directions for the attachment of the property in question, Gul Plaza, until the “finalisation of the dispute of settlement/ compensation [payment] to the lawful owners/ renters (stock owners)”.
They also requested the court to “restrain respondents from concealing or destroying relevant records”.</p><small>2026-01-19 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19131713b57e448.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967845/social-media-posts-case-ihc-grants-imaan-hadi-one-day-protective-bail' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: IHC grants Imaan, Hadi one-day protective bail</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, one-day protective bail in relation to their arrest warrants in a case linked to controversial social media posts.
The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production.
Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow.
Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled.
“Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said.
He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”.
“The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha.
As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow.
The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow.
Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”.
The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided.
Judge Majoka expresses displeasure
During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested.
He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am.
When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court.
The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest.
Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”.
On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings.
In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA.
During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest.
At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court.
The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused.
Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-19 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19140559a3f2340.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967848/ptis-participation-in-jcp-meetings-conditional-upon-consultation-with-imran-barrister-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s participation in JCP meetings conditional upon consultation with Imran: Barrister Gohar</strong></a><br><p>Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has said that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan.
Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges.
JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary
Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court today, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”.
When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
He said that the party had serious reservations about the 26th Constitutional Amendment as well, which was enacted into law in 2024.
However, Gohar maintained that despite that, PTI “still wanted to present the party’s point of view and give input in the selection of judges for the superior judiciary, but then our meetings with the PTI founder were severed”.
He maintained that due to no contact with Imran, the party is unable to consult him.
“Just as we boycotted participation from other committees, we also decided to stay away from the meetings of the JCP,” he explained.
“We will make a proper decision in this regard after meeting with Khan sahib,” he added.
Meetings with the PTI founder have been suspended till February 8, Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in December last year.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
‘NA opposition leader not appointed at behest of Nawaz’
On the matter of the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Gohar dismissed reports that the appointment was made at the behest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.
On January 16, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the NA.
Gohar held that it was at the discretion of the speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, to issue the notification.
“I understand that it was done by the speaker National Assembly for which we were grateful,” he said.
Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”.
He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today.
“Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said.
In October 2025, PTI had nominated Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as its candidates for the slots of leader of the opposition in the National Assem­bly and Senate, respectively.</p><small>2026-01-19 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1912244148622c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967843/paf-contingent-arrives-in-saudi-arabia-for-combat-exercise-spears-of-victory-2026-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF contingent arrives in Saudi Arabia for combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a multinational aerial combat exercise, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release on Monday.
The PAF contingent, comprising F-16 Block-52 fighter aircraft alongside dedicated air and ground crew, arrived at King Abdulaziz Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the multinational aerial combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’.
“The exercise is witnessing the participation of fighter jets and combat support elements from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, France, Italy, Greece, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America,” the ISPR said.







“It offers a robust platform to enhance interoperability, operational synergy, mutual understanding and capacity building among participating air forces, particularly in large force employment, night composite air operations, integrated ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance), and operations in advanced electronic warfare environments.”
Through participation in this multinational forum, the PAF seeks to enhance interoperability with partner air forces and “validate its operational preparedness in a contested, technology-driven battle space”.
The military’s media wing elaborated that PAF fighter aircraft undertook a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, “demonstrating the long-range operational reach and expeditionary capabilities of Pakistan Air Force”.







“During the conduct of the exercise, PAF pilots flying advanced F-16 Block-52 aircraft equipped with modern avionics and Beyond Visual Range capabilities will be pitched against air crews of participating air forces operating a wide array of sophisticated combat aircraft,” it added.
The ISPR further said that the participation of the PAF contingent in the exercise not only reflected its firm commitment to regional and international military cooperation, but also underscored its “professional excellence and proven capability to operate effectively in diverse and demanding operational environments alongside leading contemporary air forces”.
In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage.

The crash happened on Sunday evening when a train operated by rail company Iryo travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz, crossing onto the other track where it crashed into an oncoming train, which also derailed.
The interior ministry said at least 39 people died, raising the toll from 21 given by police late on Sunday.
Another 123 people were injured, including five very seriously and 24 seriously, a ministry spokesperson added.
Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters the disaster took place on a straight part of the track, which was completely renovated.
The first train to derail was “practically new”, making the accident “extremely strange”, he added.
The death toll is not final, Puente said Monday, indicating it could rise from the current figure.
“The death toll has already reached 39 and is not definitive. I want to express my deepest gratitude for the tremendous work of the rescue teams throughout the night, under very difficult circumstances,” he wrote on X.
Rail experts “are very surprised by this accident because it is very strange and very difficult to explain at this stage,” the minister said.
‘Hard, tricky work’
Rail operator Iryo said around 300 people were on board its Malaga-Madrid service.
Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers it was carrying.
Spain has Europe’s largest high-speed rail network, with more than 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) of dedicated tracks connecting major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, and Malaga.
The hundreds of passengers left in the wreckage hampered the frantic work of emergency services.
“The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,” Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Cordoba, told public broadcaster RTVE.
“We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,” he added.
Some of the carriages had tumbled down an embankment of four metres (13 feet), Sanz said.
‘Like a horror movie’
A passenger on the second train, bound for the city of Huelva, who gave only her first name Montse, told Spanish public television the train, “with a jolt, came to a complete stop, and everything went dark”.
She described being thrown around in the last carriage and seeing luggage tumble on other passengers.
“The attendant behind me hit her head and was bleeding. There were children crying,” she added. “Luckily, I was in the last car. I feel like I was given a second chance at life.”
Survivor Lucas Meriako, who was travelling on the first train that derailed, told La Sexta television that “this looks like a horror movie”.
“We felt a very strong hit from behind and the feeling that the whole train was about to collapse, break… there were many injured due to the glass,” he said.
High-speed services between Madrid and the Andalusian cities of Cordoba, Seville, Malaga and Huelva would be suspended on Monday, Adif announced.
‘Night of deep pain’
“Today is a night of deep pain for our country owing to the tragic rail accident in Adamuz,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X.
“No words can alleviate such great suffering, but I want them to know that the whole country is by their side in this tough moment,” he added.
The royal palace said on X that Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were following the news “with great concern”, offering “our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured”.
French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen were among the world leaders offering condolences.</p><small>2026-01-19 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1911470673536c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967841/58-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-gilgit-baltistan-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.8-magnitude earthquake jolts parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan on Monday, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said.
According to PMD, the earthquake struck at 11:21am at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre in Northwestern Kashmir.
According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which uses the Moment Magnitude scale, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck northwestern Kashmir at a depth of 31 km.
It said that the quake was recorded 58 km north-west of Barishal in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
In October 2025, a 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi.

The board called the transition to the auction model “a historic move after a decade of success” and said that it reinforced PSL’s “continued growth, competitiveness, and commitment to innovation”.
“This strategic shift is aimed at enhancing competitive balance, increasing transparency, and providing players greater earning opportunities,” PCB said in a statement today.







Under the revised player acquisition framework, each franchise may retain a maximum of four players, limited to one player per category. Previously, every franchise was allowed to retain eight players from their squad, including a mentor, a brand ambassador, and a Right to Match (RTM) option to retain a ninth player in the draft.
The rules pertaining to mentors, brand ambassadors and RTM have been abolished for PSL XI, the statement said.
“Newly inducted teams will be allowed to select and retain four players from the available player pool before the player auction,” it added.
It added that each franchise will also be allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in PSL X, enabling teams to strategically strengthen their squads with fresh international talent.
Further strengthening the league’s commercial and competitive outlook, the player salary purse has been increased to $1.6 million per franchise, which the statement said underscored PSL’s “commitment to rewarding player performance and attracting elite domestic and international cricketers”.
“These progressive measures reflect the League’s strategic trajectory and evolution, while remaining firmly rooted in its mission to promote cricketing excellence, fan engagement, and attaining unprecedented heights,” it said.
According to the statement, PSL 11 will officially commence on March 26. Additionally, Faisalabad has been added as an additional venue to host League matches, “marking the city’s return to (the) spotlight and further expanding the League’s national footprint”.
It added that additional details regarding the player auction process, schedule, and operational guidelines would be shared in due course.</p><small>2026-01-19 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19100216e188d04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967729/cotton-supply-at-ginning-factories-indicates-stagnant-production' target='_blank'><strong>Cotton supply at ginning factories indicates stagnant production</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) has released provisional national cotton production figures, showing that by Jan 15, 2026, a total of 5.49m bales arrived at ginning factories across the country.
This is only 7,000 bales higher than the output recorded during the same period last year, indicating near stagnation in cotton production.

 

According to the PCGA report, 2.58m bales reached ginning factories in Punjab, while 2.91m bales arrived in Sindh. Compared to the same period last year, cotton arrivals in Punjab declined by 4pc whereas Sindh recorded a 4pc increase.
The data reveals that textile mills purchased 4.84m bales from ginning factories while exporters bought 176,000 bales. Around 479,000 bales are still available for sale with the ginners.
At present, only 127 ginning factories are operational. Of them 91 are in Punjab while 36 are in Sindh.

Ginners call for ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones; say the challenge has shifted from production to consumption

The PCGA officials noted that during the past two weeks alone, 46 ginning factories in Sindh and 50 in Punjab became non-operational—far more than market expectations.
The association also reported a sharp upward trend in cotton prices over the past week, with prices rising by Rs300 per maund to reach around Rs16,500 per maund. The increase has been attributed to the extremely limited availability of quality cotton in the domestic market and rising international prices of cotton yarn and fabric.
Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq says that despite Pakistan’s cotton production remaining nearly 50pc below annual targets for several years, the real challenge has now shifted from production to consumption. He attributes this to the excessive cultivation of sugarcane in traditional cotton zones, which has not only reduced cotton acreage but also caused environmental pollution that had adversely affected cotton quality.
As a result, he says, many textile mills are forced to import high-quality cotton to fulfill export orders, putting severe pressure on the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
He urges federal and provincial governments to strictly enforce crop zoning laws instead of spending billions of rupees on cotton revival projects. He calls for a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation and the establishment of new sugar mills in cotton zones, which can help restore national cotton production to around 15m bales.
Haq warns that record decline in exports, soaring production costs for exporters and highly lenient import policies have pushed the cotton sector to the brink. More than 150 textile units have shut down completely, many others are operating partially, and hundreds of ginning factories have become inactive, placing the entire cotton industry ‘on a ventilator’.
He cautions that if ‘oxygen’ is not immediately provided to the cotton sector, the national economy itself can slip into ‘coma’. He points out that Pakistan’s cotton industry faces some of the highest electricity, gas, and markup rates in the world, along with multiple high-rate taxes and excessive intervention by various federal and provincial departments, all of which have sharply increased production costs and eroded export competitiveness.
Calling the current situation the worst economic crisis in the industry’s history, Ihsanul Haq urges governments to prioritise industrial revival over cash handouts.
He suggests that instead of spending around Rs1 trillion on welfare schemes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and Ramazan packages, these funds should be directed toward reviving industries, which would not only strengthen the economy but also significantly reduce unemployment and poverty.

Speaking to reporters after congratulating the newly-elected cabinet of the Timergara Press Club, Mr Khan alleged that trucks carrying flour were being stopped at Attock and bribes demanded, leading to severe shortages in Lower Dir and parts of KP, where a 40kg bag of flour was being sold for as much as Rs6,000.
He said the situation amounted to a clear violation of Article 151 of the Constitution, which guarantees free trade among provinces, adding that despite Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being an integral part of Pakistan, the federal government was treating the province unfairly. He also criticised the provincial government for ‘failing to fulfill its constitutional and moral responsibilities’.

 

Responding to a question, Mr Khan said military operations were underway in various parts of the province, but stressed that the growing insecurity must be curbed immediately as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not afford further loss of lives. He said instead of military operations, the capacity of police and other civilian institutions be upgraded to cope with the menace of terrorism.

Inayat says capacity of police should be enhanced instead of conducting military operations

Meanwhile, talking to reporters at the residence of party’s leader Maulana Wahid Gul in Khar area of Bajaur, Inayatullah Khan called for resolving the unrest in the merged districts through dialogue rather than military operations.
He expressed sympathies with the family of the JI leader over the Friday night’s bombing targeting his house, and said his party had long held the ‘principled stance’ that issue of law and order in the tribal districts must be resolved through peaceful means, not by use of force.
The JI leader alleged that military operations in the tribal districts were not only causing destruction and unrest but also adversely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of residents.
Responding to a question, the JI leader said their party was in favour of dialogue on all issues, whether they pertained to security or internal political conflicts.
Condemning the bombing at Wahid Gul’s residence, the Jamaat’s provincial chief called it a cowardly act, stating that such incidents were unacceptable and were intended to silence the voices of peace.
He stated that the relevant authorities must immediately arrest those responsible for the attack.

PROTESTERS scuffle with an ICE supporter who was in downtown for ‘Americans Against Islamification’ rally.—AFP

WASHINGTON: The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government’s deportation drive, two US officials told Reuters on Sunday.
The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent.
President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act.

Army places units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence escalates

Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year.
In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances.
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.
Trump’s threat
“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
The soldiers subject to deployment specialise in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two US Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said.

Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.

 

Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived last night with full force and resources, the scene here would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.

Traders say fire could have been contained sooner, but limited resources and delayed action by authorities allowed it to spread unchecked

A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.
“Had the operation started properly the moment the fire broke out, perhaps so much damage could have been avoided. By morning, everything had been consumed by the flames,” one shopkeeper said, looking over the rubble.

 

“If a proper rescue operation had been in place, people could have been saved, and businesses might have survived. The government doesn’t seem to realise that these weren’t just shops – thousands of households’ livelihoods were at stake,” a clothing dealer lam­ented.
“At first, the smoke kept spreading, and then the fire reached the upper floors. If the teams had arrived on time, perhaps people could have been brought out safely,” a young man on the scene recounted.
Atmosphere of fear and mourning
The fire that could still not be fully extinguished by Sunday night has cloaked the bustling M.A. Jinnah Road and Saddar area in an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and mourning.
The rising sun, usually seen as a symbol of life and hope, appeared sorrowful this Sunday morning in Karachi. The light that every day awakened new hopes in shops and businesses was silent, as if it too had lowered its gaze after witnessing the blaze and destruction.
Along with traders and the relatives of those who died, even the air around Gul Plaza seemed to be grieving.
Some are searching for their loved ones, while others are consumed by the agony of losing their businesses. Every eye looked wet and every face appeared drained and hopeless.
The same market where shopkeepers raised shutters every morning and the voices of bargaining echoed, today stands as a burning skeleton. Where once crowds of buyers gathered, now victims, relatives, rescue workers and onlookers stand clustered together.
The intensity of the fire has already caused part of the building to collapse.
One glance at the rubble is enough to realise the scale of the devastation. Hundreds of shops have been destroyed.
It is clear that when a building burns, it is not only brick and metal that burn. Livelihoods, trust and the hard labour of years also burn to the ground.
The piles of debris and ash have shattered the economic lives of traders within moments.
‘Everything was here’
A middle-aged trader who had been running his business in the building for nearly two decades stood on the road looking at the charred structure on Sunday morning.
After a long silence, he uttered just one sentence: “Everything was here.”
In that single sentence lay the struggle, livelihood and hope of an entire life.
Another affected trader broke down while speaking to Dawn and pointed toward the burning building. People around him tried to console him, but every heart around seemed to be grieving.
Majid, who owned a children’s clothing shop, said he and other shopkeepers had stocked merchandise for the Eid season, but “now everything has turned to ashes.”
A dangerous design, an ageing structure
Among the public, there is also a belief that the scale of the fire is tied to the risks that had accumulated over time.
Gul Plaza is among the commercial centres of Karachi built decades ago. Over the years, thousands of shops, warehouses and stockrooms became packed into narrow corridors.
Fabrics, plastics, cardboard cartons, other goods, cramped pathways and substandard wiring created an environment that made today’s disaster unbearable.
Traders say that such calamities not only destroy wealth, but also push an entire class to stand once again before time and debt to rebuild what was lost.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.

 

Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.

 

He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

• Macron wants ‘never-before-used anti-coercion instrument’ against US• Meloni calls tariff threat a ‘mistake’• Dutch FM dubs it ‘blackmail’• UK, Norway mull over response
LONDON: Global markets face a fresh bout of volatility after President Donald Trump vowed to slap tariffs on eight European nations until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.
Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached.

 

“Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins.
“The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder.
On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

 

An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy.
France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said.
Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat.
Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told the BBC, calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”.
“We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said.
Trade war fear
France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too.
“In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.
Norway, targeted by the tariff threat but, like Britain, not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.
“I think one needs to stop and think so that a trade war can be averted that would lead to a downward spiral. Nobody would win,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told NRK television.

Tajikistan, in Central Asia, shares a mountainous border with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities.
According to Tajik security services cited by the state-owned Khovar news agency, “four terrorists were neutralised” after they refused to put down arms in the southern Khatlon region.
Tajik authorities have reported at least five deadly incidents on the mountainous border, which is some 1,350 kilometres (840 miles) long, since November.
An AFP count using official data found that 16 people have been killed in total. These include Tajik border guards, Chinese workers and what Dushanbe calls “smugglers” and “terrorists”.
After attacks on Chinese nationals in November, Tajik authorities urged the Taliban government to take measures to prevent destabilisation of the volatile border region, where drug traffickers and militants are active.
In December, five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, according to Tajik state media. It added that the people killed in the clash included “three terrorists” and two Tajik border officers.
Dushanbe is also concerned about the presence in Afghanistan of members of the terrorist organisation Islamic State in Khorasan.

Addressing a jirga comprising parliamentarians and elders from Bajaur tribal district in Chief Minister’s House here, he said that peace had been restored in 2018, however, deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation.
He stated that decisions, taken behind closed doors, had always worsened the situation.

 

Sources privy to the meeting said that participants discussed law and order and development schemes in Bajaur district. They said that situation could not be brought under control until all the stakeholders were on the same page.
“Governments are run with wisdom. There should be a mechanism where all the stakeholders agree on a point and be on the same page. That is how I believe things will normalise,” former governor Shaukatullah told Dawn.

Elders from Bajaur, Khyber and Kurram apprise chief minister of their issues

Others said that there were issues but they were performing duty, protecting their areas and never allowed outsiders to stay on their land. “As far as military operations are concerned, you know well that the chief minister himself is helpless and cannot stop it in his own hometown, how do you expect him to stop such action in Bajaur,” a participant told this scribe on condition of anonymity.

 

He said that development in the merged district was also discussed in detail in the meeting.
He said that the chief minister promised that if the funds, promised by federal government for merged districts, were not released, he would cut funds from other developmental projects and divert them to Bajaur.
A statement issued by Chief Minister’s House said that the participants of jirga presented suggestions for establishing permanent peace and expressed full confidence in the chief minister, assuring him all out support.
The jirga discussed law and order situation in the province, improvement in Pak-Afghan relations and development strategy.
It said that the chief minister announced increasing compensation for partially damaged houses in Bajaur from Rs0.16 million to Rs0.5 million following recent operations. He said that federal government had promised Rs1 billion annually at the time when the previously tribal areas were being merged with KP, however, over the past seven years, only Rs168 billion was released.
He said that federal government was not providing funds for Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). He issued direction for increasing the upper age limit for recruitment in police department in merged districts.
Also, in another jirga with members from Kurram and Khyber districts, the chief minister said that he understood the agony of military operations. He added that he would not leave his people alone.
He told the jirga members that sectarian issues caused damage and enemies took advantage of the situation. He said that he would soon visit Kurram to resolve issues of displaced persons. He ordered registration of those people, who had left their homes due to the law and order situation, within one week.
Our correspondent from Mansehra adds: Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi said that the street movement launched from Karachi on the directive of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan would bring revolutionary changes in political system of the country.
“This mammoth crowd, which gathered at midnight to welcome the convoy of the street movement from Haripur to different parts of Hazara, is an eye-opener for the government. The people want immediate release of PTI jailed founding chairman, Imran Khan,” he said while addressing cheering crowds at Khatm-i-Nubowat Chowk and College Doraha in small hours of Sunday.
PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Babar Saleem Swati, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar and deputy president Kamal Saleem Swati were also present on the occasion.
The chief minister said that the street movement had successfully mobilised people from Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would soon reach every nook and corner of the country.
“We want to make it clear to the government that this time it cannot suppress the people’s street movement. We have turned every city and every square into D-Chowk,” he said.
Mr Afridi said the country needed Imran Khan’s leadership to steer it out of the prevailing socio-political and economic crises, accusing federal government of failing to address those challenges.
The convoy of the street movement entered Mansehra through Karakoram Highway at Datta, proceeded through Ghazikot and concluded at College Doraha in the early hours of Sunday.

• Dacoits warned to lay down arms            
RAHIM YAR KHAN: A large-scale, joint operation by Punjab and Sindh police is ongoing in the katcha areas of Rahim Yar Khan, including Machka, Kacha Rajwani and Ronti, with 1,700 personnel, drones and armoured vehicles deployed against bandits.
According to Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bahawalpur Ghazi Muhammad Salahuddin, Rahim Yar Khan police had cordoned off Kacha Rajwani, with contingents from Rajanpur (Punjab) and Ghotki (Sindh) taking part. Sindh police and Rangers were also conducting action in adjoining riverine areas.
He said 1,700 police personnel had been deployed along with eight drone teams, six bulletproof vehicles and three armoured personnel carriers.
Modern technology was being used to ensure effective progress and restore law and order in the area, he said, adding that police were conducting action against criminal elements under a coordinated and well-planned strategy.
The RPO clarified that suspects who renounce criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to the police would not be engaged in encounters and would be produced before the courts in accordance with the law. However, criminals have been strictly warned to lay down their arms and surrender.
He further emphasised that the operation would continue until the writ of the government was fully established in the riverine areas.
District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan Irfan Ali Samo stated that action against criminals was ongoing and that ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the public remained the top priority.
According to details, police with a heavy contingent and full combat equipment have launched a decisive operation against bandits after cordoning off the areas of Machka and Kacha Rajwani.
Earlier this month, the Sindh government announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the katcha areas of the province, vowing to eliminate them through the use of state force.
Speaking to reporters after presiding over a high-level meeting on the law and order situation in the Sukkur and Larkana ranges, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said it had been decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”.
“We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits you see on social media,” he said, adding that special focus would be placed on Sukkur and Larkana.
Mr Lanjar stressed that dacoits would be given a chance to lay down their arms and join the national mainstream. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them. There will be a fight and they will be eliminated through the use of state force,” he warned.
The home minister thanked the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation in which a no-go katcha area was vaca­ted. He said individuals kidnapped from Sindh were recovered from Punjab with the full cooperation of the Rangers and other security agencies.
