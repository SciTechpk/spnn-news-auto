Organised by DawnMedia, the two-day summit is bringing toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as the rising population continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.

 

Pakistan, with a population of over 241 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, adding four to five million people every year. Its population growth rate of 2.40 per cent is the highest in South Asia.
The rapid increase is outpacing employment opportunities, with official statistics showing the country will require 104m jobs by 2040. Pakistan will not be able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 if the current trajectory of population growth does not slow down.

3:36pm — Population Association of Pakistan president says govts ‘not serious enough’
Population Association of Pakistan President Professor Mehtab S. Karim said that none of the “successive governments after Gen Ayub Khan’s removal” were serious enough about population programming in Pakistan, except for ex-PM Benazir Bhutto.
Prof Karim also brought up Bangladesh as a case study, pointing out the rising contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) there, leading to the average number of children per woman of two, compared to Pakistan “still struggling” with over three children per woman.

3:27pm — Indonesian envoy details his country’s efforts
Rahmat Hindiarta Kusuma, social affairs coordinator at the Indonesian embassy, noted that Indonesia had ranked among the top six most populous countries since the 1960s.
“However, the international community has considered Indonesia as one of the countries having a strong and successful family planning initiatives in the world,” Kusuma highlighted.
He cited figures of declining fertility rate in Indonesia and rising CPR in the 1990s.
“The crisis gave us very incredible experience,” he said, adding that people learned that having family planning was beneficial for them.
Kusuma recalled that Indonesia organised dialogues and events to promote the importance of family planning, with enforcement encouraged among men as well, not just women.

3:23pm — ‘Should include chapter on small families in academic curriculum’
Dr Rashid Amjad said there was much to learn from Bangladesh, which had got “some tailwinds” of the youth dividend.
He also mentioned the “flexibility” that Iran and Egypt were trying to build into their population growth strategy. “Egypt is very similar to us […] [President] Sisi is very clear — two-child family,” he said.
Dr Amjad underscored the need to educate the youth about the benefits of “happy, healthy, smaller families”, calling for the topic to be incorporated into primary and higher education curricula.
He also suggested the formation of a high-level “Special Demographic Dividend Facilitation Council”.

3:18pm — Pakistan facing ‘demographic disaster’ with rising fertility rate: Dr Amjad
Dr Rashid Amjad described “demographic dividend” as a “window of opportunity which comes up when your working age population grows at a faster rate than your dependent population”.
“We did not receive the demographic dividend. We are in the phase of what I call the demographic disaster,” he said.
The Lahore School of Economics professor described the demographic disaster as a situation when you get a youth bulge and “there is an echo of this youth bulge in terms of increasing fertility”.
“So you get what we call double jeopardy.”
He emphasised the importance of having the “tailwind” of declining population growth alongside reforms, such as in the case of India.

3:15pm — Academic says exact census figures not known
Dr Rashid Amjad, director of Lahore School of Economics’ Graduate Institute of Development Studies, said the exact population figures were not known.
“Unless we get our numbers right, unless we allow our population census, allow other bodies to do their homework in the way they do it by adding numbers, we will not make any progress.”

3:09pm — Pakistan’s outreach campaigns ‘very modest’ compared to other Muslim countries: Dr Shabaneh
UNFPA’s Dr Shabaneh praised Iran’s primary healthcare system and Turkiye’s hospital accessibility.
“He further said that Egypt was doing a massive outreach campaign on media, compared to the “very modest” efforts regarding that in Pakistan.

3pm — UNFPA’s Dr Luay Shabaneh speaks as 5th session begins
Dr Luay Shabaneh, representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Pakistan, is chairing today’s fifth session, titled “Regional Review of Population & Economic Growth”.
“We don’t have a vision [of] what Pakistan is trying to achieve on this agenda, apart from blaming people for being victims,” the UNFPA official said.
He stated that the number of people was not the entire issue, but the main challenges were the human capital and the outcomes of the health and education systems.




2:17pm — Short break

2: 12pm — Farooq Sattar sees something ‘seriously wrong’ with approach to conducting population census
MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said that there was something “seriously wrong” about the approach taken to conducting the population census. He said that the last census held in 2023, due to enhanced monitoring, authorities were able to catch the “thieves snatching away a big chunk of Karachi’s population”.
He further said that Karachi’s population had risen from 32 to 37 per cent of Sindh’s over the last 60 years.
He further said that while other speakers had highlighted the impact of unchecked demographic growth, very few had talked about the influx due to economic migration.

2:05pm — Jhagra calls for revising NFC to ‘fiscal equalisation’
Jhagra stressed the need for increasing the size of the National Finance Commission (NFC), basing it on the principle of “fiscal equalisation”.
The former minister said: “Change the NFC, change it from population, but that does not necessarily mean that more backward provinces get less because if you look at any definition of an instrument, such as the NFC, its primary object is fiscal equalisation.”

 

He continued: “Sindh can generate revenue from the port, and Punjab can generate revenue because it’s the agricultural hub and breadbasket of Pakistan. Balochistan is a massive challenge, and in KP, the two competitive advantages that we have are trade with Afghanistan, which is now closed, and two, we can be the energy hub of the country.”
However, Jhagra lamented that KP remained isolated, saying “for us to develop our economy in the way we can, the state of Pakistan does not allow us and tells us it’s in the national interest”.
Citing India’s example of the NFC distribution, Jhagra said, “States in India that are the furthest behind in revenue generation get the greatest share because of this need for fiscal equalisation.”

1:58pm — PTI’s Taimur Jhagra calls for integrating family planning with health sector
Former KP minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra called for the need to integrate family planning into the health sector.
Recalling his time as the provincial health minister, the PTI leader said, “I told my staff that every Basic Health Unit (BHU) and primary health care centre must, in its set key metrics, have family planning as one of them.”
The former minister stressed that “by bifurcating family planning from health, we have actually created this need to buy new land for new family planning centres, to recruit more staff when all the staff exists within the health set-up.”
Recalling a federal government’s family planning meeting, he said that “out of Rs10bn set up for family planning, we were told that Rs9bn would be spent on arranging land for the family planning centres”.

1:54pm — PM has taken up challenge to tackle massive population growth: MNA Shaista Pervaiz
Asked about the three actions that the current government led by her party should be doing to promote population as the paramount issue for Pakistan, PML-N MNA Shaista Pervaiz noted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has “recognised and taken up the challenge”.
“The priority should be [that it’s] taken at the national level, with chief ministers of the provinces taken into it together,” she said, noting that the lack of coordination between the Centre and the provinces was clearly evident.
The PML-N lawmaker emphasised the need to take the people along with what is decided at the top level. She added that the Centre and the provinces were working in silos, with each taking its own decisions.
“The [subject] of population needs to come under the federal umbrella,” Pervaiz added.

1:50pm — Pakistan being ‘Muslim country’ not an impediment to tackling population growth
Senator Mushahid Hussain termed it a myth that Pakistan being a Muslim country was an impediment in tackling high population growth.
The senator pointed out that the Muslim-majority countries of Iran, Indonesia and Bangladesh were “success stories in population”.
“The government priorities are wrong,” PML-N’s Mushahid said, emphasising that funds were being allocated to other areas when much of it could be spent on education.

1:48pm — Lack of political will, lack of priorities are issues: Senator Mushahid Hussain
Senator Mushahid highlighted that now, all major political parties had a focus on the subject of population.
He recalled that he also spoke to the military when he was the chairman of the Senate’s standing committee on defence.
“That time onwards, even the speeches of the military focused on population as a part of the narrative on Pakistan,” Mushahid said.
He pointed out that “lack of political will and lack of priorities” were the problems in tackling the issue.

1:45pm — Senator Mushahid notes ‘politics of population’ in Pakistan
Senator Mushahid Hussain noted that there was “politics of population” in Pakistan, with people saying that the population has been understated after every census.
He noted that constitutionally, the allocation of resources to the provinces was based largely on population.
The PPP senator recalled that he introduced a resolution in the Senate on population in 2020, which had the support of all parties. He also pointed out the launch of “Parliamentary Forum on Population”, calling it his brainchild.

1:40pm — 4th session begins with lawmakers at stage
The day’s fourth session, titled “Translating Political Resolve into Action on the TAWAZUN Narrative”, has begun.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed is moderating the panel discussion.




1:28pm — World Bank official warns of ‘demographic liability’ if youth not provided with jobs, skills
The World Bank’s Pakistan director said reducing stunting and learning poverty were among the areas that would be focused on under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework.
Dr Bolormaa Amgaabazar noted that 60pc of Pakistan’s population was under 30, adding that there was a “potential” for demographic dividend, but it would remain unrealised until people were provided jobs and skills.
“Until then, it can turn into demographic liability,” she cautioned.

1:20pm — Population growth a ‘barrier to human and economic development’: World Bank official
Dr Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank’s country director for Pakistan, observed that population growth was a “barrier to human and economic development”.
Citing World Bank figures, she said a woman in Pakistan had 3.6 children on average, adding that it was higher than the rest of South Asia.
While noting that there was a difference in these statistics, with the Bank’s being higher, Amgaabazar asserted that they depicted the same thing — Pakistan’s fertility rate was much higher than other neighbouring countries.
Echoing Sherry Rehman and Aurangzeb’s comments, she noted that rapid growth was linked to climate change, water scarcity and food security.

1:05pm — Dr S. Akbar Zaidi points out ‘extremely worrying’ trends in declining real wage, HDI
Dr S. Akbar Zaidi further noted that unemployment had been growing in the last five to seven years.
Citing economist Dr Hafeez Pasha’s data, he said the real wage of workers in Pakistan has seen a 20pc in just the last three years.
He also mentioned Pakistan’s declining ranking in the UN Human Development Index, terming the figures “extremely worrying trends”.
Speaking about human capital, Dr Zaidi said, “Today, we are half a century behind where South Korea is.”
In contrast to the finance minister’s remarks, Dr Zaidi said, “We can’t talk about a new economy, of IT, of computer growth with these sort of numbers.”

12:55pm — Pakistan’s economy in a very, very sharp decline: Dr S. Akbar Zaidi
“Pakistan is in decline. Pakistan’s economy is in a very, very sharp decline,” said IBA Executive Director Dr S. Akbar Zaidi at the outset of his comments.
“You talk to any economist and the many in this room and most will agree that all numbers are going in the wrong direction,” he added.
“It is irrefutable that Pakistan’s economy is not doing well, in relevant terms and in absolute terms, it is much worse than it has been over the last few years.”
Dr Zaidi said that Pakistan was estimated to be the third most populous country in the world in 25 years.

12:50pm — Lums VC Ali Cheema for ‘centring women’ in tackling population growth
Taking to the stage, Lahore University of Management Sciences’ Vice Chancellor Ali Cheema underscored the importance of centring women in solutions aimed at population growth.
“Both in terms of growth and fertility decline, if you do not centre women, you are not gonna get growth up, and you are not going to get fertility down,” Cheema said.
He further noted: “Don’t think about population as a separate service to be provided under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), but [rather] we want to centre that (population) as part of growth, if you do not bring population down, you are not gonna get growth up.”

12:44pm — Youth leading IT economy, says Aurangzeb
Addressing the issue of the population dividend, the finance minister noted that the youth were “leading the IT economy” in the country and called for the need to get out of the “job mindset”.

 

“This is not about the government giving jobs, I think we have to get out of that mindset, it is the ladies and gentlemen who are freelancers today, leading our IT services, leading the IT economy.
“We need to upskill them, reskill them; that is how we are going to go forward with respect to this population dividend,” he detailed.

12:40pm — We must move to ‘implementation’, says Aurangzeb
Continuing his address, the finance minister noted that “we have known the what and why for the longest time” behind population growth.
Aurangzeb, who has repeatedly termed population growth as an “existential issue” for Pakistan, said, “There is no dearth of policy prescriptions.
“Everything has to do now with the […] execution and the how part of it.”

12:30pm — Aurangzeb stresses need to ‘recognise and negotiate’ population growth, climate change
The finance minister called for the need to “recognise and negotiate” population growth and climate change.
Speaking about Pakistan’s roadmap to a $3 trillion economy by 2047, Aurangzeb stressed that it was “clear that these two existential issues have to be recognised and negotiated if we are to realise our full potential”.

12:25pm — Third session begins with finance minister’s remarks
The third session of the day, titled ‘Accelerating Economic Growth Towards a More Optimal Balance’, has begun. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is voicing his opinions on the issue.




12:10pm — ‘Pakistan’s capital-labour ratio much lower than India’
Dr Hanid Mukhtar further noted that because of the low investment, which was indirectly related to the population growth, Pakistan’s “capital-labour ratio is much much lower than India”.
He stressed that it was important because it was a factor that provided productivity to labourers.

12:03pm — Dr Hanid Mukhtar highlights rising imbalance compared to rest of South Asia
Dr Hanid Mukhtar, a fellow at the Consortium for Development Policy Research, pointed out that Pakistan’s GDP per capita income had been growing at 3.6pc per year.
However, he then compared that the per capita income was 56pc higher than that of India in 1990 and almost double that of Bangladesh, but in 2024, India had 71pc higher GDP per capita than Pakistan and Bangladesh’s was 53pc higher.
Dr Mukhtar said that research had shown that the population impacted GDP growth.
He also spoke about expenditure, warning: “Even if we don’t see too much difference in public infrastructure quality and quantity between India and Pakistan today. Watch out; next five years, they are going to [leave all us behind] like anything.”

11:52am — 6m ‘unwanted pregnancies’ reported in Pakistan every year: Dr Sathar
Detailing the results of a research, Dr Sathar shared that out of a total of 12.7m pregnancies recorded in Pakistan, six million were “unwanted or untimed”.
“If we had strong family planning programs, we could remove or rather reduce, the unwanted pregnancies and focus on the other 6.7m instead, ensuring a better mortality rate,” she said.
“This is what women want, this is what families want,” Dr Sathar added, expressing confidence that Pakistani families would react positively to a good and well-funded family planning program.

11:50 — Dr Sathar sounds alarm on out-of-school children
On the number of out-of-school children, Dr Sathar termed it an “unacceptable figure”.
She said the figures were not huge because of parents not wanting to send their children to school, but it was a “failure” of the governments.
“I don’t want to point to any particular government; all the past few governments.”




11:40 — Dr Zeba Sathar calls for restoring balance to address population growth
Dr Zeba Sathar, the country director for Pakistan at Population Council, opened the second session, explaining the summit’s theme on “balance” in addressing population growth.
“We have centred our whole theme around balance because it is important to have a national narrative,” Sathar said.
“The balance really is about responsibility, the state’s responsibility; the balance has to be restored in terms of societal issues, the balance between resources, and the number of people in Pakistan,” she said.
Comparing Pakistan’s population growth with other countries in South Asia, she noted that “We are clearly out of balance in terms of where we are standing with our neighbours.”
“Our growth rate is double that of our neighbours,” she added.

11:38 — Govt has placed ‘stunting, population management at highest national priority’
Speaking further, the planning minister highlighted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has placed “stunting and population management at the highest national priority”.
“The government is moving towards emergency multi-sector action integrating health, nutrition, education, social protection, water and local government systems,” Ahsan Iqbal said.
“It is not population size but population quality that drives national progress.”
The minister stressed that Pakistan’s priority must be fewer children but better outcomes for every child.

11:35am — Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal highlights child stunting
Addressing the summit via video link, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed child stunting one of the most painful demographic challenges.
“Countries with high stunting lose 2-3pc of GDP annually. Due to no productivity and impaired human capital, a stunted child earns up to 22pc less over their lifetime,” Iqbal said.
He added, “This is not a health issue alone. It is a national productivity crisis, a national development emergency, and a direct threat to Pakistan’s long-term economic strength and sustainability.”

“I commend DawnMedia group, the Population Council and all our development partners for convening a dialogue on an issue that will shape Pakistan’s destiny more than any other.”
Citing the estimated figure of 370m by 2050, Iqbal termed population growth a “defining challenge for our future stability, prosperity and competitiveness”.
“Every single year, Pakistan adds almost the entire population of New Zealand, around 4-4.5m people,” the minister noted.

11:30am — No more a demographic issue: Shaista Pervaiz
MNA Shaista Pervaiz began her address by commending the participants, lauding their “collective resolve to address population challenges”.
She stressed that “population growth is no more a demographic issue”.
She continued: “It is linked with our economy, it is linked with the well-being of our people, linked with the future of our children, linked with everything a country is judged by.”
Pervaiz noted that while there was “political will” present to address the issue, it was time that it should be “turned into action”.

11:26am — ‘No new ministry needed; have information ministry do awareness drive’
Providing suggestios on how to tackle the issue, Sherry Rehman said the federal government should have the information minister hold an awareness drive in the national language on population and family planning.
“It doesn’t need to worry about having a population ministry. Please don’t have ministries. Please don’t,” the senator said.
“Start putting this on phones, on Androids, on anything. And you will have yourself a campaign that goes into your doors.”

11:14am — There is demand for the ‘C-word, for contraception’: Sherry Rehman
Sherry Rehman stressed, “There is demand for the C-word, for contraception. Contraception prevalence rate (CPR) is what you need to talk about.”
Noting that the CPR was 34pc, she emphasised that contraceptive usage would lower the birth rate and said there was a need for it to be easily and cheaply accessible.
“One province is offering vasectomies to men who are willing to take it up,” she remarked.

 

“Every 50 minutes, before we finish this session, a woman in Pakistan will die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications.”
The senator noted the Council of Islamic Ideology’s ruling allowing birth spacing and said the hesitation was not a religious matter, but rather a cultural taboo.
Noting the high unemployment rate, Rehman said it raised “discontent in the state’s ability to provide a climate where employment is easily available”.

11:05am — ‘72pc of a woman’s day spent carrying water’
Sherry Rehman also pointed out the excessive water consumption, calling for the need to reduce it. She termed large-storage dams “a thing of the past”, noting the lack of financing for them and the displacement caused by them.
“Seventy-two per cent, three quarters, of the average woman’s day in Pakistan is taken up carrying water. Shocking, isn’t it?” the senator highlighted.
“Food, climate and poverty are all impacted,” Rehman, the chairperson of the Parliamentary Forum on Population, said.
“Forty per cent of children under five are stunted,” she added, noting that mothers were also not able to make the health choices that they need to, including birth spaces.




11:03am — Population numbers amplify climate shocks: Sherry Rehman
Speaking about the intersection of climate change and population growth, Senator Rehman said, “With our economic growth dragged down by climate shocks and institutional fragility — let’s not pretend that is not the case —we are not able to lift millions out of the poverty I just spoke about.”
She detailed that if the GDP was already being impacted by multiple factors, such as the recent floods, “population numbers stretch those numbers further”.
“There are simply more people to save, more people to shelter, more people to feed, house, clothe, and save from diseases.”

11:00am — ‘Population growth has passed some kind of danger line’
Referring to Nazafreen’s comments on Pakistan’s “youth bulge”, Senator Sherry Rehman said, “Pakistan talks about this demographic dividend non-stop, but at which point does this dividend become a challenge?
“When you are not able to provide jobs for the 1.5m jobs needed per year,” she said, stressing that “it was a huge number”.
“Population growth, in my view, and I am sure everyone agrees, has passed some kind of danger line,” Rehman cautioned.
“Of course, we love people, we love our births, and we mourn our deaths, but what goes round here is the pressure on our resources,” the senator explained.

10:55am — Sherry Rehman terms population growth a ‘ticking time bomb’ for Pakistan
In a keynote address, Senator Sherry Rehman recalled: “Seven years ago, I wrote about three ticking time bombs for Pakistan — unchecked population growth was one of them, water scarcity, and of course, climate stress.”
“In my view, they are no longer ticking; they have noiselessly exploded around us,” the minister warned.
“They have already done the damage they needed to do,” she said.

10:45am — ‘Let’s work together to defuse population time bomb, turn it into Pakistan’s greatest dividend’
Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani said the provision of education up to at least Grade 12 and upskilling the youth through vocational training would not only strengthen Pakistan’s GDP but also position “our human capital to support other economies facing a population explosion”.
“This young skilled workforce has the potential to transform Pakistan’s destiny, to build real economic strength and to elevate our standing on the global stage.
“The decisions we take today on health, education, gender, equity and economic development are investments in Pakistan’s future,” she highlighted.
“We will bring you ideas, detailed reporting, expert analysis and focused storytelling, so that the conversations here reach people across the country and help shape a more informed national debate,” she added.
“Let us work together to defuse this population time bomb and turn it into Pakistan’s greatest dividend,” she said.

10:42am — ‘Rapid growth slows our ability to improve living standards’
Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani noted that “without careful planning, rapid growth weakens per capita income and slows our ability to improve living standards”.
“Globally, the contrast is stark,” she said, pointing out that many Asian countries had slowed population growth through education, women’s empowerment and access to health services.
“Pakistan’s fast growth without parallel investment in human development makes it harder to deliver basic services and harder for families to move out of poverty.”
The Dawn CEO, however, said there was an opportunity for Pakistan, which was at a crossroads with a “large and growing population, a sizeable youth cohort and rapidly evolving socio-economic realities”.

10:38am — Dawn CEO Nazafreen highlights Pakistan has ‘young’ population
Inaugurating the moot, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the CEO of Dawn, highlighted that Pakistan had a mostly young population, with the “median age of just over 20 years”.
Stating some estimates about the expected population in the coming years, she said the rapid growth directly affects the lives of people and the country’s future.
The Dawn CEO said: “It places immense pressure on our health care system, especially maternal and child health. It stretches our education system, leaving millions of children without access to quality learning. It increases the demand for jobs, housing, clean water, sanitation, transport and for energy.

10:40am — Conference begins
The conference has begun, with the national anthem being played, followed by the recitation of the Holy Quran.
Senator Sherry Rehman and Dawn CEO Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani are present at the stage as the national anthem is played.

The minister said this during a press conference in Lahore, where he said he believed that “since the past few days, past few weeks, 90 per cent news on social media is fake”.
Saying so, Naqvi also clarified that he believed in the freedom of expression and liberty to criticise.
He also highlighted that in case false news was reported by a platform in the mainstream media, a complaint could be registered with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. Similarly, he continued, a reporter associated with a news outlet would be answerable to their director news or the bureau chief in such a scenario.
“But, on social media one can post any photo, make news as per their wish and post it,” he said, adding that he had spoken to the information minister today morning, and “we will not allow this”.
Naqvi added, “If you have evidence, you can report any story. But it cannot be allowed that you say whatever you want on social media, make any allegation against anyone, [declare] any living person dead and [declare] a dead person alive. This cannot happen.”
The information ministry, along with the NCCIA, would carry out a “crackdown on this on a massive scale”, he said.
“We will not allow you to spread fake news across the country and create panic […] in the garb of journalism.”
The interior minister then went on describe “who is a journalist for us”.
“Journalists are responsible, those who are part of the national media. They work as part of a system. Every institution has a system of check-and-balance and an editorial board,” he said, adding that individuals working as part of these systems “are journalists for us”.
On the other hand, those who spread fake news were “not journalists for us. We are very clear on this”, Naqvi further stated.
He went on to say: “Whether you produce vlogs or a podcast, […] run news responsibly.”
The minister once again emphasised that journalists and freedom of expression held significance for the government, but the spreading of fake news could not be permitted.
Later, when a journalist asked him whether a regulatory body would be established in connection with the new measure announced by Naqvi today, the minister replied: “I think one is already being established.”
He also asserted that this measure was “not against journalists”, but only those spreading fake news. In this connection, he gave the hypothetical example of “someone saying that an ABC person has died”.
He added that after making such a statement, one would have to take responsibility.
Answering another question, he said the action taken by the information ministry and NCCIA “will not be an operation or a crackdown, but simply an action against anyone spreading fake news without any evidence”.
Asked about “a political party running a campaign from India” — an apparent reference to PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters giving interviews to Indian outlets recently — Naqvi said: “I want people to get exposed. Others should know who can go to what extent. The country’s integrity is a boundary that you don’t cross and join the enemy. Let it happen.”
In this context, Naqvi was also asked about criticism directed toward Chief of Army Staff Fied Marshal Asim Munir.
He replied, “The state is clear […] we will not spare them. The other day someone was saying in London that there was a dispute within the institutions, someone else says something about our journalists. This will have to stop.”
Without naming anyone, he added: “Those sitting out there, let me tell you, you are also coming back soon. And if you think you will get protection here, that is not possible. We will soon bring you back, and you will be answerable.”

At the outset of the press conference, Naqvi said the authorities were facing difficulties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with regards to sending Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan. This was not the case in the three other provinces, he added.
Afghan migrants, he claimed, were being “protected in KP”. He further alleged that the federal government had de-notified camps of Afghan refugees, but several of them remained operational in KP.
Highlighting the involvement of Afghans in terror activities, he mentioned that terrorists who attacked Federal Constabulary headquarters a few days ago — ostensbily a reference to an attack in Peshawar on November 24 — were also Afghans.
Naqvi added that station house officers (SHO) in police were now being assigned the task to identify and locate “illegal Afghans” in their respective areas so that they could be sent back to Afghanistan. Instructions had also been issued to inspector generals for the collection of data via SHOs.
“Our message to the KP government is also that it is important at this time to prioritise your country over politics,” he said, adding that the KP government would have to ensure the implementation of the federal government’s decision “as we cannot afford any more bomb blasts”.
He added, “My message to illegal Afghans is to leave yourself respectfully. Because if you get caught now, we will not just send you back.” Without further elaborating on this statement, Naqvi also warned that if any Afghan returned to Pakistan after being sent to Afghanistan, they would be arrested.
Asked whether the Centre was mulling going to the court against KP government over the alleged non-cooperation on the matter of Afghan, Naqvi said multiple options were being worked on.
“When it comes to national security, it cannot happen that a province makes it own policy. We will not allow this.”
Offloading of passengers
On the matter of officials denying boarding to passengers travelling abroad, Naqvi maintained that just 50-70 people were being offloaded daily across the country.
“I have asked the FIA (Federal Investigation Agency) to share this data so that people how realise how an agent mafia is running a campaign on  social media. Because obviously, they are the ones who will actually  face consequences in this matter,” he said.
The minister said that there could be some negligence on part of the FIA, but travellers having all necessary documents were not being barred from travelling abroad.
He went on to say that action against travellers with insufficient documents was necessary as “we are trying to improve the ranking of our passport”.
Speculation about notification
Naqvi was also asked about a “notification” and the speculation about it on social media.
It seemed to be a reference to the delay in the issuance of the notification for the Chief of Defence Forces’ (CDF) appointment. Observers described the delay in CDF’s notification as “baffling”, noting that it has signalled to the opposition that something may be amiss in civil–military relations.
In his response, Naqvi, seemingly referring to the speculation on social media, said: “Let them do it”.
He then went on to explain that “a new institution is being established after an amendment in the Constitution. They want things to happen at the press of a button, but things don’t work that way. A system has to be established, and it takes days, hours. It’s not that you press a button and it will become a part of the Constitution”.</p><small>2025-12-01 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01151834350498c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958518/cop-martyred-in-suicide-blast-targeting-police-mobile-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Cop martyred in suicide blast targeting police mobile in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>One cop was martyred while five others were injured on Monday in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district.
Lakki Marwat District Police Officer’s spokesman Asif Hassan told Dawn that a Tajori police mobile was targeted in a suicide attack.
He identified the deceased as Head Constable Alauddin. He further said that the bomber’s accomplice had escaped, adding that a search operation was underway.
The injured were identified as Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Haq Nawaz, Constable Yar Muhammad, Elite Force Constable Kamal Ahmad, Elite Force Constable Naeemullah and Duty Foot Constable Nasrullah.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the incident, saying that the sacrifices of police personnel “will not go in vain”.
“The provincial government stands with the police,” Afridi said, adding that maintaining law and order was the government’s top priority.
“Such cowardly attacks cannot dampen our morale,” he said.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TTP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last week, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu.</p><small>2025-12-01 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01110608b1280a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958504/body-of-3-year-old-boy-who-fell-into-open-manhole-in-karachis-gulshan-i-iqbal-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>Body of 3-year-old boy who fell into open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal recovered</strong></a><br><p>The body of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night was recovered on Monday, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
The development was confirmed by both Rescue 1122 and Edhi, with the latter adding that the body was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
Images shared on social media last night had showed a large number of citizens gathered in the area as rescue work was underway. Other videos also showed the child’s distraught mother calling on someone to save her child.
Earlier, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the service’s central command received information about the incident at 10pm on Sunday night.
He said the boy was with his parents, who were shopping at a private departmental store near Nipa. He said the boy fell into the manhole after the family left the store.
He said that Rescue 1122 did not usually initiate search operations at night due to a lack of visibility. But, since a “highly charged” crowd had gathered and the parents were grief-stricken, officials initiated the search operation, he said.
However, rescue workers have been unable to trace the boy.
The spokesperson said that the search and rescue operation continued into the night for a considerable time. He said that the rescue operation had been halted for now, but officials had excavated five areas with the help of heavy machinery to search for the missing boy.
He said that the Rescue 1122 team had asked the authorities concerned to provide the blueprint for the underground drainage system. According to Khan, the team was waiting for information on the entry and exit flow of the underground water so that rescue work could be conducted at the exact location.
Karachi mayor cautions against politicising incident
Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mayor Murtaza Wahab said he would initiate an inquiry into the incident but cautioned against politicising it.
“Unfortunately, when this kind of thing happens, we immediately go toward blame and rhetoric,” he said. “If there is a human tragedy, then is it necessary to bring politics into it?”
He said that he would conduct an inquiry as to how long the manhole had been left open in the middle of the city, near a large department store which was visited by thousands daily.
“How it was open or was it left open at that time … this will be checked,” he said.
“If there was carelessness on the part of the government, I assure you we will take action,” he said.
Wahab also said he would ask the union council chairman concerned about whether it had been communicated that the manhole was left open as he questioned the funds provided to the councils.
“This is very unfortunate,” he said, talking about the incident. “I will refrain from political rhetoric, but I will say once, and for all that we will have to decide whether we will focus on assigning blame or actually try to find solutions to people’s problems.”
‘How many more will die?’
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman slammed the Sindh government for “playing with the lives and health of Karachi’s citizens” in the name of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects.
Speaking to the media in Karachi, he said the construction of the projects had resulted in the destruction of roads. “BRT projects in Karachi should be stopped due to their numerous flaws, which are causing traffic issues and endangering lives,” he said, as he went on to speak about the incident at Nipa.
“ Today, a boy fell into a gutter and died [sic],” he said, questioning that “how many more will die?”. He held the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation responsible for the incident and condemned the incident.
The JI chief’s accusation apparently stemmed from the digging at University Road between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology for the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project.
The city’s roads were also dug for BRT projects, which Rehman said the authorities should abandon, citing concerns over the safety and well-being of citizens. Referring to frequent road accidents and incidents such as people falling into manholes, he questioned, “Who will take responsibility for the 3.5 crore population of Karachi?”
He said Karachi was generating 90 per cent tax revenue in the country but still faced problems.
“The Sindh government has collected 3,306 billion rupees in  taxes, infrastructure funds, and development charges, but has failed to utilise these funds for the development of Karachi. Instead, they engaged  in corruption,” he alleged.
He appealed to the people of Karachi to join the JI in its efforts to hold the government accountable and fight against land grabbers and corruption.
Past incidents
Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger. The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes.
In September, three sanitation workers died by falling into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood.
In May, a six-year-old boy fell into an open manhole in Karachi and drowned, causing a a protest by residents and politicians which prompted the police to register a case.
In April, the body of a young girl was recovered from a drain in Liaqatabad after being reported missing.</p><small>2025-12-01 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01120348671bf79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958506/pindi-atc-directs-to-unfreeze-shaukat-khanum-memorial-trust-namal-university-bank-accounts' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi ATC directs to unfreeze Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust, Namal University bank accounts</strong></a><br><p>A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court issued directives on Monday for unfreezing the bank accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust (SKTM) and Namal University in Mianwali.
Judge Amjad Hussain Shah issued the instructions in a case pertaining to November 26 protests last year, in which incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, has been facing legal proceedings.
SKTM, a charitable organisation established under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 of Pakistan, and Namal University were both set up by Imran. The bank accounts of the two institutions were said to have been inadvertently frozen following the issuance of an arrest warrant against Aleema in the case.
During today’s proceedings, Shah heard arguments on Aleema’s application for unfreezing her bank accounts. Representatives of the SKTM also attended the hearing and presented arguments in favour of restoring the bank accounts.
For his part, prosecutor Zaheer Shah clarified that the prosecution had never sought, either verbally or in writing, the freezing of SKTM’s or Namal University’s bank accounts.
He also pointed out that there was no court order specifically directing relevant authorities to freeze the bank accounts of the two institutions.
The prosecutor contended that the confusion over the matter originated from an order sent to the State Bank of Pakistan in which Aleema’s identity card number was referenced.
“The state bank conducted a data search based on her CNIC, and during this process, these accounts also came up,” he said, adding that they were subsequently frozen.
He further clarified that the prosecution had no objection to the unfreezing of SKTM’s or Namal University’s bank accounts, but also stressed that Aleema’s personal and business accounts, which were frozen under the same order, should remain blocked.
Following the completion of the arguments, the judge ordered the unfreezing of the bank accounts of the two institutions and upheld the court’s earlier decision regarding Aleema’s personal bank accounts.
Criticism over account closure
Earlier, a wave of criticism had erupted over the closure of the bank accounts of SKMT, as many feared that it could affect the supply of medicines and treatment for cancer patients.
SKTM operates the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centres in Lahore and Peshawar, with construction underway for a third location in Karachi. The facilities were established with the aim of providing quality cancer care to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay. Thousands of deser­ving patients have been receiving free treatment every day at these hospitals.
On the closure of bank accounts, SKMT had assured the public that efforts were under way to have the frozen accounts restored and that the hospital would ensure uninterrupted medicine supply to the 75 per cent patients who were receiving free treatment.
Meanwhile, some users on social media linked the matter to Judge Shah’s directives in the case against Aleema and claimed that despite being informed abo­ut patient-related difficulties and Aleema’s appearance in the court, he had not susp­e­­nded his order. Similar claims were made about Namal University’s bank accounts as Aleema was a board member.
Nov 26 protest case
The case pertains to allegations brought under various sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in connection with protests and unrest linked to last year’s November 26 protest.
The protest saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”.
Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the ATA. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations.
Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.</p><small>2025-12-01 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01124050e65712a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958509/we-have-no-verifiable-information-about-his-condition-imrans-son-kasim-voices-fears-for-fathers-safety' target='_blank'><strong>‘We have no verifiable information about his condition’: Imran’s son Kasim voices fears for father’s safety</strong></a><br><p>Jailed PTI founder Imran Khan’s son, Kasim Khan, fears that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
The remarks come as the PTI and Imran’s sisters have protested and staged sit-ins outside Adiala jail, where he is imprisoned, after being barred from meeting him for over three weeks.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked and rumours swirl about possible prison transfers, Kasim told Reuters the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the ex-prime minister, despite a judicial order for weekly meetings.
“Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,” he said in written remarks, adding that there had been no independently confirmed communication for a couple of months.
“Today we have no verifiable information at all about his condition,” he added. “Our greatest fear is that something irreversible is being hidden from us.”
The family has repeatedly sought access for Imran’s personal physician, who has not been allowed to examine him for more than a year, he added.

 

The interior ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a jail official told Reuters that Imran was in good health, adding that he was not aware of any plan for a move to a higher-security facility.
Imran, 72, has been in jail since August 2023, convicted in a string of cases he says were politically driven following his ouster in a 2022 no-confidence vote.
His first conviction was in the Toshakhana case and centred on accusations that he unlawfully sold gifts received in office. Later verdicts added lengthy jail terms, including 10 years in the cipher case and 14 years in the Al Qadir Trust corruption case.
The PTI has alleged that the prosecution’s aim in cases against Imran was to exclude him from public life and elections, which were held in 2024.
Family anxiety deepened by lack of information
Imran’s family says the lack of communication has fuelled fears over what it calls a deliberate effort to push Imran out of public sight.
“This isolation is intentional,” Kasim said, referring to the authorities he believes are keeping his father cut off.
“They are scared of him. He is Pakistan’s most popular leader, and they know they cannot defeat him democratically.”
Kasim and his older brother Suleiman Isa Khan, who live in London with their mother, Jemima Goldsmith, have kept a distance from Pakistan’s politics.
The brothers have spoken publicly only sparingly, mainly about their father’s imprisonment.
Kasim added that the last time they saw their father was in November 2022, when they visited Pakistan after he survived an assassination attempt.
“That image has stayed with me ever since. Seeing our father in that state is something you don’t forget,” Kasim said.
“We were told he would recover with time. Now, after weeks of total silence and no proof of life, that memory carries a different weight.”
The family was pursuing internal and external avenues, such as appeals to international human rights organisations, and wanted court-ordered access restored immediately, he said.
“This is not just a political dispute,” Kasim said. “It is a human rights emergency. Pressure must come from every direction. We draw strength from him, but we need to know he is safe.”
Meanwhile, Jemima responded to an interview between Zeteo’s Mehdi Hasan and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, wherein the latter says Imran’s sons can meet their father.
“They’re not even allowed to speak to him on the phone. No one is,” she said.






</p><small>2025-12-01 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0111353118d5a98.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958508/india-orders-smartphone-makers-to-preload-state-owned-cyber-safety-app' target='_blank'><strong>India orders smartphone makers to preload state-owned cyber safety app</strong></a><br><p>India’s telecoms ministry has privately asked smartphone makers to preload all new devices with a state-owned cyber security app that cannot be deleted, a government order showed, a move likely to antagonise Apple and privacy advocates.
India is one of the world’s largest telephone markets, with more than 1.2 billion subscribers, and government figures show the app, launched in January, has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones, including 50,000 in October alone.
Apple, which has previously locked horns with the telecoms regulator over development of a government anti-spam mobile app, is among the companies, such as Samsung, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi bound by the new order.

 

The November 28 order, seen by Reuters, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government’s Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it.
For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the ministry said in its order, which was not made public and was sent privately to select companies.
The government said the app was essential to combat “serious endangerment” of telecom cyber security from duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers, which enable scams and network misuse.
Apple’s iOS powered an estimated 4.5 per cent of 735 million smartphones in India by mid-2025, with the rest using Android, Counterpoint Research says.
Telecom cyber security
While Apple pre-installs its own proprietary apps on phones, its internal policies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before sale of a smartphone, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
“Apple has historically refused such requests from governments,” said Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint.
“It’s likely to seek a middle ground: instead of a mandatory pre-install, they might negotiate and ask for an option to nudge users towards installing the app.”
Apple, Google, Samsung and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India’s telecoms ministry also did not respond.
A 14- to 17-digit number unique to each handset, the IMEI, or International Mobile Equipment Identity, is most commonly used to cut off network access for phones reported to have been stolen.
The government app allows users to report suspicious calls, verify IMEIs and block stolen devices through a central registry.
With more than 5 million downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7 million stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30 million fraudulent connections have also been terminated.
The government says it helps prevent cyber threats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.</p><small>2025-12-01 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28170621daf2c43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956503/the-crisis-no-one-sees-how-climate-change-is-rewriting-childhood-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>The crisis no one sees: How climate change is rewriting childhood in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>“My son used to be a happy child. Now, he won’t even step outside to play,” says a 28-year-old mother from Sanghar, a district in Sindh reeling from the devastation wreaked by the disastrous 2022 floods. “He clings to me and says that if he goes far, the floods will come again.”
“He fears he will lose me,” she adds.
The mother’s concerns and her son’s fears reflect a dimension of climate change that eludes discussions in policy circles: the psychological toll of disasters on children. While Pakistan has taken steps toward building climate resilience in recent years, this one fundamental gap remains unaddressed.
For many children across Sindh, Balochistan, Southern Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, floods do not end when the waters recede; they simply move inward. This boy’s trauma is not an isolated case; in fact, it shows a much larger, growing crisis.
Based on interviews conducted with parents in Sindh following the 2022 floods, approximately 70 per cent of participants reported that their children exhibited depressive symptoms linked to the fear of floods. Although the study provides valuable insights, research on the mental health impacts of climate-related disasters on children in Pakistan remains limited.
Nonetheless, similar challenges have been observed in other provinces, suggesting that flood-related anxiety and depression among children represent a broader, nationwide concern.
Unmasking trauma
These mental health challenges extend beyond the borders of Sindh, spreading far across the country, into villages nestled between mountains and ancient towns sitting on riverbanks.
Children in low and middle-income countries, such as Pakistan, are particularly vulnerable to climate change and the disasters it triggers, due to several biological, social, economic, and infrastructural factors. The same was also highlighted in a review published in PubMed Central, the premier source for biomedical literature.

 

Yet, despite growing attention to climate-resilient infrastructure and disaster response, Pakistan’s policies largely ignore the emotional aftershocks of catastrophic events.
In Sanghar, the 28-year-old mother sees the tremor of the 2022 disaster in her son every day. “If we force him to go to school in the morning, he complains of a headache or tummy pain,” she sighed. “But the doctors say there is nothing physically wrong with him.”
But psychologically, these aches mask deeper anxiety and trauma.
Unfortunately in Pakistan, mental health services are almost non-existent, and field visits to flood-affected districts reveal this stark reality. The seats of clinical psychologists at local health facilities and the positions for psychiatrists often remain vacant.
Without these services, children and families cannot fully recover or benefit from social protection measures.
Scattered promises
Pakistan’s social protection system comprises initiatives such as the Benazir Income Support Programme and the Benazir Nashonuma Programme, which primarily focus on income transfers, food security, and infrastructure support during and after emergencies.
They are vital lifelines for many families. But rarely do these programmes include mental health screening, counselling or community-based trauma support.
And this — ignoring psychosocial needs — undermines recovery. It is important to understand that a child struggling with anxiety cannot fully benefit from education or cash support programmes, and parents coping with trauma face additional barriers in rebuilding livelihoods.
Even though promising efforts have been undertaken in recent times, these attempts remain scattered.



In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the government is piloting a Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) model in partnership with German development agency GIZ, training a “Hamdard Force” of 500 community volunteers, equipping 80 primary-care doctors to identify and manage common mental health conditions, and deploying clinical psychologists to guide and supervise care.
This is one of the few government-led initiatives aimed at building a tiered mental health system at the community level. As important as these efforts are, they are still fragmented, provisional and donor-dependent, with no integration into Pakistan’s broader climate or social protection policies.
That said, Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and National Climate Change Policy are increasingly integrating resilience planning, structural defences, and early-warning systems to address escalating risks from floods, glacial lake outburst floods, and shifting monsoon patterns.
Notably, the NDMA’s National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (2025–2030) acknowledges the need for psychosocial support in recovery. However, such support is still not embedded as a consistent or well-funded component, and much of the actual service delivery for disaster-affected populations continues to rely on non-government organisations and short-term interventions.
The cost of ignoring mental health
When the mental health of our children is ignored, the cost borne is not just that of social injustice, but also economic. According to a 2022 National Commission for Human Rights report, the economic burden of untreated mental illness in Pakistan has been estimated at $6.2 billion, due to reduced productivity, lost opportunities, and underemployment.
The report also warns that because mental health services are poorly regulated, many unqualified actors provide counselling, thus exposing vulnerable people to human rights abuses, as the state fails to invest in ethical and accountable mental health care effectively. These figures underscore how mental illness is not only a health crisis but a drain on national development and resilience.
Untreated trauma in children has consequences that are seen far beyond the immediate fiscal loss. Persistent anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder can impair cognitive development, reduce school attendance, and limit future productivity, which in turn undermines investments in education and social protection.

 

If Pakistan is serious about adaptive social protection, mental health must be treated as non-negotiable. Practically, this means integrating psychosocial support into disaster response, training community health workers and school counsellors nationwide, establishing trauma support units in high-risk districts, incorporating mental health indicators into social protection targeting, and ensuring that every climate response plan addresses emotional well-being.
Recent climate-related disasters have brought to the forefront the reality of not only rising water but also rising emotional vulnerability. Children exposed to such catastrophes face a higher risk of psychological illnesses, resulting in long-term consequences, including chronic mental health conditions, impaired social development and difficulty in coping with adulthood. If left unaddressed, this burden can accumulate across generations, undermining the effectiveness of broader social protection efforts.
It is therefore essential to open conversations on this crisis — invisible but indispensable. Protecting children is not just limited to the provision of food, shelter, and education; it is also about ensuring their mental and emotional well-being.
The fears of the child in Sanghar, who is afraid of losing his mother to another flood, are not only heartbreaking but also preventable. If Pakistan wishes to build genuine resilience, it must ensure that policies and social protection measures systematically integrate mental health interventions alongside disaster response and recovery efforts.

Pak-EPA enforcement team inspects a vehicle for smoke emission under the ongoing vehicular emission testing drive in Islamabad on Sunday. — White Star

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency on Sunday warned owners of smoke-emitting vehicles of stringent action across the federal capital.
It said any vehicle found releasing excessive emissions will face strict punitive measures.
In a statement, Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zaib Ali said the agency had intensified its enforcement operations as part of ongoing efforts to curb vehicular pollution, which she described as a major contributor to deteriorating air quality and recurring smog episodes in Islamabad.
She said enforcement teams were carrying out regular inspections on major roads, intersections and high-traffic corridors to identify vehicles emitting excessive smoke. Violators would face on-the-spot fines, confiscation of vehicles, or both, depending on the severity of the offence, she added.
Ms Nazia reminded the public that driving a vehicle emitting smoke beyond permissible limits, particularly the thick black smoke from poorly maintained engines, constituted an environmental crime under federal environmental laws.
“Let me be very clear, smoke-emitting vehicles will not be allowed to operate in Islamabad under any circumstances,” she warned. “This is not just a regulatory matter. It is a public health emergency. Vehicular smoke is poisoning the air our children breathe. We will take every lawful measure, including heavy fines and confiscation, to stop this environmental crime.”
She said the agency’s heightened vigilance stemmed from growing alarm over the increasing number of vehicles, particularly diesel buses, trucks, wagons, Qingqi rickshaws and motorcycles that continue to ply roads without proper maintenance, releasing hazardous emissions that harm both the environment and human health.
Pak-EPA said vehicular emissions remained a major source of outdoor air pollution and heat-trapping carbon emissions in urban centres. The smoke released from vehicles contained harmful pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and un-burnt hydrocarbons, all of which degraded air quality and contribute to smog formation.
Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, penetrated deep into the lungs and could enter the bloodstream. Long-term exposure increased the risk of chronic respiratory diseases, heart conditions, stroke and premature death.
The World Health Organisation has repeatedly stated that air pollution is among the top global environmental health risks, causing millions of premature deaths each year.
The statement said Islamabad’s winter months typically brought stagnant air and temperature inversions that trapped pollutants close to the ground, intensifying smog episodes. Vehicular smoke, when combined with dust and industrial pollutants, formed thick layers of toxic air that reduced visibility and trigger respiratory illnesses.
Local health experts said smoke from polluting vehicles was a key cause of respiratory distress, chronic cough, asthma attacks, allergies and eye irritation. Children, the elderly and individuals with cardiac or pulmonary diseases face heightened risks.
Prolonged exposure could impair lung development in children, while medical specialists warned of increased risks of heart attacks and worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Public health data also linked vehicular pollution with higher rates of bronchitis, pneumonia and certain cancers.
Ms Nazia stressed that addressing air pollution could not be left solely to enforcement teams. It called on citizens to act responsibly by cooperating during inspections, maintaining smoke-free vehicles, reporting polluting vehicles and encouraging adherence to environmental laws.
“Cleaner air is a shared national responsibility. If citizens cooperate with us, we can significantly reduce pollution levels and protect the health of millions,” she added.

When asked to specify how long it would last, Trump said he had “no time limit” in mind for the measure, which the Department of Homeland Security says is linked to a list of 19 countries already facing US travel restrictions.
“We don’t want those people,” Trump continued. “You know why we don’t want them? Because many have been no good, and they shouldn’t be in our country.”
The Trump administration issued the pause in the aftermath of the shooting in Washington on November 26, that left 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom dead and another guardsman critically wounded.
A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident.
Lakanwal had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and entered the United States as part of a resettlement programme following the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
Lakanwal had been granted asylum in April 2025, under the Trump administration, but officials have blamed what they called lax vetting by the government of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden for his admission to US soil during the Afghan airlift.
Trump wrote after the shooting he planned to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover”.
Asked which nationalities would be affected, the Department of Homeland Security pointed AFP to a list of 19 countries — including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar — which since June have all faced travel restrictions to the United States.</p><small>2025-12-01 05:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/692cf1dd9c290.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958472/imf-report-light-on-substance' target='_blank'><strong>IMF report: light on substance</strong></a><br><p>THE much-awaited IMF assessment of Pakistan’s governance and corruption landscape has triggered chatter on talk shows and social media. For a report that likely cost the country close to $10 million, it is a disappointment. The information and analysis it provides and the messages it conveys, could easily have been communicated in one-tenth of its length. What we have received instead is a long, self-righteous document whose 186 pages carry far more physical weight than the weight of any original insight or substance.
Much of it is dense verbiage and platitudes — a superficial bureaucratic sputter being presented as a forensic investigation unearthing high crime. Embellished by loads of hearsay it is essentially a compendium of heavily padded restatement and recycling of issues, findings and diagnoses long known to Pakistanis and analysed to exhaustion in the media. There is plenty of development-speak and rhetorical flourish but little that deepens understanding, and even less that charts new, sharper directions and frameworks for reform.
The only quantitative metric offered to demonstrate the scale of corruption — and which set off animated discussions in the media — is the report’s sensational claim that NAB recovered Rs5.3 trillion in the last two years, equivalent to four per cent of GDP. No evidence, source, or methodology drawn on for verification seemingly accompanies this number in a report that sermonises transparency and accountability. In fact, NAB’s own website does not confirm it; instead, it cites a cumulative recovery of Rs6.7tr over its entire 25-year existence. Furthermore, the report does not provide a breakdown of this figure — cash recovered, the paper valuations of public land reclaimed and the settlements reached. And it is silent on the number of corruption cases resolved or on the action taken against the perpetrators of the crimes.
The exaggerated “success” being implied would denote that NAB outperformed every other public institution, including the FBR — to the point where, on the basis of “mobilising” the equivalent of 2pc of GDP annually, we could theoretically dispense with the services of FBR altogether. Yet, in the same breath, the report assails NAB for being seen as an instrument employed by successive governments to hound political opponents. The contradiction is glaring.
The most serious shortcoming of the report is its failure to undertake a thoughtful examination of the policies that create incentives for malfeasance. While it correctly identifies institutional weaknesses in taxation, regulation, SOEs and anti-corruption enforcement, it falls short of confronting the more profound, challenging and uncomfortable question of why these institutions perform poorly. While targeting institutional inadequacies, regulatory gaps in oversight functions and uneven enforcement by those tasked with this mandate, it ignores the policy frameworks that furnish continuing openings for corruption.

A fundamental weakness in the report is the reluctance to admit the role of external agencies.

Institutions do not become corrupt in a vacuum. They are corrupted by the policy frameworks that facilitate discretion, arbitrary taxation, rent-laden exemptions, distortions and subsidies. By focusing narrowly on “institutional inadequacies” and regulatory lapses, the report sidesteps identification of the specific policy choices that create these openings and opportunities in the first place. It avoids probing these underlying distortions.
This omission is hardly accidental. It is for a good reason. Both domestic and external actors crafted the policies, systems and structures that created the incentives and opportunities for corruption underlying the governance failures of the institutions. And many of the very policies that have generated corruption-enabling distortions were either endorsed, incentivised or directly pushed by the IMF and its multilateral partners over decades.

 

The report chastises Pakistan’s opaque, excessively complex and distortionary tax regime — yet conveniently forgets that its bizarre architecture was fabricated on the IMF’s watch and endorsed by it, supposedly its core competence: additional customs duties, regulatory duties, super tax, minimum tax, turnover tax, CVT, deemed income assessments, surcharges, levies and a labyrinth of withholding taxes with multiple rates. In several instances, the ad hoc and distortionary measures and instruments were forced upon the country by the IMF in its overriding quest to raise revenues, regardless of the economic cost to the country. The resulting mutilated structure violates the Fund’s own best-practice norms and global advice.
Therefore, a fundamental weakness in the report is the striking reluctance to admit the role of external agencies in the enduring governance and fiscal frameworks and agendas. It conveniently feigns ignorance of the role played by the IMF and multilaterals under the nearly $1 billion in policy-based loans for tax reforms, complete with extensive conditionalities and technical assistance, which contributed materially to shaping the very institutional structures and systems the IMF is now criticising. There is barely any critique of the distortionary policies repeatedly sanctioned through IMF and multilateral programmes and policy loans — even though several members of the 15-person team that authored the report were involved in these interventions.
For example, it expediently overlooks the multilaterals’ own contributions to the regulatory nightmare confronting businesses and the current dysfunction in the energy sector, and who complain about commitments not being honoured, yet see no contradiction in repeatedly lending to a spoilt child whose behaviour hasn’t changed. To sum up, the report sermonises governance while shirking in practice; sidestepping responsibility for the distortions these agencies, and especially the IMF, assisted in designing. This approach smacks of intellectual dishonesty.
Finally, the report dwells at length on the governance failures of previous governments, strikingly leaving untouched the present set-up’s feeble and compromised governance through law rather than under law (rule by law instead of rule of law), ad hoc regulations, opaque decision-making, arbitrary and poorly designed tax measures. The IMF mentions “data cut-off dates”, but this explanation is unconvincing considering the declared sweep and ambition of the assessment. This selective framing — severe and rigorous on the past, but mute on the present — dilutes its neutrality and diminishes its analytical credibility.

That is why its security and foreign policy has, over the decades, been predicated on avoiding having to deal simultaneously with external threats on two borders. This policy was shaped by the exigencies of the country’s formative years when it was confronted with a hostile India and contested borders on both its western and eastern flanks bequeathed by colonialism. An early conflict with India and continuing tensions over Kashmir was accompanied by irredentist claims of successive Afghan governments, who questioned the border with Pakistan, demarcated as the Durand Line by the British.
The tyranny of geography imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan. But the lesson learnt from the country’s early years was the strategic imperative of keeping one front defused as active military engagement on both borders was regarded as unsustainable. This was not something Pakistan could always control, but its security strategy aimed at averting a double squeeze from two hot borders. This is exemplified by Pakistan’s efforts to prevent any flare-up of tensions with India in the 1980s during its long involvement in the US-led military campaign against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.
It is also illustrated by the post-9/11 decade when Pakistan became a front-line state in the US ‘war on terror’ and cooperated in the US/ Nato effort to defeat the Taliban and terrorist groups based in Afghanistan. India’s military mobilisation along the border after a terror attack on the Indian parliament in 2002 compelled Pakistan to deal with two hot fronts for some time. But US mediation helped to end the Pakistan-India military stand-off. What followed was perhaps the longest period of uninterrupted diplomatic engagement between the two countries in a ‘composite dialogue’. In fact, one of president Pervez Musharraf’s ‘asks’ of the Americans then was for Washington to ‘watch’ Pakistan’s ‘back’ while Pakistani forces were engaged on the Afghan border. The US administration obliged.
Today however, Pakistan faces a three-front security challenge. On the eastern front an implacable foe continues to issue threats and insist its ‘Operation Sindoor’ — the name of its military action against Pakistan in May — is not over. On the western frontier, Pakistan and Afghanistan remain engaged in hostilities. Pakistan also alleges active collusion between Kabul and New Delhi in terrorist attacks on the country. The third front is at home, reflected in the surge in militant attacks that is undermining domestic peace and stability.
This is unprecedented as never before has the country had to deal simultaneously with three fronts. The only bright spot is improved ties between Pakistan and Iran that has helped to address border management problems. This is an encouraging development considering the two neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile strikes in January 2024 over activities of militant Baloch groups on both sides of the border.
Relations with Afghanistan have hit a record low because of the Taliban’s unwillingness to act against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that continues cross-border terror attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries and poses a grave threat to Pakistan’s security. With several rounds of talks yielding little, an increasingly frustrated Islamabad was forced to adopt a coercive policy towards Kabul, especially as Pakistani casualties mounted in terror attacks.

Pakistan faces two hot borders and an internal security challenge.

In October, deadly clashes erupted on the border. Pakistan launched air strikes against militant targets in Afghanistan including Kabul while Afghan forces attacked multiple border posts in response. Pakistan retaliated with fierce cross-border strikes. A ceasefire was reached through mediation by Qatar and Turkiye. But subsequent talks ended in deadlock as the Taliban declined to give a written commitment to stop TTP attacks.

 

The border remains closed and trade suspended. Islamabad seems to have concluded that with diplomatic efforts exhausted the only option is kinetic as sustained military pressure might have a deterrent effect on the Taliban’s permissive attitude and support for TTP. This is designed to inflict pain on Kabul. But it also entails costs for Pakistan not only in terms of lost trade (annual Pakistani exports are just over $1 billion), but also in overstretching its resources. Pakistani officials acknowledge this but argue they are left with little choice. Nevertheless, prolonged tensions will mean Pakistan’s attention and military resources will have to increasingly be directed or diverted to its western border from the east, despite the latter front being unstable.
In the face of continuing Indian belligerence and intimidatory military exercises near its border Pakistan cannot afford to lower its guard. With the Indian leadership apparently wanting to avenge its setback in the May conflict with Pakistan, Islamabad cannot leave anything to chance. True, India took no knee-jerk action after the recent Delhi bomb blast. But recently when its defence minister provocatively suggested that borders can change and Sindh could one day ‘return to India’, Islamabad condemned this as “a threat to regional stability”.
Given New Delhi’s hostility and absent any communication between the two countries, a high degree of unpredictability and risk of miscalculation characterises the situation. Pakistan thus has to keep a watchful eye on the western front and remain in a state of military preparedness. The existential threat after all can come from India, not Afghanistan.
While Pakistan may be unable to do much in the near term to defuse either of the two external fronts (ideally the Afghan front should be over time) the home front is what it can and should control. Two provinces are afflicted by insurgency while terrorists are also striking across the country. Despite notable counterterrorism gains, the internal security situation remains troubling with rising fatalities from terrorism likely to make 2025 the deadliest year in a decade.
Pakistan needs a more effective counterterrorism strategy. Strengthened border controls must involve zero tolerance for corruption and criminality that allow militant movement. The government should also evolve a differentiated approach to deal with militant violence in Balochistan and KP. In Balochistan, the underlying sources of long-standing public disaffection need to be addressed. Law enforcement should be accompanied by political and economic measures to win hearts and minds. Effective counter-insurgency operations in KP require rising above partisan politics for better coordination with the opposition-controlled province to secure community support.
Defeating militant violence ‘within’ is a strategic compulsion as a continuing three-front situation is obviously untenable.

They said that the programme was already approved by cabinet but an agreement was being vetted and go-ahead was awaited to start granting compensation of Rs1 million for the deceased below 60 years and half of the amount to the ones above 60 years. “The summary has also been approved by the cabinet,” they added.
According to officials, the government has been spending Rs37 billion on free treatment of 11 million families of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa annually under which more than five million people have availed free services since 2016, costing Rs130 billion.
They said that the move was meant to further strengthen Sehat Card Plus (SCP), and benefit the relatives of people passing away during treatment under the flagship programme of the PTI government. The programme was approved by former chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur and will be implemented when formalities are fulfilled because it is a policy decision.

 

The government has pledged Rs4.5 billion and authorities concerned have started work on the programme including devising mechanism for distributing the amount to the heirs of deceased people and how the amount will be received with specifications about the share of husband, wife, sons and daughters.
Bereaved families will be required to present a certificate issued by National Database Registration Authority and death certificate by the relevant hospital, confirming that the deceased was the head of his or her family.
“The scheme will be implemented by State Life Insurance Corporation, the executor of free treatment scheme in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with which an agreement has been signed but final notification is awaited,” said officials.
They said that the programme, if implemented would also increase hospitalisations under SCP. The free healthcare insurance scheme also benefits those people, who are admitted to hospitals.
Another programme was launched in July, under which free OPD services are available to deserving people in four districts including Mardan, Malakand, Kohat and Chitral. The scheme to benefit 120,000 families in each of the four districts has been started with Rs2 billion financial assistance of the government of Germany.
Officials said that the government focused on free health schemes as under it the number of beneficiaries included 53 per cent women, most those having maternal issues.
The largest group of beneficiaries of the scheme is in the age bracket of 10 to 39 years, accounting for 42 per cent of recipients while 28 per cent of beneficiaries are between 40 to 59 years. The number of beneficiaries in the age group of up to four years is four per cent.
“The new scheme will also ensure financial assistance to the families of patients over 60 years in case of death,” said officials.
SCP has enabled people to seek healthcare services in costly private hospitals in addition to public sector medical teaching institutions without any spending any amount from their own pockets.
“The new plan will also prove very helpful for elderly people, who are bedridden in their homes. People will rush them to hospitals to improve their quality of life as the services are free on SCP and they will get compensation as well,” said officials.

Addressing a ceremony at Jamia Islamia, he said that Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam to establish a justice-based system but situation in the country was quite different. He said that it was the fundamental responsibility of government to give people their rights and implement a comprehensive system for a prosperous economy.
“Today the Constitution has been turned into a toy. Powerful groups get laws passed from parliament according to their own interests. The wishes of people are being continuously trampled,” alleged Mr Rehman.







He said that JUI-F was a party to 26th Amendment that was passed last year to pave the way for doing away with interest, empowering Federal Shariat Court, bringing the recommendations of Council of Islamic Ideology to parliament and registering religious seminaries. But even after lapse of a year, the registration of seminaries was still awaited, he added.

JUI-F chief says Pakistan failed to establish friendly ties with Afghanistan in 78 years

The JUI-F chief said that 27th Amendment was passed through a fake majority that allowed every citizen of Pakistan to change gender. “By adding a clause that those under 18 years of age cannot be considered adults, Islamic teachings have been mocked. Declaring the marriage of a minor as rape and calling children born from such a union illegitimate is a grave act against the society, law and religion of Islam,” he added.
He said that JUI-F would never compromise on its principles. He said that Bangladesh made economic progress as the value of Pakistani currency was low than Taka. He said that Imran Khan was accused of following western agenda, but the current rulers were promoting the same agenda.
“Work on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was halted during the Imran Khan government, but the current government has not added even a single brick to it,” he said. He said that generals were given benefits and extensions in service in the past and the same practice still continued. “The registration of seminaries was blocked before and is still blocked today,” he added.
He said that he had no personal differences with Imran Khan rather with his policies. “If a movement was launched against him then another will be launched again today if needed,” he added.
About Afghan policy of the government, Mr Rehman said that during the last 78 years, Pakistan had not been able to establish friendly ties with Afghanistan. “You only know war; this issue will not be solved by you. There should be no war between the two countries. There is no room for armed conflict within Pakistan either. A serious review of policies is necessary for peace in the region,” he added.

KARACHI: While the Sindh government appears to be overzealous about strict implementation of e-challans, the responsibility of traffic engineering remains scattered among multiple entities, hindering the development of a seamless and efficient transportation network in Karachi.
Sources told Dawn that the absence of a unified traffic engineering authority was a significant obstacle to designing and implementing solutions — from road design to traffic signal timing — leaving the city’s traffic stuck in multiple gridlocks.
They said that the challenging task of traffic engineering and management was at present shared among multiple entities, including the Traffic Engineering Bureau (TEB) of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) and cantonment boards, leading to lack of clear accountability and coordination.
Primarily the complex task of traffic engineering, including installation of traffic signals and signs, is the responsibility of the TEB, which has been barely able to maintain the already installed signals due to “constant financial constraints”, they said.
The KDA said that its TEB maintained 90 out of total 130 traffic signals across the city, while 40 by different cantonment boards.
However, the sources said that TEB maintained only 50 out of 90 signals under its domain and remaining were out of order and required extensive repair works.
KDA Director General Asif Jan Siddiqui said that the authority was barely maintaining the traffic signals due to financial constraints.
Plan to set up traffic management company
The sources said that the provincial government was considering setting up a new company, to be called the Karachi Traffic Management Company (KTMC), for managing traffic engineering responsibilities of the entire city.
The sources said that the company would be responsible for installation of new signals, repair of signals, road and lane markings, U turns and zebra crossings.
Confiding this to Dawn, the sources said that different proposals for setting up a regular body for improving traffic flow and reducing congestion were discussed at high-level meetings.
They said that the proposed company would be headed by the Karachi mayor as its chairman, with commissioner and experts from the private sector as its members.
They said that that the TEB would be merged into the proposed company.
Recently, DIG Traffic Pir Muhammad Shah had also informed industrialists belonging to the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry about the proposal, saying it had already been submitted to the government and the proposed company would receive a share of challan revenue to fund improvements in road infrastructure.
When contacted, the Karachi commissioner said that the proposal was still at a “conceptual stage”.
The sources said that there was another proposal under discussion to bring TEB altogether under the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.
SMTA installing signals
While the installation of traffic signals is still the responsibility of the TEB, the SMTA has apparently taken over the task as it said that it had installed 11 new traffic signals in different parts of the city, including Model Colony, Gulberg, Tipu Sultan Road, Gurumandir, Kamran Chowrangi and Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Steel Township Crossing.
SMTA Managing Director Kanwal Nizam Bhutto told Dawn that besides installation of 18 new traffic signals, the authority had also upgraded 24 out of 27 signals in the city under an Annual Development Plan scheme.
Moreover, the SMTA has also installed as many as 243 traffic sign boards on different locations on Shahrah-i-Quaideen, Shaheed-i-Millat Road, Rashid Minhas Road, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Saddar.

Speaking at a news conference, the minister expected the federal and provincial stakeholders of the national finance commission (NFC) would lead to an outcome in the spirit of “Pakistan First” like they had delivered National Fiscal Pact and introduced agriculture income tax (AIT) through provincial legislations. “I look forward to good and constructive discussions with provincial finance ministers and chief ministers” on Dec 4, he said.







He said the nature of NFC was to have consensus mainly on revenue, expenditure and governance and there was no dispute that as a nation the country required not only structural but institutional reforms as also highlighted in the IMF’s governance and corruption diagnostic assessment (GCDA) on the request of Pakistan government.

 

He said it was a separate discussion if there would be AIT collection but it was a fact that for the first time in history, the provinces have legislated AIT. Likewise, expenditures are also required to be made collectively on the pattern of KYC (know your customer) in the banking sector and in line with Anti-Money Laundering Act as Pakistan had only recent graduated out of Financial Action Task Force watch list and could not afford slipping back.

Warns against gold rush to economic growth

That was why the ToRs for the NFC meeting were set in a manner that all the provinces would present their positions and the centre would do the same and listen to each other and take the process forward in an appropriate manner. He said both the federation and the provinces would have to contribute to enhance revenue mobilisation to run the country sustainably. “You cannot run the country on 8-10pc tax-to-GDP ratio,” he said.
“We don’t have to go into gold rush. We have to make economic growth sustainable and for that we have to keep a close eye on balance of payments and current account,” otherwise which finance minister would not like such a key performance indicator, the minister said.
“It is very easy to pump liquidity and have consumption led growth but we would like to have export-led growth,” he said. It was in this direction that the government was making a decisive shift tow­ards an inclusive, private-sector-driven and export-led growth model, he asserted, adding that the PM had set up seven to eight working groups of private sector leaders. He said the abolition of 0.25pc Export Development Surcharge (EDS) after almost four decades was a key demonstration of this commitment.
He said one of the working group had recommended transferring operations of export development fund (EDF) to the private sector and till addressing its governance-related issues, suggested suspending the EDS. But the premier abolished the levy imposed in 1991, he said, adding that a summary had already been moved to the cabinet for formal approval to abolish the EDS.
Shortfall
However, the minister sidestepped a question about the trigger points for contingency measures in the wake of revenue shortfall of about Rs580bn in first five months, saying the revenues should not be seen in the context of targets but a healthy 11pc growth.
About GCD report, the minister said it was part of the government’s broader agenda of institutional strengthening. He said the report had been requested by and developed in consultation with the government through more than 100 meetings. He said the report prioritised 15 key reforms many of which relating to taxation, governance, public financial management, and procurement were already under implementation phase.
He insisted the report’s findings should be viewed in the context of long-standing structural challenges and said the government was strongly determined to advance the remaining recommendations as structural reforms without institutional refo­rms were meaningless and unsustainable. “This is why the government considers the report a catalyst for accelerating reforms rather than a criticism of current policy direction,” he said.
The minister said export performance had strengthened, with overall exports rising 5pc and IT services exports growing by over 20pc year-on-year. He said the IT sector had recorded back-to-back monthly records in September and October, establishing itself as a critical pillar of the “new economy”.
He said the announcement of US Exim Bank joining the $3.5bn Reko Diq syndication, led by IFC had helped achieve financial close for the project following an end to US-government shutdown. He said the financial close will represent a transformational investment that will generate an estimated $2.8-$2.9bn in annual exports once production commences.
Also, the inaugural panda bond in the Chinese market would be issued in December, but no later than Chinese New year. Besides, remittance would be surpassing $41bn this year from $38bn last year, he added.
Responding to questions, he said the government would get out of commodity business sooner the better.

According to a notification from the Petroleum Division, the new HSD price is Rs279.65 per litre, while the new rate for petrol is Rs263.45. The prices will come into effect on December 1.
“The government has revised the prices of the petroleum products based on recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority),” a notification from the Petroleum Division stated.
Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-01 03:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01080248f47e717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958453/pti-to-stay-calm-despite-being-pushed-towards-conflict-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to stay calm despite being pushed towards conflict: KP CM</strong></a><br><p>• Afridi announces weekly protests outside IHC, Adiala jail• Claims Imran kept in isolation and visitors denied access• Alleges KP kept deprived of NFC share since 2018• Special assistant says provincial cabinet to meet every Friday
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Sunday that the powers-that-be wanted to push the PTI into a conflict, but the party would remain peaceful and not opt for confrontation.
“However, the PTI will never hesitate to offer sacrifice,” Mr Afridi added while addressing a news conference at the Chief Minister’s House.
He maintained that efforts were being made to corner the PTI, but his party would continue to hold peaceful protests.
“Persistent efforts have been made to isolate the PTI, and peaceful protesters were even shot at,” the chief minister said.
‘Imran in isolation’
He continued that PTI founder Imran Khan was being kept in isolation and solitary confinement, and that all his visitors, including the chief minister himself and Mr Khan’s sisters, were being denied meetings with the incarcerated former prime minister.
Mr Afirdi said that after some unfortunate news was reported by international media, he went to Adiala jail to inquire about Mr Khan’s health, but even after spe­nding an entire night outside the facility, he was refused a meeting.
He added that they then went to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), but the judges also declined to meet them.
Weekly protests
The chief minister said the PTI had decided all its parliamentarians would hold peaceful protests outside the IHC every Tuesday, and accompany Mr Khan’s sisters to Adiala jail.
He added that the KP government would follow the directions issued by the PTI leadership.
“All the parliamentarians, including National and provincial assembly members as well as senators, will protest outside the IHC over delayed case hearings. They will all proceed to Adiala, accompanying Khan sahib’s sisters,” Mr Afridi told reporters.
He said he decided to hold a sit-in outside Adiala jail because his party was being mistreated.
The KP CM stated that while some chief ministers were offered official jets by the Pakistan Air Force and facilitated during travel, he was placed on the Passport Control List.
Responding to questions, the chief minister said no part of KP was under the control of militants. However, without naming anyone, he added that the entire country was being controlled by a single individual.
He said the Centre should consider the provincial government’s suggestions for maintaining lasting peace in KP, adding that decisions taken behind closed doors had harmed the province.
“If the federal government implements what the provincial government has been suggesting, it will be our responsibility to carry out those decisions and maintain law and order,” he said.
He added that the KP government wanted all stakeholders to be taken on board for any decision regarding peace in the province.
NFC share
Mr Afridi said the provincial government would participate in the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting scheduled for Dec 4 and would fight for the province’s rights.
He added that the tribal areas were merged administratively with KP in 2018 but had yet to be merged financially.
He maintained that the NFC share for the merged districts had not been paid to KP since 2018, describing it as a “constitutional violation”.
The chief minister also announced that from Monday (today), awareness sessions would be held for students in universities so they could understand how the federal government had treated the KP government.
Responding to another question, the chief minister said that while he personally did not own any property in Tirah, his family did. He added that the recent documentary against him was an attempt to divert public attention, but people did not believe those who produced it.
“People know everything. They know who is lying, and we want them to do their job… only then will the country move forward,” the chief minister said.
‘Good governance’
Separately, Special Assistant to the KP CM Shafiullah Jan issued a statement expressing similar concerns about the PTI founder’s health. He criticised the PML-N leadership, saying the party had “forgotten its own past”, recalling how its workers met their “convicted leader” in London and sought guidance from him during his stay abroad.
“Today, they are fearful of Imran Khan’s statements and even his photographs,” he said, adding that the PTI founder remained the most popular political leader in the country and that attempts were being made to “block his voice”. Mr Jan said that the KP chief minister had declared emergencies in the education and health sectors and had decided that the provincial cabinet would meet every Friday. “Good governance is among the top priorities of Chief Minister Sohail Afridi,” he added.

AFGHAN refugees return to Afghanistan after deportation.—Dawn/file

ISLAMABAD: Afghan refugees, awaiting resettlement in the US, have urged the Trump administration to resume the programme, saying that they were living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear of deportation.
The statement from the Afghan P1/P2 case holders came days after the US administration abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals indefinitely after the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.
“We, the Afghan allies and partners of the United States with completed P1/P2 cases, express our deep concern and urgent plea for assistance. Our cases were fully processed, and we were awaiting our flight dates when, on January 20, 2025, the programme was suspended without explanation,” the statement shared with the media said.
“For more than three years, we have been living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear,” it said, while also condemning the Washington attack.
“This was the act of a single individual, and it must never be used to collectively punish thousands of loyal Afghan allies who served the United States honourably and at great personal risk. Individual crime is not a reflection of an entire group, and we respectfully ask that this principle of justice be upheld,” the statement added.
As Pakistan and Afghanistan’s relationship deteriorates due to the terrorist outfits operating from the Afghan soil, Islamabad has stepped up the deportation of Afghan refugees, including those who have valid documents. The statement also reflected this concern, saying the authorities continued to arrest and deport Afghan nationals, including “documented US allies”.

 

“Even official letters from the US Embassy carry no protection, and many with valid documents are still detained and deported. If we are forced back to Afghanistan, we will be immediately identified and killed by the Taliban for our service to the United States,” the statement said, adding that thousands of cases that had already been processed were now in a state of uncertainty.
“We urgently request that the United States uphold its commitments, protect its allies, and resume the evacuation process before more innocent lives are lost,” it added. “We are not criminals. We are the allies who stood with America. Now, we ask America to stand with us,” said the statement issued on behalf of the P1/P2 case holders in Pakistan.
In a recent statement posted on its website, the UN refugee agency had also urged Pakistan to ensure that Afghans with specific protection needs are exempted from the provisions of the ‘Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan’ and allowed to remain safely in the country.
The UNHCR confirmed that more than one million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan in 2025. “In the right circumstances, this would be something to celebrate,” said Philippa Candler, UNHCR representative in Pakistan. “But under the current conditions, it raises more concerns than solutions.”

• Banned BLA claims responsibility for both assaults              
QUETTA: Security forces foiled an armed attack on the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the Nokundi area of the district, killing three attackers late on Sunday night. An FC South spokesman said a group of terrorists targeted the FC headquarters in Nokundi town.
“A suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the headquarters, and after the blast, at least half a dozen armed terrorists attempted to force their way into the camp,” the spokesman said, adding that the FC Quick Response Force immediately retaliated and killed three terrorists who had entered the FC fort along with others.
Sources said heavy gunfire and multiple blasts were heard from inside the fort. Security forces, however, successfully foiled the attack, according to the FC spokesman. “A clearance operation is under way inside the fort,” he said, adding that the situation was under control.
On the other hand, some sources claimed six terrorists had been killed in the operation.
Panjgur ambush
Meanwhile, armed terrorists also launched an attack on an FC checkpost in the Gurmakan area of Panjgur district late in the evening. Reports indicated heavy gunfire between security forces and the attackers. Officials said several terrorists were killed in the exchange of fire, which continued until late night.
The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for both attacks.

Abdelatty arrived in Islamabad last night for a two-day official visit and also met President Asif Ali Zardari and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar earlier today.
The FO statement said during his meeting with Field Marshal Munir, “both sides reaffirmed the importance of continued high-level engagement between the armed forces of the two countries”.







Egyptian FM meets Zardari
Abdelatty also called on President Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr today.
A statement by the President’s Secretariat said Zardari told the Egyptian FM that “Pakistan values its longstanding ties with Egypt, which are rooted in shared faith and mutual respect, and looks forward to advancing the relationship in a more structured and forward-looking direction”.
He also conveyed warm greetings for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi.







According to the statement, the president noted that “this year marks 77 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that both sides will reinvigorate cooperation in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges”.
He encouraged greater Egyptian investment in sectors where opportunities are expanding, including energy, logistics, construction, agriculture, mining and IT, the statement said.
For his part, Abdelatty delivered a message from the Egyptian president and expressed “Egypt’s keen interest in expanding its partnership with Pakistan in various fields”, it added.
The two sides also exchanged views on key regional and international issues, reaffirming their resolve to work together for peace, stability, and prosperity.
The statement said earlier, the two leaders also held a one-on-one meeting and exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest.
Separately, the FO statement said the two exchanged views on matters of bilateral cooperation, regional stability, and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. “The president appreciated Egypt’s leadership and constructive diplomatic engagement on issues of regional importance,” it added.
Pakistan to share list of 250 business houses
Before meeting with Zardari, Abdelatty also met Dar separately, and the two addressed a joint press conference.
Dar said during the press conference that he and Abdelatty had a “very, very focused discussion” today on how their nations could contribute to elevating the business-to-business upscaling of the bilateral activities, which the deputy PM termed as “surely not commensurate”, with around $300 million.
“With the depth and the affection the two countries have, […] Pakistan will share with Egypt a comprehensive list of 250 Pakistani business houses representing key sectors of the economy,” Dar announced.
“These businesses will be facilitated and supported to enhance bilateral commercial engagement,” the deputy premier highlighted.



The deputy PM detailed that the business houses will be chosen from “across the board” and through due consultation.
The list of businesses “representing each sector of the economy” will be initially prepared by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) in collaboration with the other chambers of commerce. Dar asserted there would be a “very transparent selection of those who really deserve and are willing to work and cooperate, and enhance the business”.
The businesses, after “due diligence in Egypt”, would be declared as the “white list”, Dar said. Noting that the foreign ministry was receiving complaints of waiting too long to obtain a business visa “very frequently”, the minister said those concerns will “cease at least to the extent of these top 250” businesses.
Dar further said that in the three-month period after three months have passed since the first list, Islamabad would select another 250 businesses to take the original list to 500.
He added that the Egyptian FM had also agreed to “process the list and that would again be added to the existing white list at that time from 250 to 500”.
The deputy PM went on to announce that a Pakistan-Egypt Business Council will be established after that to institutionalise private sector cooperation and to promote mutually beneficial commercial partnership and B2B business promotion between Pakistan and Egypt.
“Once these two steps are done, Pakistan and Egyptian Business Forum will also be established,” Dar stated, adding that it would be co-chaired by the two foreign ministers.
Its first meeting would be convened in Cairo in the second quarter of 2026, to advance trade, investment and economic collaboration.
Dar also acknowledged with “little embarrassment” that the Pakistan-Egypt Joint Ministerial Commission had not met since 2010, and neither had the two countries held bilateral political consultations.
Therefore, it was decided that the political consultations would be held in the first quarter of 2026, with Egypt nominating an assistant minister to head its delegation, while the Pakistani team would be led by the foreign secretary.
“They will do the entire preparatory work and agenda for the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting, which has not taken place in 15 years, to be held in the second quarter of 2026,” Dar explained.
“Discussions today reaffirm the strength of Pakistan-Egypt relations, and our shared commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation across political, economic, defence, cultural and people-to-people domains,” Dar said.
“We agreed to work towards a more structured framework of cooperation and to explore new avenues of partnership,” the deputy premier noted, adding he was confident that the visit would “open new avenues of practical cooperation” between the two countries.
Dar noted that the two leaders also assessed the regional developments, with “particular focus on the grave situation in Gaza”.
“Pakistan appreciates Egypt’s vital role in humanitarian support, mediation efforts and diplomatic engagement to uphold the ceasefire and safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.”
“Pakistan values Egypt as a key partner in the Muslim world and looks forward to continued engagement at all levels,” Dar affirmed.
The two ministers also discussed India-occupied Kashmir, Afghanistan and cooperation at multilateral fora.
Dar noted Abdelatty’s visit reflected the “longstanding friendship” between the brotherly countries of Pakistan and Egypt.

 

The foreign minister said his Egyptian counterpart also announced the doubling of scholarships this year for Pakistani scholars who wish to study in Al Azhar University.
“While staying in the religious domain, Al Azhar University [offers] courses on how to eliminate terrorism,” Dar pointed out, adding that scholars would learn how to tackle the menace as per religious teachings.
The deputy premier went on to mention that he and Abdelatty met frequently on the sidelines of various global moots this year: “This year, we have met at least half a dozen times if I’m not wrong.”
Islamabad, Cairo agree to intensify coordination to counter cross-border terrorism
At the outset of his remarks, Abdelatty conveyed Egypt’s condolences over the “tragic loss of lives and injuries” in the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Peshawar.
“We stand in full solidarity with Pakistan in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism,” the Egyptian top diplomat affirmed.
“The issue of fighting terrorism is extremely important and we stand ready to share with our brothers and sisters here in Pakistan our very successful experience in fighting terrorism through a holistic approach focusing not only on the security dimension, but also socio-economic dimensions, as well as fighting extremist ideology through the very moderate religious institutions in Egypt, notably the Al-Azhar al-Sharif, Dar Al Ifta and the Ministry of Waqf.”

 

The Egyptian FM said, “In the security domain, we have agreed to intensify our coordination to counter cross-border terrorism and extremism.
“Furthermore, we are eager to leverage this spiritual and intellectual leadership of Al-Azhar al-Sharif to strengthen our joint efforts in promoting moderate discourse and combatting extremist ideology,” he added.
Terming the discussions “extensive and constructive”, Abdelatty said they focused on how to “enhance the partnership that exists between Egypt and Pakistan, and reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation across all areas, including political dialogue, economic partnership, trade, investment, security and defence cooperation, and cultural and educational exchanges”.
‘Agreed to intensify coordination on the Palestinian cause’
The two ministers also exchanged views on regional and international developments, stressing the “importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for sovereignty, and adherence to the principles of international law and the UN charter”.
“This visit comes at a pivotal moment of our region,” Abdelatty said, recalling that Egypt, alongside Pakistan and other countries, “mediated and voted” on the Gaza ceasefire agreement that was signed in Sharm El-Sheikh.

 

“Egypt will continue uncompromising efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and we are working very hard with Pakistan on that.“
The Egyptian FM asserted that the two-state solution was the “only viable path towards genuine and lasting regional stability, which could only be achieved through the creation of a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state based on the UN pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”.
“It is within this context we agreed to intensify our coordination and consultations on the Palestinian cause, particularly the situation in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,” he added, appreciating Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity and support for Egypt’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause”.
Abdelatty went on to invite Pakistan to an upcoming conference on the reconstruction of Gaza.
“I reiterated Egypt’s willingness to work closely with Pakistan to address global challenges, from countering terrorism to climate change to food security,” the diplomat said.
Abdelatty appreciated Pakistan’s “steadfast support in various multilateral forums”, affirming that Cairo remained committed to close coordination on issues of mutual concern.
Sky’s the limit for our cooperation: Egypt FM
Addressing the media prior to his meeting with Dar, FM Abdelatty termed Pakistan his “second home country”.
“I would also like to convey our deep appreciation of our very cordial relation with Pakistan,” he said, acknowledging “common challenges” on the economic, political and security levels.
“That, of course, encourages us to work together and to cooperate in terms of exchange of best practices and expertise to help each other, and to confirm that stability and peace and development are the main pillars of our strategic partnership,” Abdelatty said.
“We would like to elevate our relationship to the strategic level,” the minister added.

Noting that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had instructed him to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Islamabad, Abdelatty said, “Sky’s the limit for our cooperation.”
He expressed Egypt’s willingness to “reinvigorate the existing institutional mechanism of dialogue and cooperation” between Pakistan and Egypt, especially the JMC.
“So it’s timely now to convene the upcoming joint committee meeting. We would also like to agree on a roadmap for our cooperation, which will cover all areas of cooperation — political, economic, investment, trade, security, religious and cultural dimensions.”
“Pakistan holds its relations with Egypt in very high regard and we view this visit as an important opportunity to advance our common objective,” the deputy premier highlighted.
“I appreciate the positive momentum in our recent engagements at different levels, including our interactions on the margins of regional and multilateral fora around the globe,” he added.

“Egyptian and Pakistani brotherhood is broadly known all over the world,” he said, adding that both he and Abdelatty had a great responsibility to take their countries’ diplomatic, economic, trade, business, security, and defence relations to a “much higher level”.
Earlier today, Dar received FM Abdelatty upon his arrival at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Office said on social media platform X.







Abdelatty held a tete-a-tete meeting followed by delegation-level talks with Dar, during which the two sides reviewed full spectrum of Pakistan–Egypt bilateral relations including political, economic, trade and defence relations; cultural and educational cooperation, and collaboration in the health sector, including Egypt’s support to Pakistan’s national Hepatitis C elimination efforts.
According to the FO statement, Abdelatty also interacted with members of Pakistan’s business community during his engagements in Islamabad, highlighting the potential for expanding trade and investment partnerships.
“The visit of the foreign minister of Egypt contributed to further strengthening the longstanding Pakistan–Egypt relationship and provided an important opportunity to deepen cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to continue working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity,” the FO statement said.</p><small>2025-11-30 20:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/302125550bf8e3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958336/imposition-of-governors-rule-in-kp-being-seriously-considered-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imposition of governor’s rule in KP being ‘seriously considered’: state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Sunday that the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was being “seriously considered”, linking the need for this potential move to the “security and governance issues” in the province.
Malik said this on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ where he was asked about the possibility of this move and the government’s plans in this regard.
He said KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team had “badly failed in having any sort of a workable situation”. Neither do they want to have any kind of coordination or cohesion with the Centre, nor do they take any action in areas where it was needed, he added.
Given the situation, the governor’s rule was now being “seriously considered”, he said, adding that it was a “constitutional measure”, which was undertaken in case of an “absolute necessity”.
“And I think, the situation in KP itself calls for a step to be taken in this regard so that the presence of an administrative structure is ensured there.”
Asked whether the government had finalised the decision to impose the governor’s rule in KP, Malik said the president had the authority on this based on the prime minister’s advice under Articles 232 and 234 of the Constitution. “And the federal government is pondering [this option].”
However, when it was pointed out that under Article 234 a governor could recommend the move to the president while the federal government had little to do with it, the state minister said the governor’s recommendation was just one option.
“The president can take this step on his own as well […] the approval for which will later have to be taken by a joint sitting of [Parliament],” he said, adding that under the Constitution, governor’s rule could be imposed initially for two months, and it could later be extended further if required.
When asked whether the governor’s rule would be imposed after replacing incumbent KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Malik replied that the matter was at a “very nascent” stage.
Citing “reports”, he also accused the KP government of “planning to block routes and cut off the province” from the rest of the country.
Kundi unaware of reports about potential removal
Earlier today, KP Governor Kundi expressed ignorance about reports of him potentially being replaced and said he would “accept” his party’s decision in case of such a scenario.
The KP governor made this statement while speaking to journalists, who sought his comments on his potential replacement.
When one of them said that “total six names” had surfaced in connection with the matter, Kundi asked: “Where have they surfaced?”
To that, the journalist said they were being reported in the media.
“Now if the media will appoint the governor, then may God have mercy on us,” replied Kundi.
To a question about a possible scenario of his removal, the governor said he would “accept whatever the party’s decision will be”.
Media reports about Kundi’s potential removal have been circulating lately, which the KP governor had previously denied. Back then, too, he said he would “accept whatever decision will be taken by the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party”.
Amid these reports, Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week to discuss matters concerning KP, including the imposition of governor’s rule.
At the time, a source in the PM Office said the prime minister expressed full confidence in Kundi and gave signals that the government had no intention of removing him.
The discussion on the occasion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation, during which Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal were also present.
Among them, the issue of imposing governor’s rule in KP was discussed reportedly due to a rigid stance by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
Governor Kundi also requested that the prime minister on the occasion to provide KP’s due share in the forthcoming National Finance Commission award.</p><small>2025-11-30 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/301712508f41b02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958328/chief-of-defence-forces-notification-to-be-issued-in-due-course-of-time-process-has-been-initiated-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Chief of Defence Forces notification to be issued in due course of time, process has been initiated: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday said that the notification regarding the Chief of Defence Forces’ (CDF) appointment would be issued “in due course of time”, the process for which had started.
“Please be informed that the process has been initiated. PM is returning shortly. Notification will be issued in due course of time,” Asif said in a post on social media platform X.







The CDF position, created under the 27th Constitutional Ame­nd­ment, replaced the now-abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on Nov 27. It will be a dual-hatted position combined with the office of the army chief.

 

Officials and observers had expected the new notification to coincide with the abolition of the CJCSC post, but November 29 was seen as a critical marker, being the date on which the original three-year tenure of the incumbent Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Field Marshal Asim Munir, was set to expire.
Asif’s statement came as the November 29 date passed without any notification being issued to formally appoint the country’s first CDF.
His statement implies that the notification will be issued upon Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s return to the country, who is currently visiting London. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Dawn that the PM would return to Pakistan on Monday.
Need for notification
Some legal experts had argued that without a new notification, Field Marshal Munir’s tenure could be interpreted as having lapsed.
However, a 2024 amendment to the Pakistan Army Act extended the tenure of the service chiefs to five years. That change included a “deeming” clause stating that the amendment “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act”, a formulation that legal minds say removed the requirement for a fresh notification extending the COAS tenure from three to five years.
Still, there is near consensus among security and legal officials that the creation of the CDF post, a new assignment rather than a continuation, does require a formal notification. Under the 27th Ame­ndment and subsequent changes to the Army Act, the army chief will simultaneously serve as the CDF for a five-year term.
Therefore, several security sources, when contacted by Dawn earlier, said the government would have to issue a new, public notification assigning the CDF role to Field Marshal Munir.
Unresolved debates
The delay in the issuance of the notification has also been widely seen as a sign of unresolved debates within the highest levels of government. According to individuals with insight into the discussions, one point that has been under consideration is which date will be taken as the start of the COAS’s five-year tenure: November 2022 when Field Marshal Munir originally took command or November 2025 as had been broadly speculated after passage of the new legislation.
Another sensitive question that has been raised pertains to the extent of operational and command authority the CDF would exercise over the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The government rapidly pushed the 27th Amendment through parliament earlier this month, but the notification setback has left top military leadership embarrassed and has complicated the transition to the restructured higher-defence framework, which military planners had hoped would be seamless.
Another pending decision has been the appointment of the commander of the National Strategic Command, a new four-star position created to assume the nuclear manager role previously exercised by the CJCSC. Officials believe this appointment will be made only after the CDF notification is issued.

Bilawal made the remarks in a video address to mark the PPP’s 58th foundation day, with his speech being live-streamed in “more than 100 districts” across the country, as per the party.
Bilawal recalled that the ruling PML-N had also proposed constitutional tweaks related to the provinces’ financial rights under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, which were then rejected by the PPP and did not make it to the final version of the 27th Amendment.
“The PPP considers that there were a lot of faultlines in this country and remain,” Bilawal said, adding that the PPP had tried to address those by giving provinces their rights and due representation, and restoring democracy in the past.
“Those people who are trying to play with the NFC Award or the 18th Amendment or other such matters, or are thinking of doing so, it is as if they are playing with fire,” Bilawal warned.







Noting that the government “could see” that the Indian defence minister made aggressive statements about Sindh and that tensions were being created on the Afghan border, Bilawal affirmed: “We will try our best that the internal faultlines in Pakistan are addressed, instead of providing any forces the chance to misuse or take advantage of our faultlines.”
The PPP chairman said that if united, the country had the ability to face any adversary, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and “all sorts of conspiracies”.
Bilawal praised his party for “saving the constitutional guarantee of the provinces’ financial share”.

 

“They (PML-N) wanted to bring back the system of executive magistry; they wanted back the subjects of education and population control that had been devolved to provinces in the 18th Amendment. […] Similarly, the government had other wishes,” he noted.
“I have been protecting your rights and God-willing, will keep doing so,” the PPP scion vowed, adding that his party was ready to support any decision that would strengthen the federation.
“But the PPP can never back a decision that would weaken the federation or through which province’s rights would be usurped,” he asserted.
‘FCC will prove wrong those trying to make it controversial’
During his address, Bilawal also spoke about the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) established under the 27th Amendment — a move the PPP had long advocated for, but was omitted in the 26th Amendment.
“Some people are trying to make this constitutional court controversial,” he noted, adding that he hoped the FCC would “prove all those wrong through its character”.







In a message to those “political forces who wanted to make a parliamentary move controversial”, the PPP chief stressed that it was the parliament’s and the public representatives’ power to enact legislation.
“If someone is demanding that a court or a judge decide on whether the Amendment can remain or not, it is not their authority, and neither will we allow that any other institution interferes in the parliament,” Bilawal warned.
The 27th Amendment and the FCC created through it have been at the centre of a heated debate. The FCC has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s top judicial forum, with international experts and judges having raised concerns over judicial independence.

 

“[The FCC], that institution and its judges have a major responsibility on their shoulders. While representing the Centre, they have to oversee our constitutional issues and judicial independence,” Bilawal said.
He expressed the hope that the FCC would try to “restore people’s trust [in the judiciary] and become a court that will prioritise the Constitution, the law and do justice”.
The PPP scion said it was “definitely his wish” that a Constitutional Amendment be passed through a consensus. However, he highlighted: “If not with consensus, then this work was done through a majority and by the parliament, so only the parliament has the power to review that decision or not.”
“We hope that the constitutional court will look at this country’s biggest constitutional and political issues, and our older Supreme Court of Pakistan will look at all criminal matters,” Bilawal said.
Taking a jibe at what his party deemed judicial activism, Bilawal said he hoped the FCC would not be a court that would “head out to build dams, destroy poor people’s homes, decide the prices of tomato and samosas, send democratic governments home, or disqualify prime ministers for not writing a letter”.

 

“We are about to address a major judicial faultline in the form of the constitutional court,” Bilawal asserted.
He added that this new set-up would enable the ordinary citizens to get “immediate relief” in criminal cases, as they will be focused on by the SC.
“We not only fulfilled the [promise] of creating a constitutional court but also assured the equal representation of provinces in that court,” he highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-30 14:21</small></div><hr>
