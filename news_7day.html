“One of our helicopters has crashed in Thor, Chilas,” GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement.
He added that there were two pilots and three technical staff on board the aircraft. Diamer Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, in a statement, also said: “Reportedly, 5 x casualties occurred due to [helicopter] crash.”
The helicopter was conducting a test landing on a newly proposed helipad, SSP Hameed added. Diamer police and rescue teams had reached the incident site and started evacuation, the officer added.
While the SSP said the cause of the crash was yet to be ascertained, the GB government spokesperson cited a “technical failure”.

In the tournament being played as warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts Sept. 9 — Pakistan have started with thrashings of Afghanistan and UAE thanks to a number of players chipping in with impactful contributions.
After seasoned pacer Haris Rauf and skipper Salman Ali Agha led Pakistan to a 39-run win over Afghanistan in the opener, Saim Ayub and Hasan Nawaz himself scored half centuries each to see the side down UAE by 31 runs.
The UAE fixture saw Pakistan cross the 200-mark as Hasan Nawaz launched a late onslaught after opener Saim Ayub had set the stage. Experienced fast bowler Hasan Ali then wrapped up the proceedings with 3-47 as UAE’s Asif Khan’s blistering 77 off 35 went in vain.
Under white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Pakistan are building up to next year’s T20 World Cup without now discarded senior pros Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and Hasan Nawaz said the young team was prepared for the upcoming challenges.
“You see the youngsters in front of you, all of them work very hard, even in the off-season,” he told reporters after the match on Saturday.
“I honestly feel this is Pakistan’s best T20 team … the plan is to win the tri-series and then, god-willing, the Asia Cup as well.”
 






Hasan Nawaz, coming in at number six, smashed 56 off 26 – a knock studded with six sixes and two fours – to boost Pakistan to 207. For the Layyah-born right-hander, his freedom to go big came due to Saim’s knock for 69 off 38 (seven fours and four sixes).
“In the beginning, Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan had already set the tone,” he said.

“So, my mindset was that we should now aim for a bigger target. There wasn’t much time to settle, so the plan was to cross 200. I just played according to that plan.”

Pakistan shuffled their bowling line-up to bring in Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris — the latter duo having played against Afghanistan.
Hasan Nawaz said the changes pointed towards a changing culture, where no players are considered second choice.
“I don’t see it as ‘bench strength’ because for me, all our players are equal,” noted the 23-year-old.
“Hasan Ali, for example, is a senior player — you can’t call him ‘bench strength’.
Pakistan’s will face Afghanistan again in their third tri-series match on Thursday. The tournament’s final is set for Sept. 7.

The report, published by the government on Monday, said photo-based age estimation products were broadly accurate, fast and privacy-respecting but noted worsening results for people near the age minimum of 16.
The findings foreshadow a mixed experience once the ban takes effect in December: Caucasians three years over the age cut-off can expect minimal disruption, but non-Caucasians and teenage girls face challenges.
The experience may also be more complicated for social media platforms from Meta’s META.O Instagram to Alphabet’s GOOGL.O YouTube, which, under the law, must show they are taking reasonable steps to block users under 16 or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).
The trial found high accuracy for people over 19, but those up to three years on either side of the cut-off were in a “grey zone where system uncertainty is higher”.
Users aged 16 had an 8.5 per cent chance of being estimated as underage, so they might need to be “diverted to supplementary assurance methods, such as ID-based verification or parental consent”, the report said.
“While systems generally performed well across diverse user groups, some showed reduced accuracy for older adults, non-Caucasian users and female-presenting individuals near policy thresholds,” the report added.
Social media experts said the report raised questions about whether the ban could work in three months.
“It seems like there are a lot of variations in accuracy,” said Justine Humphry, a media researcher at the University of Sydney who specialises in online safety.
“That variation is concerning, with the tight schedule for the introduction of a system that will need to be robust and working by the end of this year,” she added.
Communications minister Anika Wells said the report proved that “while there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to age assurance, this trial shows there are many effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded”.</p><small>2025-09-01 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0110520850ef778.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938863/250-reported-dead-more-casualties-feared-as-60-magnitude-earthquake-hits-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>250 reported dead, more casualties feared as 6.0-magnitude earthquake hits Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Hundreds were feared dead and injured after an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 struck two rugged eastern provinces in Afghanistan, authorities said on Monday, as helicopters ferried the injured to safety from rubble being combed in a hunt for survivors.
The disaster will further stretch the resources of the South Asian nation already grappling with humanitarian crises, from a sharp drop in aid to a huge pushback of its citizens from neighbouring countries.
There was no confirmed death toll, health authorities said in Kabul, the capital, as rescuers raced to reach remote hamlets dotting an area with a long history of earthquakes and floods.
Afghanistan’s government-run Bakhtar News Agency said that “nearly 250 people have been reported martyred and over 530 injured across Kunar and Laghman provinces”.
“According to officials from the Disaster Management Department in Kunar, the most severely impacted districts include Noor Gul, Chawkay, Watapur, Mano Gai, and Chapa Dara,” BNA reported.
 






The local Tolo News, citing the Natural Disaster Preparedness Authority in Kunar, also put the death toll at “around 250”, with 500 others injured in the districts of Nurgal, Sawkay, Watapur, Manogi and Chapa Dara.
“They add that the numbers of dead and injured are not final, and communication is still ongoing with residents in remote areas,” Tolo added.
“Figures from just a few clinics show over 400 injured and dozens of fatalities,” ministry spokesperson Sharafat Zaman said in a statement that warned of higher casualties.
Images from Reuters Television showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped soldiers and medics carry the wounded to ambulances.
Three villages were razed in the province of Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, the health ministry said.
Reports showed 250 dead and 500 injured, said Najibullah Hanif, the provincial information head of Kunar, adding that the tally could change.
Early reports showed 30 dead in a single village, with hundreds of injured taken to hospital, authorities said.
Rescuers were scrambling to find survivors in the area bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where homes of mud and stone were levelled by the midnight quake that hit at a depth of 10 kilometres.
“So far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,” a foreign office spokesperson said.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than 1,000 people last year, underscoring the vulnerability of one of the world’s poorest countries to natural disasters.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he was “extremely saddened by the tragic loss of over 300 lives and the many injuries”.
“My deepest condolences go out to the families who have lost their loved ones and heartfelt prayers for full and quick recovery of those injured. This immense sorrow is felt by us all,” he said on X.

Spanish second seed Alcaraz and tennis icon Djokovic — who are on course to meet in the semi-finals — both recorded straight-sets wins on the Arthur Ashe Stadium main court.
Five-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz overpowered France’s Arthur Rinderknech 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 and has not dropped a set to date at the championships.
 






“I think my style of tennis suits pretty well the energy here in New York,” the 22-year-old said.
“The energy is special playing the day session, playing the night session.
It doesn’t matter, people are always there. I love it and I think that’s why I play my best tennis here,” he added.
Alcaraz will face Czech 20th seed Jiri Lehecka in the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
Lehecka reached the last eight of a Grand Slam for only the second time after battling past veteran Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, winning 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.
Djokovic, 38, continued his latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title with a brisk 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 defeat of unseeded German Jan-Lennard Struff.
“It definitely helps if you serve well. I think I had a great serving performance last round and also tonight,” said Djokovic.
“That helps make it easier on the court.” Djokovic faces a quarter-final on Tuesday against fourth seed Taylor Fritz, the lone American man left in the draw.
 






Fritz sprinted into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 defeat of the Czech Republic’s Tomas Machac in 1hr 38min.
Fritz is carrying hopes of being the first US men’s Grand Slam champion since Andy Roddick in 2003 following the exits of fellow seeds Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe.
But Fritz will head into his quarter-final against Djokovic with history stacked against him. Djokovic has won all 10 of their past meetings, including a 2023 quarter-final win at the US Open.
“I think the first, almost like seven or eight times I played him, I probably just wasn’t a good enough player to really have that much of a chance,” said Fritz.
“I think only the last couple times we’ve played I think I’ve been this just better player that can, you know, I’d say compete and have chances.”
Sabalenka balance
In the women’s draw, Sabalenka never looked troubled in a 6-1, 6-4 defeat of Moldova-born Spaniard Cristina Bucsa, ranked 95th in the world.
Sabalenka has now reached the quarter-finals or better at 12 straight Grand Slam tournaments, a consistency she attributes to striking a balance in her life on and off the court.
“I’m super proud, I think that’s an incredible achievement,” Sabalenka said.
“I think for me the key was balancing on and off-the-court life. I think I’ve done a great job on balancing really hard work and also great recovery and some fun time outside of tennis court. I think that’s been the key.”
Sabalenka faces a quarter-final against the Czech Republic’s Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, who upset ninth seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in the late game on Arthur Ashe.
In other women’s draw action on Sunday, another Czech, unseeded former French Open and Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, conjured a remarkable escape to oust Taylor Townsend, saving an incredible eight match points before digging out a 1-6, 7-6 (15/13), 6-3 victory.
 






Krejcikova fought off a match point on her own serve at 5-4 down in the second set, and then somehow survived seven match points in an enthralling tie-breaker to move on.
“What a match,” said Krejcikova, who revealed she had wondered if she would ever play tennis again after missing the opening months of the season with a back injury.

“I was sidelined for six months and didn’t know if I would ever play again.
I’m super happy I can be here.”

Krejcikova will face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals.
Pegula, beaten in the final last year, advanced to the last eight after breezing past compatriot Ann Li 6-1, 6-2 on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.</p><small>2025-09-01 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/010926477b814f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938837/pakistan-suspends-mail-to-us-amid-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan suspends mail to US amid tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: More than 25 countries of the world, including Pakistan, have temporarily suspended mail delivery to the United States after the US imposed new taxes and duties.
Because of this situation, the Pakistan Post has also stopped delivering booked mail to the US because it fears it will be returned under the new US rules.
The US government has suspended the previous duty-free facility under an executive order number 14324 on July 25. The US move has severely affected postal communications to the US worldwide because now all types of mail delivery to the US will have to pay duties and taxes under the new system.
 
 

All major countries of the world, including China, the UK, Japan. Austria, Australia, New Zealand, India, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, have temporarily stopped mail delivery to the US because airlines have also shown their inability to deliver mail.
The countries hit by the US move have taken up the matter with the US through the Universal Postal Union, a UN agency, which is taking steps to resolve the dispute.

He is accompanied by his wife, a toddler daughter and around a dozen members his family, who have come to the camp in the hope of getting some relief goods.
“The flood hit our village, Nagar, about 10 days ago, but the water did not reach our homes until three days back. On Thursday, it surrounded my house and the rest of my neighbourhood. We could not leave on our own because there was water all around the village.”
“I kept calling the helpline, as well as a welfare organisation, but despite promises that they would send the boat, help arrived today after three days. Now, tell me where to go from here?” he asks, pointedly.
Javed’s daughter has a fever and she has developed a skin allergy due to exposure to rain and floodwater. His niece and wife also have similar symptoms, so they make a beeline for the medical camp, where a doctor examines them and gives them some medicine.
When asked where they they will go from here, Javed says they have to make it to their relatives in Bhai Pheru. “But I don’t know how to reach Kasur from here,” he says, looking around for help.
A rescuer tells him that their duty is to evacuate them from flooded areas; they cannot promise further conveyance.
Javed’s is one of the many families who were rescued and brought to the relief camp near the Talwar post. The border with India can be seen across the huge body of water that spreads as far as the eye can see.
This site has become an assembly point for flood-hit people from around 16 villages, the last Pakistani settlements before the border. Now, they are all inundated with water from the River Sutlej.
The meandering Sutlej flowing alongside lush green rice fields: this is the sight that greets us on our way to the Ganda Singh border.
 
 

Initially, as we head down the main road, there is no sign of flooding. But as the village of Mahalam Kalan nears, around 15km from Ferozepur Road, the presence of Rangers bunkers and military personnel indicates that something is up.
At Rajiwala Araiyaan, the floodwater comes into view, along with a hullabaloo of activity, with hordes of flood-affected people and their cattle gathering in groups as relief activities are in full swing.
It has been two weeks since waters from the overflowing Sutlej first hit this area, but rescue boats are still busy ferrying those stranded in nearly villages.
A medical camp has been established near the Talwar Post, so that flood victims can receive first aid before they head out, most seeking shelter with relatives in nearby towns, or in relief camps.
The embankment at Rajiwala Road, on the edge of the floodwaters, is quite muddy due to fresh rain. Here, we see about 50 sheep, and Salman – a young man in his 20s – tending to them. He tells us he brought his animals to safety in a rickety boat around 11 days ago.
“There is nothing left in our houses. All we have were these animals. We are keeping the sheep here, but we have sent cows and other large animals ahead for fodder. There is nothing here. We don’t even have fodder for the sheep. We are arranging everything on our own, including food.”
He says there were 150 houses in his village, all of which were empty by the time they left. The authorities are preventing anyone from going back, so most people are understandably quite anxious about the state of their homes.
The main concern here is not just with people or property; it is the animals. Most of the flood-hit villagers are farmers who depend on their cattle for their livelihood. They cannot simply leave them behind, and relocating them to far-flung places is not feasible.
Mushtaq and Shahid, from the Bhikhiwind village, have also tethered their cows and buffaloes near the relief camp. They point to their village from where they sit; there is nothing there but deep, unnavigable waters.
They say that in the past, the water would reach their village, but it never breached their homes. This year, they said, there was more water than they had ever seen in their lives.
There were 25 families living in Bhikhiwind, all of whom have now been evacuated.
Around a fortnight ago, when they first evacuated, one man from each family stayed behind to protect their animals and property. However, law enforcement forced these stragglers out too, and now the people complain they have no support from the government, either in arranging food for themselves or fodder for their animals.
When we head over to the relief camp set up in the Rajiwala school, the guards don’t let us enter.
Amir Ali, a policeman deployed at the camp, says that residents of around 16 flooded villages had been brought to the camp. If people don’t leave their flooded villages and homes, the police brings them over forcibly, he says.
But the women from Bhikhiwind tell us that the day the army chief visited the area, they were enrolled at the camp. However, they did not receive any food, despite waiting the entire day.
The disappointed families say that they don’t expect anything from the government now. “Only Al-Khair and Al-Khidmat Foundation gave us some food,” says Mushtaq.
However, officials deputed at the relief camp deny these allegations. “Many people from the villages which are not affected by flood also approach the camp to demand food and fodder. We need to check their CNICs and seek the evidence of animals and family members,” said an official.
Muhammad Farooq has been voluntarily operating a raft (locally known as a Baira) since the flood hit. When we meet him, he is bringing ashore a motorcycle-rickshaw, a couple of heads of cattle, as well as people from the villages of Changa Singh and Dhupsari.
He says he gets diesel from the deputy commissioner’s office to run his Baira, which he uses to transport people, their animals and other heavy loads to the camp.
Asif, a resident of Changa Singh, is disembarking from Farooq’s raft as we arrive. He has just returned from a visit to his inundated village, which he left about eight days ago.
When they left, some elders were left behind to look after the houses, and every couple of days, someone returns to check on them. On this trip, Asif spent the night trying to save his family’s wheat stocks, placing them on the rooftop and covering them up to protect them from the elements.
But as the heavens open up, he looks crestfallen, fearing the rain might spoil their wheat too.

Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani and Adviser to the Chief Minister Dr Rubaba Buledi warned of an increasingly alarming flood situation. The provincial government was monitoring developments closely and coordinating with Sindh and Punjab to ensure a timely emergency response, they claimed.
Citizens, especially those living near rivers and canals, have been urged to take precautionary measures and strictly follow local administration guidelines.
Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Jahanzeb Khan, Nasirabad division commissioner Salahuddin Noorzai, and deputy commissioners of flood-prone districts visited vulnerable areas near the Sindh border. They reviewed the situation, assessed readiness, and coordinated with local administrations.
Nasir Majeed, chief engineer of canals, who inspected the Pat Feeder Canal from RD-418 to RD-505, was briefed by irrigation officials on the current flood risk and the capacity of the Indus River to carry nearly one million cusecs of water.
Meanwhile, the health department reviewed the situation and ramped up medical and relief operations. Senior officials at a meeting, chaired by Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar, decided to strengthen disease surveillance, ensure immediate availability of anti-venom, deploy mobile health units, and activate the 1129 control room for public support.

The Election Comm­ission of Pakistan (ECP) has set Sept 9 for polling to fill the vacant Punjab seat.
According to party’s media wing, the annou­ncement has been made by expected candidate Salma Ejaz, wife of Mr Ejaz. She has made it clear that she will not contest the by-election as she does not want to become part of the ‘fraudulent elections’.
PTI Central Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram said that the founding chairman PTI Imran Khan has stated in his message that members of assemblies and senators affiliated with PTI, have been unjustly imprisoned under the false pretext of May 9 cases.
He also said that it will be an insult to them if the party decided to contest the election on seats which have been vacated due to their disqualification.
He said that, after getting the message, party’s political committee also decided that no candidate will be fielded on any seat apart from Mian Azhar’s seat which has been vacated after his death and his son Hammad Azhar will contest the election from there in Lahore.
“This decision gives a clear message that PTI will not accept any unjust or imposed electoral process. The party stands firmly with its workers and leaders and it will continue its struggle under all circumstances,” Mr Waqas said. According to media reports, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has awarded the ticket to former interior minister Rana Sanaullah Khan for the seat.

The reason for the decline in area of plantation is attributed to the removal of the minimal support price since May 2024, combined with low domestic wheat prices at the planting time that led some farmers to shift to more profitable vegetables and cash crops, including oilseeds, condiments and vegetables, says Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) on Pakistan in its latest issue.
In irrigated areas, yields are estimated to be above average, but dry weather conditions caused crop losses in rain-fed areas, which acco­unt for about 20pc of wheat plantings, and in some irrigated areas in northern parts due to shortage of irrigation water, the FAO report says.

Removal of minimal support price since May 2024 blamed for decline in plantation area

Planting of the 2025 paddy crop finalised in early August. In some areas, farmers undertook replanting operations following severe localised flooding between June and early August. The floods and landslides particularly affected northern and northwestern areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, as well as parts of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan provinces, resulting in localised crop losses and disruption of agricultural livelihood.
The report says in the 2024-25 marketing year wheat imports were significantly below the five-year average after the introduction of an import ban on wheat grain in July 2024. This year the government also put a ban on exports of wheat flour, including flour made from imported wheat, wheat products, refined flour and semolina, which is still in place as of early August 2025.
Exports of rice, the country’s major exportable cereal, are preliminarily forecast at 5.5 million tonnes in calendar year 2025. Exports of maize in the 2025-26 marketing year are preliminarily forecast at an average level of 500,000 tonnes.
Domestic prices of wheat flour, the country’s main staple food, declined by about 50pc between March 2024 and July 2025. The decline in prices reflects abundant market availability driven by consecutive good harvests and large imports in 2023-24, as well as by the government’s decision, since 2024, to cease wheat procurement from farmers at an MSP.
The abolition of the minimum support price was part of a broader package of economic reforms required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a condition to secure a $7 billion bailout approved in 2024.

Extension of Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank — de facto annexation of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war — was on the agenda for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet meeting late Sunday that is expected to focus on the Gaza war, a member of the small circle of ministers said.
It is unclear where precisely any such measure would be applied and when, whether only in Israeli settlements or some of them, or in specific areas of the West Bank like the Jordan Valley and whether any concrete steps, which would likely entail a lengthy legislative process, would follow discussions.
Any step toward annexation in the West Bank would likely draw widespread condemnation from the Palestinians, who seek the territory for a future state, as well as Arab and Western countries. It is unclear where US President Donald Trump stands on the matter.

IDF pounds Gaza City suburbs, claims killing of Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida

Israel, which is facing mounting international criticism over the war in Gaza, is angered by pledges by France, Britain, Australia and Canada to formally recognise a Palestinian state at a summit during the UN General Assembly in September.
The United Nations’ highest court in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
Israel argues the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory.
Its annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights decades ago have not won international recognition.
Thirty more killed in a day
Israeli forces pounded the suburbs of Gaza City overnight from the air and ground, killing 30 people, including 13 who tried to get food from near an aid site in the central Gaza Strip, destroying homes and driving more families out of the area.
Gaza health authorities said Israeli gunfire and strikes killed at least 30 people on Sunday, including 13 who tried to get food from near an aid site in the central Gaza Strip.
Residents of Sheikh Radwan, one of the largest neighborhoods of Gaza City, said the territory had been under Israeli tank shelling and airstrikes throughout Saturday and on Sunday, forcing families to seek shelter in the western parts of the city.
An Israeli official said Netanyahu’s security cabinet will on Sunday discuss the next stages of the planned offensive to seize Gaza City, which he has described as Hamas’ last bastion.
On Saturday, Red Cross head Mirjana Spoljaric said an evacuation from the city would provoke a massive population displacement that no other area in the Gaza Strip is equipped to absorb, amid severe shortages of food, shelter, and medical supplies.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians.
On Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said seven more people had died of malnutrition and starvation in the enclave, raising the number of such deaths to 339 people, including 124 children, since the war began.
Hamas spokesman
Israel claimed on Sunday its forces had killed the spokesman of Hamas’s armed wing in a strike on Gaza a day earlier.
Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida has been eliminated in Gaza, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X.
Israel has killed most leaders of Hamas during its 23-month devastating offensive in the Gaza Strip.
Hamas has not commented on the ‘killing’ of Abu Obeida.

This subtle but obvious change is surprising, because as recently as February, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Brian Mast, publicly criticised the State Department and USAID for wasting ‘hard-earned tax dollars’ — citing, among other things, a $15 million grant allegedly providing condoms to the Taliban.
The indication of the shift came from Sebastian Gorka, Deputy Assistant to President Donald Trump and Director for Counterterrorism, during his remarks at a Heritage Foundation event last month.
“This sounds strange coming out of my mouth, but the Taliban have been moderately cooperative counterterrorism partners because there are certain threat groups in their country, Muslim threat groups that threaten them as well, and so we’re working together,” Mr Gorka told the audience.

Trump aide hints at limited security cooperation, but experts say Taliban regime recognition is unlikely

“We don’t have a complete overlap in threats, but not bad,” he observed, noting that it was this threat perception that at times forced “the Taliban … to align their actions with our security objectives”.
Mr Gorka also showered praise on Pakistan, saying that apprehending Sharifullah — the IS-Khorasan terrorist currently being tried in the US for orchestrating the Abbey Gate bombing of 2021 — would not have been possible without Islamabad’s cooperation.
Experts argue that a direct US-Taliban channel could ease Pakistan’s operational burden as the primary conduit for aid and dialogue with Kabul, but it could also reduce Islamabad’s leverage with both Washington and the Taliban. At the same time, Afghanistan’s potential integration into regional trade and energy networks could benefit Pakistan economically.
According to Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, Afghanistan as a tributary to CPEC would be key to developing the tribal districts of Pakistan, while Kabul could stand to gain from being a conduit for energy from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan.
Hassan Abbas, professor of International Security Studies at Washington’s National Defence University, told Dawn that US-Taliban contacts have quietly continued since the hasty August 2021 withdrawal.
These have largely been driven by a shared concern over the threat posed by IS-Khorasan.
Abbas, who has also written a book on the Taliban resurgence, noted: “While these channels do not amount to recognition, they reflect a practical convergence on counterterrorism. However, their internal divisions — between those advocating limited pragmatism and others clinging to rigid control — remain a major obstacle to meaningful outreach”.
For Prof Touqir Hussain of Georgetown University, the engagement with Kabul is likely a geopolitical power play, in that Washington does not want Afghanistan to slide back into the Chinese and Russian sphere of influence. He noted the US also needs Kabul’s cooperation to repatriate around 9,000 Afghans living in the US under temporary protected status, as well as the repatriation to the US of Afghans left behind, who had cooperated with the Americans, and the release of any US detainees.
“But Washington does not want any deep or long-term engagement with the Taliban. The strong counterterrorism interest can perhaps be addressed with over-the-horizon arrangement with Pakistan or Central Asian countries,” Prof Hussain added.
The Taliban, he said, were not averse to direct counterterrorism arrangements with Washington either, “in the hope it might lead to recognition.”
The Trump administration “may agree to this cooperation but may not give much in return by way of the restoration of some aid programs,” he added.
For Daniel S. Markey, senior research professor at Johns Hopkins’ School of Advanced International Studies, this limited counterterrorism cooperation may not lead to a major thaw in US-Taliban relations.
“Mainly because there are so many other priorities for the Trump administration. But I can’t rule it out either, since deal-making and flexibility are the president’s hallmarks,” Markey told Dawn.
In the words of Prof Nadeem Hussain of George Washington University, since relations between Kabul and Islamabad are strained at the moment, the Taliban’s willingness to collaborate with the US directly might irk the establishment in Islamabad, but it may actually be good for Pakistan overall.

It has long been apparent what needs to be done for the country to achieve its promising potential. Its problems are well known. So are its solutions. But why have these solutions never been applied? Why has little been done to address the structural problems? Why have much-needed economic, educational and institutional reforms never been implemented? What is the impediment? What holds Pakistan back? What blocks meaningful progress?
Two words may answer these questions. Elite capture. Elite control of state power and of much of the country’s resources which enable overlapping elites to influence governance, politics and the economy as well as receive unwarranted benefits from such control — all at the expense of the public and without its consent.
A narrow, oligarchic elite has dominated the country’s politics and protected its interests with scant regard for societal welfare. A few hundred families have dominated virtually all of Pakistan’s legislatures, including the present ones, maintaining their grip on power through generations. Dynastic politics is emblematic of this. Party and electoral politics continues to be dominated by wealthy families, clans and networks of regional and local ‘influentials’. Even those from non-elite backgrounds are co-opted into elite culture.
This has remained largely unchanged despite economic and social changes of recent decades that have gradually been transforming the national landscape. These changes include greater urbanisation, rise of a larger middle class, shift in the economic centre of gravity from the countryside to urban centres, emergence of a diverse civil society and a more ‘connected’ and informed citizenry, thanks to the spread of technology. But politics and the political system have yet to be aligned with such changes. Instead, the old mould of control by entrenched elites continues. Politics remains a competition and power struggle among the political elite. Because power not purpose drives such politics it is bereft of ideas or any vision for the future.

A narrow elite, resistant to reform, prioritises its own interests over that of the people.

This power elite has resisted meaningful reform — whether land reform, tax reform or reforms in governance. It has ‘rentier’ characteristics: using access to public office as a means of leveraging state resources to transfer wealth and acquire unearned income.
 
 

Elite capture has meant governance challenges have multiplied over the years, leaving the country with daunting problems of state solvency, security and mounting energy and water shortages.
Elite dominance is obviously not unique to Pakistan. It is a phenomenon elsewhere too. Elites are found in all societies, and countries everywhere are run by them. But it depends on what kind of elites they are and the nature of elite capture — whether it helps or hinders societies and economies to grow and prosperity to be shared. The extent to which privileged elites control politics, governance and the economy in Pakistan makes it distinctive. So does the way this prevents mobility and perpetuates the relatively limited pool of decision-makers. Another distinct characteristic is the intersection and symbiotic relationship between political and military elites.
The military whose social background is increasingly middle or lower middle class often counterposes itself to the traditional political elite as a meritocratic institution that offers social mobility and functions on the basis of professionalism, which it does. But the alliances it forges are with the very political elite it criticises and sees as self-serving, venal and inept. The status quo interests of both are what bind them together. Both use patron-client relationships to reinforce their ascendancy and protect their privileged position.
There has been extensive discussion in the country about the politics and economics of elite capture and its consequences. UNDP’s National Human Development Report of 2021 found that economic privileges given to Pakistan’s elite groups, including the political class, corporate sector, feudal landlords and the military amounted to around $17. 4 billion or about six per cent of GDP. Among the stark, deep-rooted inequalities identified by the report are that the richest 20pc own almost 50pc of the country’s income while the landed elite which constitutes 1.1pc of the population owns 22pc of cultivable farmland. The report notes that both the urban and rural rich have strong representation in parliament. Powerful groups, it says, capture much more than their fair share through favourable policies and structural discrimination.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics has conducted extensive research on elite capture in different areas and its implications, while urging a nuanced debate on this. Its bimonthly publication of August/ September 2024 was dedicated entirely to this, with rich contributions from economists and other social scientists. Among PIDE’s research findings are that elite capture perpetuates/ widens inequality, constrains economic growth, limits the development of human capital, leads to lack of economic productivity and impedes social mobility. It produces substantial losses to the economy and results in stagnation. Poor governance is inescapable when policy decisions are made to further the interests of the elite rather than the public.
Rosita Armytage’s book, Big Capital in an Unequal World: The Micropolitics of Wealth in Pakistan (2020), alsogenerated much debate on elite capture.It profiled Pakistan’s business and industrial elite and offered insights into its ‘uppermost’ elite, and its networks and methods that help to maintain its position and reinforce inequality. The author finds Pakistan a compelling case of elite power, which, like many developing countries, is run by an oligarchy of economic and political interests and is afflicted by high levels of instability. This instability is encouraged by powerful families that benefit from it through the ‘culture of exemptions’, which enables members of the elite to buttress their positions and thwart competition. The book argues that major wealth in the country is concentrated among a limited number of families that dominate the principal political parties and leading firms and have family links with senior echelons of the military.
Amply clear from all of this is that unless public welfare, not the interests of a narrow, privileged elite, becomes central to the enterprise of governance, Pakistan cannot achieve its full po­t­ential. This choice, more than anything else, will determine the country’s fate and fortunes.

Unbeknownst to many, the facility also has the dubious honour of holding the highest number of HIV-positive inmates in Punjab, as revealed recently by the Punjab Aids Control Programme.
Figures show 148 prisoners are infected in the detention centre, built for fewer than 2,000, but crammed with over 4,300. The outbreak not only highlights the dangers of neglecting healthcare in closed institutions, it also reminds us of our failed response to HIV.
Overcrowded prisons are the perfect incubators for disease, especially given the inadequate attention to health and risky inmate behaviour. The dangers in Pakistan are amplified by a history of unsafe practices — unsterile injections, lax blood-banking and rampant syringe sharing. Ratodero in 2019, where hundreds of children contracted HIV from a single doctor’s reused syringes, was the most notorious case. Unprotected sex among high-risk groups and migrant workers bringing infections home are two more contributing factors.
The statistics speak for themselves: nearly 40pc of those who inject drugs are HIV-positive, and almost three-quarters admit to reusing syringes. The kind of behaviours that drive transmission in communities find their way into jails. Although prevalence in the general population remains officially low at 0.1pc, UNAIDS modelling suggests that over 230,000 Pakistanis were living with the virus in 2022 — a three-and-a-half-fold increase since 2010.
Pakistan’s response to the virus has been weak. Recent commentary in The Lancet accused the state of outsourcing much of the HIV effort to NGOs sustained by foreign donors, leaving the government with little incentive to take ownership. Services remain siloed in stand-alone clinics that are easy to spot; with their bold signage, patients are inclined to avoid stepping in for fear of stigma. Only a third of those infected are on antiretroviral therapy. Spending on prevention has fallen, while international funding, on which Pakistan is dependent, is shrinking. The Global Fund, citing both belt-tightening and mismanagement, has slashed its support by $27m.
As with other health challenges, Pakistan has strategies on paper. Its latest AIDS plan aspires to slash new infections by nearly two-thirds by 2026. Yet provincial health departments often fail to spend the money already allocated, while screening and treatment targets remain a fantasy. In some provinces, less than a quarter of those infected even know their status. Also, while improving prison health is imperative, the government must realise it is not just about inmate welfare. Untreated infections spill back into communities when prisoners are released. The authorities must invest in prison healthcare, enforce safe medical practices, and above all, integrate HIV prevention and treatment into the wider health system. The virus is relentless and so must the country’s response be.

The vessels will set off from the Spanish port city to “open a humanitarian corridor and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people,” said the Global Sumud Flotilla — sumud is the Arabic term for “resilience”.
The group’s website states it is an independent organisation with no affiliation to any government or political party.
A fleet of boats was ready to depart with hundreds on board, including activists from various countries like Irish actor Liam Cunningham and Spain’s Eduard Fernandez, as well as European lawmakers, public figures and former Barcelona mayor Ada Colau.

Greta Thunberg and other public figures sail to open a humanitarian corridor

The flotilla is expected to arrive at the war-ravaged coastal enclave in mid-September.
“The question here today is not why we are sailing. This story is not at all about the mission that we are about to embark upon,” Ms Thunberg told reporters. She said the goal was to bring in aid and open a humanitarian corridor to break an “illegal” and “inhuman” blockade of Gaza.
“The story here is about Palestine. The story here is how people are being deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive. The story here is how the world can be silent,” she said.
Mr Cunningham said the presence of the flotilla signifies the world’s failure to uphold international and humanitarian laws, marking a disgraceful period in history.
Organisers say other vessels are expected to leave Tunisian and other Mediterranean ports on Sept 4 to join the aid mission. “This will be the largest solidarity mission in history, with more people and more boats than all previous attempts combined,” Brazilian activist Thiago Avila said.
Activists will also stage simultaneous demonstrations and other protests in 44 countries “in solidarity with the Palestinian people”, Ms Thunberg wrote on Instagram.
“We understand that this is a legal mission under international law,” Portu­guese lawmaker Mariana Mortagua, who will join the mission, told journalists.
Previous attempts
Previously, Israel blocked aid ships to Gaza in June and July. In one instance, the sailboat Madleen with 12 activists, including Thunberg, was intercepted 185 km from Gaza, and its passengers were detained and expelled.

The Met Office advised provincial authorities in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) to take necessary precautions against Glof events, which are triggered by accelerating glacier melt.
According to the alert, hydro-meteorological data from monitoring stations under the Glof-II project showed “a significant rise in temperature values, much higher than normal,” which may hasten the melting process.
It stated an increased probability of Glof and flash floods in locations including Arkari, Badswat, Darkut, Hisper Hoper, Ghundus and Gulkin.
“All concerned are advised to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation,” the department said.
More monsoon rains
Simultaneously, the agency’s forecast noted that monsoon currents from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are penetrating the country’s upper and central parts. This system, combined with a westerly wave, is expected to persist until Monday.
Wind and thunderstorms are expected in Kashmir, GB, KP and upper and southern Punjab, as well as Islamabad. Meanwhile, isolated heavy rainfall is anticipated in Kashmir, upper KP, and northeastern and southern Punjab.
Other regions of the country are likely to experience hot and dry conditions.
The department warned that on Sept 1, heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in the local streams of Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Manshera, Abbottabad, Nowshera and Swabi.
The risk also extends to Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, northeast Punjab and the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan.
Heavy downpours could also cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Narowal, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan.
Officials warned that landslides and mudslides may lead to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat and Kashmir during the forecast period.

• Central bank debt reduced to Rs3.8tr from Rs5.5tr; average domestic debt maturity rises to 3.8 years
• Falling interest rates saved Rs800bn in FY25, easing taxpayer burden
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday said it had retired about Rs1.133tr debt to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), taking advantage of the central bank’s record profits driven by the highest interest rates in the country’s history.
“On August 29, 2025, the Debt Management Office (of the Ministry of Finance) executed another monumental repayment of Rs1.133 trillion,” the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said in a statement, adding that this came on top of an earlier Rs500bn repayment on June 30, 2025. The total repayment, therefore, amounted to Rs1.633tr in just 59 days, and Rs2.6tr in about a year.
The government had earlier announced in November last year that it had retired Rs1.867tr against a borrowing of Rs753.2bn for budgetary support in FY2023-24 through earlier repayments and buybacks of its securities from the market. “The MoF had, in the first half of FY25, retired domestic commercial market debt of Rs1tr — the first such advanced debt retirement operation in Pakistan’s history,” the statement said, adding that “including both the central bank and commercial portions, the total early debt retirement in less than one year now comes to over Rs2.6tr— an unprecedented scale and decisive action in the country’s fiscal history.”
The MoF said the early debt retirement was part of government efforts to strengthen public finances through early repayments and restore fiscal credibility. It marked a decisive shift from past debt-heavy practices, where reliance on borrowing crowded out fiscal space and increased risks. The ministry said the government had now initiated debt discipline under which 30pc of central bank debt was retired ahead of its maturity in 2029. As a result, government debt to the SBP dropped to Rs3.8tr from Rs5.5tr, thereby reducing risks and improving fiscal space.
Consequently, fiscal resilience had strengthened, the MoF maintained, adding that “the average maturity of domestic debt has risen to 3.8 years from 2.7 years in FY24 — the sharpest single-year improvement in history, and well ahead of IMF targets.”
The statement acknowledged that falling interest rates helped secure about Rs800bn in saving that would have otherwise put an additional tax burden on taxpayers.
Earlier, the government had said the pre-mature debt retirement was possible because of 186pc growth in federal revenues. The unprecedented increase in revenues in FY2024-25 was mainly driven by the surplus profit of the SBP (Rs2.5tr).
The government’s recent Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDMS 2026-28) emphasises increasing net issuances of PIBs, fixed-rate and zero-coupon bonds to help lower refinancing and interest rate risks. The strategy also seeks gradual repayment of securities held by the SBP to reduce refinancing risk in FY2029.
With IMF consent, the plan will be supported by “utilising any windfall from SBP dividends exceeding 1pc of GDP for the retirement of SBP debt,” the MoF said, adding that demand from long-term institutional investors was also expected to support this shift. Longer-dated zero-coupon bonds would suit their liability structures, it said, noting that the recently introduced two-year zero-coupon bond had already attracted strong interest from both commercial banks and insurers. Increased issuance of this instrument was therefore envisaged under the MTDMS.
The MTDMS conceded that the cost of debt in FY2025 remains elevated, particularly for domestic borrowing. The overall weighted average interest rate stands at 11.9pc, driven largely by the significantly higher cost of domestic debt relative to external sources.
While external debt carries a much lower weighted average interest rate of 4.4pc — reflecting the high share of concessional and semi-concessional financing — domestic debt bears an average rate of 15.82pc. As a result, interest payments consumed nearly 6pc of GDP in FY2025.
According to MoF, interest rate risk is high for domestic debt, reflecting a shift to floating-rate domestic debt instruments in response to market demand in recent years, primarily due to a growing reliance on floating-rate instruments in response to market preferences, the ministry said.
This trend was particularly evident in FY2023, when investors showed a strong preference for short- to medium-term floating-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), notably the five-year tenor with semi-annual coupons. “This shift was driven by expectations of continued interest rate hikes and a high policy rate environment, which peaked at 22pc during FY2023,” the ministry added.
Nearly 80pc of domestic debt is subject to an interest rate re-fixing in FY2026, with an average time to re-fixing (ATR) of only 1.2 years. For external debt, ATR is higher at 4.5 years, reflecting a greater share of fixed-rate debt, it added.

LAHORE: The overflowing Che­nab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers have displaced more than two million people across 2,200 villages since Aug 23, while Sindh braces for what officials warn could be a “super flood” as mas­sive inflows from Punjab move downstream.
Rescue and relief operations are underway on an unprecedented scale in Punjab, where the Provincial Disa­ster Management Authority (PDMA) has warned that the next 48 hours are critical. In Sindh, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has cautioned that inflows of nearly one million cusecs could threaten barrages and inundate vast swathes of land, endangering more than 200,000 people.
The Punjab PDMA has warned that the next two days are critical, as heavy rainfall in India’s Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh catchment areas is expected to push additional floodwaters into Pakistan.
Officials fear that if India releases an additional 300,000 cusecs into the Sutlej, areas around Lahore and its outskirts could face massive devastation. Already, localities such as Mohlanwal on Multan Road have been inundated, forcing emergency evacuations as water entered residential homes.
Monsoon rains over the past week swelled the three major rivers that cut through Punjab. The flooded rivers have affected mostly rural areas near their banks, but heavy rain also flooded urban areas, including several parts of Lahore. While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, and deadly, across the region.
Landslides and floods triggered by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains have killed more than 850 people nationwide since June.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia confirmed that very high to exceptionally high floods are expected to persist in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala, while the Chenab at Trimmu and Panjnad is likely to attain exceptionally high flood levels through Sept 3.
Addressing the media, the PDMA chief said the situation regarding the release of water from Indian dams has been sensitive and all relevant departments remained alert.
He said the Indus Water Commission, the NDMA and all departments remained active and they spoke with the Indian Commission regarding the Sutlej water.
The Indian Commission did not give any official update regarding the release of water from the Salal Dam, he said.
The decision to conduct breaches in the flood dykes was taken to save populated areas, he said, adding that the Sutlej River caused more destruction in Kasur.
He said the Punjab Irrigation Department had managed the flow of Sutlej water. There is an expected flow of 253,000 cusecs there, which will further decrease at the Kasur point and there will be more water at Head Islam and Vehari.
 
 

Mr Kathia said that when the water reaches the Panjnad at Ali Pur, there will be a flow of over 900,000 cusecs, and a flow of 1.1 million cusecs is expected to enter Sindh.
Water flow
According to data released by the Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) at 11pm on Sunday, the flow at Marala Headworks on the Chenab River was recorded at 114,550 cusecs (falling trend), while Khanki Headworks was at 154,339 cusecs (steady trend).
The flow at Qadirabad Headworks stood at 154,865 cusecs (steady trend). At the Chiniot Bridge, the flow was 209,457 cusecs (falling trend).
A significant concern was Trimmu Headworks, where the flow was in the “very high flood” category at 479,743 cusecs but was falling.
On the River Ravi, the flow was 479,743 cusecs at Jassar, 69,780 at Shahdara, 179,730 (very high) at Balloki, and 50,158 at Sidhnai.
As for the Sutlej River, the flow at Ganda Singh Wala was in “exceptionally high flood” at 253,068 cusecs. The flow was 134,970 at Sulemanki Headworks and 69,730 cusecs at Islam Headworks.
The key point of observation is the Panjnad Headworks, where the flow was normal at 87,564 cusecs at 11pm but was rising.
Death toll rises to 33
PDMA’s latest Flood Situation Report revealed that 33 people lost their lives and eight others were injured due to high floods in the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers from Aug 23 to 31.
According to the report, 2,066,785 people of 2,222 mouzas were affected and 506 relief camps were established to provide shelter to 10,654 people in the province. As many as 352 medical camps were established, in which 17,853 people were treated.
The rescue teams evacuated 760,424 people and 516,258 animals and transported them to safe locations. Veterinary services are being provided through 331 camps.
Meanwhile, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Sunday that recent rains and flash floods have claimed 850 lives and left more than 1,150 people injured across the country.
Speaking to the media alongside Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, the NDMA chief said that over 600,000 people were relocated to safer areas during the flooding, and thousands of livestock were also rescued across the country.
He said the final monsoon spell is expected in the first 10 days of September, with heavy rainfall likely in eastern Punjab, Azad Kashmir and nearby regions.
Over 2m displaced
Climate Minister Musadik Malik told the briefing that nearly 2m people have been displaced across the country, mostly in Punjab, due to devastating floods, warning that the brunt of the crisis is falling on the country’s poorest families.
“Our first, second and third priority is around the 800,000 poorest people who do not have wealthy relatives to rely on and are in dire need of aid,” Mr Malik told the media.
He urged the nation to stand with the poor. “If there is any NGO in your area or if you personally can help a displaced family, please do so,” he emphasised.
Mr Malik pointed to Punjab’s geography, where five rivers converge, as a challenge, warning that the Panjnad system could face flows as high as 3m cusecs if conditions worsen.
Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also confirmed that over 2m people have been affected by floods in Punjab. Of them, nearly 750,000 have been safely evacuated, Ms Aurangzeb said, calling it the “largest evacuation operation in the country’s history”.
UN delegation visits flood-hit Sialkot
Meanwhile, a United Nations delegation led by Resident Coordinator Dr Muhammad Ahmad Yahya visited the flood-affected areas of Sialkot to assess damage and distribute aid.
Accompanied by local officials, including Deputy Commissioner Saba Asghar Ali, Additional Deputy Commissioner General Ayub Bukhari, and Regional Director of Rescue 1122, Syed Kamal Abid, the eight-member delegation embarked on a tour.
They spent two hours visiting the flood-hit areas, including Kot Dasu and Daska, using Rescue 1122 boats. During their visit, they provided rations, ready-to-eat food and drinking water to people impacted by the floodwaters.
“The United Nations stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time,” Dr Yahya said.
Sindh braces for ‘super flood’
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the provincial government had devised a comprehensive plan to deal with the looming “super flood” — a term used when inflows reach 900,000 cusecs or more.
On Sunday, the chief minister visited the Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where he was briefed by the PDMA and other officials regarding flood preparations and relief measures.
He told the media that inflows from Trimmu would reach Sindh in about five days via Panjnad.
He said that in 2010, inflows of 1.1 million cusecs had passed from the Guddu Barrage. “This time, even 900,000 to one million cusecs would be extremely challenging. If inflows remain limited, losses will be manageable, but crops may still not survive,” he said.
Mr Shah said the provincial government’s foremost priority was to protect human lives and livestock, followed by safeguarding the Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages.
“We know exactly which areas will be affected at different water levels — 500,000 to 700,000 cusecs, 700,000 to 900,000, or even beyond. If inflows cross 900,000 cusecs, over 200,000 people may be impacted,” he warned.
He noted that Sindh’s terrain poses greater risks than Punjab’s. “In Punjab, designated breaches allow water to return quickly to the river. But Sindh lies below river level, so once water spreads, it does not recede easily,” he explained.
Also on Sunday, authorities relocated thousands of people from Sindh’s riverine areas to safer locations.
Woman, two daughters killed in KP
Meanwhile, a woman and her two daughters died after the roof of their house caved in due to heavy rains in the Spin Mazak area of Upper South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil late on Saturday night.
According to the district administration officials, the incident occurred when the roof of a room collapsed owing to heavy rains. Locals rushed to the scene and managed to recover bodies from debris before shifting them to Wana Hospital.
Deputy Commissioner Upper South Waziristan Asmat Ullah Wazir expressed grief over the loss of lives and directed officials to provide non-food items and other basic relief to the affected family. He said that compensation and further assistance measures were being arranged.
Only last week, torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc across the district, sweeping away three key bridges and destroying three houses completely.
In a separate incident, an 18-year-old girl was swept away by floodwaters and lost her life. The deputy commissioner said the district administration in South Waziristan Upper was making all-out efforts to support the affected families.

According to the state-run PTV which cited the Pakistan Meteorological Department, the earthquake was recorded at 12:18am.
It added that the tremors were felt in Peshawar, Manshera, Abbottabad, Hangu, Malakand, Swat, Chitral, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad.
 






A Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson said the quake was recorded at a depth of 10 kilometres with its epicentre located southwest of Asadabad, Afghanistan.
Shocks were also felt in India and Tajikistan.
Following the tremors, district administrations across Punjab began inspections of buildings to assess structural safety.
“However, no casualties or damage have been reported so far,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia confirmed.
The PDMA stated that its provincial control room and all district emergency operation centers remain on 24/7 alert.
Citizens have been urged to report any earthquake-related losses or emergencies by calling the PDMA helpline at 1129.

Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and motorcycles, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
A notification from the Finance Division, available with Dawn.com, stated that the new price of HSD was Rs269.99, while petrol would remain at Rs264.61 — the same as the start of August. Additionally, the prices of superior kerosene oil and light diesel oil were slashed by Rs1.46 per litre and Rs2.40, respectively.
“The government has revised the petroleum product prices for the fortnight starting tomorrow (September 1), in line with the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the concerned ministries,” the Finance Division stated.
Earlier this week, the cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved a financial bailout for Pakistan Television (PTV), a recovery plan for Rs47 billion in outstanding petroleum levy from Cynergico Refinery, and the use of funds collected under the captive levy on gas to reduce electricity rates for all consumers.
On August 16, the Finance Division announced a cut of Rs12.84 per litre in the price of HSD for the next fortnight, while petrol prices remained unchanged. The prices of superior kerosene oil and light diesel oil were slashed by Rs7.19 per litre and Rs8.2, respectively.</p><small>2025-08-31 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/311626240c4f544.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938680/govts-policies-closely-align-with-president-xis-vision-for-nations-progress-pm-shehbaz-says-on-china-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Govt’s policies closely align with President Xi’s vision for nation’s progress, PM Shehbaz says on China visit</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday that all the endeavours and initiatives of the current government of Pakistan closely aligned with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s vision and philosophy that were anchored in progress and prosperity of the Chinese nation.
PM Shehbaz arrived in China yesterday to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) two-day Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
Addressing students and faculty members of Tianjin University today, the premier urged the Pakistani students currently studying there to gain the latest knowledge and technology with sheer commitment and hard work.
In his address, which was also broadcast on national TV channels, the prime minister said that Pakistan fully supported President Xi’s philosophy and vision.
He noted that the Chinese leadership had “inspiring” strategic long-term planning for the progress of the country while keeping the welfare of its people at heart.
 


“President Xi’s visionary leadership conveyed to the entire globe that long-lasting friendship could be achieved through multilateralism and not through unilateralism, while shared progress and prosperity could be conceived through joint teams’ work and not through exclusive rights,” PM Shehbaz added.
Members of the prime minister’s delegation, ambassadors, and officials were also present on the occasion.
The premier also mentioned that taking 800 million people out of poverty had been the most towering achievement of China, which was made possible due to the historic transformation under President Xi’s visionary leadership. He hailed the Chinese president’s commitment to the welfare of his people and to building a shared destiny and future.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that the enduring friendship between the two nations not only stood the tests of time but faced enormous challenges of history.
“It withstands owing to commitment and clear vision in our minds; together to find a shared destiny,” he said, adding that all the designs to keep these two great friendly countries were defeated by their united actions and clear understanding.
 
 

The prime minister said the Pak-China time-tested friendship was built by their elder generations through unwavering commitment, honesty and unbelievable sincerity, thus “laying the foundation of a friendship to stand on pillars of mutual trust”.
He asserted that the friendship between the two nations would last forever, no matter what challenges came in their way. He noted that their ties were as old as the Silk Road, and as profound as the religious ties between Gandhara, Taxila and Beijing.
He enumerated the historical facts that forged stronger ties, including Pakistan being the first Muslim country to recognise the People’s Republic of China and PIA’s first direct flight from Karachi to Beijing about 60 years ago.
The prime minister lauded that owing to their hard work, sincerity and untiring efforts, the Chinese leadership and its people had transformed the country into the second-largest economy and military powerhouse in the world, adding that Pakistan felt pride over the achievement of its friend.
PM Shehbaz asserted that the incumbent government in Pakistan was also committed to eradicating corruption and poverty, and went on to claim that “not a single corruption case had emerged” during the current government’s tenure.
“We have a shared destiny with China and should learn from the knowledge imparted by the Chinese universities to bring economic [and] agricultural prosperity to the people of Pakistan,” he said.
 
 

The prime minister expressed his satisfaction that more than 200 individuals from various parts of Pakistan were studying at Tianjin University. He called on them to utilise their expertise in Pakistan for the welfare, progress and prosperity of their people.
Noting that the university was regarded as “a cradle of great learning” and terming students as ambassadors of Pakistan, the premier expressed the optimism that, owing to their hard work and dedication, they would return to Pakistan as architects for their future.
“Above all, you are the torch bearers of Pakistan-China friendship,” PM Shehbaz highlighted.

The prime minister said the students would become great experts and serve as helping hands not only in China’s progress but also for the well-being and progress of Pakistan.
He observed that about 60 per cent of the population in Pakistan comprised the youth, “which is a huge challenge”, and stressed that they should reap the demographic dividends to unlock this potential and chart new horizons in collaboration with China.
The prime minister noted that the government had sent 1,000 agriculture graduates from Pakistan to China to learn modern techniques. Moreover, about 30,000 students from Pakistan had been getting education and training in China.
He also termed vocational training as critical in building and training the youth in different parts of Pakistan. The prime minister also fondly recalled his memories of his visit to the university in 2017.
The prime minister also visited the National Earthquake Simulation Centre at Tianjin University and appreciated China’s use of modern technology for disaster management.
“By benefiting from Chinese expertise in this regard, Pakistan will be able to adopt effective precautionary measures and strategies to deal with natural disasters in the future,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz, Turkiye’s Erdogan meet on the sidelines
On the sidelines of the summit, PM Shehbaz reviewed bilateral relations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and expressed satisfaction with the ties between Islamabad and Ankara, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“They noted with appreciation the steady increase in high-level exchanges and cooperation across a broad spectrum, including political, economic, defence and security domains,” APP added.
The Turkish president offered his condolences to the PM over the loss of life and property amid the ongoing floods ravaging various parts of Pakistan.
Erdogan “expressed his country’s solidarity with the people of Pakistan and said that the government and people of Turkiye stood shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan in this hour of need”, APP reported.
The pair discussed regional developments and also expressed grave concern
 






PM Shehbaz is leading a delegation from Pakistan to participate in the SCO summit. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
 
 

Leaders from Mongolia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Turkiye, Egypt, the Maldives, Myanmar and others, as well as the chief of the United Nations and heads of various regional and international organisations, are also attending as part of the expanded format.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the prime minister had met visiting heads of state at the summit, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“At the 25th SCO Heads of State Council in Tianjin, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held informal meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedow, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres,” the post read.
“The warmth and cordiality shown reflected the brotherly and friendly ties between Pakistan and these nations.”
 






PM Shehbaz is slated to reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to promoting multilateralism, enhancing regional security and advancing sustainable development, the FO said in a statement earlier. He is also expected to have bilateral meetings with other SCO leaders and invited members to “strengthen diplomatic relations”.
The prime minister would also hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”, according to the FO.
“He would also attend the military parade with President Xi and other world leaders being held in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World’s Anti-Fascist War,” the FO added.
PM Shehbaz, as per the statement, would “interact with reputed Chinese businessmen and corporate executives to discuss bilateral trade, economic and investment ties”. He would also address a Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference in Beijing.
 






The statement highlighted that the visit was a part of leadership-level exchanges between the two countries.
“It manifests the importance attached by the two countries to further deepen their All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, reaffirm support on issues of respective core interests, advance Phase-II of CPEC and maintain regular communication on important regional and global developments,” FO said.
Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.</p><small>2025-08-31 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/31234028f28f146.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938720/ogra-notifies-054pc-decrease-in-lpg-price' target='_blank'><strong>Ogra notifies 0.54pc decrease in LPG price</strong></a><br><p>The Oil and Gas Regulatory (Ogra) on Sunday notified the new price of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) at Rs214.19 per kilogramme for the month of September, according to a notification available with Dawn.com.

These prices are effective from September 1 onwards.
“The LPG producer price is linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate,” a separate Ogra press release read.
“As compared to [the] previous month, Saudi Aramco-CP remains unchanged.

A tense tussle at Anfield looked set to end in a stalemate until the Hungarian’s 83rd-minute strike ensured the defending champions remain the only side with a perfect record from the opening three games.
In all three matches, Arne Slot’s men have scored late winners, also overcoming Bournemouth and Newcastle in dramatic fashion.
Liverpool may still be a work in progress after overhauling the squad that romped to the title last season. But they remain the team to beat thanks to an abundance of attacking talent capable of match-winning moments like the one Szoboszlai produced.
Liverpool could even be stronger come the end of the transfer window on Monday as they look to add Newcastle’s unsettled striker Alexander Isak and Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster their defence.

Arsenal have backed Mikel Arteta with over £250 million ($338 million) worth of new signings in a bid to usurp the Reds and win the Gunners’ first Premier League title since 2004.
The visitors were hampered by the absence of the injured Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz. But Viktor Gyokeres did little to silence doubts that he can make the step up from a prolific spell at Sporting Lisbon to the Premier League. The Swede was easily marshalled by Virgil van Dijk.
To add to the Gunners’ injury woes, William Saliba went off inside the opening five minutes, replaced by Christhian Mosquera. The Spanish under-21 international is yet to make a Premier League start but was not seriously tested as Liverpool’s new-look attack struggled to click into gear.
Despite defensive issues this season, Slot again named a front four of club record signing Florian Wirtz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike.
At Arsenal, Noni Madueke’s arrival was not met with enthusiasm by fans who even started a petition to block the England international’s £48.5 million move from Chelsea. Deputising for Saka on the right wing, Madueke was by far the visitors’ biggest threat.

Milos Kerkez has had a difficult start to his Liverpool career and was consistently beaten for pace by Madueke, who lacked the finishing touch.
A desperate Kerkez challenge deflected Madueke’s strike over with the best effort of a disjointed first half.
The second half followed the same cagey pattern with both sides wary of risking a damaging early defeat in the title race.
Liverpool did have the ball in the net on the hour, only to be denied by the offside flag.
David Raya breathed a sigh of relief after he failed to hold Wirtz’s effort and then tripped Gakpo before Ekitike forced the ball in.
Psychological blow
However, Gakpo had strayed offside before collecting the rebound.
That excitement did at least bring the Anfield crowd to life to inspire a late Liverpool push for all three points.
Arsenal had not conceded this season and it took something special to break down Arteta’s men. Szoboszlai’s free-kick dipped and curled perfectly in off the Raya’s right-hand post to leave the Spaniard helpless.
Arsenal had a penalty shout waved away for Joe Gomez’s challenge on Eberechi Eze in their pursuit of an equaliser.
Liverpool stood strong to register their first clean sheet of the season and land an early psychological blow in the title race.</p><small>2025-08-31 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3121340331936b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938709/ctd-says-five-terrorists-linked-to-ttp-and-aqis-arrested-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>CTD says five ‘terrorists linked to TTP and AQIS’ arrested in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Sunday claimed to have arrested five suspected militants linked with outlawed groups in separate incidents in Karachi, according to a statement.
The CTD and Federal Intelligence Agency, acting on a tip-off, conducted joint operations in the Manghopir area and on Kashmir Road near the KMC Sports Complex and apprehended five suspects believed to be affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Sub-continent (AQIS), the statement read, quoting a spokesperson.
“Two arrested suspects belong to the TTP, while three others belong to AQIS,” the statement read. “Illegal weapons were seized from their possession. They (weapons) have been sent to the police’s forensic science lab to ascertain whether they have been used in any criminal activity.”
The CTD added that the suspects received training from a neighbouring country and were planning to carry out acts of terrorism in Karachi.
“Cases of illegal possession of weapons have been registered against the suspects at the CTD police station,” the statement concluded.
On August 23, the CTD said that it found involvement of the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in this connection.
According to a statement by the law enforcement agency, “In a joint operation, Sindh CTD and the state intelligence agencies traced the network working for the Indian intelligence agency RAW and arrested six suspects.”
It added that the 45-year-old victim was “an innocent citizen who actively participated in welfare work”.
“The suspects escaped after unjustly killing him,” the statement said, adding that the Indian media had expressed “immense joy” over the murder and claimed that “an Indian enemy was killed in Pakistan”.

Until today, Pakistan and Armenia did not have formal diplomatic relations. The relationship was characterised by a regional geopolitical rivalry, with Pakistan supporting Azerbaijan against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as per the Press Information Department.
However, earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan had agreed to consider establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia after a phone call with counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan following a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
According to the FO today, Islamabad and Yerevan formally established diplomatic relations by exchanging a joint communique in Tianjin, on the sidelines of the ongoing Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.
“Marking a historic step forward, both the leaders [Dar and Mirzoyan] affirmed their commitment to the principles and objectives of [the] United Nations Charter and discussed possible avenues of cooperation, including economy, education, culture, and tourism,” the FO statement read.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their desire to work closely with each other at bilateral and multilateral fora, to achieve their shared objectives of peace, progress, and prosperity for the peoples of their two countries.”
 






In a post on X, Dar wrote that he was pleased to sign the joint communique with his Armenian counterpart and echoed the FO’s remarks on affirming their commitment to the principles of the UN Charter.
 






The FM also attached photos of himself and Mirzoyan signing and exchanging the document, fanked by their national flags.
The Armenian foreign minister aslo wrote on X: “By this major step, our governments express their desire to develop mutually beneficial cooperation in line [with] the UN Charter [and] readiness to foster constructive engagement in multilateral fora.
 






Previously this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal.
“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a statement on X.
He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”</p><small>2025-08-31 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/31194314c98b1dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938703/chinas-xi-says-sco-bears-greater-responsibilities-for-keeping-regional-peace' target='_blank'><strong>China’s Xi says SCO bears ‘greater responsibilities’ for keeping regional peace</strong></a><br><p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security forum now bears “greater responsibility” for safeguarding regional peace and stability, as well as promoting the development and prosperity of its member states, Chinese President Xi Jinping told about 20 world leaders he hosted on Sunday evening.

On August 30, the provincial capital Peshawar received 41 millimetres of rain, whereas heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in Khyber district also swelled the Budni and other nullahs, submerging low-lying areas along Warsak Road, Safia Town, Regi Model Town and Nasir Bagh, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
As per the KP PDMA report, as a result of the rain, “two were reported dead in Peshawar — both children — including a child who was swept away by a flash flood and another three-month-old infant who died as a result of a roof collapse incident.”
Five people sustained injuries in separate infrastructure collapse incidents.
Meanwhile, heavy rain in upper South Waziristan claimed the lives of three people from the same family after the roof of their house collapsed. The dead include two children and a woman.
According to the PDMA report, a total of six houses have been damaged due to rain and urban flooding, including three that were destroyed completely.
In a statement, the PDMA spokesperson said, “PDMA has directed respective district administrations to intensify relief efforts and ensure timely assistance to victims.”
“PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre is fully functional,” the spokesperson added, urging people to contact PDMA’s helpline at 1700 in case of emergency or weather updates.
According to the PMD, Cherat received 165mm of rain over the past 24 hours, while Kakul received 54mm, Peshawar 41mm, Balakot 14mm, Malam Jabba 10mm, Bannu 5mm, and Dera Ismail Khan 4mm.
The latest data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) showed that at least 853 people have died and over 1,000 have been injured in rain-related incidents and flash flooding since the start of the Monsoon season on June 25.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p><small>2025-08-31 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3113080905f56f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938651/president-zardari-signs-anti-terrorism-amendment-bill-into-law' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari signs anti-terrorism amendment bill into law</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday signed into law the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeking to improve counterterrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards.
The amendments, made to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, were passed by both the National Assembly and the Senate this month amid the opposition’s uproar, as it reinserted powers granted to law enforcement authorities (LEAs) and the armed forces to detain individuals for up to three months.
“President Asif Ali Zardari has given assent to the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025,” today’s statement by the President’s House said.
“This law strengthens the ability of security agencies to prevent terrorism and protect national security.”
It added that the law included judicial oversight and safeguards to provide recourse against misuse and abuse of power, unlike past arbitrary practices.
“The amendment aims to improve counter-terrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards,” it said. “This is an important step in addressing Pakistan’s ongoing security challenges.”
The bill, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, read: “The government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case maybe, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventative detention of any person.”
This amendment was made to sub-section (1) of Section 11EEEE of the ATA.
Any person suspected of activities against national security or safety will be detained, according to the bill, adding that persons involved in target killing, kidnapping for ransom, or extortion can be detained for three months.
The bill also added that it applies “against whom sufficient grounds exist of his having been so concerned, for [the] purpose of inquiry”.
It stated that the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
If a detention order is issued by the army or civil forces, the investigation will be conducted by a joint investigation team, according to the bill.
“The inquiry will be conducted by no police officer below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law-enforcing agencies,” the bill added.
The statement of objects and reasons, presented in the houses during the passage of the bill, said that the current security situation in the country required a “robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework.”
“The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the Act ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, Armed Forces and Civil Armed Forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed, it said.
This will also provide law enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It would facilitate the use of joint interrogation teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence, the statement added.</p><small>2025-08-31 08:14</small></div><hr>
