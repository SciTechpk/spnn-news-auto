Opener Saim smashed a 38-ball 69, with four sixes and seven fours, while Hasan’s 26-ball 56 included six maximums, lifting Pakistan to 207 all out in exactly 20 overs.
Asif Khan threatened to snatch an unlikely win for UAE with a brilliant 35-ball 77 before falling in the last over.
The UAE managed 176-8 from their 20 overs.
 






Skipper Muhammad Waseem also hit a breezy 18-ball 33 but was run out in the sixth over.
Earlier, Pakistan’s innings was built around the excellence of Saim and Hasan after they won the toss and batted first.
Once Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman and skipper Salman Agha cheaply, it was left to Saim and Hasan to provide the rescue acts.
Saim’s fourth T20I half-century came off just 25 balls while Hasan’s fifty was reached in 24 deliveries with a hat-trick of sixes off spinner Haider Ali.
Hasan added 57 for the fifth wicket off just 25 balls with Mohammad Nawaz, who added a 15-ball 25.
Faheem Ashraf chipped in with 16 as Pakistan clubbed 64 in the last five overs.
Junaid Siddique and Saghir Khan grabbed three wickets apiece, but were both expensive.
Pakistan skipper Salman saidhe wanted death bowling to improve.
“It was a perfect batting game. First 15 overs with the bowling we were good, but the last five overs we need to work on. It’s something we have been working on but yeah we need to get better,” he said.
“I think our death bowling is something we are working on and it’s concerning. We need to be better in the next game, but overall we have been playing really well and this is how we want to continue playing.”
Afghanistan, who lost to Pakistan by 39 runs on Friday, face the UAE in the next match on Monday.

Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2025</p><small>2025-08-31 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/31082606385418c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938559/agricultural-loss' target='_blank'><strong>Agricultural loss</strong></a><br><p>THE current wave of floods has ravaged vast tracts of farmland across the plains of central Punjab.
Hundreds of thousands of mostly smallholders have been displaced, with floodwaters sweeping away their food and other crops.
More agricultural land will be swallowed by the raging waters, surging southwards to converge with the Indus in the coming days. A major economic upheaval is already emerging, along with a humanitarian crisis. Though it is still too early for a full assessment of the damage wreaked on crops and livestock, initial reports suggest that farmers’ losses are already running into billions.
 
 

The deluge has wiped out standing rice, maize and other crops besides vegetables in more than 2,100 villages located along the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab. The rushing waters are now expected to inflict further damage on croplands in Punjab’s cotton-producing southern districts before cascading into Sindh.
The agricultural losses will weigh heavily on both the economy and people. The destruction of crops and disruption of food supply chains have set the stage for spiralling food inflation. The 2022 floods offer a sobering reminder: food prices surged month after month. But the impact of flooding goes beyond food inflation.
For many of the affected farmers — mostly smallholders — the devastation is total: with crops, livestock, homes and livelihoods all swept away. Left with nothing to live on — let alone invest in the next crop — more people are likely to slip below the poverty line. The increase in the prices of essential foods will disproportionately affect low-income rural and urban households. Beyond the immediate impact, the economic costs are staggering. The agriculture losses will be felt across industries, and reduce automobile and fertiliser sales.
More worrying is the impact on the fragile balance-of-payments situation, with the deluge likely to push up the import bill due to domestic shortages of food items. Exports, on the other hand, may suffer due to production losses in rice and cotton.
 
 

Overall, the damage to farm output will keep GDP growth depressed. The farm sector, which forms nearly a quarter of the economy and employs almost 40pc of the labour force, had grown marginally by 0.56pc — the lowest in a decade — last year against a five-year average of 3.38pc. Pakistan has suffered nearly 20 major flood disasters since 1950 — half of them in the last two decades.
Climate change is intensifying their frequency and severity, yet national preparedness remains inadequate. The lesson from the current disaster is clear: floods are no longer freak incidents but recurring economic shocks that depress GDP growth, widen deficits, wash away livelihoods and drag millions deeper into poverty.
Unless we radically overhaul our disaster preparedness and invest in agricultural resilience, each new flood event will drown villages, devastate livelihoods and reduce growth.

Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
The SCO summit, to be held in Tianjin today and tomorrow, gathers more than 20 world leaders in a powerful show of Global South solidarity, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
Earlier this month, China had welcomed Modi’s planned visit, as foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded to media reports. Together, China and India account for over one-third of the world’s population, and both economies and their global influence are on the rise.
Following the 2020 border clash, China-India relations went through a long period of frostiness, severely impacting political trust, economic ties and people-to-people exchanges.
In October last year, the successful meeting between the Chinese and Indian leaders in Kazan set the tone for a fresh restart in bilateral relations.
 
 

Xi yesterday began welcoming leaders, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Egyptian Premier Moustafa Madbouly. Putin is also due to arrive in Tianjin ahead of the summit.
China and Russia have used the SCO — sometimes touted as a counter to the Western-dominated Nato military alliance — to deepen ties with Central Asian states.
PM Shehbaz in China
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also set to attend the high-level SCO moot. Arriving in China yesterday with Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, the premier said he looked forward to meeting Xi and other world leaders.
According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO), PM Shehbaz is leading a delegation from Pakistan to participate in the SCO’s Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit from August 31 to September 1.
Leaders from Mongolia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Turkiye, Egypt, the Maldives, Myanmar and others, as well as the chief of the United Nations and heads of various regional and international organisations, will also attend as part of the expanded format.
PM Shehbaz is slated to reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to promoting multilateralism, enhancing regional security and advancing sustainable development, the FO said. He is also expected to have bilateral meetings with other SCO leaders and invited members to “strengthen diplomatic relations”.
On the engagements in China, the FO said the prime minister would hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”.</p><small>2025-08-31 04:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/310926445c184c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938513/dollar-shortage-strains-rupees-artificial-strength' target='_blank'><strong>Dollar shortage strains rupee’s ‘artificial’ strength</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee is under increasing pressure as demand for dollars rises, while exchange companies are struggling with a severe shortage of cash dollars.
Currency experts have warned that administrative measures aimed at supporting the rupee may backfire, especially in the face of unforeseen events such as the recent flood devastation across the country.
Despite the growing demand for dollars and a reduction in supply, the rupee has managed to appreciate since the government crackdown and stricter monitoring in July. However, experts believe that the current trend could be unsustainable if demand continues to outstrip supply.
According to currency dealers, many exchange companies are running low on US dollars, raising concerns about potential hoarding or smuggling. “While smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely,” said one currency dealer. This shortage is also a sign of illegal currency operators possibly entering the market, further exacerbating the situation.
Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, warned that “no force can outmuscle the market when the fundamentals are stacked against it”. The rupee has been artificially strengthened by administrative measures, especially in the open market, which has led to a significant slowdown in actual cash transactions. “Exchange companies are hardly ever holding forex cash,” Mamsa noted.

Experts warn administrative measures could backfire

This situation is expected to have a negative impact on remittances in the near future. Mamsa also suggested that it might reignite the use of hawala transactions or cryptocurrency exchanges, which are increasingly used as alternatives for foreign currency dealings.
Speaking before the National Assembly’s standing committee, Dr Inayat Husain, Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), confirmed that the rupee’s strength since mid-2024 is largely due to higher inflows and administrative controls.
To prevent an “over-correction,” the SBP has purchased $7.8bn from the market, raising reserves to $14.5bn (approximately 2.3 months of import cover). However, officials argue that the rupee is now “fairly valued,” and that interventions are necessary to ensure external stability and counter concerns of an artificial peg.
Meanwhile, exporters are holding back their proceeds, further tightening supply in the market. This has created an uneasy calm — an appearance of strength amid a drying up of supply. Experts warn that if inflows continue to stagnate, the pressure on the rupee could intensify, leading to a sharp correction. “As history shows, markets are always right,” Mamsa added.
On a positive note, Pakistan stands to benefit from a 50pc US tariff on Indian textile exports, which has created a gap in the market worth around $16bn. Additionally, Pakistan enjoys a 19pc tariff on its exports to the US, which is slightly more favourable than Bangladesh and Vietnam, both of which face a 20pc tariff.

The groups, including Amnesty Int­ernational, the Human Rights Com­mi­ssion of Pakistan (HRCP) and Defence of Human Rights (DHR), voiced collective alarm over what they described as a systemic failure to deliver justice, truth or reparations to victims and their families.
 
 

“A flawed system of accountability and official data from the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappear­a­nces (COIOED) reveals the scale of the problem but also the system’s failure to provide meaningful justice,” cha­­irperson of Defence of Human Rig­­hts (DHR) Amna Masood Janjua said.
Ms Janjua noted that state institutions have practised enforced disappearances with utmost impunity for over two decades.

HRCP, seven other groups seek justice, legal reforms on International Day of Victims of Enforced Disappearances

Other groups involved in the conference were the Baloch Yakjehti Com­m­ittee (BYC), Pashtun Tahafuz Move­ment (PTM), Voice for Missing Per­s­o­­ns of Sindh (VMPS), Sindhian Natio­nal Congress, and the Asian Federation Against Involuntary and Enforced Disappearances (AFAD).
Speakers highlighted that since 2010, the commission has documented 10,592 cases, including over 3,000 submitted by the DHR. They added that 140 new cases were reported this year alone.
 
 

The DHR chairperson said the commission has never ordered a prosecution against a single perpetrator, reinforcing a culture of impunity.
“In a handful of cases where this Commission has issued production orders, it failed miserably to get them complied,” Ms Janjua said.
 
 

“Our demands, ironically the same for the last 20 years, are to immediately disclose the whereabouts of all forcibly disappeared individuals and hold perpetrators accountable throu­­gh independent, impartial investigations and fair trials,” she added.
The speakers, including rights act­i­v­­ists Afrasiyab Khan Khattak and Ta­­hira Abdullah, also noted that a re­­cent amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act that allows security forces to detain individuals for up to three months is evi­dence that the tightening of the noose around citizens’ necks was on the rise.
Truth, Reconciliation Commission
Ms Abdullah called it “deplorable” that while the National Judicial Policy Making Committee has announced a committee to address the issue of enforced disappearances, results are still awaited.
She called for either reforming the COIOED or establishing a new, victi­m-centred “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” with representation from the families of the disappeared.
Later, the groups released a joint statement highlighting that authorities intentionally use disappearances as a tool to suppress political activists, ethnic minorities, journalists, and human rights defenders.
The BYC reported 546 cases this year, the PTM recorded 133, and the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh noted 40, with more than 1,300 people still missing.
The statement criticised authorities for their continued reliance on laws that enable arbitrary detentions, such as the Army Act, the Official Secrets Act, and the Actions (in Aid of Civil Power) Regulation of 2011.
These laws, it said, limit judicial oversight and allow for prolonged incommunicado detentions under the pretext of national security.
The organisations said Pakistan is obligated to protect against arbitrary detention and torture. They deman­ded that the county must ratify the International Conven­tion for the Pro­tection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

• US president vows to fight back
WASHINGTON: A US appeals court has ruled that many of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have upended global trade, were illegal — but allowed them to remain in place for now, giving him time to take the fight to the Supreme Court.
The 7-4 ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday affirmed a lower court’s finding that Trump had exceeded his authority in tapping emergency economic powers to impose wide-ranging duties.
But the judges allowed the tariffs to stay in place through mid-October — and Trump swiftly made clear he would put the time to use.
The appeals court “incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,” he said in a statement on his Truth Social platform lashing out at the ruling.
He added that he would fight back “with the help of the United States Supreme Court”. The decision marks a blow to the president, who has wielded duties as a wide-ranging economic policy tool.
 
 

It could also cast doubt over deals Trump has struck with major trading partners such as the European Union, and raised the question of what would happen to the billions of dollars collected by the United States since the tariffs were put in place if the conservative-majority Supreme Court does not back him.
Friday’s case, however, does not deal with sector-specific tariffs that the Trump administration has also imposed on steel, aluminum, autos and other imports.
‘Diplomatic embarrassment’
Since returning to the presiden­cy in January, Trump has invoked the International Emergency Econo­mic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose “reciprocal” tariffs on almost all US trading partners, with a 10-percent baseline level and higher rates for dozens of economies.
He invoked similar authorities to slap separate tariffs hitting Mexico, Canada and China over the flow of deadly drugs into the United States.
The Court of International Trade had ruled in May that Trump overstepped his authority with across-the-board global levies, blocking most of the duties from taking effect, but the appeals court later put the ruling on hold to consider the case.
Friday’s ruling noted that “the statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”.
It added that it was not addressing if Trump’s actions should have been taken as a matter of policy or deciding whether IEEPA authorises any tariffs at all.
Instead, it sought to resolve the question of whether Trump’s “reci­procal” tariffs and those imposed over trafficking were authorised, with the document noting: “We conclude they are not.”
In a supplementary filing just hours before the appeals court released its decision, Trump cabinet officials argued that ruling the global tariffs illegal and blocking them would hurt US foreign policy and national security.
“Such a ruling would threaten broader US strategic interests at home and abroad, likely lead to retaliation and the unwinding of agreed-upon deals by foreign-trading partners,” wrote Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.  He added that they could also “derail critical ongoing negotiations” with partners.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meanwhile, warned that suspending the effectiveness of tariffs “would lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment”.
Several legal challenges have been filed against the tariffs Trump invoked. If these tariffs are ultimately ruled illegal, companies could seek reimbursements.

The department placed a report in the case file of Dr Fowzia Siddiqui, who is seeking her sister Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release from a US prison, noting that the notices to premier and his ministers over non-compliance of the order were not executable.
In its report, the registrar office proposed the formation of a larger bench to deliberate over three central legal issues.
The office questioned whether a judge can self-assign cases to their court, violating the Roster of Sitting. It also asked whether a judge can hear a case without the issuance of the approved cause list and whether the consent of various benches is mandatory for the consolidation of identical petitions.

IHC registrar office proposes larger bench to determine legality

The development follows the Aug 29 reassignment of the case from Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, who had issued the sweeping contempt notices, to Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas.
The change is part of a new “Roster of Sitting” taking effect on Sept 1.
On July 21, Justice Ejaz Ishaq issued the notices; however, that particular proceeding became questionable, as the judge was not inc­l­u­ded in the Roster of Sitting approved by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, since he was on a five-week leave effective from July 20.
Consequently, the registrar office put an administrative hold on these notices, pending approval from the competent authority.
Following these developments, and according to the cause list issued by the IHC registrar’s office, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas is now scheduled to address the case with a new hearing date slated for September 1.
Meanwhile, under the new roster, Justice Ejaz Ishaq has been placed on a special division bench with Justice Babar Sattar to hear tax and commercial matters, a posting that prevents him from sitting as a single-judge court and hearing such petitions.
Dr. Fowzia Siddiqui’s petition, pending in the court since 2015, seeks to compel Pakistan’s government to formally support Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, who was imprisoned in the US in 2008 on terrorism charges. The government has so far refused to file an amicus brief in US courts on her behalf.

Officials said that international conflicts, natural calamities and other issues resulted in a 90 per cent drop in tourism across the region.
Sajid Hussain, assistant director at the GB Tourism Department, said that only 270 international climbers arrived in GB this year to attempt peaks, including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II and Nanga Parbat, as compared to more than 2,000 foreign climbers and trekkers who visited the region last year.
He said that most climbers returned without success due to extreme weather conditions at the peaks. Rockfalls, avalanches and high winds forced many to abandon their attempts and remain at base camps before heading back to their countries.
 
 

According to the department, only 40 climbers summited K2, 25 reached Nanga Parbat and about a dozen summited Gasherbrum-I this season.
Iqbal Hussain, director at the GB Tourism Department, told Dawn that last year 24,000 foreign tourists without permits visited GB, along with one million domestic tourists. This year, he said, the situation is alarming as tourist arrivals — both international and domestic — have declined by 90pc.
Asghar Ali Porik, a tour operator, said several factors contributed to the sharp decline in foreign ad­v­e­­nture tourists. “The legal battle between the GB To­­urism Department and tour operators over the hike in permit fees, the Iran-Israel conflict, tensions between Pakistan and India, and unpredictable we­ather conditions at peaks compelled many forei­gn climbers and trekkers to cancel their plans,” he added.
A tea stall owner on the Karakoram Highway said that the tourism season usually runs from May to October. “I have never experienced such a situation where you can go the whole day without a single client and return home empty-handed,” he said.
Like him, hotel owners, shopkeepers, transporters, porters and tour operators are also facing financial losses.
Haider Abbas, owner of Gilgit Looms, said his business had also been badly affected, adding that he had invested billions of rupees, but now found it difficult to pay shop rent and salaries.

Inside the classrooms, blackboards and benches have been replaced by mattresses, bundles of clothes and kitchen utensils — the few belongings people managed to save before the river swallowed their houses and fields.
“We had no warnings. The water came into our village at night, and within hours our homes were gone,” recalls Shazia Bibi, a mother of four now staying in a relief camp at a government school in Shahdara. “My children cry for their toys and other belongings, but everything was swept away in the flood.”
Heavy monsoon rains and massive water inflows from India have swelled the Ravi River, inundating hundreds of riverside settlements. Thousands of villagers, most of them daily-wage earners and small farmers, were forced to abandon their homes.
The government’s relief camps in schools were meant to be a refuge, but conditions are harsh. Families complain of overcrowding, a shortage of clean drinking water, poor sanitation, and insufficient supplies.

Flood survivors complain of shortage of clean drinking water, poor sanitation

Although authorities claim medical teams are present, parents say their children have developed skin rashes and fever due to the unhygienic conditions. Women in particular express frustration over broken or unclean washrooms.
Community volunteers and welfare organisations are stepping in with food and clothing, yet many displaced families feel the help falls short. Women at a “tent village” set up by an NGO in Shahdara echoed the same concerns — no toilets, no privacy, and rising skin infections among children.
“I had two buffaloes, both drowned,” says Ijaz Ahmed, now living in a government camp in Chung. “Those buffaloes were my livelihood. I have no idea how to feed my family after going back.”
Like Ijaz, many displaced families are anxious about returning home. Their greatest fear is not just rebuilding in the same flood-prone areas, but surviving the days after aid ends.
 
 

“Even if the water recedes, who will help us restore our homes?” asks Sughran Bibi. “The government is feeding us here, but who will feed us once we return home?”
Officials admit the challenge is overwhelming. “We have established more than a dozen relief camps in Lahore and are providing food and medical assistance. But the scale of displacement is large, and we are still assessing the damages,” says an official from the deputy commissioner’s office.
According to official data, 18 relief camps have been set up in schools across the city, sheltering at least 4,150 people. Currently, 900 people are housed at five camps in the areas including Sanda, Babu Sabu, Gulshan-i-Ravi and Sherakot; 2,350 at three camps in tehsil Raiwind including Manga Hathar and Mohlanwal; 800 at four camps in tehsil Ravi including Shahdara, Jia Musa and Harbo Jabbo; and 100 at five camps in Allama Iqbal Town tehsil including Chung, Shahpur, Niaz Beg and Mureedwal.
 
 

Interestingly, no displaced families have yet been shifted to a relief camp established in a Wahga tehsil school. Authorities say they have so far evacuated 26,065 people and 3,222 animals from flood-hit areas. Another 65 schools have been identified to serve as relief camps if needed.
Environmental experts stress that the crisis cannot be managed by short-term relief alone. They call for investment in flood protection along the riverbanks, effective early warning systems, and relocation programmes for vulnerable settlements.
Until then, classrooms will remain crowded with families who once called the Ravi’s banks their home, waiting not only for the waters to recede but also for a future less fragile.

The observations came from a three-judge bench headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, while hearing a case involving the Sindh government.
The bench noted with concern the tendency of the federal and provincial governments, as well as autonomous bodies, to institute appeals after the lapse of the limitation period prescribed by law.
Authored by Justice Mazhar, the four-page order regretted that often the plea taken by the governments for condoning the delay was that fulfilling inter-departmental procedures and seeking final instructions from the competent authority delayed timely filing of the case.
Seemingly, applications for condonation of delay are being filed as a routine matter, while adopting a callous approach, which fails to recognise the delay cannot be condoned without the presence of sufficient cause or explaining delay of each and every day.
“The doctrine of equality before law demands that all litigants, including the state, are accorded the same treatment and the law is administered in an even-handed manner,” Justice Mazhar observed, adding the astuteness of the law of limitation does not confer a right but ensues incapacitation after the lapse of the period allowed for enforcing some existing legal rights and foresees the culmination of claims which have decayed by the efflux of time.
It is inherent duty of court to delve into the question of limitation, regardless of whether it is raised or not, he observed, adding carelessness, intentional sluggishness, or lack of bona fides could not be valid reasons for condoning a delay.
“We noted the mechanical and unpersuasive justification of administrative delays has almost become a trend, which is consistently pleaded for condonation of delay through stereotypical and generalised applications, which in our point of view cannot be considered ‘sufficient cause’ or a reasonable ground in every case,” the order said.
The issue arose when the Sindh government’s Land Acquisition Department challenged the April 12, 2022, order of the SHC’s Sukkur bench. In fact, the department had sought to contest a judgement passed on Feb 28, 2002, by the Referee Court/Additional District Judge, Sukkur, in Land Acquisition Reference/Suit No. 13 of 1989.
The SC noted that the civil appeal was time-barred by 30 days and the condonation application attached with the appeal does not specify any ground for indulgence of the apex court except few unconvincing and generic grounds.
No explanation was provided for the delay, nor was it clarified who was responsible for it. The court emphasised the question of limitation cannot be taken casually or unconscientiously. Any person or party wishing to file an appeal in a higher court must be vigilant and diligent in pursuing available remedy within the stipulated timeframe, the SC emphasised.
“If the department was negligent or reckless in causing the delay, then no premium can be placed on such conduct by granting condonation,” the court ruled. Consequently, the SC dismissed the civil appeal, both on merits and for being barred by time.

“In the light of the existing agreements between the UN and its host state, we all urge for this decision to be reconsidered,” Kaja Kallas, the bloc’s top diplomat, said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Kallas invoked “international law” in calling for Washington to reverse the extraordinary step, which further aligns US President Donald Trump’s administration with Israel’s government.
The US move comes as France is leading a push to recognise the Pales­tinian state at the gathering of world leaders in New York. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot spoke out in protest ahead of the Denmark talks.

Abbas ‘barred’ from UN summit; Israeli forces kill 50 more as death toll rises to 63,371

“A UN General Assembly meeting should not be subject to any restrictions on access,” Barrot told reporters.
A string of ministers in Copenhagen echoed France’s call for the United States to allow access to the Palestinian delegation.
The Palestinian Authority has likewise called for the United States to reverse its decision, which it said “stands in clear contradiction to international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement”.
 
 

Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, a veteran 89-year-old leader who once had cordial relations with Washington, had planned to attend the UN meeting.
Under an agreement as host of the United Nations in New York, the United States is not supposed to refuse visas for officials heading to the world body.
A US official said on Saturday that Mahmud Abbas is among 80 officials being denied visas to attend next month’s UN General Assembly, where France is leading a push to recognise a Palestinian state.
“Abbas is affected by this action along with approximately 80 other PA officials,” a State Department official said in a statement, detailing those impacted by the extraordinary decision announced on Friday by the United States.
The United States and Israel have accused France and other powers of rewarding Hamas through their recognition of a Palestinian state. Canada and Australia have also said they would recognise a Palestinian state, and Britain threatened to do so if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire in Gaza.
Meanwhile, heavy bombardment has been reported in Gaza City early on Saturday as Israel said its planned seizure of the besieged Palestinian territory’s largest area was progressing. At least 50 more people were killed in Gaza in a single day, taking the death toll of Palestinians in over 22 months to 63,371.

• Lawmakers of ruling parties vie for coveted slots left vacant after over 40 opposition members quit standing committees
AS more than 40 PTI lawmakers quit parliamentary committees, including the apex Public Accounts Committee, in line with the order of their chief Imran Khan, the decision has been described by analysts as a “political blunder”, which will play into the government’s hands.
More PTI legislators are expected to submit their resignations to the National Assembly Secretariat on Monday — a move that will likely strengthen the treasury benches in parliament. According to observers, Imran Khan’s move to exit the committees was similar to his decision in 2022 when he decided to quit parliament after the 2022 no-trust vote instead of choosing to become a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power.
According to the National Assembly Secretariat (NAS) officials, the decision to resign from the standing committees will not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three to four PTI lawmakers from a committee would not disturb the quorum that requires the presence of one-fourth of the members.
Therefore, the departure from these committees would not make any difference as members from the treasury benches would soon replace them, they added.
Against this backdrop, the treasury lawmakers were already vying for coveted slots left vacant by the PTI members, particularly the positions of the chairperson of at least 10 National Assembly standing committees. Once these positions are in the government’s hands, it will be smooth sailing for the ruling parties.
Previously, the government was facing immense resistance in these committees during debates on proposed legislation referred to respective committees for consultations. A senior PTI leader, on condition of anonymity, said many leaders were not in agreement with the decision taken by Mr Khan as they believed that this move would cede ground to the government.
“The resignations are being given at a time when the government (allegedly) is planning to get the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed,” he claimed.
 
 

He said the decision would force the party to rely on its street power and courts — a move that had proved counterproductive in the past. In 2022, the Supreme Court, in response to a PTI challenge against the NAB law, had asked the party why it did not raise its objections in parliament as “there was no alternative” to the house.
Talking to Dawn , Mudassar Rizvi of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said that despite the disqualification of its legislators, the PTI was still the largest party in both houses and should keep the opposition leader’s offices to maintain its strength. Anything else would be a “political blunder”, as some other party could get its hand on all the important positions despite having less representation.
For political analyst Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), it was quite ironic that PTI decided to leave all standing committees, including the PAC. “This is the same act the PTI had done when it exited the National Assembly and ceded (governments in) all provinces, where it was ruling, one by one,” he added. “A lack of opposition representation in this important committee will negatively impact the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” Mr Mehboob said.
Vying for slots
On the other hand, MNAs from the ruling PML-N, the MQM, and the PPP are making efforts to occupy the vacant chairperson slots previously held by PTI in different standing committees. It is likely that the PAC office would go to PPP’s Naveed Qamar, who also chaired the recent meeting in the absence of PTI’s Junaid Akbar, being its “most senior member”. Nadeem Afzal Chan, however, said the next meeting of the PAC would not take place unless a new chairman was elected. However, PPP Secretary Information Nadeem Afzal Chan told Dawn that the party had not held any discussions on the matter.
A senior leader of PML-N, on condition of anonymity, said those party MNAs who could not get lucrative positions in the standing committees earlier were flexing their muscles to grab the vacant positions, especially the chairperson slots in the committees.
Besides the standing committee, the offices of the opposition leaders in the Senate and the National Assembly are also vacant, following the disqualification of the NA Opposition Leader Omar Ayub and Senate leader Shibli Faraz. Though the PTI has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and PTI Senator Azam Swati for these slots, the party has kept them as backup options.
According to Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, there is no specified timeframe for the election of the opposition leader, but the assembly rules suggest that they should be nominated as soon as possible due to their role in key constitutional functions, including consultations over the names of the next chief election commissioner and ECP members.

The newly created Pakistan Land Port Authority will act as a central platform for coordinating between multiple border management agencies. Its mandate includes facilitating the smooth movement of goods and passengers across land ports, reducing delays, and ensuring more efficient trade flows.
With this development, Pakistan becomes the third country in South Asia, after Bangladesh and India, to establish a dedicated land port authority.
The authority will introduce a robust mechanism to coordinate effectively with border management agencies, streamline trade facilitation, and enhance cross-border connectivity. It will also play a vital role in meeting Pakistan’s obligations under international agreements and conventions.
 
 

The establishment of the Pakistan Land Port Authority marks a significant step towards strengthening the country’s regional trade integration, improving border management, and enhancing economic connectivity with neighbouring countries.
Change in 11th NFC
In another significant development, President Asif Ali Zardari has approved a change in the constitution of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC).
According to the Presi­dency, the change became necessary after the government of Balochistan revised its nomination, recommending Mahfooz Ali Khan as its non-ex officio member in the 11th NFC.
The president accorded approval to this nomination, superseding the earlier approval.
The Balochistan government earlier withdrew the nomination of Farmanullah Khan, former CEO of the Balochistan Investment Board, and instead nominated Mahfooz Ali Khan to represent the province in the NFC.
This will be Mahfooz Ali Khan’s fourth term representing Balochis­tan in the NFC, as he has previously represented the province in the 5th, 6th and 7th NFCs.
He also held significant roles in the provincial government, including serving as an additional secretary and secretary of finance for six years. He retired as a Grade-21 officer in 2014 after serving as Balochistan’s secretary of finance.
In addition, he has held key positions such as Accounts General of Balochistan, Controller Military Accounts, and Director General of the National Institute of Manage­ment (NIM) Balochistan.
Petroleum Bill
President Zardari has also asse­nted to the Petroleum (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as passed by parliament.
The Act strengthens measures against smuggling and illegal operation of petrol pumps.
It empowers deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and customs authorities to confiscate illegal petroleum products and vehicles, introduces IT-based tracking, and enhances penalties for violations.
The legislation is expected to modernise petroleum sector regulation, improve transparency, and strengthen the government’s effor­­ts against smuggling and tax evasion.
Besides, the president has also given his assent to the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as passed by parliament.

• Transport alliance urges Punjab administrations to install diversion signs for container trucks
• Fertiliser shipments via flood-hit river corridors suspended
• Movement on highways still smooth
• Onion, potato supplies to Karachi decline
KARACHI: As various goods for import, export, and local consumption continue to move smoothly on motorways and highways, goods’ transporters have claimed that the ravaging floods in Punjab are causing delays on other routes.
They said shipments from the port city of Karachi to different parts of Punjab, as well as consignments arriving from Punjab to Karachi, are being delayed.
All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance President Nisar Hussain Jafri said that over the last three days, the supply chain has faced delays of two to three days. He added that excluding motorway routes, shipments of goods (both import and export items) from Karachi to various areas of Punjab usually take two to three days under normal conditions. The same time is spent on the return of empty or loaded containers from Punjab.
He said goods carriers are facing problems as the city governments in various areas of Punjab have not displayed diversion signs for container trucks. As a result, carriers often reach points where they cannot proceed further. He urged the administrations to install diversion signs to save diesel and time.
‘Fertiliser supply via flood-hit areas suspended’
Executive Director of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC), retired Brig Shershah Malik, said shipments passing through flood-affected areas such as Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab had almost been suspended. However, the fertiliser movement on motorways and highways was still smooth, but “if floods prolong, fertiliser movement and consumption will definitely be impacted.
“In the next two to three days, floods will cross Multan and on Sept 6, 2025, will enter Sindh. After that, the actual ground situation will become clear,” he said.
He added that shipments to sales points in river corridors and across the rivers had been suspended, though fertiliser application in those areas had also stopped. Hence, there was no immediate chance of shortage in flood-affected regions.
President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, Super Highway, New Subzi Mandi, Haji Shahjehan, said onion supply from Balochistan and potato supply from cold storages had declined in Karachi due to rains and floods. Oil Companies Advi­sory Council (OCAC) Secretary General Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi said he had not yet noticed any disruption in oil supplies to the upcountry. “I do not know what will happen in the next couple of days,” he added.
Pakistan Pharm­aceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chai­rman Tauqeer-ul-Haq said that so far there had been no reports of supply disruption and that the supply of medical goods was continuing normally.
‘Floods pose risk to agri output’
Mohammad Shahroz of Insight Securities said recent flooding in KP and Punjab posed risks to agricultural output and supply chains, which could reignite supply-side inflationary pressures. “It is important to safeguard the nascent stabilisation and strengthen the economic base before shifting gears to growth,” he added.
He estimated headline inflation at 4.1pc for Aug 2025 compared to 9.6pc in the same month last year and 4.1pc in July 2025. On a month-on-month basis, inflation is expected to rise 0.4pc due to higher food prices, though this has been partly offset by lower electricity charges and declining LPG prices.

Sources said militants ambushed Bara Rifles’ 163 Wing in Upper Dir’s Barawal tehsil, leading to a fierce exchange of fire. The checkpost, which is a few hundred metres from the Afghanistan border, was initially overrun by the militants, but they were later repulsed by local volunteers who also joined the fight.
At least three soldiers laid down their lives, while three sustained injuries and moved to a nearby hospital. There were also reports of militant casualties as well, but it could not be confirmed.
The incident comes at a time of heightened militant activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s border districts, where security personnel and civilians have increasingly come under attack in recent weeks, rai­sing concerns among residents about the deteriorating law and order situation.
In Kohat’s Lachi tehsil, a police patrol came under fire, leading to the death of one policeman and injuries to two others. In a subsequent search operation, the police gunned down three militants. The identification process of the murdered militants was in progress, the police said.
He added that an operation was in progress to round up the injured militants while intense fighting with the militants was going on in the Paya area near the Hangu border.
In a separate attack in Mohmand, a police constable and two sustained injuries when militants attacked a post in the Pandiali tehsil on Saturday. DPO Ikramullah said that the attack occurred during a search operation in the Dawezai area of Pandiali tehsil. He said Constable Mohammad Arif was martyred in the attack, while constables Hayat and Ibrar were injured.
 
 

Sources said that the police and security forces continued a search and strike operation in different areas of Mohmand district, during which several suspected hideouts were destroyed.
Three killed in IBO
Separately, the security forces killed three terrorists, including a key commander, in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Loni area of Kulachi tehsil in Dera Ismail Khan.
According to the military’s media wing, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of militants in the area. During an intense exchange of fire, three militants were killed while a cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered from their possession.

LAHORE/ PESHAWAR / GILGIT: While severe flooding in Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers prompted mass evacuations across Punjab, the situation aggravated due to a renewed spell of downpour and a barrage breach in India, leaving Sindh to revise flood displacement estimate, now projecting over 1.65 million people at risk along both banks of the Indus River.
In the country’s northern parts, glacier melting threatened further floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer district as per Met Office warning and some Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, including Peshawar, recorded urban flooding amid heavy rains.
Authorities in Punjab are grappling with what they call an unprecedented hydrological crisis, as the Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) and Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) report dangerously high water levels across key river sites, with several nearing or exceeding critical levels.
Millions of residents in low-lying areas of Punjab are being relocated as authorities struggle to manage what officials describe as an unprecedented hydrological crisis.
The combined inflow from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers continues to pose a severe threat to downstream regions, including Multan and Muzaffargarh. The flows from the three rivers are now halfway through Punjab.
 
 

At 6:30pm, the water levels have risen to 524.20 feet, dangerously close to the critical threshold of 526 feet at the Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River.
Water flow
According to the FFD data as of 12am on Sunday, the water flow at Marala and Khanki headworks on the Chenab River was 95,152 cusecs and 229,100 cusecs, respectively.
Qadirabad Headworks was steady at 203,862 cusecs, and so was Trimmu Headworks at 184,108 cusecs.
The Ravi River is also exhibiting alarming trends. Balloki Headworks was steady at an extremely high volume of 211,395 cusecs, while the flow at Shahdara was falling and stood at 90,500 cusecs. Jassar was also steady at 95,580 cusecs while Sidhnai was rising at 30,481 cusecs.
The Sutlej River continues to flow at exceptionally high levels. Ganda Sing Wala was steady at 253,068 cusecs, Sulemanki Headworks at 154,219 cusecs and Islam Headworks at 68,058 cusecs. Panjnad Headworks was rising at 73,166 cusecs.
On the Indus River, the outflow was recorded at 344,723 cusecs at Guddu Barrage, 256,660 at Sukkur Barrage and 236,223 at Kotri Barrage — all being in the “low flood” category.
Dykes breached
In a high-stakes operation to manage an unprecedented flood wave, provincial authorities were executing controlled breaches of protective dykes along the Chenab River at several locations. The strategy was followed to sacrifice thousands of acres of land to save critical barrages, bridges, and major urban centres in Jhang, Hafizabad, Sheikhupura, Nankana, and Kasur.
Around 850,000 cusecs of water were expected to reach Trimmu Barrage on Saturday night, and a controlled breach of the protective dyke was planned to save the headworks if the water levels exceed its capacity.
The authorities also installed ammunition in two flood dykes near Rangpur and Head Muhammad Wala, in case the flow increased to threaten Multan and Muzaffargarh within a day or two.
Speaking to the media, Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia warned that very high to exceptionally high floods will continue in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers until Sept 3.
According to the Flood For­eca­sting Division, under the influence of a monsoon low over north Madhya Pradesh, heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Bias and Ravi rivers from Sept 2-3.
Mr Kathia said that an exceptionally high flood level will continue in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala, while the Chenab at Trimmu is expected to attain an exceptionally high flood level during Saturday night. He said that the Chenab at Panjnad is expected to attain a very high flood level on Sep 3.
The PDMA chief said floodwaters in Punjab’s rivers right now would meet at Head Panjnad on the night of Sept 4. “It will have a total intensity of 875,000-925,000 cusecs,” he said while speaking to the media.
He forecasted that the waters would then reach the Guddu barrage on Sept 6, with a high intensity of 975,000 to 1,050,000 cusecs due to possible rains.
He said that the floodwaters at Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River right now would reach Head Sulemanki in the next 24-36 hours and “achieve a peak”. Water flow would increase at Head Islam near Vehari in the next 48-55 hours.
Noting that there had been more rain, Mr Kathia said more water flows had entered from India into the Chenab River, leading to a medium-level flood at Marala.
Meanwhile, evacuations in low-lying areas of Pindi Bhattian, Chiniot, Hafizabad, Alipur Chatha, Jhang, Sillanwali, Athara Hazari, Rungpur, Khanewal, Kabirwala, Multan, Shujaabad, Jalalpur Pirwala and Muzaffargarh are ongoing.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Karim Khan said that as many as 261,747 people were evacuated from the division, including 238,419 from Multan, 2,307 from Vehari, 17,068 from Khanewal and 3,953 from Lodhran. As many as 255,538 cattle were also evacuated.
The daily flood situation report, submitted to South Punjab Additional Chief Secretary and seen by Dawn, states that 478,270 people were affected and 514,434 acres of cropland were damaged due to flood in Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur divisions due to flood in Indus and Sutlej rivers. Over 267,683 acres of land were lost due to flooding in the Indus River in the DG Khan division.
Over 383,000 people and 140,000 livestock were evacuated, and 507 relief camps were established after a flood alert in the Chenab River.
1.65m people in Sindh at risk
Meanwhile, the Sindh government has revised its earlier assessment on potential displacement due to floods, now estimating that over 1.65 million people living on both the right and left banks of the Indus River are at risk.
Just a day earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority informed Sindh’s chief minister that more than 52,000 families could face displacement due to high water flows.
However, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, speaking at a press conference on Saturday, revised the figure, stating that the displacement risk could affect over 273,000 families, with 1,651 villages and 167 union councils at risk. He assured the public that the government was fully prepared to respond.
Also on Saturday, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was assured that all the barrages were under control and that all necessary safety measures had been implemented.
Flooding in Peshawar
According to the PMD, the provincial capital received 41 millimetres of rain, whereas heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in Khyber district also swelled the Budni and other nullahs, submerging low-lying areas along Warsak Road, Safia Town, Regi Model Town and Nasir Bagh.
Rain waters entered several houses in these areas, forcing the residents to leave their homes for safer places.
Rescue 1122 said that a roof collapse in the Nahaqi area on Charsadda Road left a minor girl dead, while a wall collapse in the Faqir Killay area of Warsak Road left a person injured.
 
 

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said that rescuers evacuated 300 individuals to safety. He said that the operations engaged over 280 rescue personnel equipped with water rescue vans, disaster-response vehicles, fire engines and ambulances.
He said that relief efforts focused heavily on vulnerable regions, inc­luding Nasir Bagh Road, Warsak Road and Budhni. “Rescue teams utilised rubber boats to safely evacuate elderly citizens, women, and children, prioritising their protection. Loudspeaker announcements along water channels were made to ad­­­vise people to stay vigilant and ta­­­ke precautionary measures,” he said.
Besides, he said that water levels at Budhni Nullah along Charsadda Road were gradually declining. Rescue 1122 teams have also been deployed in the Mian Gujar area.
KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority said that Budni nullah recorded medium-level floods after the rains. Water level in the nullah at Darmangi was recorded at 11,900 cusecs while Pir Bala stood at 9,000 cusecs.
In Khyber district, flash floods washed away a portion of the road in Jamrud as the region received torrential rains early on Saturday morning, suspending traffic on the Peshawar-Torkham Highway for several hours.
The road blockade also affected the integration of the returning Afghan nationals for nearly six hours at Torkham, as most vehicles carrying the Afghan returnees got stranded on the road at Katta Kushtha, where a portion of the road collapsed in gushing floodwaters.
The excessive rains and resulting floods in most water channels in Landi Kotal, Jamrud and Bara caused damage to houses, warehouses, shops and kiosks and swept away a motor car and damaging the boundary wall of a cricket academy in Bara.
Meanwhile, around two dozen students trapped in a flooded watercourse were rescued in the Lakki Marwat district on Saturday.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed officials to remain in the field until rescue and relief operations are complete and ensure the continuous presence of emergency teams until conditions return to normal.
According to the PMD, Cherat received 165mm of rain over the past 24 hours, while Kakul received 54mm, Peshawar 41mm, Balakot 14mm, Malam Jabba 10mm, Bannu 5mm, and Dera Ismail Khan 4mm.
Ghizer faces rising flood risk
The Provincial Emergency Operation Centre issued a “Risk of Excessive Glacier Melt in Ghizer” alert, stating that the temperature at the Darkut station in Yasin Valley had reached 35 degrees Celsius.
The PMD warned that this soaring temperature could lead to excessive glacier melt in the upper areas of Ghizer, heightening the risk of glacial floods, flash floods in streams and nullahs and potential inundation of low-lying settlements.
Resident Gul Sher told Dawn that people in these villages are living in tents without basic necessities. “We have no access to drinking water and our children’s education has been severely affected as schools have been damaged and roads to these institutions are blocked,” he said.

The tri-series of Twenty20 international matches is to tune up for the Asia Cup and features Pakistan, the UAE and Afghanistan. Each team will play the others twice, giving all sides at least four matches before the top two teams qualify for the final, scheduled on September 7.
Pakistan batted first after skipper Salman Agha won the toss and set a target of 208 for the UAE.
 






The UAE only managed to make 176 runs.
Salman had hit an unbeaten half-century and fast bowler Haris Rauf grabbed four wickets as Pakistan upstaged Afghanistan by 39 runs in the tri-series opener on Friday. Salman hit a 36-ball 53 not out with three sixes and as many boundaries, which lifted Pakistan to a solid 182-7 in their 20 overs.
Haris took 4-31 while fellow pacer Shaheen Afridi claimed 2-21, while spinners Mohammad Nawaz (2-23) and Sufiyan Muq­eem (2-25) dismissed Afghanistan for 143 in 19.5 overs before a noisy capacity 16,000 crowd at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.</p><small>2025-08-30 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/302241594ad60b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938474/trump-scraps-india-visit-for-quad-summit-amid-deteriorating-ties-report' target='_blank'><strong>Trump scraps India visit for Quad summit amid deteriorating ties: report</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has scrapped plans to attend an upcoming summit of the ‘Quad’ grouping in India amid deteriorating ties between Washington and New Delhi, US newspaper The New York Times (NYT) reported on Saturday.
Relations between the two countries have plummeted, with 50 per cent levies on many Indian imports into the US taking effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil; a part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
 
 

As ties between both nations deteriorate, NYT reported on Saturday that the breakdown in relations was caused after a phone call on June 17.
“After telling [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall, according to people familiar with the president’s schedule,” the NYT reported, citing “interviews with more than a dozen people in Washington and New Delhi”.
The NYT mentioned how Trump’s repeated claims about having ended the recent brief conflict between India and Pakistan reportedly “infuriated” Modi. The paper added that the dispute “dates back more than 75 years and is far deeper and more complicated than Mr Trump was making it out to be”.
India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
“During a phone call on June 17, Mr Trump brought it up again, saying how proud he was of ending the military escalation,” the NYT reported.
“He mentioned that Pakistan was going to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour for which he had been openly campaigning. The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same.”
It added that the “bristled” Indian premier told Trump that American involvement had nothing to do with the ceasefire and the conflict had been settled directly between India and Pakistan.
“Mr Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi’s comments, but the disagreement — and Mr Modi’s refusal to engage on the Nobel — has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr Trump’s first term,” the report reads, adding that the two leaders have not spoken since the June 17 phone conversation and Trump has only doubled down on taking credit for the ceasefire.
Amid this dispute, India has grown closer to Beijing and Moscow. Modi is currently in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Heads of State summit, where he is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“At its core, the story of Mr Trump and Mr Modi is about two brash, populist leaders with big egos and authoritarian tendencies, and the web of loyalties that help keep both men in power,” the NYT reported.
“But it is also the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan.”
Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Modi turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House after a G7 meeting in Canada, over concerns that he would set up a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was visiting the US at the time.
Reporting the same, NYT said: “Modi declined an invitation from Mr Trump to stop by Washington before he flew home. His officials were scandalised that Mr Trump might try to force their leader into a handshake with Pakistan’s army chief, who had also been invited to the White House for lunch around the same time. It was another clear sign, a senior Indian official said, that Mr Trump cared little for the complexity of their issue or the sensitivities and history around it.”
 
 

The COAS carried out two visits to the US. The first, in June, saw him meet Trump at the White House for luncheon, making him the first sitting army chief to do so.
The field marshal termed his second visit to the US in just one-and-a-half months a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad. During this trip, the COAS engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora.
Pakistan and the US also finalised a trade deal at the start of August, lowering tariffs to 19pc from the previously announced 29pc and helping develop Pakistan’s oil reserves while trade talks between the US and India have stalled.</p><small>2025-08-30 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/302105073b9c955.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938470/prime-minister-of-yemens-houthi-government-killed-in-israeli-strike-media-report' target='_blank'><strong>Prime minister of Yemen’s Houthi government killed in Israeli strike: media report</strong></a><br><p>The prime minister of Yemen’s Houthi government and several other ministers were killed in an Israeli strike on the capital Sanaa, the news agency run by the group said on Saturday, citing a statement by the head of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, Mahdi al-Mashat.
A number of others were wounded in the strike, carried out on Thursday, it said without providing details.
Israel said on Friday that the airstrike had targeted the Iran-aligned group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior officials and that it was verifying the outcome.
 






The Houthi-run news agency ran a statement from the defence minister shortly after it confirmed the prime minister’s death and quoted him as saying the group was ready to confront Israel.
The statement did not mention Thursday’s airstrike and it was unclear if it was made before or after the attack.
Ahmad Ghaleb al-Rahwi became prime minister nearly a year ago, but the de facto leader of the government was his deputy, Mohamed Moftah, who was assigned on Saturday to carry out the prime minister’s duties.
Rahwi was seen largely as a figurehead who was not part of the inner circle of the Houthi leadership.
The Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck a compound in the Sanaa area where senior Houthi figures had gathered, describing the attack as a “complex operation” made possible by intelligence-gathering and air superiority.
On Thursday, Israeli security sources said the targets had been various locations where a large number of senior Houthi officials had gathered to watch a televised speech recorded by leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi.
The Iran-aligned Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. They have also fired missiles towards Israel, most of which have been intercepted. Israel has responded with strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port.
“We remain steadfast in our genuine position of supporting and standing with the people of Gaza, and in building and developing the capabilities of our armed forces to confront all challenges and dangers,” Mahdi al-Mashat’s statement said.</p><small>2025-08-30 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/30165810b26f8f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938378/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-tianjin-for-sco-summit-modi-touches-down-in-china-after-7-year-gap' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Tianjin for SCO summit; Modi touches down in China after 7-year gap</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday he looked forward to meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping along with other world leaders as he arrived in China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also touched down on his first visit after a seven-year gap.
The SCO summit, to be held in the northern port city of China’s Tianjin on Sunday and Monday, will gather more than 20 world leaders in a powerful show of Global South solidarity, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Tianjin with Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.
 






Terming his visit “historic”, PM Shehbaz said on X today: “I look forward to meeting H.E. President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to further build upon our bilateral ties with China, our All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner, as well as with other key countries of the region […]”
The premier expressed his aim to “enhance regional cooperation, strengthen multilateralism, and advance shared goals for peace and prosperity”.
 






According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO) today, the premier is leading a delegation from Pakistan to participate in the SCO’s Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit from August 31 to September 1.
“The SCO CHS Summit will bring together heads of state and government from SCO member states, including Pakistan, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan,” the statement read.
Leaders from Mongolia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Turkiye, Egypt, the Maldives, Myanmar and others, as well as the chief of the United Nations and heads of various regional and international organisations, will also attend as part of the expanded format.
“At the SCO CHS Summit, Prime Minister Sharif will present Pakistan’s perspectives on pressing regional and global issues, highlighting strategies to strengthen the SCO’s role in fostering regional cooperation and stability,” the FO stated.
 






PM Shehbaz is slated to reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to promoting multilateralism, enhancing regional security and advancing sustainable development, the FO said. He is also expected to have bilateral meetings with other SCO leaders and invited members to “strengthen diplomatic relations”.
On the engagements in China, the FO said the prime minister would hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”.
“He would also attend the military parade with President Xi and other world leaders being held in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World’s Anti-Fascist War,” the FO added.
PM Shehbaz, as per the statement, would “interact with reputed Chinese businessmen and corporate executives to discuss bilateral trade, economic and investment ties”. He would also address a Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference in Beijing.
The statement highlighted that the visit was a part of leadership-level exchanges between the two countries.
“It manifests the importance attached by the two countries to further deepen their All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, reaffirm support on issues of respective core interests, advance Phase-II of CPEC and maintain regular communication on important regional and global developments,” FO said.
 






Ahead of Pakistan’s participation in the summit, FM Dar also posted on X, saying: “Pakistan’s all-weather strategic partnership with China is anchored in trust and strategic alignment. We value President Xi’s leadership and initiatives such as the Belt and Road, and the Global Development, Security & Civilisation Initiatives, which continue to transform economies and strengthen regional integration.”
He added: “The SCO has become a pivotal Eurasian platform, advancing cooperation in security, trade, energy, connectivity, and culture under the principles of mutual trust and shared development.”
In today’s multipolar world, FM Dar said, the SCO’s role in promoting multilateralism, stability, and inclusive growth is more vital than ever.
 






Leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the 25th SCO Heads of State Council.
Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.
“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” an official announcement had said, quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative.
In July, the two countries decided to form technical working groups to explore and implement projects focusing on high-yield cotton seed development, advanced water-saving irrigation technologies, and modern farming techniques.
Modi’s visit after 7-year break
Modi also arrived in Tianjin on his first visit to China since 2018, coming straight after a trip to Japan, which pledged to invest $68 billion in India.
 






China and India, the world’s two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
A thaw began last October when Modi met with President Xi for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia.
Xi began welcoming leaders, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Egyptian Premier Moustafa Madbouly.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is also due to arrive in Tianjin ahead of the summit.
China and Russia have used the SCO — sometimes touted as a counter to the Western-dominated Nato military alliance — to deepen ties with Central Asian states.
Other leaders, including Iranian and Turkish presidents Masoud Pezeshkian and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will also attend the bloc’s largest meeting since its founding in 2001.
Multiple bilateral meetings are expected to be held on the sidelines of the summit.
The Kremlin said on Friday that Putin will discuss the Ukraine conflict with Erdogan on Monday.
Turkiye has hosted three rounds of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine this year that have failed to break the deadlock over how to end the conflict, triggered when Moscow launched its invasion of its pro-European neighbour in February 2022.
Putin will also meet with his Iranian counterpart Pezeshkian to discuss Tehran’s nuclear programme on Monday, a meeting that comes as Iran faces fresh Western pressure.
Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, triggered a “snapback” mechanism on Thursday to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with commitments made in a 2015 deal over its nuclear programme.
Russia’s foreign ministry warned that the reimposition of sanctions against Iran risked “irreparable consequences”.
Tehran and Moscow have been bolstering political, military and economic ties over the past decade as Russia drifted away from the West.
Relations between them grew even closer after Russia launched its offensive against Ukraine.</p><small>2025-08-30 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3016545400b2656.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938431/pakistan-gets-us-nod-to-extend-seafood-exports-for-4-years-set-to-bolster-position-in-global-market' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets US nod to extend seafood exports for 4 years, set to ‘bolster position in global market’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has received authorisation to extend the export of seafood products to the United States for another four years, Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry announced on Saturday.
Pakistan’s seafood exports rose to $465 million in FY25, reflecting a 13.4 per cent increase in value and an 8pc growth in quantity compared to last year, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) in July.
According to a press release by the maritime ministry, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified all Pakistani fisheries listed on its List of Foreign Fisheries as “comparable” under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).
“This classification confirms that Pakistan’s fisheries meet US standards for protecting marine mammals from incidental mortality and serious injury during fishing operations,” Chaudhry was quoted as saying.
The MMPA required fisheries to “minimise marine mammal bycatch, adopt conservation practices, and sustainably operate measures” for supporting healthier marine ecosystems, the press release read.
“The decision reflects international recognition of the quality of Pakistan’s seafood and will provide long-term stability to the sector,” the minister said.
“The extension is expected to bolster our position in the global seafood market, securing access to one of the world’s largest seafood importers,” he added.
The maritime ministry further said that the current seafood earnings were about $2 per kilogramme in the global market, noting that “with this international endorsement of compliance, the price is projected to rise, potentially opening new markets in Europe and the Gulf.”
It stated that Pakistan exported 242,484 metric tons of seafood products worth $489.2 million at an average of $2 per kilogramme. “The same export volume next year could generate nearly $600 million.”
Chaudhry called the successful submission of a comprehensive compliance dossier to NOAA “a critical milestone”. “This acceptance validates Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to regulate its commercial fisheries, uphold sustainable fishing practices, and align with international environmental standards,” he added.
The minister highlighted that the approval was “vital” to protect multi-million-dollar seafood exports to the US market and enhance the country’s reputation for responsible and sustainable fisheries management. Chaudhry also emphasised “strengthening protective measures for marine mammal populations” to ensure the long-term health of marine biodiversity.
Earlier this month, the Ministry of Commerce noted that Pakistan’s exporters were poised to gain a significant competitive advantage in the US market after the government successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29pc to 19pc — the lowest rate in the region.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal had said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.</p><small>2025-08-30 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3016362667262ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938440/new-250-visa-fee-risks-deepening-us-travel-slump' target='_blank'><strong>New $250 visa fee risks deepening US travel slump</strong></a><br><p>A new $250 “visa integrity fee” imposed on travellers to the United States risks piling more pressure on the struggling travel industry, as overseas arrivals continue to fall due to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and hostility to many foreign countries.
Overseas travel to the US fell 3.1 per cent year-on-year in July to 19.2 million visitors, according to US government data. It was the fifth month of decline this year, defying expectations that 2025 would see annual inbound visitors finally surpass the pre-pandemic level of 79.4m.
 
 

The new visa fee, set to go into effect on October 1, adds an additional hurdle for travellers from non-visa waiver countries such as Mexico, Argentina, India, Brazil and China. The extra charge raises the total visa cost to $442, one of the highest visitor fees in the world, according to the US Travel Association, a membership organisation.
“Any friction we add to the traveller experience is going to cut travel volumes by some amount,” said Gabe Rizzi, President of Altour, a global travel management company. “As the summer ends, this will become a more pressing issue, and we’ll have to factor the fees into travel budgets and documentation.”
International visitor spending in the US is projected to fall below $169 billion this year, down from $181bn in 2024, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.
The visa fee reinforces a bleak perception of the US under Trump, whose immigration policies, cuts to foreign aid and sweeping tariffs have eroded America’s appeal as a destination — even with major events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Los Angeles 2028 Olympics on the horizon.
The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed government regulation that aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media.
In early August, the administration said the US could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme effective August 20 that will last for approximately a year, in an effort to crack down on visitors overstaying their visas.
Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics consultancy, forecast in December 2024 that overseas travel to the US in 2025 would increase more than 10pc year-over-year. Instead, it is on track to fall 3pc, said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.
“We see it as a sustained setback, and we anticipate much of it is in place throughout the administration,” Ryan said.
Hardest hit
The newest visa fee is likely to hit hardest in Central and South American countries that have been a rare bright spot for US travel this year.
As of May, travel from Mexico to the US was up nearly 14pc in 2025, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.
Arrivals from Argentina rose 20pc and from Brazil 4.6pc year-to-date. Overall, travel from Central America grew 3pc and from South America 0.7pc, compared with a decline of 2.3pc from Western Europe.
 

Bar chart shows overseas visitors to the US by world region of residence

In China, arrivals have remained muted since the pandemic, with July numbers still 53pc below 2019 levels. The visa fee also threatens travel from India, where visits are down 2.4pc so far this year, driven by a near 18pc drop in students.
For some, the rise in fees will be absorbed as just another cost in an already expensive trip to the US.
“The US has always been selective about its visitors. If your financial standing isn’t up to par, getting a visa is tough anyway,“ said Su Shu, founder of Chinese firm Moment Travel in Chengdu.
As foreign visitors face higher entry fees, US travellers worry about stricter requirements being imposed abroad, said James Kitchen, travel agent and owner of Seas 2 Day & Travel.
“Travellers have expressed concern around reciprocal fees that may be imposed in the coming months,” Kitchen said.</p><small>2025-08-30 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/301526029f4fb39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938426/indonesia-protest-blaze-kills-3-as-anger-erupts-over-driver-death' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia protest blaze kills 3 as anger erupts over driver death</strong></a><br><p>A fire started by protesters at a council building in eastern Indonesia killed at least three people, a local official said on Saturday, after demonstrations across the country following the death of a man hit by a police vehicle.
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy was rocked by protests in major cities including the capital Jakarta on Friday after footage spread of a motorcycle taxi driver being run over by a police tactical vehicle in earlier rallies against low wages and financial perks for lawmakers.
Protests in Makassar, the biggest city on the eastern island of Sulawesi, descended into chaos outside the provincial and local city council buildings, which were both set on fire as demonstrators hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Three people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council, its secretary Rahmat Mappatoba told AFP.
“They were trapped in the burning building,” he said, accusing protesters of igniting the blaze.
“Usually during a demonstration, protesters only throw rocks or burn a tyre in front of the office. They never stormed into the building or burned it.”
Two workers at the city council died at the scene and a third person, a civil servant, died in hospital.
At least four people were injured in the fire and were being treated at hospital, Rahmat added.
Hundreds of people were seen in footage posted by local media cheering and clapping as fire engulfed the building on Friday with few security forces in sight.
One man was heard shouting: “There are people upstairs!”
In footage verified by AFP, smouldering debris was seen falling from the roof of the city council building surrounded by palm trees as charred cars flickered with flames.
Inside protesters lit several fires as parts of the building collapsed, while others smashed glass and chanted “revolution”.
By Saturday, the building appeared to be a blacked-out wreck, with dozens of charred cars around it, as a crowd of locals turned up to inspect the scene, footage broadcast by local media showed.
Other images showed the South Sulawesi provincial council building ablaze overnight. Protesters had tried to knock down the gate and storm the building.
Makassar and South Sulawesi police did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comments.
Prabowo test
In Jakarta on Friday, hundreds massed outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade Corp (Brimob) paramilitary police unit they blamed for motorcycle gig driver Affan Kurniawan’s death the day before.
Protesters threw firecrackers as police responded with tear gas.
One group of demonstrators tried to tear down the gates of the unit, long accused of heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the building’s facade.
Police said they had detained seven officers for questioning in connection with Affan’s death.
The protests were the biggest and most violent of Prabowo Subianto’s presidency, a key test for the leader less than a year into his rule.
He has urged calm, and ordered an investigation into the driver’s death and that the officers involved be held accountable.
In a message posted on Instagram on Friday, Prabowo said the government was “committed to guaranteeing the livelihood” of the driver’s family, posting images with them at their home.
“In situations like this, I urge the public to remain calm and to trust the government that I lead,” he wrote on a post on X.
 






He has pledged fast, state-driven growth but has already faced protests for widespread government budget cuts to fund his populist policies including a billion-dollar free meal programme.
Protests this week have spread to other major cities, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province.</p><small>2025-08-30 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3015214955f6b91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938419/one-policeman-martyred-3-terrorists-killed-in-kohat-shootout' target='_blank'><strong>One policeman martyred, 3 terrorists killed in Kohat shootout</strong></a><br><p>At least one policeman was martyred and three terrorists were killed in a firing incident in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, police said on Saturday.
According to Regional Police Officer Kohat Abbas Majeed Marwat, “One policeman was martyred and two others were injured in an operation against terrorists.”
He said, “Three terrorists have been killed and several others injured as police retaliated [against terrorists] in the mountains of Darmalak.” An operation is underway to arrest the injured terrorists, the official added.
“We will not let the sacrifices of our martyrs go in vain and our war against terrorism will continue.”
Earlier today, a statement from the Rescue 1122 read, “A tragic incident of firing on a police vehicle took place near the Darmalak police post in Kohat.”
As a result of the firing, one policeman was martyred on the spot and two policemen were injured, the statement said, adding that the injured officials were taken to Kohat District Headquarters Hospital.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Earlier this month, two Federal Constabulary personnel were martyred and 18 others were injured in a terrorist attack in KP’s Hangu district.
On August 14, five cops were martyred and another eight left injured as militants attacked police checkpoints at different locations across KP, including Peshawar, Upper Dir and Lower Dir.
Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Bannu district in July.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-08-30 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/30151930dd1dacf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938407/president-zardari-approves-change-in-11th-nfc-members-after-balochistan-revises-nomination' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari approves change in 11th NFC members after Balochistan revises nomination</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday approved a change in the constitution of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) after Balochistan revised its nomination, a statement by the president’s secretariat said.
The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22 to prepare a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
Chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the NFC includes four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members, one from each province.
Its inaugural session, however, was postponed on the request of the Sindh government “due to the impending flood situation”.
As per the statement released today, the change became necessary after the “Government of Balochistan revised its nomination, recommending Mahfooz Ali Khan as its non ex-officio member in the 11th NFC”.
The statement added that the president has given the nod to this nomination, superseding the earlier approval.
The terms of reference set under clause 2 of Article 160 require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federation and provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories as explained in clause 3 of Article 160.
These include: taxes on income (including corporation tax but excluding salaries paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund); taxes on the sale and purchase of imported, exported, produced, manufactured, or consumed goods; export duties on cotton and other duties as specified by the president; excise duties; and any other taxes specified by the president.
The notification for the 11th NFC also mandates recommendations on grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces, and on the exercise of borrowing powers by both tiers of government.
The new NFC is further tasked with considering sharing of expenditures incurred, or to be incurred, by the federation in respect of matters falling within the provinces’ domain; expenditures on trans-national issues; and financial responsibility for national projects to be shared by both the Centre and provinces.
This apparently indicates the Centre’s intention to push for provincial contributions toward natural calamities, horizontal health programmes, major dams, highways, and motorways. The federal government has also been advocating for an end to population-based incentives, replacing them with social sector performance, along with activation of local governments.
The NFC will also determine grants-in-aid from the Centre to the provinces, set borrowing powers and conditions for both, and assess resources required to meet expenditures of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile Fata).</p><small>2025-08-30 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3012554201aede8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938410/lahore-atc-sends-imran-khans-triathlete-nephew-shahrez-to-jail-on-14-day-judicial-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC sends Imran Khan’s triathlete nephew Shahrez to jail on 14-day judicial remand</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Saturday sent PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan to jail on judicial remand in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.
Lahore Police picked up Shahrez, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from his mother’s Lahore residence on August 21. His brother Shershah Khan was also arrested the next day over similar allegations, and sent on physical remand and then to jail.
Lahore police presented Shahrez before the court of ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill today upon the completion of his eight-day physical remand.
Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as Shahrez’s counsel, while Imtiaz Ahmad Sipra was present as the prosecutor.
 
 

Sipra sought a further 30-day physical custody of Shahrez, while Umer urged the court to discharge his client from the case. Judge Gill denied the police’s request and ordered that Shahrez be sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
“A cane has been recovered from the suspect’s possession,” the officer told the court, adding that Shahrez’s photogrammetry test had been conducted as well.
“Further investigation of the incident needs to be completed. Hence, further remand may be given,” Sipra said. He further said that Shahrez’s social media accounts also need to be verified, according to today’s court order, seen by Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, Advocate Umer filed a bail plea for Shahrez before the ATC. “No recovery of any kind was done from the suspect. The investigation has been completed,” the petition contended.
Terming Shahrez’s arrest “illegal”, the plea requested the court to order the triathlete’s release.
‘In Chitral on May 9’
Shahrez’s lawyers submitted photocopies of affidavits of seven people who either travelled with him or were residing at Chitral on May 9, according to the court order.
“Learned defence counsels representing the accused during the course of arguments have tendered some photographs, affidavits as well as detail of foreign trips of the accused,” the court order noted, adding that the defence lawyers had argued that Shahrez was not in Lahore from May 7 to May 12, 2023 but in Chitral.

According to the order, the investigating officer was asked whether he had considered the evidence, to which he replied that the documents were presented at about 12am, hence he could not verify or investigate them.
“This court is of the view that verification of social media accounts, air travel history and participation of the accused in international sports events could easily be verified and searched out through Google, social media and newspapers, etc, without taking into custody of the accused on physical remand.”
Judge Gill directed that Shahrez be presented before the court on September 13, and ordered the IO to submit the charge sheet by then.
During the hearing, Advocate Umer contended that the suspect was not present in Lahore on May 9, 2023 but was with family and friends in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral.
“The statement of the hotel manager where he stayed is also available,” Umer said.
“The suspect has been involved in this [case] because he is the PTI founder’s nephew,” the lawyer claimed. He added that no statement of Shahrez’s inclusion in the case was part of the record.
“Aleema Khan raises her voice for the PTI founder’s release. Aleema Khan’s son has been arrested to silence her voice,” Umer contended.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
 
 

Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI has challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests last week, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-08-30 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3012340501b83b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938397/india-will-not-bow-down-trade-minister-says-after-50pc-us-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>India will not ‘bow down’, trade minister says after 50pc US tariffs</strong></a><br><p>India will not “bow down” and instead focus on capturing new markets, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said in his first public remarks since Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods.
The 50 per cent levies on many Indian imports into the United States took effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Since his return to the White House this year, US President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
Speaking at a construction industry event in New Delhi on Friday, Goyal said India was “always ready if anyone wants to have a free trade agreement with us”.
But, the trade minister added, India “will neither bow down nor ever appear weak”. “We will continue to move together and capture new markets.”
 
 

The latest tariffs salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
Trump wants greater US access, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.
But analysts have cautioned that a 50pc duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewelry have already reported cancelled US orders and losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.
Goyal said the government would be coming out with several measures in the coming days to support every sector and boost exports.
“I can say with confidence that India’s exports this year will exceed 2024-25 numbers,” he said.</p><small>2025-08-30 07:45</small></div><hr>
