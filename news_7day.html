“On average, refugee households have more members than host community households and the national average,” the report ‘Forced Displacement Survey — Pakistan, 2024’ says, adding that the national average is 6.3, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
The survey highlights a significant dependency burden, with the age dependency ratio at 137 among refugees and 105 in the host community.
This indicates more than one dependent for every working-age individual in both groups, a figure higher than the world average of 55. The data also showed 54 per cent of children in refugee households are under age 4, compared to 31 per cent in the host community.

Says the typical refugee family has 8.9 people, exceeding the national average of 6.3.

Also, the refugee population is predominantly young, with half of all refugees, nearly 620,000 children, under the age of 15.
Child marriage rates were also found to be alarmingly high. Approximately 5pc of refugee girls are married before the age of 15 and 25pc before 18.
This means one in every four girls in the refugee community is married before adulthood. The rates are lower but still significant in the host community, where 2pc of girls are married before 15 and 12pc before 18.
According to Unicef and the World Bank, child marriage is closely linked to poor health outcomes, reduced educational attainment, and economic hardship — particularly among vulnerable populations such as refugees.
The survey also sheds light on the origins of the refugee population, revealing that the majority were born in Pakistan. Around three-quarters of refugees aged 18 and above were born in the host country.
Only 24pc, or approximately 160,000 individuals, were born in Afghanistan. Nine in ten refugees have at least one parent who is or was also a refugee.
Marriage rates among household heads are high in both communities. Among refugees, 96 percent of males and 60 percent of females are married. In the host community, 95 per cent of male household heads and 40pc of female household heads are married.
This potentially indicates that among both refugees and host communities, most female-headed households are single-parent households.
For over four decades, Pakistan has hosted more than three million Afghan refugees, making it one of the world’s leading refugee-hosting nations. The survey focused on Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, the majority of whom live in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
 
 

In addition to registered refugees, UNHCR has recorded data on approximately 190,000 Afghan asylum-seekers and refugees who arrived after the Taliban takeover in 2021.
Of these, an estimated 110,000 are considered to have “extreme vulnerabilities and would be at risk of imminent harm if returned to Afghanistan”.
The Forced Displacement Survey (FDS) is UNHCR’s flagship programme for producing high-quality data on displaced populations. Data collection for the survey was conducted by the Centre for Development and Evaluation (C4ED) under UNHCR supervision between March 2024 and January 2025.

• Naqvi says COAS played key role in talks with Sri Lankan officials
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly (NA) and the Senate on Thursday passed resolutions expressing gratitude to the government of Sri Lanka and the country’s cricket board for not recalling its cricket team, which is currently in Pakistan to play a cricket series and a tri-nation tournament.
Parliamentary Affairs Minis­ter Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution in the NA hours after Law Minister Azam Nazeer presented a similar resolution in the Senate.
 






Through the resolution, the NA expressed gratitude for the personal efforts of the president of Sri Lanka, the country’s defence minister, and the entire government of Sri Lanka for their decision to continue the cricket tour of Pakistan.
“The House appreciates the Sri Lanka Cricket Board’s decision to proceed with the tour despite all threats,” the resolution stated.
The resolution also acknowledged the zeal and dedication of Interior Minister and PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, for their all-out efforts in ensuring the successful continuation of the tour.
Earlier in the day, while speaking in the Senate Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir facilitated talks with Sri Lanka, which led to the visiting team’s decision to stay in Pakistan for the ongoing matches.
According to media reports, Sri Lan­kan players on Wednesday wanted to ret­urn to their homeland due to security concerns following a suicide attack at the Islamabad Judicial Complex that clai­med 12 lives and injured many others.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said they were thankful to the Sri Lankan government “which assured us that it stands by Pakistan in the war on terror and did not recall its team.”
Mr Tarar read out the resolution, which recognised the historic and brotherly relations be­­tween Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and appreciated the spirit of spo­­rtsmanship and mutual trust that continues to stren­gthen ties between the two nations.
Mr Naqvi said Sri Lanka’s cricket board confirmed late last night that its team’s ongoing tour of Pakistan would proceed.
“Our field marshal himself spoke to their defence minister and secretary, convincing them and assuring them fully of [providing] security,” Mr Naqvi, who also serves as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, said while speaking on the Senate floor.
He recalled that the Sri Lankan team had initially “decided to return after the bomb blast occurred”.
“Our interaction with them began, and their board, players, and everyone decided with great bravery to stay here,” the PCB chairman added.
“They had many concerns, but we tried to allay all of those,” Mr Naqvi said, highlighting that Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had spoken to his country’s team to convince them.
Mr Naqvi revealed that Field Marshal Munir had played a key role in the visiting team’s decision to continue the tour.
“Now, the Pakistan Army, Rangers, and Islamabad Police are jointly managing their security, and we are providing them the same kind of protocol and protection as our state guests,” the interior minister said.
Naqvi meets SL team
Later, Interior Minister Moh­sin Naqvi met Sri Lankan players and termed their act of continuing with series — a victory of peace and defeat of terrorists, as Zimbabwe’s squad also reached in Islamabad to participate in the triangular series.
Mr Naqvi, along with State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Sri Lankan High Commissioner retired Rear Admiral Fred Siriweera, visited Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where hosts Pakistan and Sri Lankan team were practicing ahead of second ODI, which will be played on Friday (today).

The company is likely to establish technical collaborations, knowledge-sharing, and feasibility studies to assess specific investment projects in partnership with local entities.
Nova Minerals is a dual Nasdaq and ASX-listed gold, antimony and critical minerals mining exploration and development company, and its delegation, led by Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Gerteisen, held a meeting with Minister for Board of Investment, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, on Thursday, and showed interest particularly in antimony and rare earth minerals.
The leader of the delegation stated that Pakistan’s geological diversity, coupled with government facilitation and policy reforms, offers ample opportunities and makes it an attractive destination for long-term investment.
Lauding Nova Minerals’ interest in Pakistan’s mineral exploration sector, Minister Qaiser Sheikh informed the delegation that the government encourages responsible, technology-driven ventures that ensure sustainability and local value addition. Such initiatives would help create an ecosystem conducive to further foreign investment in Pakistan’s mining sector.
 
 

The investment minister noted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly supports foreign investments and joint ventures, recognising them as key drivers of economic growth and modernisation. He also lauded the efforts of the business community and international partners who continue to build confidence in Pakistan’s investment climate.
During the meeting, Mr Qaiser Sheikh highlighted Pakistan’s vast and largely untapped potential in the minerals and mining sector, emphasising that the country offers promising investment opportunities across multiple areas, particularly in the exploration and processing of high-value minerals.
He underscored that foreign investment in mining will not only unlock Pakistan’s natural resources but also strengthen bilateral economic relations, promote technology transfer, and create opportunities for skill development and higher education exchanges, enabling Pakistani professionals and students to return with advanced expertise.

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz made these remarks while hearing separate cases on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively.
During the hearing of a case related to a private company before Justi Kayani on Thursday, a lawyer requested that the final arguments be scheduled for the first week of December.
However, Justice Kayani responded: “In the first week of December, another judge will be sitting here to hear this case.”
The lawyer expressed his concern, saying, “Sir, don’t say things like this that make us uncomfortable.”
Justice Kayani replied with a smile, “No problem. I am happy about it.”
When the lawyer said, “Sir, you will leave… we have a lot to learn from you”, Justice Kayani reiterated, “No problem, I am happy.”
A day earlier, Justice Imtiaz had made similar remarks during the hearing of another case, saying that her bench might not be available from December, when a counsel sought an adjournment for the following week.
 
 

It may be recalled that five IHC judges, including Justi­ces Kayani and Imtiaz, had strongly challenged the tra­n­s­fer of incumbent Chief Jus­ti­­ce Sardar Mohammad Sarf­raz Dogar to the Islamabad High Court earlier this year.
The recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary.
According to sources, the transfers of high court judges are exp­ected to take place in phases, with the IHC likely to be affected first.

The latest meeting, held at the company’s head office in Karachi on Thursday, was convened with the same agenda put forward earlier this month, i.e. the removal of CEO Moonis Alvi.
However, the effort faltered as the meeting witnessed serious differences among the government board members and those from the private sector. A majority of board members walked out, effectively blocking the motion.
 
 

Company sources told Dawn that, unlike the previous meeting on Nov 5, Thursday’s session met all legal requirements and began with a quorum. Nine of the 10 directors were present, though the federal finance secretary was unable to attend. Proceedings were recorded in line with the procedure.

Motion blocked as majority of board members leave six-minute meeting

However, the meeting lasted only six minutes. As the agenda centred on the CEO’s removal, Mr Alvi did not attend.
After the meeting opened, five directors — Adeeb Ahmad, Mubasher H. Sheikh, Muhammad Kamran Kamal, Saad Amanullah Khan and Shan A. Ashary — excused themselves and left the venue.
This left only the two government nominees — the Secretary of Power and director Javed Kureishi, who had called the meeting — in the room. Board Chairman Mark Gerard Skelton also remained on the premises.
The walkout rendered the meeting unworkable and the attempt to unseat the CEO collapsed for a second time.
Later, K-Electric forwarded its report to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) titled ‘Board Meeting Other Than Financial Results’.
“In continuation of our intimation dated Nov 7, this is to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held on Thursday, 13 November 2025, considered matters other than the financial results of the Company. Please inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” the company’s statement said.

• Achakzai wants  demos on Fridays
• KP CM stopped from meeting Imran for sixth time
ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the resignations of the judges of the top court and urging the judiciary to stand on its feet, the PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee has suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
However, the suggestions will be discussed in a meeting of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday (today), followed by a press conference.
 






The parliamentary party’s meeting was chaired by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief and TTAP chairman, and attended by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Asad Qaiser and other members of the National Assembly.
Former NA speaker Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said during the meeting, proposals were sought to devise a strategy after the passage of the 27th Amendment.
“The participants [of the meeting] unanimously agreed that the incumbent government is not capable to run the country. At the same time there is an economic crisis, miserable law and order situation and the country is at the verge of a civil war,” he said.
Mr Qaiser said Mr Achakzai was of the view that the countries, which lac­ked respect for the law and Constitution, were destined to fall apart.
 
 

“[Mr] Achakzai suggested involving the religious segment of the society and holding a countrywide protest on Fridays.”
Replying to a question, the former NA speaker said the resignation of the two judges was a commendable act and marked the first drop of rain against the government.
“We urge the judiciary to stand on its feet because the whole nation will stand along with it over the issue,” he continued.
He said that a meeting of the TTAP to be held on Friday would chalk out and announce the collective strategy of the joint opposition.
KP CM denied meeting again
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was stopped from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan for the sixth time on Thursday.
Mr Afridi, along with other leaders of the opposition, including Raja Nasir Abbas and Junaid Akbar, reached Adiala jail, but were not allowed to enter its premises.
Later, they returned to their vehicles as the time for the meeting had expired.
The KP chief minister, while talking to reporters, said that it was unfortunate that the orders of Islamabad High Court were not being implemented.
It is worth mentioning that the apex court has directed to allow the KP chief minister’s meeting with the PTI founder.
Mr Afridi wondered as to why there was a fear if he held a meeting with his party’s patron-in-chief.
“Am I going to discuss nuclear secrets with him?” he remarked.
He urged the security establishment to “focus on the borders of the country” and allow the politicians to address their issues through politics.

Earlier, senior puisne Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah had written separate letters to the CJP asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference. However, the two justices resigned on Thursday evening in protest against the 27th Constitutional Amendment
Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary.
Headed by the CJP, the full court meeting will be held at the Supreme Court building before the Friday prayers.
Justice Panwhar stated he was writing the letter “not in protest but in … the duty that binds every judge who has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution”.
“There comes a time when silence is not caution but abdication. I believe such a time may now be upon us,” the letter read.
“From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”.
“Let us test each provision of the amendment by a single question: does it strengthen the independence of the judiciary, or diminish it?” Justice Panwhar’s letter suggested, stating that if the independence of the judiciary is diminished, then judges must say so, “not in anger but in truth”.
Justice Panwhar also suggested commissioning a technical brief through the Pakistan Secretariat’s Law and Justice Commission and, if necessary, engaging the National Judicial Policy Making Committee.
He also suggested that the Supreme Court confer with the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and provincial bar councils, since the “bar and the bench are twin guardians of justice”.
The SC judge also asked to prepare to preserve their capacity under Article 190 of the Constitution, should litigation ensue, to ensure that the “judicial commands were not rendered hollow”.
“Let our response be principled yet temperate and firm in defence of constitutional boundaries, but respectful of the comity due among organs of the State,” the judge wrote.
“For Parliament’s power to amend is plenary, but it is not without limit, even if it does not say so,” the letter said, adding that the “Constitution was not clay to be moulded at will, it was a covenant between the state and citizen”.
Justice Panwhar wrote that his request was not born of discord, but conscience. He emphasised that the judiciary is a servant of the Constitution, not its master, but it would not stand if its independence is diminished.
“History will not remember the ease of our days but the courage of decisions,” Justice Panwhar added. He requested the meeting so that “we may together preserve the trust reposed in this court and ensure that the rule of law remains the law of the land, not in word alone, but in living truth”.
“It is the very condition upon which liberty itself depends. If the judiciary is not free; free from fear, free from influence, free from control, then the rule of law becomes but a phrase, hollow and without breath,” the letter cautioned.
Even the appearance of interference is enough to erode public confidence and “confidence” is the very soul of justice. Once lost, it cannot be summoned by decree or proclamation, the letter said.
Meanwhile, prominent lawyer Asad Rahim Khan also moved a petition before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that, in the presence of Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as provided in the original Constitution of 1973, cannot be abridged or abolished through an act of parliament.
The petition also pleaded before the Supreme Court to take measures for securing the independence of the judiciary, and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted.
Earlier today, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law.
The summary signed by the president, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “The Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2025, is assented to, as advised by the prime minister, at para 5 of the summary.”
Meanwhile, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency.</p><small>2025-11-14 02:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14073614e91d30e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954930/pakistan-revives-offshore-exploration-with-23-block-award-round' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan revives offshore exploration with 23-block award round</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government has awarded 23 new offshore exploration blocks to three public sector oil and gas producers led by Mari Energies on a provisional basis for three years with investment commitments of about $80 million.
Mari Energies — a joint venture of Fauji Foundation and the federal government and its other entities — has emerged as the leader by securing stakes in all 23 blocks in the bidding round, in which a total of 40 offshore blocks were offered by the government.
The Islamabad-based Mari Energies said that it secured all the 23 blocks, as operator in 18 and as joint venture partner in the remaining five blocks. Mari has 100pc ownership and operatorship in 10 offshore blocks and majority shares along with operatorship of eight others.
Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) — the country’s oldest producer and Karachi-based state-owned enterprise — secured six blocks as operator and partnership in two others, while the largest producer — Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), based in Islamabad — was awarded two blocks as operator and six others as joint venture partner.

Mari Energies and partners secure new stakes as govt eyes global investors for next exploration phase

Prime Global Energies — a private firm — also secured operatorship in one block with 31pc stakes, with the remaining 23pc each by Mari, PPL and OGDCL.
These awards are subject to the execution of production sharing agreements (PSAs), the grant of exploration licences, the signing of joint operating agreements (JOAs) among the respective partners, and the completion of other legal and procedural formalities.
The government had received on Oct 31 a total of 23 bids for 40 offshore blocks on offer for exploration. The provisional awards for 23 blocks covered a total area of about 53,510 square kilometres.
Earlier last month, the government had received only one bid for 23 onshore exploration blocks on offer from Mari Energies and that too from Mari Energies. International and local private-sector partners, like Turkish Petroleum, United Energy, Orient Petroleum, and Fatima Petroleum, are also part of these joint venture partners, underscoring growing international interest in Pakistan’s offshore potential, according to the Petroleum Division.
The exploration attempts by leading international firms like Shell and ExxonMobil in Pakistan’s offshore blocks remained unsuccessful, the latest by a consortium led by ExxonMobil about five years ago in Kekra-1, despite the availability of promising hydrocarbon data.
 
 

Before initiating the process, the Petroleum Division developed a model production sharing agreement (MPSA), a key document integrated into the bid package, to ensure transparency, competitiveness, and investor confidence. In parallel, the Offshore Petroleum Rules were promulgated to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework, paving the way for renewed offshore exploration in Pakistan’s waters.
A recent basin study conducted by the US firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) has indicated a significant yet-to-find potential of hydrocarbons in Pakistan’s offshore basins. Building on this encouraging assessment, the Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched with a view to offering blocks that allow companies to undertake systematic exploration efforts to test various geological plays across both the Indus and Makran basins.
The Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched in January this year after a gap of 18 years for the grant of petroleum exploration licenses in 40 Indus and Makan offshore blocks near the jurisdictions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Petroleum Division said a total of 4,427 work units have been committed for these 23 blocks during Phase-1 of the initial three-year license period, representing an investment of approximately $80 million. The companies have submitted work programmes designed to progressively mitigate the geological risks, and in the event of exploration drilling, investments could reach up to $750m to $1bn, it said.
During Phase-1, the companies will undertake comprehensive geophysical and geological (G&G) studies, including seismic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation, to better define the hydrocarbon potential of Pakistan’s offshore basins. Upon completion of these studies, the Phase-II work programme will be finalised, which will include drilling of exploratory wells in the prospective areas.
The statement said the government strategy to initiate exploration in both the Indus and Makran basins simultaneously paid off, as reflected in the participation and outcome of the bid round. After the completion of G&G work and drilling planning, the ministry will invite global oil majors to join the next phase of offshore exploration, several of whom are already in contact with the government and local companies and are currently evaluating the available data.

The incident occurred when the CTD’s SWAT team was conducting a “targeted operation” in the Kanda Pul area of Mardan district and tried to stop two men on a motorcycle, a statement by the department said.  
The suspects opened fire on the officers, who “narrowly escaped” harm, prompting the team to return fire, killing both assailants. 
The deceased were later identified as Noman, known by the aliases Murad and Ghaznavi, and Sohail, also called Charsi.  
According to the Coun­ter Terrorism Department, they were implicated in the murders of Head Constable Amjad, Cons­table Iqrar Syed, and a bystander named Ehtesham.  
Additional charges of murder and attempted murder were also filed against them. 
Following the exchange of fire, authorities recovered a motorcycle, two pistols with ammunition, and a mobile phone from the scene, the statement said.

The amendments were tabled soon after President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif introduced the Pakistan Army Act (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill 2025, which were passed with a majority vote.
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar introduced the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2025, which was also passed with a majority vote.
Tarar said the four bills, which were passed in nine minutes without any debate, were meant to harmonise the existing laws with the recently signed 27th Constitutional Amendment Act. “These are not new laws. These are amendments to the present laws,” he said.
 
 

The law minister said the change in the army act was to make the COAS the CDF and to eliminate the post of the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), adding that the CDF’s term would be five years from the date of appointment.
The amendment further said that the tenure of the incumbent army chief would recommence from the date of his notification as the CDF.
The changes also included replacing the position of the CJCSC with the commander of the National Strategic Command (CNSC). They outlined that the prime minister would appoint the CNSC on the recommendation of the army chief from the generals of the army for a three-year tenure.
It added that the prime minister could also reappoint the CNSC or extend his tenure by three years on the army chief’s recommendation.
The changes further said that the prime minister could, on the army chief’s recommendation, authorise an officer appointed as the vice or deputy chief of army staff to exercise and perform the powers and functions vested in the army chief.
The amendments to the air force and navy laws included the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.
Meanwhile, the amendment to the Supreme Court law paved the way for the elimination of the constitutional bench.
The president’s assent to the 27th Constitutional Amendment came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was underway, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar again tabled the bill in the upper house of Parliament today.
COAS Munir’s extension
Field Marshal Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and extensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years. However, the tenure of the CJCSC had remained unchanged, at three years.
The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year.
In September, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan had said that the tenure of the army chief would end in 2027 and a decision whether to extend it or not would be taken at that time.
Earlier this month, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act.
He had said no new notification was required for the COAS’s five-year term and the section was always a part of legislation.
Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the chief of the army staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the chief of the army staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”.</p><small>2025-11-13 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13230719cadba1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954869/all-terrorists-in-wana-attack-afghan-nationals-orchestrated-by-ttp-from-afghanistan-information-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>All terrorists in Wana attack Afghan nationals; orchestrated by TTP from Afghanistan: information ministry</strong></a><br><p>The information ministry on Thursday said that all terrorists involved in the attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens.
Security forces confirmed a day ago that they had successfully foiled a terrorist attack on Cadet College Wana, killing all the attackers after an intense clearance operation.
The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college on Monday evening and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy.
Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there.
“The attack on Cadet College Wana was planned and controlled from Afghanistan. The attack was planned in Afghanistan by kharji Zahid and the final approval was given by kharji Noorwali Mehsud. All the khwarij who attacked Cadet College Wana were Afghan citizens. The equipment for this attack was provided from Afghanistan, which included American-made weapons,” said the information ministry in a statement today.
The ministry further said that the identities of the “Afghan terrorists” killed in the attack “firmly establish the links of terrorists in their bases in Afghanistan”.
It added that the responsibility for the attack was accepted by an unknown terrorist group, “Jaishul Hind”, on Mehsud’s orders.
Mehsud is the chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group.
The information ministry added he wanted to shift the responsibility from the TTP, adding that this was why the “Afghan terrorist” kept mentioning ‘Jaishul Hind’ in the video made during the attack.
“The Afghan Taliban pressurise Fitna al-Khawarij not to accept responsibility of attacks as that leads to pressure from Pakistan and friendly countries.
“The attack on Cadet College Wana was aimed at increasing security concerns in Pakistan, on demand of the Indian agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing).”
 






‘Clear Afghan involvement’
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said on Tuesday that it was “clear” that Afghanistan was directly involved in the attack.
Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”.
Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.”
“We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country,“ he asserted.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-11-13 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13230312748df31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954892/flagrant-attack-on-independence-of-judiciary-jurists-body-assails-newly-enacted-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>‘Flagrant attack on independence of judiciary’: jurists’ body assails newly enacted 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) on Thursday issued a statement assailing the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, calling it a “flagrant attack” on judicial independence and the rule of law.
Last year, the ICJ similarly derided the 26th Constitutional Amendment being signed into law as a “blow to judicial independence”.
ICJ Secretary-General Santiago Canton was quoted as saying: “The changes made to the judicial system in the 27th Amendment are alarming …They will significantly impair the judiciary’s ability to hold the executive accountable and protect the fundamental human rights of the people of Pakistan.”
The jurists’ body expressed concern over several main points, namely the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), the appointment of judges and chief justices to the Supreme Court and the FCC, the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes between any of Pakistan’s governments, provincial and federal and to adjudicate matters of public interest involving the enforcement of ‘fundamental rights’,” the statement read, adding that it can call for the record of any case and hear appeals if they deal with interpreting the Constitution.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the statement read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
 
 

“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
“The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted.
The ICJ noted that amendments to Article 200 (transfer of high court judges) allow the JCP to recommend that the president transfer a judge from one high court to another, with the judge in question forced to accept the transfer within 30 days, lest they be barred from judicial duties.
“Article 200 fails to provide for any basis on which the JCP will decide when judges should be transferred and there is no requirement to establish a mechanism with clearly defined criteria and objectives to guide recommendations for transfer,” the ICJ said.
“This arbitrary system makes it impossible to determine whether transfer might actually be intended to be punitive or retaliatory, rather than for the legitimate purpose of better administration of justice and public interest.”
With regards to lifetime immunity granted to the president, the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the fleet under Articles 243 and 248, the ICJ said the amendments are “contrary to core rule of law principles, including accountability, access to justice, and equality before the law”.
“No public official should ever be entirely unaccountable, as this effectively allows for the possibility of unlawful or arbitrary exercise of power without consequence,” the statement read.
Senate’s approval
The president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.

The development comes hours after the 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari and shortly after Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned from their offices in protest.
A notification from the law ministry said President Zardari made the appointment under clause (3) of Article 175A read with Article 175C of the Constitution, adding that it would come into effect from the date that Justice Khan took his oath.
The judge will take the oath at the Presidency tomorrow at 10am. The chief justices and judges of superior courts, high-ranking officials have been invited to participate in the oath-taking ceremony
Justice Khan was born in Multan in 1960. A second-generation lawyer, he earned his LL.B from University Law College, Multan, in 1984 and began practice under his father, Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan.
He became an advocate of the Lahore High Court (LHC) in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001. He joined Zafar Law Chambers in Multan in 2001 and worked with the legal firm until he was elevated to the position of a judge in 2011, where he decided civil cases on the Multan and Bahawalpur benches.
He was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2019, taking his oath of office from then-chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa.
He was made the head of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench in November 2024, while ranking fourth in seniority among Supreme Court judges.
Justice Khan has decided thousands of cases pertaining to civil matters and most of his judgments have been upheld by the Supreme Court. During his career, he assisted renowned lawyers like Mian Nisar Ahmed and Umar Ata Bandial.
Sources had told Dawn the FCC would initially comprise six other judges — four from the Supreme Court and two from the high courts — besides the chief justice. The names being discussed for the inaugural composition incl­uded Just­ice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musa­rrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Far­ooq, and Justice Baqar Najafi from the SC, while Justice KK Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Bar­rech, the incumbent Chief Justice of Balochistan Hi­gh Court, were being considered from the high courts.
The sources had also said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require approval through an Act of Parliament.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the President, acting on the advice of the prime minister, would issue the formal appointment orders. They added that under the provisions of the amendment, the President would be constitutionally empowered to make such appointments to the newly-constituted court.
The proposal to establish the Federal Constitutional Court was revived as part of the judicial reforms package incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Act.
The amendment aimed to rationalise the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and introduce greater efficiency in the adjudication of constitutional questions.
 
 

According to government officials, the creation of the FCC is intended to reduce the Supreme Court’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases, and strengthen the independence and credibility of the judicial system. The concept of a separate constitutional court is not new.
It was first introduced in the Charter of Democracy (CoD) signed by the PPP and the PML-N in 2006.
The CoD envisaged the establishment of a specialised court dedicated solely to constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus primarily on its appellate jurisdiction.
The idea resurfaced during discussions on the 26th Const­it­utional Amendment, but was shelved at the time following resistance from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and certain other political factions.
Under the current proposal, judges serving in the FCC will retire at the age of 68 years — three years higher than the retirement age for Supreme Court judges, who retire at 65.
The new court will not be housed within the Supreme Court premises. Officials indicated that it is likely to be established in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building in Islamabad. In turn, the FSC is expected to be relocated to the third floor of the Islamabad High Court building.
However, sources within the FSC revealed that its judges are unhappy with their abrupt relocation and have raised their concerns before the chief justice of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-11-13 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13225103de435b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954871/india-inaugurates-new-military-airbase-close-to-china-border-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>India inaugurates new military airbase close to China border, source says</strong></a><br><p>India’s air force chief made the inaugural landing of a military transport aircraft at a new airbase capable of fighter jet operations close to the disputed Himalayan border with China, a defence official said on Thursday.
The move comes amid a thaw in ties between the nuclear-armed neighbours, following a milestone pact last October to ease military tension along their de facto border and a visit this year to China by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Air Chief Marshal AP Singh landed the C-130J aircraft on Wednesday at the Mudh-Nyoma air force station in Ladakh, perched at a height of about 4,000m, added the official, who sought anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.
The Indian Air Force and the defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The new airbase, the region’s third such key station, is just 30 kilometres from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.
“This new airfield in Ladakh, capable of fighter operations, will add a new challenge for both of our adversaries,” retired Air Marshal Sanjeev Kapoor wrote on X, referring to neighbours China and Pakistan.
China has an airfield at a similar height, he added.
 






Mistrust persists between China and India despite the thaw, Indian analysts and officials say, with the Indian Army chief pointing this year to continued heightened troop presence and infrastructure build-up on the border by both sides.
India and China share a poorly demarcated border that stretches 3,800km and has been disputed since the 1950s. They fought a brief but brutal war over it in 1962.
Ties soured after a deadly border clash in 2020, before their 2024 pact brought a thaw and easing of some curbs, allowing resumption of direct flights and two-way visits.</p><small>2025-11-13 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/132102060e6cf58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954875/newly-enacted-27th-constitutional-amendment-challenged-in-supreme-court' target='_blank'><strong>Newly-enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment challenged in Supreme Court</strong></a><br><p>Lawyer Asad Rahim Khan filed a petition with the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to challenge the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment, moving the court to declare the amendments unconstitutional and to “take measures” to ensure judicial independence.
The 27th Amendment, signed into law earlier today by President Asif Ali Zardari, was widely criticised by the legal fraternity for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned earlier this evening, in response to the 27th Amendment, which “diminished” the apex court.
Khan’s petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, requested that the Supreme Court declare Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 to 43, 45A and B, 46 and 48 of the Constitution (Twenty-seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 illegal and unlawful, as it violated Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, read with other provisions of the Constitution.
According to the petition, Entry 55 “ensures a horizontal separation between the legislative and judicial branches” by defining the jurisdiction of the apex court. The petition moved the SC to declare that its jurisdiction cannot be abolished by an act of parliament.
Additionally, Khan moved the SC to “direct the respondent (the Federation of Pakistan) to take such measures as may be required for securing the independence of the judiciary; and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted”.
“The parenthetical clause (“except for the Supreme Court”) makes it abundantly clear that the Apex Court’s jurisdiction — unlike that of the courts below it — cannot be interfered with, let alone abbreviated, through any kind of legislation, even an amendment to the Constitution,” the petition read.
Noting that the act was passed in haste and an “unconstitutional and procedurally defective manner”, Khan argued that rushing the bills through parliament violated key principles of parliamentary democracy and was neither public nor transparent.
“The act is thus an assault on parliamentary democracy itself, and merits being struck down on this score alone.”
He further argued that the amendment is enabling the “influencing and purging [of] independent-minded Judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts” and stated that a judge’s position depending on the whim of the executive is antithetical to judicial independence.
The petition also argued that the composition of the FCC — a key component of the 27th Amendment — was “equally alarming”, as the chief justice would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, but without any deliberation or consultation.
“This permits the executive to handpick the de facto highest judicial authority in Pakistan, in direct violation of the principle of judicial independence,” Khan argued.
“The initial cohort of FCC judges is likewise to be appointed solely on executive advice, again without any role for the judiciary or any consultative mechanism. A court constituted entirely at the will of the executive cannot claim independence.”
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”

Both judges had called on Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi in separate letters to summon a full court meeting and judicial conference to hold a debate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In his resignation letter today, Justice Shah said that “staying on would not only amount to silent acquiescence in a constitutional wrong, but would also mean continuing to sit in a court whose constitutional voice has been muted,” while Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”.
Here is what the lawyers and politicians had to say on the departure of the two judges.
‘Darkest day’
Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig said today marked the “darkest day” in our judicial history.
“Not only has the Supreme Court lost two of its greatest jurists, but the passage of the amendment marks the judiciary’s complete destruction,” he said while speaking to Dawn.
“Unfortunately, the dismantling of the judiciary has, as has been the case throughout our history, been spearheaded by those entrusted to protect it.”
Similarly, Barrister Rida Hosain said, “Today marks an incredibly dark day for Pakistan. Independent judges have resigned as the Supreme Court’s constitutional jurisdiction has been abolished, and the executive has captured the courts”.
Referring to the reserved seats case, she said Justice Shah had found that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had failed to fulfil its constitutional role.
“In granting PTI its rightful share of reserved seats, Justice Shah’s decision will be remembered for seeking to ensure the legislature represents the people’s voice. Justice Shah has authored various notable judgments, including in the Atif Zareef case, where he held that a woman’s ‘sexual history’ or alleged ‘immoral character’ cannot be considered determinative in a case of rape. He has repeatedly reinforced, through his judgments, the importance of using gender-sensitive language.”
She said the resignations were a “huge loss” for Pakistan’s justice system and “another tragic chapter” in its constitutional history.
‘Heartbreaking culmination of a process of capture’
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii termed the resignations a “heartbreaking culmination of a process of capture” that began in earnest with former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa.
“Thereafter, our executive has adopted the Trojan horse tactic with our judiciary; to clearly great effect,” he said.
“I cannot improve upon the words of Justice Shah when he says we have abandoned constitutional wisdom for political expediency. Or of Justice Minallah when he says, ‘The Constitution I swore to uphold and defend is no more … I can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as the new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave.’”
Jaferii added that an “illegitimate government” had “bargained with ruin” to sustain itself.
“It has sold its soul to remain in power, which it did not deserve for a single day. It has been abetted in this bargain by two chief justices and a third pretender of constitutional wisdom,” he said.
Jaferii said the Parliament failed the people it “pretends to have been elected by”, adding that “it has done so knowingly, and no amount of pretence by our political leaders can mask this as anything other than a shameless and desperate act of self-preservation.”
He said the will of the people was “mutilated today by individuals the people never elected”.
“We are being commanded by the cloaked, ruled by fear. We must not part without thanking Justice Qazi Faez Isa, who started this, nor without thanking Justice Yahya Afridi for helping finish it.”
‘Principled stand’
Meanwhile, lawyer Ayman Zafar said the resignations reflected a principled stand against “what can only be described as an erosion of judicial independence under the guise of constitutional reform”.
She said the country had witnessed “many dark days” in the legal arena in recent years, with each carrying its own dilemma.
“The 27th Amendment effectively reduces the Supreme Court of Pakistan to a mere appellate forum, stripping it of its constitutional role as the guardian and interpreter of the Constitution. It is no longer the Supreme Court of Pakistan, but simply the Supreme Court — symbolically and substantively diminishing the stature it has retained since its inception,” she said while speaking to Dawn.
Zafar added that the amendment detached the institution from its status as a coequal branch of the state, “subordinating it to the political will of the legislature and executive”.
The judges’ decision to resign, in her opinion, was not an act of defiance, “but a courageous and necessary stand for principle, a virtue increasingly rare in our times, and above all, for a judiciary that must remain independent, not ornamental”.
She concluded that “if this is the reform we are promised, then perhaps what truly needs reforming is our understanding of the Constitution itself”.
Praise for resigned judges
Others praised the resigned judges for their guidance and tutelage over the years.
“Two judges who genuinely believed in developing constitutional jurisprudence. We learned so much from their judgments,” said lawyer Hassan Abdullah Niazi, terming the resignations as yet “another tragedy in Pakistan’s sordid constitutional history”.
 






Barrister Ahsan Pirzada thanked the two for their service and for “standing on the right side of history”.
 






Politicians laud ‘courage’ while lamenting resignations
Politicians were observed widely lauding the courage of the two judges while also expressing regret at their departure from the judiciary.
“Decision to resign is courageous and heartening. In such an era where deals of consciences are commonplace, where yokes of slavery are worn with pride instead of freedom, the act of these honourable judges to reject positions and privileges for the sake of the Constitution and principles is a breath of fresh air,” said Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar.
 






Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari called it a “complete unravelling” of the independence of the judiciary.
 






 






Former planning minister Asad Umar said resigning from high positions based on principle was not something everyone could do and required a “big heart”.
 






Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry thanked the two judges. “By resigning, you at least gave a public funeral to justice—otherwise, even the shroud and burial would have been kept secret.”

Both judges had called on Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi in separate letters to summon a full court meeting and judicial conference to hold a debate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In his letter to the president today, Justice Shah assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
“By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote.
“As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed - but not before leaving deep institutional scars.”
The judge stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation.
“Staying on would not only amount to silent acquiescence in a constitutional wrong, but would also mean continuing to sit in a court whose constitutional voice has been muted,” Justice Shah wrote.
“Unlike the 26th Amendment — when the Supreme Court of Pakistan still retained the jurisdiction to examine and answer the constitutional questions — the present amendment has stripped this court of that fundamental and critical jurisdiction and authority.
“Serving in such a truncated and diminished court, I cannot protect the Constitution, nor can I even judicially examine the amendment that has disfigured it,” he stated.
On the other hand, Justice Minallah stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order.
“I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added.
Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”.
“What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote.
“These robes we wear are more than mere ornaments. They are to serve as a reminder of that most noble trust bestowed upon those fortunate enough to don them,” the letter read. “Instead, throughout our history, they have too often stood as symbols of betrayal through silence and complicity alike.”
Justice Minallah is the eldest son of Nasrum Minallah, who was a commissioner during the 1960s and 70s. He is the son-in-law of Justice Safdar Shah, who was part of the bench that convicted and sentenced former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but wrote a dissenting note against the conviction, for which he faced the wrath of the then-military dictator, General Ziaul Haq.
He joined Pakistan Customs and rose to senior positions, but later resigned and started practising law. Following the sacking of former chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, he joined the lawyers’ movement for the restoration of the judiciary.
However, after Justice Chaudhry’s restoration, he became a critic of the judiciary because of excessive suo motu cases, which led to the pendency of routine cases.
In November 2022, then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial administered the oath to Justice Minallah, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi as the judges of the Supreme Court.
Earlier in the evening, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency.

Separately, former attorney general of Pakistan Makhdoom Ali Khan tendered his resignation from the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan to CJP Afridi.
“When you sought my consent to be a member of the commission, I accepted without a second thought.
“The Constitution, by then, had been amended for the 26th time. I could see despondence on the once shining faces of promising young lawyers. I continued to believe, however, albeit without cause, that it remained possible to negotiate the bends and avoid a free fall. The realists cautioned that I was out of touch.
“The habits of a lifetime take time to die, however. These made me think that with technique, with finesse and with reason, persuasion will find a way. Advocacy will break through. The institution though battered and holed had not keeled over. And while it was afloat so was hope. It would of course require advocacy beyond ability which was possible given the extraordinary motivation. It always is,” he said.
However, he said the 27th Constitutional Amendment had “sunk that ship”.
He added, “It has scuttled whatever was left of an independent judiciary. That being so, I cannot continue to be a member of an institution erected on the promise to reform the law. No law reform is possible or can be effective without an independent judiciary. To continue in these circumstances would be to perpetuate the worst fraud possible: a fraud on oneself. I can go on but that would serve no purpose … I, therefore, thank you for the opportunity but confess my inability to continue. I resign.”
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.
The 27th Amendment promised, on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.
At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
 
 

Clause 23 of the amendment stated that the incumbent CJP — Justice Yahya Afridi — would maintain his office until the end of his tenure. Clause 56 of the amendment stated that once incumbent CJP Afridi’s term comes to an end, the future CJP would be the senior-most judge from the chief justices of the FCC and apex court.
Sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the FCC tomorrow at the Presidency.</p><small>2025-11-13 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06113652220795f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953108/unconstitutional-amendments-why-the-27th-could-mean-the-death-of-justice' target='_blank'><strong>(Un)constitutional amendments: Why the 27th could mean the death of justice</strong></a><br><p>This article was originally published on November 6, 2025, and has been replugged.

“I looked around in that ceremony, at the majority of recipients, and realised the rot that had set in: a constitutional colossus like him being honoured in the company of pygmies and dwarves … we have violated our oath to uphold the Constitution, and the result is a stark regression in the judicial protection of human rights.”
— Justice Shahid Karim on the conferment of Hilal-e-Imtiaz on the late Justice Fazal Karim, 17 November 2023
A year ago today, Qazi Faez Isa departed as the chief justice of Pakistan.
His parting gift was to reverse the ruling on dissident votes in the parliament. This, we know, kicked the gates open to the 26th amendment, as once-unbothered lawmakers were promptly forced into voting for the judiciary’s funeral rites.
The bill was passed, and the third branch was destroyed.
But while obeying His Lordship’s decision, the unity regime felt free to disobey that of the other lordships in a different case — reserved seats. It was just enough defiance to secure the numbers for their amendment.
How, you ask, does the executive override the Supreme Court whenever it feels like? By precedent. Two years earlier, it had shrugged off the Bandial Court’s orders to hold elections in 90 days. Only, once the state learns to ignore some judges, it learns to ignore the lot of them.
 
 

As several worthies deciding the reserved seats matter found out: it should have come as no surprise that their 12-member verdict was flung away as casually as that of the Bandial Court’s five — they’d enabled it via bizarre dissenting notes in the 90 days case, and then by supporting the trash-fire practice and procedure law chaining their own hands.
Per historian Edward Gibbon, “Those princes … permitted for a while to hold a precarious sceptre, were dismissed from their thrones as soon as they had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke the vanquished nations.”
And that yoke’s latest form — the Constitutional Bench — has more than delivered: out go reserved seats, in come military trials of civilians, and from the skies new lords parachute into the last holdout: the Islamabad High Court.
Nor is the unity regime satisfied. Its eyes are on a bigger prize: the creation of a so-called Constitutional Court. If allowed to go through, what was the worst judicial regression in over 30 years risks becoming the worst in Pakistan’s history. We look at the facts.
A crazy transplant from civil law
For starters, Pakistan’s entire justice system is built on common law, as opposed to that of civil law countries. To explain, common law systems (such as the United Kingdom and its former colonies, Pakistan and India) develop the law case by case, through precedent.
This can’t be overstated: stare decisis — to stand by what’s decided — makes the law dependable and predictable, with judges leaning on verdicts that have been handed down over decades and centuries. It also means trusting the courts to interpret the law and protect the people.
History is in play here: in common law countries, it was thought that empowered, independent judges would shield the citizen from tyrannical kings (a recurring problem in Pakistan).
 
 

Civil law systems believe in no such thing: there is no strong doctrine of precedent; the code is all; and judges are considered best when applying the law’s black letter as faceless, nameless robots.
But civil law countries are also born from specific nightmares: France, their prime example, was forged in the fire of revolution, when judges were thought enemies of the people and instruments of class privilege. Restoring order to madness, Napoleon made sure to straitjacket the judges into ‘la bouche de la loi’ — the mouth of the law, and no more.
That’s already the opposite of Britannia and its South Asian heirs, where the courts only ever gained in legitimacy when opposing despots. While Napoleon’s France codified against judges, we developed the common law through them.
Take also Germany, another well-known civil law buff: its constitutional court sits atop a culture of obedience and bureaucratic discipline. Pakistan, on the other hand, is always at risk from the gloved hand; its most basic rules of the road remain unsettled; and its judges are routinely pressed into service as the final frontier against democracy’s derailment.
Does that sound like a place where judges should be reduced to bean-counters?
Interestingly, ours is the first ruling class pleading for a civil law system to escape neither degenerate elites (France) nor fascist dictatorship (Germany), but its own Supreme Court.
Supreme confusion: we already have constitutional courts
Though stating the obvious, constitutional review is already vested in our superior courts: the high courts and the Supreme Court. They are also more than happy to exercise that jurisdiction under Articles 4 and 199 (judicial review of executive action and fundamental rights), with the Supreme Court acting as the final arbiter through Articles 184, 185, and 187.
But the unity regime wishes to strip them of that core function. The demoted Supreme Court, as this writer has said previously, shall now concern itself with civil nosebleeds, land disputes, maybe the odd buffalo wandering into a stranger’s rice paddy. That is no apex court, nor what it’s for.
This also breaks the third branch altogether: from a relatively clear path — trial courts to appellate High Courts to a final Supreme Court — we now get a new forum with a dozen detours.
 
 

For one, meaningless distinctions between ‘ordinary’ and ‘constitutional’ judges will fragment what’s already considered one of the most broken legal systems in the world.
For another, constant litigation over jurisdictional boundaries — what is a ‘constitutional’ question and what is not — will fill more dockets, burn more time, and nudge out more cases.
Finally, instead of our judicial structure as one coherent pyramid, we’re set for two competing apexes, with doctrinal chaos as a result.
An extra warehouse for pliant judges
Which brings us to why this amendment is being brought in the first place.
It’s certainly not pendency; a fallacious reason that only the most cynical and intellectually dishonest lawyers can put across with a straight face. As of 2024, per the Law and Justice Commission’s report, Supreme Court cases make up just 2 per cent of total pendency in the country.
That’s right: the main focus of the 26th and 27th amendments — for all the wide-ranging havoc they have brought and will bring to the judiciary — leaves 98pc of cases and 98pc of the litigant public untouched. (Even if we toss in all superior courts, it’s still over 80pc in the cold).
 
 

Because the litigant public was never worth securing, so much as a unity regime, that same public threw out in the last election. As yet another doorstop for the unelected, the new federal court will now serve as a warehouse for pliant judges: think Constitutional Bench with a hundred times the square footage.
And as a means of executive capture, what a joy it will be: a smaller court will require fewer appointments to control; its members can be packed in a single political cycle; favourites can audition from the provinces; and the Supreme Court’s senior career judges with decades of independence baggage can be skipped over at once.
Not least, by stripping their consent from the equation, independent judges will be transferred from province to province in the manner of common bureaucrats. Imagine if, at the first sign of resistance, the centre keeps ping-ponging courageous judges between Quetta and Karachi.
It even works out in converse: those timid souls making a career of doing the executive’s bidding will have added incentive not to get any funny ideas, and continue churning out one mindless judgment after the other.
Back to the future: new court, no precedent
The selling point of any new system is its lack of a difficult past: why sweat history?
And given federal constitutional courts — Europe’s, at least — tend to turn up their nose at precedent anyway, we arrive at the real bonus: decades of rights-friendly case law can be distinguished, overruled, or declared ‘inapplicable’ under the new amendment.
The Constitutional Bench has shown us a helpful preview: its reserved seats decision is gloriously bereft of even the most basic logic, while its military trials verdict seems to be labouring under the impression that Pakistan remains frozen in Bhutto’s emergency, and that judicial independence and the right to fair trial never happened in the interim.
Hence, also, the crux of our neo-PCOs, the 26th and 27th amendments: an embarrassed state of exception can become proud law. Yes, there have been a fair few outliers. But generally, from 2009 to 2023, the post-restoration judiciary guarded its turf.
So the deep state has seen fit to raise a new judiciary instead, and upend the very terms of that restoration: a process begun in earnest when the unity regime crowed with glee that democracy could be overridden based on a fictional 4-3 verdict in the 90 days case. It was the beginning of the end, with that end turbo-charged by the year of Qazi.
 
 

In other ways, however, the judicial branch may well be regressing to the mean. After all, Pakistan has never suffered from a shortage of constitutional courts — what has forever plagued it is a lack of constitutional courage.
Or perhaps ignorance.
It can be assumed the vast majority of regime tools punching the air for a constitutional court haven’t the first idea of the difference between common law and civil law countries (or that Pakistan is a common law country at all); of the role of precedent in shaping the law over decades; of how the the forced transfer of judges is a humiliation; or of how foolish it is to blindly transplant alien organs into a republic with its own zaman, makan, and ikhwan; of how an entire judicature mustn’t be sacrificed to win sordid little grudge matches.
Yet it can equally be assumed they will become domain experts the very second the levers of power fall from their hands, and the benefit of independent judges becomes clear to them as thunder.
Sooner, one can only hope, than when drafting their own bail petitions.</p><small>2025-11-13 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13182043a27a1fb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954868/navy-chief-concludes-milestone-visit-to-bangladesh-meets-senior-military-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>Navy chief concludes ‘milestone visit’ to Bangladesh, meets senior military leadership</strong></a><br><p>Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf on Thursday concluded his visit to Bangladesh, where he met with Dhaka’s senior military leadership and discussed regional maritime security and avenues to bolster defence cooperation, a statement from the Navy’s Directorate General of Public Relations (DGPR) read.
According to the statement, the navy chief’s visit coincided with the PNS Saif warship being docked at Bangladesh’s Chattogram port.
“This milestone visit symbolises a renewed chapter in fostering mutual respect, bilateral naval collaboration and contributing to strengthening maritime security cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” the statement said.
During his visit, Admiral Ashraf called on Bangladeshi army chief General Wakeruz Zaman, navy chief Admiral M Nazmul Hassan, air force chief Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and the Principal Staff Officer Armed Forces Division Lieutenant General SM Kamrul Hassan.
“During the meetings, discussions on matters of mutual professional interest, regional maritime security and avenues to strengthen defence cooperation between the two countries were held,” the statement read, adding that the meetings highlighted the need for bilateral cooperation and the mutual commitment towards regional peace.
Admiral Ashraf also visited the National Defence College and the Bangladesh Naval Academy, the DGPR said, where he appreciated the high standards and emphasised the need for advanced training in an evolving maritime domain.
“While in Chattogram, Commander Chattogram (COMCHIT), Commander Bangladesh Navy Fleet (COMBAN) and Area Superintendent Dockyard (ASD) made calls on Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf,” the statement read.
Later, a reception was held aboard the PNS Saif, which the statement said was attended by Dhaka’s navy chief, who was received by Admiral Ashraf and Pakistani High Commissioner Imran Haider.
“The gathering included diplomats, senior military officials, scholars, journalists and business leaders reinforcing the commitment of peaceful cooperation in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean Region,” the statement added.
The visit comes as ties between Islamabad and Dhaka improved over the summer.
In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus during his landmark visit to Dhaka — the first carried out by a Pakistani foreign minister in 13 years.
Dar called on Yunus and apprised him of the developments during his trip. The pair discussed “recent developments in the region and the prospects of regional cooperation”.
“The discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation,” the FO wrote.
 






In October, the 9th Session of the Pakistan-Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) was convened in Dhaka, after a hiatus of 20 years, marking another important milestone in strengthening bilateral economic and development cooperation between the two countries.</p><small>2025-11-13 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13165322b7a1f6a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954856/medical-experts-perform-surgery-using-toumai-surgical-robot-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Medical experts perform surgery using Toumai surgical robot in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Medical experts at Islamabad’s largest public-sector hospital, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), performed a robotic surgery using the Toumai surgical robot on Thursday.
Robot-assisted surgery has significantly advanced urology — medical speciality that deals with the urinary system. It offers superior precision, reduced invasiveness, and improved clinical outcomes compared to traditional techniques.  The Toumai system integrates force sensing, high-frequency response capabilities, and telerobotic surgery capabilities.
The robotic surgery at Pims was performed by both local and international medical experts, including Prof Shamim Khan, Prof Mateen Sharif and Dr Javed Burki from the UK, while the surgical team from Pims included Dr Atif Inam Shami, Dr Burhan ul Haq, and Dr Khalid Saeed.
Executive Director Pims Dr Rana Imran Sikander said it was the first time a robotic surgery was performed at the hospital.
During the surgery, the adrenal glands of a female patient were removed.
Pims spokesperson Dr Mubashir Daha explained that adrenal glands are located at the top of the kidney; they produce hormones to regulate metabolism, the immune system, and blood pressure, as well as control the stress response.
A 70-year-old female patient was diagnosed with a confirmed left adrenal pheochromocytoma, which was causing episodes of high blood pressure, palpitations, sweating, and headaches due to excessive hormone secretion.
She underwent a left robotic adrenalectomy to remove the tumour. The surgery is expected to eliminate the source of excess hormones, help stabilise her blood pressure, relieve her symptoms, and improve her quality of life.
According to ED Dr Imran, the patient is expected to be discharged in a few days.
“This was a robot brought by the team from the UK; we also intend to buy a robot to start this surgery in our hospital,” Dr Imran added. He said doctors from the general surgery and urology departments also participated in the surgery.
Moreover, he said the new technology will enable patients to recover faster, experience less pain, and witness improved surgical results.
Speaking to the media, Director of Robotic Surgery at Pims, Prof Mateen Sharif, said it marked the beginning of a “new chapter” in Pakistan’s healthcare system. He said that the robot was manufactured in China, claiming the mission was to expand robotic surgery across the country.
Meanwhile, a workshop on robotic surgery is being held at Pims. It is led by Prof Dr Atif Inam Shami, with the surgery being conducted by Prof Mateen Shareef and Dr Javed Burki from the UK. </p><small>2025-11-13 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131755398131c76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954865/turkiye-refutes-indian-media-reports-alleging-involvement-in-delhi-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Turkiye refutes Indian media reports alleging involvement in Delhi blast</strong></a><br><p>Turkiye on Thursday refuted claims made by Indian media outlets claiming that Ankara had a link to the car blast in Delhi earlier this week.
A day prior, the Indian government confirmed that it was treating a car blast that killed 12 people and wounded at least 20 others in Delhi as a “terror incident” and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice as swiftly as possible.
In a statement, Turkiye’s Directorate of Communications rejected the allegations and displayed screenshots of social media posts by two Indian outlets, which claimed Ankara had a “role in radicalising sleeper cells against India, [the] Turkish government is providing logistical, diplomatic and financial help to all terrorist groups across the world”.
“The deliberate reports in certain Indian media outlets … are part of a malicious disinformation campaign aimed at damaging bilateral relations between the two countries,” Ankara’s statement read.
 






Turkiye rejected acts of terror “regardless of where or by whom they are committed” and noted its contributions to counter-terrorism frameworks by the United Nations and Nato.
“The claim that Turkiye engages in ‘radicalisation activities’ targeting India or any other country is purely disinformative and lacks any factual basis,” the statement added.
“Such unfounded and manipulative reports targeting Turkiye are attempts to undermine our country’s contributions to international peace, security, and stability. The public is kindly advised not to give credence to such disinformative claims.”
The explosion was reported near the Red Fort in the Indian capital of New Delhi on Monday, in which at least eight people were killed and at least 20 people were injured. The toll later rose to 12.
“A slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light. An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,” Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters. “The situation is being monitored.”
At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws caught fire, Delhi’s deputy fire chief said, adding that the flames had been doused by firefighting teams.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to bring to justice all those responsible, while his Home Minister, Amit Shah, said he had instructed officials “to hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.</p><small>2025-11-13 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131759499985e0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954850/afghan-link-confirmed-as-rawalpindi-ctd-arrests-7-suspected-facilitators-of-islamabad-court-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan link ‘confirmed’ as Rawalpindi CTD arrests 7 suspected facilitators of Islamabad court blast</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday said the suicide bomber involved in the blast at Islamabad’s judicial complex was “related to Afghanistan”, while Rawalpindi’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) arrested seven suspects who allegedly facilitated the attack.
Speaking on the Senate floor, Naqvi termed the alleged links to Tuesday’s blast incident, which killed 12 people and injured 35, a “very serious” concern. He noted that Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif have also been informed about the matter.
Referring to the attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan on November 10, the interior minister said the suicide bomber involved in that incident was also from Afghanistan.
“It is becoming very difficult for us; the way people from Afghanistan are coming here and attacking us,” he said, adding that with Deputy PM Ishaq Dar also taking up the issue, they will do “whatever is possible” to tackle it.
Naqvi said the government was ensuring that illegal Afghans residing in Pakistan were driven out.
 


Later today, Naqvi said on X that he had a “deeply reassuring telephonic call” with Bahrain’s Interior Minister General Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, who “unequivocally condemned the terrorist attack in Islamabad and conveyed heartfelt condolences on the loss of innocent lives”.
The Bahrain minister also reaffirmed his country’s “unwavering support and solidarity with Pakistan at all times”, Naqvi added.
 






7 suspected facilitators arrested
Earlier today, Rawalpindi’s CTD arrested seven suspects who allegedly facilitated the suicide bomb blast in Islamabad.
According to a police source, the “suspected facilitators have been arrested from Rawalpindi’s Fauji Colony (Pirwadhai area) and Dhoke Kashmirian. Moreover, a raid was also conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
Yesterday, investigators had detained a bike rider of an online ride-hailing platform who had dropped off the bom­ber outside at the location.
A police official had said the bomber paid the fare to the bike rider against the ride, adding that he was traced and identified through the CCTV footage.
 
 

After his location was traced, the police picked him up and shifted him to an installation where he was being kept under protective custody.
The incident had occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Green Shirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Rawalpindi.
The blast had occurred the same day a bomb attack targeted a security forces’ convoy in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district, injuring at least 14 personnel.
A day before that, the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana had come under attack. While all students and teachers were reported to have been safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.
‘State of war’
In the wake of the Islamabad and Wana attacks, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif yesterday accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in recent terrorism, and vowed a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.
Hours after the blast, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had termed the incident a “wake-up call” and said Pakistan was “in a state of war”.
“Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he had said, voicing lack of hope for successful counter-terrorism negotiations with Kabul.
 
 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said, “We are linking this blast today with a lot of things and, in the coming hours or days, we will be very clear about it.”
“We are not taking this blast as just another one,” he added, noting that its timing and the federal capital being targeted “has a lot of messages”.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said that the suicide bomber was “not a Pakistani national”.
Elaborating on the matter in an interview, Chaudhry said: “The suicide attacker in the Islamabad blast was not a Pakistani. I am confirming this to you. He did not know Pakistan’s language nor did he know of the country’s currency.”</p><small>2025-11-13 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13164147bc6de4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954815/president-zardari-gives-assent-to-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari gives assent to 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Thursday, enacting it into law.
The summary signed by the president, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “The Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2025, is assented to, as advised by the prime minister, at para 5 of the summary.”
 






Meanwhile, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency.
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting  Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar again tabled the bill in the upper house of Parliament today.
Elaborating on the changes and the bill’s salient features, he said the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) would continue to hold this post until he held the office. Following his retirement, he said, the senior one among the top-most judges of the Supreme Court and the planned Federal Constitutional Court would have the title of the CJP.
He added that according to the proposed amendment, the CJP would administer the oath to the president, chief election commissioner and auditor general for Pakistan.
Detailing changes to Article 6 of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of treason, he said the provision would now read: “Any court in Pakistan, be it the Federal Constitutional Court that will now, God willing, be established, the Supreme Court or high courts, cannot validate the abrogation of [of the Constitution].”
This was akin to blocking martial laws and upholding democracy, he argued.
Speaking against the proposed amendment, PTI Senator Ali Zafar criticised the government for its “haste”.
“They want to establish their constitutional court at the earliest so that they can control it. And the reason behind the haste is the fear of one person, who is in jail a few miles away from here,” Zafar alleged.
He further stated that the 27th Amendment was based on “deceit and fraud”, asserting that the proposed legislation did not have the people’s support. “The very foundation of the 27th Amendment is based on fraud and deception, and this building is going to fall,” he warned.
The matter of defection
Immediately after Tarar tabled the bill in the Senate, Senator Zafar had highlighted that the house would be voting for the second time on the constitutional amendment. The amendment, he said, would need the support of a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which meant at least 64 votes.
He recalled that during the first instance of voting, PTI’s Saifullah Abro and another senator from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) had voted in favour of the amendment and against the party line.
After casting his vote, Abro had announced his resignation on the floor of the house.
Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani was asked about it while he was speaking to the media at Parliament today morning. In his response, Gilani said after formally receiving Abro’s resignation in writing, he would call him and maybe, “I am able to convince him”.
Later, PTI’s Zafar pointed out to him in the Senate that the defection by Abro led to the application of Article 63-A, which stipulated that Abro stood disqualified. Moreover, he said, Abro had also announced his resignation.
In light of these developments, he requested that the votes of the defecting senator not be counted.
“Otherwise, we will have to challenge this entire process,” he said.
Speaking after him, JUI-F’s Kamran Murtaza complained that “a member of ours was won over”.
“He voted in favour of the amendment, and it could not have been a choice he made out of his own good conscience,” he said, adding that “we have spent our  time with the ruling PML-N in a respectful manner”.
“But we were also disgraced,” he rued. “I think it was unfair.”
Murtaza said he wanted to put forward his party leader’s message that “our grievance to the PML-N should be conveyed that we did not like what happened. But life goes on, and what happened will remain in our memory”.
He further stated that the defecting senator from the JUI-F, Ahmed Khan, had been expelled from the party, his resignation as a senator had been sought, and the party had also sought the invocation of Article 63-A.
Considering this, Khan had no right to still vote against the party line and betray the party’s trust, Murtaza added.
“And what I am saying right now, take it as our notice pertaining to Article 63-A.  We will be voting against the amendment, and if anyone [from the JUI-F] does not, Article 63-A would apply to them as well. This is the message from Maulana, our party leader, and the decision of our parliamentary leader,” he said.
However, Tarar contended that if a member voted against the party line on no-confidence motions, budget or money bills and constitutional amendments, the party head could send a reference against them to the presiding officer. The presiding officer in the NA would be the speaker and the Senate chairperson in the upper house of Parliament, he added.
“Correct me if I am wrong. We shouldn’t distort the provisions of the Constitution for political point scoring,” he remarked.
Addressing Gilani, Tarar said he had two days to examine the reference and forward it to the chief election commissioner, that was if he had received the reference in writing. Moreover, he continued, the party head was also required to call the relevant member for a hearing before sending a reference against them.
The law minister further said the matter is eventually referred to the Election Commission of Pakistan, where a hearing is held. “And if a de-seating order is issued against anyone, they had a right to appeal in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that until this process formally culminated, a member would not be disqualified.
As far as the issue of resignation was concerned, he stressed that the relevant member had to submit their resignation in writing to the Senate chairperson, who would then give a ruling on it.
For his part, Gilani said he had not received any resignation in writing and so, “their resignation has not yet been accepted or received”.
At a later point during the session, PTI’s Zafar again took the floor and expressed his disappointment over treasury benches “openly supporting” the the trend of politicians becoming turncoats when the opposition was raising its voice against it.
“They are promoting lotacracy (a term referring to the trend of becoming turncoats in politics) and fraud. It is shameful,” he remarked.
He said it had been decided by consensus in the past that defection would not be supported, and it should be stopped.
“But today, by clapping and thumping the desks, they have told everyone that they are on the side of corruption, fraud and lies. It is very unfortunate,” he said about the treasury benches. “Had they stayed quiet and let the defector defend himself, I could have assumed that they are not involved in this. But by thumping the desks, they clearly showed that they are involved in this.
Opposing him, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar explained the defection clause,  saying that “voting in line with your conscience and against the party line is defection”.
“I don’t call it defection. I call it voting in line with your conscience,” he said, adding that a member could choose to vote against their party’s line knowing the consequences they would have to face.
He also stressed that the PTI’s defecting member would continue to be a member of the house until disqualified by the election commission.
Dar also commended Abro and JUI-F’s Ahmed Khan for voting in line with their conscience. “This is what democracy requires,” he said.
Ruckus in NA
Yesterday, a revised draft of the 27th Amendment bill was passed by the NA during a session attended by political bigwigs and marred by noisy protests and a walkout by opposition lawmakers.
The bill had 59 clauses and eight were changed in the final draft tabled before the lower house of Parliament. The draft was slightly different from the one initially passed by the Senate on Monday. The fresh changes are mostly related to the chief justice of Pakistan.
 
 

At the outset, the NA proceedings moved forward smoothly, and several MNAs, including opposition alliance leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, spoke on the floor of the house. The situation began turning chaotic when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, his brother and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari arrived in the hall. At this point, PTI lawmakers started chanting slogans targeting the PML-N leaders and against the constitutional amendment.
During the protest, PML-N MNAs made a shield in front of the PM and Nawaz Sharif to prevent the PTI members from approaching the premier and the party chief. Similarly, the security guards of the Parliament House also came closer to the PM for his security. The protest also disrupted the law minister’s and the PPP chief’s speeches, and the opposition members tore up the copies of the bill and flung them towards the PM’s chair.
Interestingly, PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat did not join the protest and remained seated even after the opposition MNAs walked out of the house in protest. Later, he went directly to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to meet him and listened to the PM’s speech. As the premier spoke in the house, PTI MNA Iqbal Khan Afridi again entered the house with a banner in his hands, which carried the portrait of PTI founder Imran Khan. He went to the speaker’s dais and kept displaying the banner to the PM throughout his speech.
When the law minister started reading clauses of the bill, the opposition members gathered in front of the speaker’s dais to continue with their noisy protest. The bill, however, was passed with the required majority.
During the session, PPP’s Bilawal had vowed that the party would never support the rollback of the 18th Amendment — a change that is said to have been proposed in the bill’s initial draft — and of any laws that would go against the basic rights of the people. He said his party decided to support the changes in Article 243 (command of armed forces) in the “context that Pakistan is going through a situation of war”.
“On the one hand, we defeated India. On the other hand, India hosted the Afghan foreign minister, and what is happening on our second border after that, the spilling of blood of our citizens is in front of you,” he said. The PPP leader said terrorism was once again on the rise, but Pakistan had managed to defeat the menace before and would do so again.
“In the 27th Amendment, we are about to fulfill the unfulfilled promises of the Charter of Democracy. We are about to establish constitutional courts, and in Article 243 — after defeating India, the prime minister decided to make the army chief the field marshal — not only are we providing constitutional protection to that rank of field marshal, but also bringing some changes to the defence institutions,” he said.
For his part, PM Shehbaz thanked President Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz, Bilawal and other allies. He said the amendment had become part of the Constitution after the consultation process, adding that the Charter of Democracy had always envisioned a constitutional court, and now that “dream” was fulfilled.
“I also want to thank Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi for supporting us within the ambit of the Constitution,” he added.
Opposition to the bill
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure.
After its approval by the NA yesterday, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the development, stating that in rushing the amendments, “you have sunk the ship of democracy and judicial independence”.
Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­­istan has ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the proposed am­­end­ment, urging the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
 
 

Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Contentious bill
The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution is taking shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved.
The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that a PM Shehbaz-led delegation had sought his party’s support for the amendment.
Subsequently, PM Shehbaz also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.
The bill was then tabled in the Senate on Nov 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the parliamentary standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft.
The law minister tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.
On November 12, the bill was passed by the National Assembly after the introduction of some changes, mostly related to the chief justice of Pakistan.
In the house of 336 members, 224 votes were required to meet the mandatory two-thirds majority for the passage of the bill. The ruling lawmakers cast 234 votes in its favour, while four votes were polled against the bill by the JUI-F members. The JUI-F has 10 MNAs, but only four attended the sitting. The PTI members, meanwhile, boycotted the process by staging a walkout.
The bill, however, was referred back to the Senate due to the fresh changes and subsequently approved today.</p><small>2025-11-13 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1318305813b197d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954859/iran-russia-fms-call-for-continued-dialogue-between-pakistan-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, Russia FMs call for ‘continued dialogue’ between Pakistan, Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>The foreign ministers of Iran and Russia have called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism.
Last week, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi spoke on the telephone on Wednesday, during which the two sides exchanged views on the latest bilateral and regional developments.
In its statement on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said the two ministers “welcomed the agreement reached between Kabul and Islamabad, mediated by the authorities of Qatar and Türkiye, on a mutual ceasefire and an end to cross-border shootings along the Afghan-Pakistani frontier”.
“The sides called for continued dialogue between the two friendly states (Afghanistan and Pakistan) to resolve differences by political and diplomatic means, in the interests of ensuring regional stability and security,” the ministry added.
 






Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign ministry’s statement said Araghchi “expressed concern over the recent clashes between Afghanistan and Pakistan”.
“He stressed the importance of constructive regional efforts to safeguard peace and stability, and called for enhanced dialogue and cooperation among regional countries in this regard.”
After a spate of terror attacks in the country this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif yesterday accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in recent terrorism, and vowed a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.
One of the terror incidents was Tuesday’s rare suicide attack in Islamabad, which killed 12 people and injured 36 others. This occurred the same day a bomb attack targeted a security forces’ convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, injuring at least 14 personnel.
 
 

Another was an attack on the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana, from where students and teachers were safely rescued, but three individuals were martyred during the clearance operation.
Today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the main suspects in both the Islamabad blast and the Wana college infiltration were from Afghanistan.
Following the Islamabad blast, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said Pakistan was in a “state of war”, adding that it was futile to hope for any positive outcome of talks with Kabul after the incident.
Araghchi slams US draft resolution on Gaza force
The two dignitaries also discussed international matters, especially those in the Middle East.
FM Araghchi mentioned the recent moves by the United States and certain European countries at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) “regarding Palestine, including a draft resolution that would impose an international trusteeship over Gaza and Palestine”.
Araghchi warned that such initiatives contradict the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and are doomed to fail.
 
 

Lavrov, as per the Iranian ministry, stressed the importance of strengthening cooperation among “regional countries to maintain collective security”. He reaffirmed Moscow’s readiness to continue bilateral and regional consultations toward this goal.
The two foreign ministers also pointed to the upcoming meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Board of Governors, exchanging views on Iran’s cooperation with the UN’s nuclear watchdog.
Last month, Iran said it was no longer bound by restrictions on its nuclear programme, which Tehran says is for civilian purposes, as a landmark 10-year deal between it and world powers expired.
“Araghchi and Lavrov underlined the need to maintain coordination and cooperation among Tehran, Moscow, and Beijing in this regard,” the Iranian ministry said. Russia accused France, the United Kingdom and Germany of “attempting to initiate an anti-Iranian campaign” at the IAEA meeting.
Iran, Russia ‘determined’ to expand cooperation in all avenues
Araghchi and Lavrov also discussed the state of Iran and Russia’s bilateral relations, reaffirming the “firm determination of their countries to expand cooperation in all areas of mutual interest”, the Iranian ministry said.
Araghchi underscored the need for continued talks between Iran and Russia, as well as with other regional partners, to “explore ways of preserving peace and stability”.
According to the Russian foreign ministry, the two leaders reaffirmed their “mutual commitment to the unconditional implementation of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Russia and Iran, which entered into force on October 2”.

The announcement comes two days after 12 people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area. The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the first one-day international (ODI) match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Rawalpindi.
The announcement about the new initiative was made by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry while he was addressing a press conference outside Parliament House alongside Islamabad Deputy Commissioner (DC) Irfan Nawaz Memon and Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi.
He said that as part of the programme, a first-of-its-kind new ‘Secure Neighbourhood’ survey would be launched that would allow the administration to know who was occupying every house, shop or office in the capital with information about the number of people, their age, their nationality, whether the place was rented or self-owned and more.
The minister said the information would not only help in providing the public with municipal services but would also provide large volumes of data to the government for security purposes.
“In the next stage, it will be declared mandatory for all vehicles in the city to have electronic tags. There will be no vehicle in Islamabad without green tags that are cleared regarding the environment, and electronic tags, which we also call M-Tag or e-tags, so every moment of any vehicle in Islamabad can be monitored.”
The minister said that Islamabad was “very important” as the country’s capital. “The administration has more responsibility than the administration of other cities,” he said, adding that the police and district administration not only had to serve citizens but also protect foreign diplomats, guests, officials and other important people.
Chaudhry said the steps were taken by the interior minister and the ministry under the prime minister’s leadership to ensure that the capital looked as secure as it looked beautiful.
The state minister said the “Secure Neighbourhood” project would reach completion in the next three months.
He added that public schools, colleges, businesses, traders, bodies and current and past officials would be taken on board as well to disseminate the survey.
Chaudhry assured the public that the information would “remain safe and secure with government agencies and the Islamabad administration.”
Details of survey app
Providing more details on the survey, DC Memon said an application was launched by the name of “ICT Household Survey” and anyone living in Islamabad could download it and add details of their residence, residents, servants and ownership status therein.
He said teams would begin door-to-door surveys from Monday to add people to the database. Memon added that the data would also pinpoint which houses had information missing about them and the administration would subsequently retrieve it, whether by “force or other means”.
He said the above was the only way to declare Islamabad safe and secure.
The DC went on to say that he would share further details about the steps related to the vehicles in the next two to three days. “The tagging mandate would not only be for vehicles in the city but also those entering it.”
Meanwhile, the police chief said the collection of data through the survey was very important for security purposes. “The police teams would also accompany the door-to-door survey teams,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-13 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13180336764bb04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954855/field-marshal-munir-facilitated-process-leading-to-sri-lankan-cricket-team-staying-in-pakistan-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir facilitated process leading to Sri Lankan cricket team staying in Pakistan: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir facilitated the talks with Sri Lanka, resulting in the latter’s cricket team deciding to stay in Pakistan for the ongoing matches.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board said late last night that its team’s ongoing tour of Pakistan will proceed, averting a crisis-like situation after reports about some players returning home in the wake of Tuesday’s deadly suicide bombing in Islamabad.
“Our field marshal himself spoke to their defence minister, secretary and convinced them and assured them fully of [providing] security,” Naqvi, also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief, said while speaking on the Senate floor.

He recalled that the Sri Lankan team yesterday “decided to return after the bomb blast occurred”.
“Our interaction with them began […] their board, players and everyone decided with great bravery to stay here,” the PCB chairman added.
“They had many concerns, but we tried to allay all of those,” Naqvi said, highlighting that Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake spoke with his country’s team to convince them.
Naqvi then revealed that Field Marshal Munir had played a role in the visiting team deciding to continue their matches.
“And now, the Pakistan Army, Rangers and Islamabad police together are managing their security, and we are providing them the same kind of protocol and security as they are our state guests,” the interior minister said.
The PCB chairman noted that the Zimbabwe team has arrived in Pakistan, and the rest of the matches will be held in Rawalpindi.
 
 

The suicide blast in Islamabad on Tuesday, which killed 12 people and left 36 injured, occurred just hours before the first One-Day International (ODI) match between the Green Shirts and the Lions was set to begin in Rawalpindi.
Subsequently, there were reports of some Sri Lankan players heading back, which were initially dismissed by the team’s manager. However, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) later acknowledged that several members of its team had requested to return home, citing safety concerns.
“Following this development, SLC immediately engaged with the players and assured them that all such concerns are being duly addressed in close coordination with the Pakistan Cricket Board and the relevant authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of every member of the touring party,” the board said in a statement.
The SLC further said it would immediately send replacements to ensure uninterrupted games if any player or member of the touring party decides to return to Sri Lanka.
In the wake of these developments, the PCB has rescheduled the two remaining ODIs for November 14 and 16 — postponing both by a day each.
It has also shifted a T20I tri-nation tournament, featuring Zimbabwe too, from Lahore to Rawalpindi. The matches are scheduled from November 18 to 29.
 






A day after the blast, Naqvi, the Islamabad chief commissioner, and the Islamabad police chief had met Sri Lankan envoy retired Rear Admiral Fred Seneviratne.
They assured him that comprehensive security measures were in place for the players, who are state guests. According to the PCB, the Sri Lankan high commissioner had expressed satisfaction at security arrangements for his national team.</p><small>2025-11-13 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13124144d51c073.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954847/karachi-police-finds-distribution-box-for-safe-city-cameras-earlier-gone-missing-from-clifton' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police finds distribution box for Safe City cameras earlier gone missing from Clifton</strong></a><br><p>A non-functional distribution box of Safe City cameras installed near a residential apartment in Karachi’s posh Clifton area was found on Thursday after reportedly being stolen, police said.
“This was a non-energised/non-operational pole site near Sea Rock Apartments at Seaview, where the theft of a distribution box was reported to local police on November 6,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
Later, the DIG confirmed, “The distribution box has been recovered from a nearby plot.”
He asserted that the police were “developing a strategy in coordination with Sindh Safe City Authority to prevent such incidents in future”.
Quoting a staff member from a nearby hotel earlier today, the South police chief said, “A vehicle with a crane was witnessed working on the pole hours before the theft was reported.
“Since then, a few switches and the battery are missing,” the DIG added.
The officer said the distribution box was installed at an “extreme height”, adding that it would not have been possible for one person to steal it. He noted that the cameras were also not functional.

DIG Raza observed that the locality was a “completely blacked out area” and there were neither street lights nor any CCTVs installed by private restaurants.
“Only a single camera installed at Sea Rock Apartments is available, which offers a limited coverage of the parking area,” he said, adding that the police had written letters to the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to install street lights in the area to no avail.
According to DIG Raza, there was no alarm system installed at the “non-operational” pole, which made it difficult to ascertain when the distribution box was removed. Further investigation of the matter was under way, he said.
 
 

The first phase of the Karachi Safe City Project, aimed at enhancing public safety and security, was launched on May 31, 2024. Under that phase, 891 surveillance cameras had been deployed across Karachi.
Last month, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah approved the expansion of the project to more high-risk commercial and residential areas of Karachi, including the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and the districts of South, East, and Malir.</p><small>2025-11-13 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131250459a68cb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954848/interior-minister-tells-uk-crime-agency-chief-terrorist-incidents-linked-to-neighbouring-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister tells UK crime agency chief terrorist incidents linked to ‘neighbouring countries’</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Thursday that terrorist incidents in Pakistan were linked to “neighbouring countries”.
He made the remarks while meeting with the director general of the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA), Graeme Biggar, according to a handout issued by the interior ministry.
“Links of all terrorist incidents come from neighbouring countries,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He said that, adding that there was no other example in the world for Pakistan’s determination against terrorism.
He said that modern forensics and training could further enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies, adding that effective measures were being taken to stop illegal immigration.
The statement further said that Naqvi and the NCA official held detailed discussions on enhancing cooperation in the areas of countererrorism, narcotics, human trafficking, forensics, immigration and police training.
The participants of the meeting agreed to enhance mutual cooperation in training courses for officers of various agencies, including the Anti-Narcotics Force and National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency. They also agreed to have effective coordination in combating online harassment of children, the statement said.
Five memoranda of understanding (MoUs) on cooperation in extradition and other areas between Britain and Pakistan are to be finalised soon, the ministry said.
Meanwhile, the NCA chief condemned the suicide attack in Islamabad on Tuesday and expressed grief over the lives lost in the incident.
“We are cooperating with the government of Pakistan in various fields,” he said, while appreciating Pakistan’s efforts in combatting the drug trade.
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott, the national coordinator of the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), the director general of the NCCIA, the additional home secretary, the Islamabad chief commissioner and the inspector general of the Islamabad police were also present on the occasion.
The meeting comes after a suicide blast occurred outside a district court in Islamabad’s G-11, the first such incident in the federal capital in nearly three years, and an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.
“It is no more a secret that an external hand is visible [in attacks in Pakistan]”, PM Shehbaz said during his address to the National Assembly following the passage of the controversial 27th Cons­ti­tutional Amendment.
PM Shehbaz said the notion that Pakistan’s enemies were not involved in the attacks was “akin to calling day as night and vice versa.” He issued a stern warning directly to those responsible.
“I want to say something with great satisfaction and force to these terrorist elements and enemies of Pakistan that we are fully aware of your actions and we have given you a befitting response before and will do so again as well,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-13 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13114410bbcda7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954843/india-asks-un-wildlife-body-to-not-curb-its-animal-imports-amid-ambani-zoo-furore' target='_blank'><strong>India asks UN wildlife body to not curb its animal imports amid Ambani zoo furore</strong></a><br><p>India has urged a UN wildlife trade body not to curb its imports of endangered species, saying it has tightened oversight amid growing allegations of irregular animal shipments to a large private zoo run by Asia’s richest family.
Vantara, a 3,500-acre zoo in Gujarat state run by the philanthropic arm of a conglomerate led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani and his family, has faced allegations of improper imports of certain animals, triggering higher scrutiny from authorities in Germany and the European Union, Reuters has reported.
Indian investigators tasked by the country’s Supreme Court to examine the allegations by non-profit and wildlife groups cleared the sanctuary of any wrongdoing in September, and Vantara has said it complies with all regulations.
However, after visiting the facility in September, the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) issued a report last week asking India to review its procedures.
The report cited discrepancies between exporter and importer trade data and flagged insufficient checks on the origin of some animals.

In a submission to CITES dated November 10, India said any restrictive or punitive measure at this stage would lack legal foundation and risk unsettling the CITES framework, calling the measure “premature and disproportionate”.
The wildlife body’s request “would constitute a de facto suspension or moratorium on lawful” imports, the government said.
The Indian submission, posted on the CITES website ahead of its convention meeting this month, is first being reported by Reuters. It signals new wrangling over Vantara’s imports.
Tighter scrutiny in place, India says
CITES is a global treaty that regulates trade in endangered plants and animals, or products derived from them, with the aim of ensuring their survival.

While CITES acknowledged last week that Vantara operates facilities of exceptionally high standards, it recommended that India halt new import permits for endangered species until safeguards are tightened.
The body warned that without stricter checks, animals sourced from the wild could be misrepresented as captive-bred.
India countered that it “has strengthened inspection and reporting mechanisms for all recognised zoos and rescue facilities”, including Vantara. The government also instructed the Central Zoo Authority to ensure enhanced due diligence for all future acquisitions.
CITES and Vantara did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Indian government’s submission on Wednesday.
Animals from the world over
Vantara says it is home to some 2,000 species.
That includes imported exotic species from South Africa, Venezuela, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, including snakes, tortoises, tigers, cheetahs, giraffes and chimpanzees.

The shipments were recorded with a declared value of $9 million, which Vantara has said reflected freight and insurance charges, not any payments for wildlife.
The CITES report last week noted that “a number of animals come from established commercial breeding facilities, which would normally sell the animals they breed”.
India has mounted a defence, saying in response that the Supreme Court panel’s findings showed imports were carried out in compliance with regulations.</p><small>2025-11-13 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13104109d863aa0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954841/lotte-chemical-sells-75pc-stake-in-pakistani-subsidiary-for-69-million' target='_blank'><strong>Lotte Chemical sells 75pc stake in Pakistani subsidiary for $69 million</strong></a><br><p>South Korea’s Lotte Chemical said on Thursday it has sold about 75 per cent stake in its Pakistani subsidiary to Dubai-based PTA Global Holding for $68.94 million (98 billion won).
The South Korean company is trying to restructure its portfolio under a government-led programme aimed at aiding loss-making petrochemicals in the country due to poor demand and abundant supply.
Lotte Chemical Pakistan produces 500,000 tons of high-purity terephthalic acid (PTA), used in polyester fibers, industrial yarns, and PET bottles, annually at its plant in Karachi.
Adnan Afridi has been appointed the firm’s chief executive officer following the stake sale, Lotte Chemical Pakistan said in a statement late on Wednesday.
“The acquisition marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the company’s journey — one defined by innovation, operational excellence, and strategic growth, positioning Lotte Chemical Pakistan as a key industrial growth agent for PET and PSF customers in Pakistan,” the statement said.
The statement also quoted Afridi as saying that the immediate focus was on “operational excellence and sustainable profitability”.
“We are optimising plant efficiency, improving reliability, and integrating advanced energy-saving technologies that will significantly reduce our production costs. This is not just about growth — it’s about setting a new standard of performance for the chemical sector in Pakistan,“ he said.
He said that improving operational efficiencies and energy-related initiatives would make the company more competitive and a key growth partner for Pakistan’s polyester and packaging industries.
Afridi said the company plans aggressive growth “through mergers and acquisitions to enable diversification and scale”.</p><small>2025-11-13 05:45</small></div><hr>
