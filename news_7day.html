Putin, who ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022 after eight years of fighting in the country’s east, also said he was not seeking the capitulation of Ukraine or denying its sovereignty, but that Ukraine had to be neutral.
Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea, more than 99 per cent of the Luhansk region, over 70pc of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fragments of the Kharkiv, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions.
Asked about fresh Russian advances, Putin told the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that he considered Russians and Ukrainians to be one people and  “in that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours”.
Kyiv and its Western allies say Moscow’s claims to four Ukrainian regions and Crimea are illegal, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly rejected the notion that Russians and Ukrainians are one people.
He has also said that Putin’s terms for peace are akin to capitulation.
Putin said on Friday he was not questioning Ukraine’s independence or its people’s striving for sovereignty, but he underscored that when Ukraine declared independence as the Soviet Union fell in 1991, it had also declared its neutrality.

London’s Metropolitan Police banned protesters from gathering in the area in west London after seven men were arrested  “on suspicion of grievous bodily harm”.
The Met said two people had been treated at the scene and taken to hospital. Their injuries were not life-threatening. The fighting was thought to have broken out within the protesting group.
Protesters opposing Iran’s clerical leadership had gathered outside the embassy in west London since Sunday, hanging up flags from the nation’s ousted monarchy alongside some Israeli flags.
They support the exiled Reza Pahlavi, son of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s pro-Western monarchy toppled by the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

UK withdraws embassy staff from Tehran

Photos published by The Telegraph showed two men receiving medical attention on the road beside the encampment.
One more man was arrested on suspicion of breaching the ban on protest outside the embassy after the altercation.
Meanwhile, The UK said Friday it had withdrawn its embassy staff from Iran on the eighth day of the war with Israel, as the US mulled whether to enter the conflict.
“Due to the current security situation, we have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw our UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

• Age limit to be fully removed from July 2026; quality standards to remain mandatory
• 40pc regulatory duty to end by 2029  • Panel sends its proposals to Senate
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb informed a parliamentary committee on Friday that restrictions on commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old will be lifted from September, in line with an International Monetary Fund condition and as part of a tariff strategy to gradually phase out overprotected sectors.
As of July 1, 2026, the age limit for importing used cars and vehicles will be lifted entirely. However, while age restrictions will end, strict compliance with quality standards will remain mandatory.
Although the matter was not listed on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue’s agenda, the minister disclosed the government’s four-year roadmap for used vehicle imports, which aims to align tax treatment for used and new vehicles.
 
 

The committee meeting was chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
The committee concluded its morning session by addressing pending agenda items, while the evening session focused on finalising recommendations to be presented in the Senate on Saturday.
Used vehicle imports
The finance minister announced that Pakistan will resume commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old, signalling a major shift in trade policy. He noted that the move could enhance the competitiveness of the auto sector and increase access to imported vehicles for the middle class, as the country fulfils its global fiscal obligations and adapts to evolving domestic demand.
Currently, commercial imports are restricted, even for cars that are just a month old. Under the Baggage Rules, only vehicles up to three years old — and up to five years for categories other than cars — are permitted for import by overseas Pakistanis under certain conditions.
 
 

Commerce ministry officials briefed the Senate committee that by the first quarter (July-September) of the new fiscal year, the government will issue a notification allowing commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old.
These imports will be subject to a 40 per cent regulatory duty in addition to existing duties and taxes on new vehicles. From July 1, 2026, this duty will be gradually reduced: to 30pc in 2026, 20pc in 2027, 10pc in 2028, and fully eliminated by July 1, 2029. There will be no restrictions on importing any type of used vehicles, including heavy bikes.
It remains unclear whether the additional regulatory duty will apply to cars and other vehicles up to five years old imported under the Baggage Rules — specifically the Transfer of Residence and Gift schemes. Currently, the Baggage Rules permit the import of cars up to three years old and other vehicles up to five years old, subject to certain conditions.
It was clarified that vehicles brought in under the baggage scheme will require a minimum overseas residency of 700 days to qualify for exemptions.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, imports of used vehicles will continue to be subject to environmental and quality standards. However, from July 2026, while the age limit will be lifted for commercial imports, quality requirements will remain in force.
 
 

Currently, new car imports attract high duties and taxes. As part of ongoing tariff reforms, these levies will be reduced over the next five years, eventually capping at a maximum of 15pc. By the end of this period, the phased reduction of duties on new vehicles and the gradual removal of additional regulatory duties on used vehicles will be aligned.
Public Finance Management Act
Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee rejected the finance ministry’s proposed amendments to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), arguing that existing legislation already empowers institutions through parliament.
The ministry was directed to return with a formal draft of the revisions.
Finance ministry officials disclosed that when funds were requested from the Port Qasim Authority, the request was denied and the ministry was advised to contact the relevant department. A follow-up letter received no reply.
During proceedings, Senator Anusha Rahman sought clarification on the terms “surplus profit” and “idle cash”. Officials explained that surplus profit refers to annual financial gains, while idle cash denotes unutilised funds held in accounts during the fiscal year.
Senator Rahman recommended that companies be included within the scope of the PFMA alongside autonomous bodies — a suggestion the ministry accepted.
Meanwhile, the FBR provided an update on ongoing customs reforms to the committee.
The Member Customs Operations rep­orted that customs duties have been red­u­ced on 35pc of tariff lines, while new duty slabs of 5pc, 10pc and 15pc are being proposed to replace the existing 3pc, 11pc and 16pc tiers.
Additionally, duties will be eliminated on 916 more tariff lines, raising the total number of zero-rated lines to 3,117.

• Exclusive clubs charging Rs1m or more membership fees brought under tax net
• Arrest powers of tax officials curbed; prior approval and inquiry mandatory
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Friday rejected a proposal to fix a uniform rate for rental valuation of commercial properties, while endorsing another measure to expand the tax net to high-end clubs nationwide and reinforce safeguards against tax fraud.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance resumed deliberations on the Finance Bill 2025 on Friday, as Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and his team addressed queries raised by committee members. The session was chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, who provided input on various provisions of the Bill.
On the issue of a uniform 4 per cent rental valuation rate on commercial properties, MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig urged the tax authority to lower the proposed rate, a suggestion FBR chairman countered by insisting the rate could not be reduced.
 






Mr Rashid noted that under the existing arrangements, tax officers held discretionary power to determine rental valuations. “If the committee is unwilling to delegate authority of the uniform rate, we are prepared to withdraw the proposal altogether,” said the FBR Chairman.
MNA Usama Mela said that a 4pc rate might be feasible in urban centres but would pose challenges for rural areas.
The FBR chairman responded that the system should be allowed to operate for one fiscal year and, if ineffective, adjustments could be made in the subsequent fiscal year’s budget. He emphasised that FBR’s property valuations are significantly more accurate than traditional Deputy Commissioner (DC) rates and noted the law allows room for further revisions.
MNA Naveed Qamar echoed the need for flexibility, suggesting that adjustments could be made where rates appear excessive.  However, FBR officials announced the withdrawal of the proposed measure following resistance from committee members.
Elite clubs and e-commerce
The FBR chairman informed the NA committee that clubs charging Rs1 million or more for membership — including the prestigious Islamabad Club — will now be brought within the income tax net. These clubs will be required to file detailed income and expenditure statements, aligning with broader fiscal transparency objectives.
 
 

Mr Rashid said the move targets exclusive membership facilities that have so far operated outside formal tax oversight. “Only clubs demanding at least Rs1m for new memberships will fall under this new compliance regime,”, the chairman clarified.
MNA Muhammad Mobeen Arif also voiced concern over low taxation on e-commerce, warning of potential misuse. He stated that FBR will levy 1pc tax on online sales compared to 5pc on shopkeepers. The FBR chairman clarified that a team is working to identify the disparity.
The committee considered the proposed amendments to The Stamp Act 1899. After detailed deliberations, the committee recommended that the amendments, as revised and proposed by the committee, be passed by the Assembly.
The committee considered the proposed amendments to The Registration Act 1908. At the very outset, the ministry expressed its intention to withdraw the said amendments. Accordingly, the committee acceded to the request and allowed the withdrawal.
The committee examined the proposed amendments to The Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. After detailed deliberations, the committee approved certain proposed amendments and suggested additional corrections and revisions to several clauses. Due to paucity of time, the committee deferred consideration of the remaining provisions of the Bill to the next meeting.
Tax officials’ arrest powers
State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani declared on the floor of the National Assembly that arrests at the inquiry stage in sales tax cases will no longer occur.
Acting on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directives to address business community concerns, the government has amended arrest clauses in sales tax laws based on recommendations from Farooq H. Naik and the standing committee.
He further said that key changes include no arrests for sales tax fraud below 50 million. Mandatory approval from a three-member FBR committee before any arrest, ensuring citizen protection. Individuals accused of sales tax fraud will now be guaranteed a right to a hearing. The discretionary arrest powers previously held by tax officials have been revoked, he further clarified.
 
 

Earlier, FBR issued a statement to clear its position on the legal provisions for the arrest of those involved in tax fraud, which have already been provided under Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act 1990 along with an elaborate procedure to be followed after the arrest which involves intimating the Special Judge immediately and the production of such person before Special Judge within 24 hours.
However, the proposed amendment now restricts the powers of the officer to arrest by making a prior inquiry after approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR). Only based on the findings of the inquiry will CIR authorise the investigation, which would give the investigation officer the powers of an officer in charge of a police station under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898). The arrest can only be made with the prior approval of CIR if the investigation officer has reasons to believe that a tax fraud may have been committed by a person.
The new legal provision further provides that if the arrest is mala fide, the matter will be referred to the Chief Commissioner for fact-finding inquiry. This shows that in contrast to the earlier provision where an Assistant CIR could arrest an offender, the new provisions bring transparency in the process by a mandatory prior inquiry and investigation and finally permission by the CIR.
Moreover, certain changes and amendments are also necessary to reassure the compliant taxpayers that the state deals with those evading taxes or involved in tax fraud with an iron hand.

“Present a business plan for PNSC within two weeks, which should include a strategy to save the annual $4 billion burden on the national exchequer,” PM Shehbaz directed the authorities while presiding over a high-level meeting regarding matters related to the corporation.
The prime minister also directed the authorities to acquire ships on lease to expand the PNSC fleet.
“Due to a reduced number of ships in the PNSC fleet, the country has to spend approximately $4bn annually from the national exchequer on maritime trade.”
 






The prime minister was informed that PNSC currently possessed 10 ships of various types, with a combined cargo-carrying capacity of 724,643 tonnes.
The meeting was attended by Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and senior PNSC officials.

• Includes $6.89bn in fresh inflows; rest are rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia and UAE
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan secured nearly $20bn in foreign loans and grants during the first 11 months (July-May) of 2024-25, surpassing the annual target of $19.2bn set for the fiscal year ending June 30.
Almost half of this amount comprised legacy rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, while fresh loans and grant inflows totalled $6.89bn — about 9pc lower than the same period last fiscal year.
According to the Economic Affairs Division’s (EAD) monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Friday, the total FEA during July-May stood at $6.89bn, compared to $7.55bn in the corresponding period of last year, against a target of $19.4bn for 2024-25 and $17.6bn last year.
This figure does not include approximately $2bn received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in two tranches under the ongoing $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which is recorded separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
Including rollovers and IMF disbursements, total external assistance reached $20bn during the 11-month period. This comprised $3bn each in rollovers from Saudi Arabia and China, and $2bn from the UAE. Pakistan’s total annual rollover portfolio from these three countries stands at approximately $12.7bn in the form of safe deposits and loans, leaving net international reserves (NIR) at around $3bn.
 
 

The EAD noted that inflows of foreign economic assistance dropped by 8.7pc to $6.89bn, largely due to delays in the IMF programme, which caused many commercial lenders to remain cautious. In comparison, inflows during the same period last year totalled about $9bn, including IMF funds.
In May alone, the EAD reported inflows of $797m, up from $576m in April, $555m in March, $237m in February, and $830m in January.
Of the $6.89bn received, around $3.9bn was allocated for budgetary support or programme loans, while $2.98bn was directed toward project financing. During the same period last year, project aid stood at $2.56bn and programme loans at $4.99bn.
Multilateral lenders contributed $3.37bn in the first 11 months of 2024-25, compared to $3.14bn last year. Bilateral disbursements declined sharply to $487m, down 45pc from $889m in the same period last year.
The EAD reported receiving approximately $903m from foreign commercial lenders based in the UAE, indicating a slight rebound from last year when commercial financing had nearly dried up. However, this is well short of the $3.8bn target set for the year, reflecting the continued impact of the delayed IMF programme, challenging economic conditions, and associated credit rating concerns.
The government had also aimed to raise $1bn through international bonds and projected $9bn in inflows from China and Saudi Arabia, including a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn in SAFE deposits from China. These funds are vital to bridging Pakistan’s external financing gap under the IMF programme.
In addition, Pakistan received $1.77bn from overseas Pakistanis via Naya Pakistan Certificates, up from $1.05bn in the same period last year. The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.39bn during the period, up from $766m a year earlier, while the World Bank contributed $1.23bn.

Wana Police Spokesperson Habib Islam told Dawn.com: “The attack took place after 11am, as a result of which one child was killed while five people were injured.”
Makin Station House Officer Abdul Qadir Mehsud also confirmed the drone attack and told Dawn.com locals have set a date for June 23 to hold a jirga with the higher authorities regarding law and order, in which they have invited people belonging to every school of thought.
KP MPA Asif Khan Mehsood told Dawn.com that the alleged incident involved a drone which “targeted school children,” although it was not known whether the drone was Pakistani or from another country.
PTI MNA Zubair Khan Wazir strongly condemned the incident. “Targeting innocent schoolchildren is a deeply distressing and unforgivable act,” he said in a statement on social media.
“This is a grave incident that warrants a thorough and impartial investigation so that the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
The incident was condemned by other politicians from the province as well, such as Afrasiab Khattak and Mohsin Dawar.
Last month, seven minors were among 22 people injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil.
The incident came within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing on May 27 that they had ended their protest after reaching an agreement with the local administration.
In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.
An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district killed one person and injured three others in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.</p><small>2025-06-21 04:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/21034204fdaa0b3.jpg?r=034245' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to recommend Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for ‘decisive diplomatic intervention’ in India-Pakistan crisis</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistani government has decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during the recent India-Pakistan crisis.
The move by Pakistan was another indication of improved bilateral ties with the US.
In a post shared on X, the government said the international community had “bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly”.
Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan “launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  — a measured, resolute, and precise military response”, the post read.
It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country’s “fundamental right to self-defence” and “carefully to re-establish deterrence”, defending its “territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm”.
The post further read that “at a moment of heightened regional turbulence”, President Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”.
It continued that the US president “de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond”.
“This intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump’s] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,” it added.
 
 

The government also acknowledged President Trump’s “sincere offers” to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan — an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.
“Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,” it observed.
The government noted that President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis “manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building”.
In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump’s “earnest efforts” will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating escalation involving Iran.
Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.
However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained in a recent conversation with US President Donald Trump that a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press statement.
Army chief interacts with DC Beltway think tanks
 

Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Munir interacts with representatives of US think tanks and strategic affairs institutions in Washington, DC. — ISPR

A day ago, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Munir had an interaction in Washington, DC, with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions.
The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests and economic interdependence”, ISPR said in a statement.
That talk followed Field Marshal Munir’s meeting with Trump over a luncheon, becoming Pakistan’s first serving army chief to hold a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
Evaluating the Pakis­tan-US partnership, Field Marshal Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development,” according to ISPR.
The army chief also highlighted Paki­stan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.
He also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.
During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.
He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.
The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.
He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”.
His remarks come amid heightened tensions in the Middle East as the Israel-Iran conflict escalates and the US weighs possible military intervention.
 
 

Participants noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”, the ISPR said.
“The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step towards enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.
The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, ISPR noted.</p><small>2025-06-21 04:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6855f053a5952.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918631/direction-of-travel-is-downwards' target='_blank'><strong>‘Direction of travel’ is downwards</strong></a><br><p>TWO days after the federal budget was announced by the finance minister, the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Report 2025 revealed that Pakistan was ranked last amongst 148 countries.
This is an absolutely extraordinary situation for Pakistan and its women, especially when these findings disclosed that this score had actually deteriorated consecutively over the last two years showing a continuous and consistent downward trend in the gender parity ratio.
Since this information was revealed after the finance minister’s budget speech, he could be forgiven for not knowing about the dismal status of women in Pakistan — although in one of his press conferences he did say that he had been aware of the state of Pakistan’s economy for the last 11 years or so. How anyone can be aware of Pakistan’s economy and not know of the status of its women is difficult to imagine.
 
 

While the finance minister could have feigned ignorance about the deteriorating status of women in Pakistan, he certainly knew about the recent data from the World Bank regarding Pakistan’s poverty rate. This data has revealed that nearly half of Pakistan’s population is below an internationally comparable poverty line. Importantly, here again data shows that the population under each poverty line has increased over the last few years, implying that poverty is growing despite claims that the economy has ‘improved’.
And for those in extreme poverty in Pakistan, the numbers have actually increased by more than threefold, from under five per cent to 16.5pc. Again, the ‘direction of travel’ — a term used by the finance minister to reassure us that the economy is improving — clearly and alarmingly shows it is headed downwards.
Almost every commentary on and appraisal of the recent budget has been either critical and negative, or an outright rejection. Analysts and commentators from differing persuasions have pointed out that this budget is a poor reflection of where the economy is and, more importantly, of the direction of travel needed over the next few years.
Given the huge array of numbers and accounting identities in the budget document, it is best to identify just a handful to underscore the complete disregard towards the people of this country.

Poverty is not just visible, it is also growing despite all claims that the economy has stabilised and improved.

Pakistan has a particularly poor savings rate of just 14pc, one reason why the investment-to-GDP ratio continues to be much lower than comparable countries. China’s savings rate is 44pc, India’s 29 and Bangladesh 25, much of which explains high investment, and hence growth, in these countries.
 
 

Savings need to be encouraged in order for growth, and not have an additional tax imposed raising the tax from the already very high 15pc to 20. The climate crisis is probably Pakistan’s most urgent potential catastrophe already unfolding and all measures to reverse such trends need to be at the top of the agenda for every government. The 18pc sales tax imposed on solar panels is anti-people and anti-environment, and perhaps some pressure has prevailed to lower this to a still unacceptable 10pc.
With poverty not just visibly evident but growing despite all claims that the economy has stabilised and improved, even a symbolic increase in raising the minimum wage in Pakistan would have shown that the finance minister was aware of the poor state of the people. While the salaries of government servants were increased by 10pc and those of parliamentarians and ministers many times that, perhaps increasing the Rs37,000 minimum wage to at least Rs45,000 would have brought some cheer to an over-taxed budget.
Tax, tax and more tax — this has been the mantra of this and every government when the budget is made under the tutelage of the IMF. Tax everything which is productive so that people emigrate and feel disheartened to expand and innovate.
 
 

On the one hand, the government dreams of IT exports of $25 billion over the next few years; on the other, it taxes freelancers and those who are actually innovating and bringing much-needed foreign exchange at a time where remittances exceed all exports. Such contradictory and counterproductive measures bode ill for Pakistan. If tax is the major concern, perhaps income and wealth taxes on retail, real estate and agricultural incomes would have been more appropriate. The imperative is to tax those who don’t pay, or avoid paying income tax, not those who continue to be over-taxed.
The other contradictions galore in the budget pertain to the knowledge economy. The federal higher education budget has fallen in real terms over the last few years, and the removal of the 25pc tax rebate given to teachers and researchers — many (possibly a majority) of whom may be women — in colleges and universities, has been removed.
With manufacturing and agriculture all showing negative growth — the ‘direction of travel’ here being downwards — the discouragement for the knowledge economy, for IT, and especially for women, stands out as a callous and an unsympathetic effort by someone who claims to know the economy for a dozen years.
 
 

In many years, if not decades, Pakistan is in a particularly fortunate space.
The military and civilian governments are no longer on the ‘same page’, but are one and indistinguishable from each other. The economy has indeed stabilised and inflation has fallen. Political opposition for now is in disarray and even the government is more stable than it has ever been. Surprisingly, for once Pakistan is being seen in a very positive light internationally with President Donald Trump praising Pakistan at the expense of India, and even having lunch with Pakistan’s field marshal.
Such a fortuitous combination is unprecedented. For precisely these reasons, for once, Pakistanis anticipated a brave, bold, imaginative, creative, future-oriented budget, which would ensure that the direction of travel would be aggressively upwards.
Sadly, this budget is distinctly anti-growth and anti-poor — for both women and men — and reflects very poorly on the how the future is being imagined. If ever there was a wasted opportunity, it is now.

“We are now focused on expanding the tax net, and that process is actively underway,” he remarked while addressing concerns expressed by lawmakers, straddling the political divide, during a parliamentary panel review of proposals in the Finance Bill 2025-26.
The proposals recommend spending curbs on compliant taxpayers. They also recommend empowering the taxman to take harsh action against tax cheats and their abettors, which ranges from barring them from operating bank accounts to arresting them. The FBR has purportedly made these proposals to improve tax enforcement and compliance to boost revenue recovery. Mr Aurangzeb has already warned that the nation should be ready for additional taxes of Rs400-500bn to meet the IMF-mandated target for the next fiscal year in case parliament does not give its assent to the proposals.
 
 

Some of the new powers suggested are indeed draconian and not needed. However, the pushback from lawmakers on the proposal restricting tax filers or eligible persons from making any purchases exceeding 130pc of the assets declared in their previous wealth statement is not understandable. The call for increasing this limit to 400pc of the declared wealth amounts to a new amnesty for tax cheats.
Behind this demand appears to be the country’s powerful real estate lobby that has reaped vast profits from the previous amnesty scheme under Imran Khan’s government in 2020. After all, in Pakistan, real estate has always been the first stop for dirty money, irrespective of its source. In fact, Pakistani lawmakers should focus on building a system of checks and balances to prevent the misuse of some of the powers the FBR is seeking for enforcement, instead of pleading the tax evaders’ case.
Tax amnesty, in any form, is a bad idea as it encourages evasion and theft besides discriminating against honest taxpayers. At the same time, the minister also needs to be reminded that he needs to walk the talk on massive tax exemptions of Rs5.84tr, up by 51pc from last year’s Rs3.88tr, which the government has allowed to various sectors.
 
 

There is no doubt that exemptions to certain sectors or taxpayers are necessary for equity and growth. However, the rapid increase in tax revenues has been lost to exemptions in the last few years. This alarming situation cannot be justified on any count, especially at a time when the brunt of the revenue burden is being shifted onto compliant taxpayers such as the corporate sector and salaried individuals.
The lawmakers have this opportunity to debate the finance bill threadbare and to try and fix the broken tax system rather than advocating for new amnesties.

The announcement came after the inaugural meeting of the Bangladesh-China-Pakistan Vice Foreign Minister/Foreign Secretary mechanism on Friday.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said the meeting was attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, Bangladesh’s acting Foreign Secretary Ruhul Alam Siddique and Pakistan’s Additional Foreign Secretary Imran Ahmed Siddiqui.
 






Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch joined the initial session via video link.

New trilateral forum looks to enhance engagement, work for more trade, investment

In her remarks, Ms Baloch expressed Pakistan’s desire for a deeper engagement between China and South Asian countries.
She highlighted the “upward trajectory of bilateral ties” with both China and Bangladesh and “conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to work with the two nations to enhance ties in trade and investment, agriculture, digital economy, environment protection, marine sciences, green infrastructure, culture, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The three nations agreed to establish a joint working group to oversee the implementation of the agreements reached during the talks.
The launch of this trilateral platform marks a notable development in the South Asian geopolitical landscape, particularly as it brought together Pakistan and Bangladesh, which had remained diplomatically distant for decades.
The relations between Islamabad and Dhaka have warmed considerably since the ouster of former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina last year.
Under the interim leadership of Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Dhaka has actively pursued broader diplomatic horizons, including a new phase of engagement with both China and Pakistan.
China, for its part, has sought to deepen its influence in South Asia through economic diplomacy and regional connectivity initiatives.
Mr Yunus’s state visit to Beijing in March and Bangladesh’s invitation to China to invest in sensitive infrastructure projects such as the Teesta River and Mongla Port suggest a policy shift away from Ms Hasina’s India-leaning approach.
 
 

Meanwhile, Pakistan and Bangladesh have resumed direct trade, military exchanges, and high-level diplomatic dialogue after more than a decade of minimal contact.
For Beijing, the growing trilateral ties advance its long-term regional objectives that relate to building alternate economic corridors, expanding its presence in the Bay of Bengal, and diminishing India’s strategic space in the neighbourhood.
For India, the formation of a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh alignment could pose significant diplomatic and security concerns, particularly as some of the proposed Chinese-supported infrastructure projects lie close to India’s sensitive northeastern corridor.
While the trilateral mechanism remains in its formative stages, the institutionalisation of these ties signals a deliberate attempt by the three countries to explore long-term cooperation beyond bilateral engagements.
 
 

The grouping could evolve into a new regional bloc with implications for South Asian geopolitics, especially if the partnership expands to include broader connectivity, defence dialogues, and coordinated positions at international forums.
No specific timeline was announced for the next round of meetings, but the establishment of a joint working group is expected to accelerate follow-up discussions and cooperation across multiple sectors.

• Unicef warns of drought conditions developing in the besieged enclave
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said 31 Pales­tinian aid seekers were among at least 60 people killed Friday by Israeli forces, the latest in a string of deadly incidents near aid distribution sites.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that five people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 26 others near a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli-controlled strip of land that bisects the Palestinian territory.
Thousands of Palestinians have gathered there daily in the hope of receiving food rations, as famine looms across Gaza after more than 20 months of war.
The Israeli army said that its troops in the Netzarim area had first fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them.
 


When the individuals continued advancing, “an aircraft struck and eliminated the suspects in order to remove the threat,” the army said.
Similar incidents have occurred in that area regularly since late May, when the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation opened its distribution centres, as Israel eased a two-month aid blockade.
The privately run foundation’s operations in Gaza have been marred by chaotic scenes. UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with it over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
Elsewhere in the territory on Friday, Bassal said 14 people were killed in two separate strikes in and around the central city of Deir el-Balah, and 13 others in three Israeli air strikes in the Gaza City area.
One of those strikes, which killed three people, hit a phone charging station in the city, Bassal said.
In southern Gaza, two people were killed “by Israeli gunfire” in two separate incidents, he added.
Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.
‘Israel using hunger as a weapon’
In a statement on Friday, the Hamas group, which says Israel is using hunger as a weapon against the population of Gaza, accused Israel of systematically targeting Palestinians seeking food aid across the enclave.
Meanwhile, Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, warned in Geneva of drought conditions developing in Gaza.
“Children will begin to die of thirst … Just 40pc of drinking water production facilities remain functional,” Unicef spokesperson James Elder told reporters. “We are way below emergency standards in terms of drinking water…”
Unicef also reported a 50pc increase in children aged six months to five years admitted for treatment of malnutrition from April to May in Gaza, and half a million people going hungry.
Elder, who was recently in Gaza, said he had many testimonials of women and children injured while trying to receive food aid, including a young boy who was wounded by a tank shell and later died of his injuries.
A lack of public clarity on when the sites — some of which are in combat zones — are open is causing mass casualty events, he added.
Al-Quds Brigades said on Friday it had targeted an Israeli military post in the southern city of Khan Yunis, claiming “dead and wounded” Israeli troops as a result. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military did not comment.
Much of Khan Yunis, like vast areas across Gaza, is under Israeli military evacuation orders.

• PPP lawmaker calls for creation of South Punjab province
ISLAMABAD: Like every year, the National Assembly on Friday once again echoed with the familiar demand for creating new provinces in the country during the general debate on the federal budget.
Taking part in the debate on the budget for the next fiscal year, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf forcefully demanded carving out Hazara province in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa whereas PPP’s Syed Murtaza Mahmud called for bifurcating Punjab to create South Punjab province.
“I demand that wherever it is administratively viable, new provinces should be created in the country. Hazara province as well as other provinces should be made to resolve the public issues and to meet people’s needs,” declared the minister who belongs to the ruling PML-N.
He accused the provincial PTI government of neglecting Hazara region in general and Mansehra in particular, alleging that the people of the area were being deprived of their fundamental rights. He said Mansehra had a population of more than 300,000 people who do not even have access to clean drinking water.
“The PTI’s provincial government is least interested in provision of basic facilities to the people of Mansehra,” he went on saying, while stressing the need for creating Hazara provinces.
Drawing attention of the house towards the ongoing movement for the Hazara province in KP, he said the only solution to the country’s problems was the creation of new provinces.
He further said the main purpose of the parliament was to discuss the problems of the people and suggest their solutions.
Similarly, participating in the budget debate, PPP MNA from Rahim Yar Khan Murtaza Mahmud urged all the political parties to sit together to discuss formation of South Punjab province in order to remove the sense of deprivation among the people of the region.
 
 

Mr Mehmud said that presently Punjab comprised 60 per cent of Pakistan because of which “anti-Punjab slogan has become popular in smaller provinces”. He was of the view that South Punjab province was necessary for Pakistan.
On June 17, PPP’s Abdul Qadir Gilani had also decried the Punjab government’s discriminatory policy towards south Punjab, stating that sense of deprivation was increasing among the people in the region.
He had regretted that only three development schemes had been announced for the region whereas some 40 plans had been announced for Lahore and central Punjab.
“I don’t know when will we get rid of Takht-i-Lahore [Lahore Kingdom]? But we will continue our struggle,” said Mr Gilani, who is the son of Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, in an apparent reference to the demand for a separate South Punjab province.
He praised the previous PTI government for setting up South Punjab Secretariat in Bahawalpur, urging the government to make it functional.
Meanwhile, taking part in the budget debate, PTI’s Junaid Akbar Chaudhry, who is also the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), criticised the government’s economic policies.
In an apparent reference to the party’s stance that the previous elections were heavily rigged, the PTI leader said the treasury benchers knew that those who counted votes were more important than those who polled the votes, adding that “they also know that those who have brought them into power, can bring them into power again.”
Mr Chaudhry claimed that the courts had become redundant as they had been unable to deliver justice after the 26th Constitutional Amendment and went on suggesting conversion of courts’ buildings into universities.
Arrest powers
Earlier in the day, Minister of State for Finance and head of the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit Bilal Azhar Kayani addressed the National Assembly, in which he responded to the criticism on the government’s move to empower tax officials to make arrests at the inquiry stage in sales tax cases.
The minister said that for the first time in the parliamentary history, the budget had been minutely discussed in the NA Standing Committee on Finance. He said the finance minister and the officials of the ministry regularly attended meetings of the committees of both the houses of the parliament.
Mr Kayani claimed that economic stability had been achieved while fulfilling IMF conditions and simultaneously providing public relief. He said the National Tariff Policy would be a cornerstone of PM Shehbaz Sharif’s vision to boost exports and drive economic growth.
He expressed the hope that the current IMF programme would be Pakistan’s last one, once the economy achieved sustainable growth and became self-reliant through dollar-earning exports.
The National Assembly will now meet on Monday morning.

• Bench ‘realised pressure endured by PTI members’, rectified situation, argues Salman Akram Raja
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s order in the reserved seats case amended the Constitution as it altered the constitutional deadline of three days for independent lawmakers to join a political party, Justice Musarrat Hilali has remarked.
The court’s order on July 12, 2024 — more than five months after the general elections on Feb 8 — allowed 41 PTI-backed independent lawmakers to confirm their political affiliation in 15 days.
Justice Hilali made these remarks on Friday while hearing appeals filed against last year’s order.
She also asked Salman Akram Raja, who was representing PTI lawmaker Kanwal Shauzab, to comment on this constitutional amendment.
Mr Raja disapproved of the impression, saying the situation under which PTI contested last year’s elections was “something where the party had to swim through a river of fire and blood”.
The counsel explained the July 12 verdict did not extend the time period to 15 days from the statutory three days. Rather, it stated that these 41 out of 80 candidates should be considered to have been backed by PTI from the very beginning.
The verdict realised the “pressures endured by PTI members” and the court decided the only way to rectify the situation was to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 66 of the Elections Rules, the counsel explained.
Through the judgement, 41 members were asked to notify through affidavits to which party they belonged within 15 days. However, the candidates were never asked to join PTI, the counsel argued.
The entire electoral process, Mr Raja emphasised, was a fundamental right exercised through articles 17(2) and 19 of the Constitution.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, another bench member, asked Mr Raja whether PTI was claiming entitlement to reserved seats in parliament.
 
 

“Do you think it is the right of any political party to claim reserved seats?” asked Justice Najafi.
The counsel retorted it was the right of the people to ensure that reserved seats were allocated as per the proportionate representation system.
The Constitution mandated parliament to be filled with representatives chosen by the people of Pakistan, the counsel contended.
“If elections were not fair, then why has the Supreme Court not struck them down?” questioned Justice Najafi.
The counsel said it could have been done so but the Supreme Court exercised restraint.
On constitutional deviations, Mr Raja said, it was for the first time in history a — major — political party was de-legitimised by not allowing it to contest the election.
Therefore, the majority of judges in the July 12 judgment recognised that constitutional deviation was committed on account of effective de-recognition of PTI as a political party, which resulted in certain consequences.
Mr Raja defended PTI members, saying that to blame them for committing mistakes by identifying themselves as independent candidates and then deliberately joining the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) gives and impression that everything else was alright.
 
 

He added that 11 out of 13 judges on the bench that heard the case last year “ignored fictitious facts” produced before the court that PTI committed errors by joining SIC and contesting elections as independents.
All but two judges embraced the reality that PTI as a party contested and in fact won seats during the general election and therefore was entitled to reserved seats of women and non Muslims, the counsel emphasised.
When asked by Justice Jamal Mandokhail whether the Election Commission’s decision to allocate reser­ved seats to the Baloch­is­tan Awami Party after the 2018 general elections was right or wrong, Mr Raja replied that in his view, the decision could not be called “wrong”.
The members who contested the election as independents should not be forced to join a party that they did not intend to join before the election, said Mr Raja.

Lawmakers in the lower House of Commons chamber voted 314 in favour to 291 to send the proposal to the upper House of Lords for further scrutiny following four hours of emotional debate.
The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside parliament who say legalised euthanasia will give people with an incurable illness dignity and choice at the end of their lives.
But opponents attending a neighbouring counter-protest said they feared vulnerable people could be coerced into dying and urged lawmakers to focus on improving palliative care instead.

Outcome sparks celebrations among supporters outside parliament

The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults who have been given less than six months to live.
They would have to be able to administer the life-ending substance themselves, and any patient’s wish to die would have to be signed off by two doctors and a panel of experts.
A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying, including Belgium and the Netherlands.
‘Heartbreaking stories’
Labour MP Kim Lead­beater, who proposed the legislation, told Friday’s so-called third reading debate that a law change would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” for terminally ill people.
She said maintaining the status quo would mean more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations”.
 
 

But Vicky Foxcroft, also of Labour, said the proposal did not include adequate safeguards for disabled people.
“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn’t value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she pleaded.
Outside parliament, protesters waved placards with slogans including “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers”.
David Walker, 82, said he supported changing the law because he saw his wife of 60 years suffer for three years at the end of her life.
“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.
But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, said she feared the legislation would open “slippery slope” where those eligible for assisted dying expands.
“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients… are vulnerable,” she told AFP.
Public support
MPs in the 650-seat parliament backed an earlier version of the proposed legislation by 330 to 275 votes at an initial vote in parliament last November, a larger majority than Friday’s 23.
Since then the bill has undergone several changes, including applying a ban on adverts for assisted dying and allowing all health workers to opt out of helping someone end their life.
MPs added a safeguard which would prevent a person being eligible “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking”, ruling out people with anorexia.
Britain’s medical community and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s top ministerial team are split on the proposed law change. Starmer voted in favour, while his health and justice secretaries opposed it.
But in a YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, surveyed last month and published Thursday, 73 per cent or respondents backed an assisted dying law.
“Change is coming,” hailed Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the Dignity in Dying campaign group.
But Catherine Robinson of Right To Life UK insisted the bill “still faces an uphill battle” to get through the Lords and her opposition campaign group “will be fighting it at every stage” to prevent it becoming law.
The House of Lords now needs to approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or the bill will fail.
If it passes and receives royal assent, it would still be four years before an assisted dying service was implemented.
 
 

A government impact assessment published this month estimated that approximately 160 to 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, rising to a possible 4,500 in a decade.
Assisted suicide currently carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Separate legislation is going through the devolved Scottish parliament.
At the end of March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.

The COAS, who visited Washington earlier this week, was invited to a luncheon at the White House and discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during a “cordial” meeting with Trump, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
Field Marshal Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the PM’s conversation with Washington’s top diplomat was described as “warm and cordial”, with the discussion revolving around key bilateral and regional issues.
“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the recent meeting between President Trump and … Field Marshal Asim Munir, in Washington, terming it productive and cordial,” the report read.
“The prime minister conveyed his best wishes for US President Donald Trump, lauding his bold leadership and commending Secretary Rubio’s diplomatic efforts that facilitated a ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India,” PTV News reported. “He emphasised that this understanding averted a potential catastrophe between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.”
 
 

The PM was also quoted as saying that Trump’s “positive remarks” about Pakistan were encouraging for lasting peace in the region and reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to resolve disputes with India — namely the Kashmir issue, the Indus Waters Treaty and counter-terrorism — through dialogue.
Discussing security, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and counter groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“Secretary Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and assured full US cooperation in addressing these threats,” PTV News reported.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for Pakistan and the US to enhance collaboration in sectors including trade, investment, energy, mining, rare earth minerals and information technology.
“Both sides agreed that their discussions should now lead to concrete action across multiple areas of mutual interest. To further strengthen ties, the prime minister emphasised the importance of frequent high-level exchanges,” PTV News reported, adding that the PM extended an invitation to Trump and Rubio to visit Pakistan.
“Secretary Rubio expressed appreciation for the call and reaffirmed the US’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Pakistan,” PTV News said. “He praised Pakistan’s adherence to the ceasefire with India and its continued efforts for peace in the region, especially given its close ties with Iran.
“Rubio affirmed Washington’s intent to work closely with Islamabad to promote regional and global peace and stability.”
Pakistan has been steadily improving ties with the US.
Earlier this week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their economic partnership as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on reciprocal tariffs through constructive engagement.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.
“The government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,” he said. “We have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards [a] competitive economy.”
In March, it was announced that Pakistan and the US would hold a counter-terrorism dialogue in June.
This was agreed during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. During the meeting, Pakistan-US relations, matters of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation were discussed in detail.
Bilawal lauds Trump’s talks with army chief
In his remarks on the recent conflict with India, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who was addressing a crowd in Karachi upon his return from a foreign diplomatic tour, said, “For the first time in history, the leader of Pakistan’s army, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has a meeting with Trump at the White House.”
Bilawal questioned India’s claims, saying, “If Pakistan is ‘terroristan’ [and] involved in terrorism, then what is our military leader doing in Washington?”
He said, “What does the field marshal’s meeting at the White House signify then?” adding, “Is the general of a failed nation called there? No.”
“This highlights that India lost the war and Pakistan won the war. The talks were a congratulatory meeting,” he added. “I consider this a success for Pakistan by the US.”

As relations between Russia and the Taliban government have been improving, an Afghan delegation is visiting Russia’s main economic conference in St Petersburg this week, meeting Russian agriculture officials.
“Afghanistan is definitely aiming for self-sufficiency in its agricultural products. However, we still rely on some food items that come from Iran, and if problems arise there, it will undoubtedly have its effects,” Ataullah Omari said on the sidelines of the conference.
Iran supplies Afghanistan with some dairy products, among other commodities, and there is widespread concern that the week-old war between Israel and Iran could disrupt trade flows.
Russia — the world’s largest wheat exporter — and Kazakhstan are the main suppliers of wheat and flour to Afghanistan. Russia is also supplying sugar and vegetable oil.
Omari said that the country is now seeking wheat rather than flour from Russia.
Afghanistan, the top buyer of Russian flour in 2024, increased its own wheat production by 10 per cent last year to 4.83 million metric tonnes. The country’s total wheat consumption is estimated at 6.8m metric tonnes a year.
“For the past four years, since the withdrawal of the Americans, we have been making efforts to provide our essential food supplies ourselves. The remaining amount, including flour and wheat, is supplied annually by Russia,” Omari said.
“We have requested that Russia send us wheat instead of flour. Additionally, the import of other products that come from Russia to our country annually is progressing well,” he added.
In April, Russia lifted its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated as a terrorist organisation for more than two decades, paving the way for Moscow to normalise ties with Afghanistan’s leadership.
Since 2022, Afghanistan has imported gas, oil, and wheat from Russia, marking the first major economic deal after the Taliban returned to power, facing international isolation following 20 years of war against US-led forces.
Omari expressed concern about Afghan refugees living in Iran who could become victims of Israel’s attacks. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that nearly 4.5m Afghan nationals reside in Iran.
“Any kind of damage that occurs there is absolutely unsatisfactory for our nation and our people, especially for many of our refugees who live there and are our brothers,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-20 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/201704313e38ea7.jpg?r=170722' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918424/police-book-2-suspects-for-gang-rape-of-social-media-influencer-in-kps-haripur' target='_blank'><strong>Police book 2 suspects for gang-rape of social media influencer in KP’s Haripur</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police have filed a case against two suspects for allegedly gang-raping a 26-year-old social media influencer in Haripur district by luring her on the pretext of a job, it emerged on Friday.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed on the woman’s complaint at Haripur district’s Khanpur Police Station a day ago under Sections 34 (common intention), 376 (punishment for rape), 392 (punishment for robbery) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation; If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said the incident occurred in Khanpur tehsil on Wednesday at 8pm.
The victim, who hails from Taxila, said she was “contacted by the suspect through her TikTok account and offered a job at a hotel in Khanpur”.
She added, “The suspect called me for an interview. When I reached the bus stop, they picked me up in their car and drove a few miles away, where they forced me to strip at gunpoint.”
The FIR said that an unknown man was driving the car, with the other suspect sitting in the front seat. It added that the two suspects subsequently raped her and later fled with her mobile phone, Rs3,000 and a gold pendant after leaving her on the side of the road.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Earlier this month, Hafizabad police launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in the district and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.
The previous month, a stage actress was gang-raped by four suspects near Nishtar Chowk, Sadiqabad.
In March, Punjab police arrested three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore.</p><small>2025-06-20 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2022085901e015b.jpg?r=220956' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918495/12th-polio-case-of-this-year-reported-in-kps-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>12th polio case of this year reported in KP’s Bannu</strong></a><br><p>A new case of wild poliovirus was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, taking the national tally to 12, the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) said in a press release on Friday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
Federal Minister for Health, Mustafa Kamal, on Thursday claimed that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.
According to the press release, the 33-month-old boy from Bannu’s Shamsikhel Union Council is the sixth case of polio reported from KP this year.
“To date in 2025, Pakistan has reported a total of 12 cases of polio, including six from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the laboratory said.
The regional laboratory noted that the southern districts of KP remain areas of concern due to limited access and challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination.
“These barriers result in missed opportunities, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated and vulnerable to poliovirus,” the statement read.
“The Polio Eradication Programme urges all parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of polio vaccine,” it added. “Each dose strengthens immunity and offers lifelong protection. Community engagement and support remain critical to stopping the transmission of poliovirus once and for all.”
Polio is a paralysing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children with high immunity against this terrible disease.
The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third immunisation drive of the year against the crippling disease last month at the National Emergency Operations Centre in Islamabad.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.</p><small>2025-06-20 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20185212ea443b4.jpg?r=185219' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918442/byc-members-continue-hunger-strike-against-leaders-detention-in-balochistans-kech' target='_blank'><strong>BYC members continue hunger strike against leaders’ detention in Balochistan’s Kech</strong></a><br><p>Members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s (BYC) Kech chapter continued their hunger strike for a second consecutive day on Friday, protesting the alleged  “illegal detention” of their leaders and the “extrajudicial arrests of Baloch citizens”.
BYC chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were arrested on March 22 for “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
They were sent to jail under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordnance, which empowers authorities to “arrest and detain suspected persons”. Mahrang and the other activists remain incarcerated.
The Kech chapter launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club on Thursday, according to the group’s X account.
“Despite the blistering 50°C heat, members of the Baloch nation are courageously participating in the hunger strike,” the BYC wrote in a post. “Their message is clear: protect and save BYC leaders and stand united against injustice.”
During the protest, the BYC alleged in posts that the demonstration had been disrupted by police and “traffic accidents”.
“For the third time, traffic accidents damaged the camp. If anyone gets injured, police authorities will be held responsible,” the BYC wrote, enclosing a video of the demonstration along the side of the road.
 






In April, Mahrang and other BYC leaders launched a hunger strike to protest alleged “torture” by jail staff, as well as the transfer of activist Beebow Baloch to district jail Pishin.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Earlier this month, Mahrang moved the Supreme Court against the Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) May 22 order that dismissed constitutional petitions challenging her detention and that of two other Baloch leaders.
In May, Amnesty International and four other human rights organisations had called on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent.</p><small>2025-06-20 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20182442fe633aa.jpg?r=190010' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918447/three-tourists-die-after-glacial-slide-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwas-naran-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Three tourists die after glacial slide in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Naran: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Three tourists lost their lives on Friday after they were buried under a glacial slide in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mansehra district, according to officials.
Mansehra Rescue 1122 spokesperson Amir Khadam Khan told Dawn.com that the incident occurred near Sohni Waterfall in the Naran area.
“[The] tourists, hailing from Lahore, were taking selfies near the glacier when it slid down, burying them underneath.”
He added that the bodies of the tourists were recovered from the glacier and moved to a nearby hospital, where they were identified as 35-year-old Mohammad Tahir, 22-year-old Mohammad Tayyab, and 13-year-old Abubakar.
Adviser to Chief Minister KP on Tourism, Zahid Chanze,b extended his condolences to the bereaved families and said, “Arrangements were being made to dispatch the bodies to Lahore.”
In a statement, he urged tourists to avoid taking selfies near dangerous spots and glaciers, saying glaciers were rapidly melting due to the hot weather.
He also said that they would launch a campaign across the province for the tourists to adapt and abide by safety precautions while visiting the places.
Last month, four tourists from Gujrat who went missing in Gilgit-Baltistan on May 16 were found dead at the bank of the Indus River near Istak village in Skardu’s Roundu valley.
In March, a UN report warned that rapidly melting glaciers and snow have imperilled the global ecosystem and billions of people who rely on freshwater from these sources.
The report said glaciers were at extreme risk due to global warming, pollution, and unsustainable human activities, and if not properly managed, they could become a source of perpetual conflicts.</p><small>2025-06-20 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20181037a5cc7e4.jpg?r=191136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918449/govt-signs-45bn-loans-with-local-banks-to-ease-power-sector-debt' target='_blank'><strong>Govt signs $4.5bn loans with local banks to ease power sector debt</strong></a><br><p>The government has signed term sheets with 18 commercial banks for a Rs1.275 trillion Islamic finance facility to help pay off the mounting debt in its power sector, Power Minister Awais Leghari said on Friday.
The government, which owns or controls much of the power infrastructure, is grappling with ballooning circular debt, unpaid bills and subsidies that have choked the sector and weighed on the economy.
The liquidity crunch has disrupted supply, discouraged investment and added
to fiscal pressure, making it a key focus under the $7 billion IMF programme.
“Finding funds to plug the gap has been a persistent challenge, with limited fiscal space and high-cost legacy debt making resolution efforts more difficult. Eighteen commercial banks will provide these loans through Islamic financing,” Power Minister Awais Leghari told Reuters.
“It will be repaid in 24 quarterly instalments over six years.”
The facility, structured under Islamic principles, is secured at a concessional rate of three-month KIBOR minus 0.9 per cent — a formula agreed on by the IMF.
Leghari said it will not add to the public debt. Existing liabilities carry higher costs, including late payment surcharges on Independent Power Producers (IPPs) of up to KIBOR plus 4.5pc, and older loans ranging slightly above benchmark rates.
Meezan Bank, HBL, National Bank of Pakistan and UBL are among the banks participating in the deal, he said.
The government expects to allocate Rs323bn annually to repay the loan, capped at Rs1.938tr over six years.
The agreement also aligns with the government’s target of eliminating interest-based banking by 2028, with Islamic finance now comprising about a quarter of total banking assets.</p><small>2025-06-20 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/201157053fa6e18.png?r=190734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382/coas-munir-stresses-potential-for-broader-multidimensional-ties-with-us-built-on-mutual-respect' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‘broader, multidimensional’ ties with US built on mutual respect</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with the United States, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
COAS Munir is on a five-day official visit to the US, where he met with President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — also the intelligence chief — has accompanied Field Marshal Munir.
COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the “comprehensive and candid exchange”, ISPR added.
The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence”, the statement said.
 
 

Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Field Marshal Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development”.
In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.
The army chief also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”, the statement added.
He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict with India and “elaborated on Pakistan’s perspective on terrorism”.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly noted that Pakistan lost 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.
During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.
He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.
The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.
 
 

He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the Israel-Iran war as the US weighs whether to intervene militarily or not.
Participants, the ISPR said, noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”. “The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.
The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, the military’s media wing noted. It reflected the country’s “commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue”.</p><small>2025-06-20 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20175937604442c.png?r=181551' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918448/pakistan-down-france-3-2-in-penalty-shoot-out-to-reach-fih-hockey-nations-cup-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan down France 3-2 in penalty shoot-out to reach FIH Hockey Nations Cup final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan qualified for the finals of the FIH Hockey Nations Cup after defeating France on Friday in the first semi-final match in Kuala Lumpur.

Earlier in the month, the government claimed to have dismantled an international child exploitation network operating out of a so-called gaming club in Muzaffargarh, where children aged six to 10 were lured, abused and filmed for the sake of selling their videos on the dark web.
“Several children were sexually abused and filmed in Sardarabad village,” a police statement said today.
The matter came to light when one of the victims contacted the police. According to the statement, the suspect had been blackmailing the children using compromised videos.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was lodged at Saddar police station in Muzaffargarh district under section 292 (sale, distribution, and public exhibition of obscene material) and section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a boy was sexually abused and filmed by his older brother’s former employer when he went to collect his brother’s pending wages. The older brother had previously worked for the suspect as an animal caretaker.
The statement added that the Sadar police station has arrested the suspect, while the victims were being contacted for legal action.
In Pakistan, the punishment for sexually abusing a minor can range from seven years to life imprisonment, while rape of a child carries the death penalty or life term. Laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act, 2020 were enacted to address rising cases of abuse, strengthen penalties, and ensure timely action. Offences related to child pornography are punishable by up to 14 years in prison, along with hefty fines.
 
 

Despite existing laws, cases of child sexual abuse continue to surface across the country.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ’Cruel Numbers 2024’ by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.
In April, Punjab police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p><small>2025-06-20 09:06</small></div><hr>
