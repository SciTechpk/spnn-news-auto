A high-level Pakistani delegation — consisting of two former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York on Sunday for consultations at the United Nations.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Sherry Rehman, Jalil Abbas Jilani, Teh­mina Janjua, Mussadik Malik, Khurram Dastgir, Bushra Anjum Butt and Faisal Sabzwari comprise the delegation.
The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council, and will address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) envoys.
The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations. Their focus will be on conveying Pakistan’s concerns about regional security and responding to what it calls India’s “escalatory moves”.
This outreach is part of a dual-track strategy involving both official and informal engagements.
Another formal delegation from Islamabad — expected to be led by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal — is also due soon for trade-related discussions with US officials.
On the Indian side, a parallel delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is also due in Washington on June 3, while Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri concluded a three-day official visit this past week.
 
 

“This is no longer just about border skirmishes,” a senior Pakistani diplomat said. “This is about shaping the international narrative to reflect ground realities.”
In Islamabad, there is growing concern that New Delhi has moved swiftly to frame the conflict in a way that revives scrutiny of Pakistan in multilateral bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the UN. Pakistan’s counteroffensive seeks to prevent what it sees as an Indian effort to turn the recent crisis into a long-term diplomatic liability for Islamabad.
“This is a political campaign masquerading as financial oversight,” said one Pakistani official, referring to India’s push to revisit Pakistan’s FATF status. “We exited the grey list in 2022 after implementing a comprehensive reform programme. There is no technical basis for reopening that file.”
Former diplomats in the delegation stress that Pakistan’s approach centres on transparency, restraint and reform. “We responded with maturity when provoked. That’s the story we are telling here — with facts, not slogans,” said one member.
Senator Sherry Rehman, who is also part of the visiting delegation, emphasised that Pakistan is advancing its own priorities while actively responding to Indian narratives.
“We have our own agenda to advance, but yes, when Indian allegations are brought up, make no mistake — we will use forensic chapter and factual verse. Myth will not be allowed to become the message on Pakistan this time,” she said.
Dar-Lammy call
Separately, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy agreed to strengthen cooperation in multilateral forums, particularly at the United Nations Security Council.
The understanding came during a conversation between the two diplomats, following Lammy’s recent visit to Pakistan — his first official trip — during which he met senior officials amid heightened tensions with neighbouring India.
The two sides also agreed to remain in contact and meet again on the sidelines of high-level UN events scheduled in New York later this month.

Local importers and exporters have been protesting against what they call the exploitative policies of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
A local PML-N leader said the federal government — led by his party — was not serious in addressing the protesters’ demand.
 
 

The sit-in against the revenue body entered its third day at Gulmat Nagar on Sunday.
The protesters have vowed the road connecting Pakistan with China will remain closed to traffic till the acceptance of their demands.
Thousands of passengers and tourists remained stranded on both sides of the road for many hours, with long queues of vehicles seen on both sides on Sunday.
‘Economic murder’
The call for protest was issued by the Pak-China Traders Action Comm­it­tee, an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Impor­ters and Exporters Asso­ciation; Gilgit-Nagar Cham­ber of Commerce; and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit.
On Sunday, people from all walks of life participated in the sit-in.
Meanwhile, various delegations of traders, scholars, civil society members from Hunza, Nagar, Gilgit and other areas joined the protesters. The protest leaders, Abbas Mir, Ebad Nagari, Muhammad Ismail and others, said thousands of protesters had been sitting on the road for the past three days but the authorities were reluctant to listen to their genuine grievances.
They lamented GB has “no industry” or employment opportunities in the private sector. The trade activity between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass was the biggest source of income for locals, they added.
They added people affiliated with this trade — transporters, shopkeepers, labourers, customs clearance agents, hotel owners, small businessmen — have been jobless for the last seven months due to the suspension of trade at Khunjerab Pass.
They said protesters have been demanding the clearance of over 240 consignments stuck at Sost Dry port for the past last seven months under a one-time amnesty scheme, as traders cannot afford billions of rupees in losses.
They said the policies of FBR and Customs at Sost Dry Port “economically murdered” locals.
They claimed that locals with border passes were not allowed to import items from China and the barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan and Xinjiang province of China has been suspended.
The traders called for the facilitation of barter trade between GB and Xinjiang under the 1985 border agreement.
Additionally, seized counterfeit items at Sost Dry Port should be destroyed or auctioned within GB, the protest leaders demanded.
GB has a disputed status, yet local traders are paying all taxes and customs duties on imported goods.
Failed talks
Addressing the protesters, the president of PML-N Nagar chapter, Javed Hussain, said the federal government was “not serious in settling the issue”.
Mr Hussain, also a former member of GB Assembly, said trade policies at other ports of the country have been relaxed beca­use “people of those areas have representation in parliament”.
“GB people have been paying all taxes, yet the FBR is reluctant to clear their consignments.
He said no taxation without representation was a universal law and the people of GB were neither given representation in parliament nor exemption from taxes.
“The government of Pakistan even gave amnesty to high-profile terrorists. So, giving a one-time amnesty to clear 250 consignments after paying taxes was not a big demand,” he said
GB Home Minister Shams Lone, assembly member Ayub Waziri and other officials met the protesters and tried to convince them to end the protest. However, the talks failed to produce results.
The government delegations told the protesters that their demands were “genuine” and supported by the GB government.
They added that the issues were related to the federal government, and the chief minister has already sent recommendations to Islamabad.
Muhammad Ali Quaid, special assistant to chief minister, told the media that the GB government has no power to solve the demands of the protesters.
He said the issue will be discussed in the upcoming meeting of the apex committee, including civil and military leaders.

• Punjab minister plays down claims, says PP-52 constituents ‘expressed full confidence’ in CM Maryam
NAROWAL/GUJRAT: As the PML-N candidate seemed poised to clinch the by-election on a provincial assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin, rival candidates alleged interference by the ruling party to manipulate results with the help of the administration and police on Sunday.
The balloting remained peaceful throughout the day, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
By the time this report went to press, unofficial results indicated that PML-N candidate Hina Arshad Warraich had clinched the seat with 78,702 votes against PTI-backed independent candidate Fakhir Nashat Ghumman’s 39,018 votes.
 
 
,

In a statement, PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Ms Warraich on her victory and thanked the people of Sialkot for reposing trust in the party.
The PP-52 seat had fallen vacant after the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich about two months ago.
Apparently for security reasons, the local administration had placed containers in front of the returning officer’s (RO) office – a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the RO’s office in Sambrial.
The local administration said the containers had been present outside the office since the start of the voting process and that the office wasn’t sealed after the polling.
PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, while speaking to media persons in Sambrial, said that polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
He said if results were changed, that would be unfortunate, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said he wanted to bring the matter to the notice of the chief election commissioner, saying it was not tolerable that alleged rigging took place during the by-election.
Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
On the other hand, PTI leader Usman Dar alleged that the PTI voters, supporters and polling agents were expelled from different polling stations by the police to favour the ruling party’s candidate. Responding to the PTI and PPP allegations, Punjab Infor­mation Minister Azma Bukhari said that the people of Punjab had expressed full confidence in Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in the Sialkot by-poll held on Sunday.
In an apparent reference to the PPP, she said even the party that got 400 votes was complaining abo­ut rigging. In a jibe at the PTI, she said that those who use words like ‘deals and NRO as weapons’ were now seeking deals themselves.
In a presser in Islamabad, the PTI accused the Punjab government and police of interfering in the by-poll, claiming that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the by-election was rigged because the Punjab government was aware that it would not be able to win without manipulating the polling. He claimed that there were a large number of people in rallies and public meetings, due to which the Punjab government was sure that it stood no chance in the by-election.
“To win the election, PTI polling agents were forcefully removed from the polling stations, and then ballot papers were stamped and polled. Workers of the PML-N were allowed to remain in the polling stations, while our polling agents were told to leave. We have video evidence of all that,” he claimed.
Sheikh Waqqas alleged that pol­ice officials were openly supporting the PML-N workers and threatening the PTI workers. He alleged that workers of PTI, who refused to leave, were beaten and thrown out of polling stations. He clai­med that the helpline of the Elect­ion Comm­ission of Pakistan had become inaccessible during the polling.

• Trump’s envoy terms Hamas demand for changes to ceasefire proposal ‘unacceptable’
CAIRO: An Israeli attack near an aid distribution point in Gaza killed as many as 31 Palestinians on Sunday, local health authorities said.
The incident in Rafah is the latest in a series of Israeli attacks on aid delivery to Gaza, following the easing of an almost three-month Israeli blockade last month.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medical teams had recovered the bodies of 23 Palestinians and treated another 23 injured people near the aid collection site in Rafah.
Earlier, the Palestinian news agency WAFA put the number of deaths at 30.
Local health authorities said at least 31 bodies had so far arrived at Nasser Hospital.
Residents and medics said Israeli soldiers fired from the ground at a crane nearby that overlooks the area, and a tank opened fire at thousands of people who were en route to get aid from the site in Rafah.
Reuters footage showed ambulances carrying injured people to Nasser Hospital.
Israel’s military said in a statement it was looking into reports that Palestinians had been shot at an aid distribution site, but that it was unaware of injuries caused by military fire.
The US-based Gaza Humani­tarian Foundation (GHF), which operates the aid distribution sites in Rafah, denied anyone was killed or injured near its site in Rafah and that all of its distribution had taken place without incident.
But the Gaza government media office has accused Israel of turning the distribution sites into “death traps” for people seeking aid.
“We affirm to the world that what is taking place is a deliberate and malicious use of aid as a ‘weapon of war’, employed to exploit starving civilians and forcibly gather them at exposed killing zones, which are managed and monitored by the Israeli military,” it said.
Reda Abu Jazar said her brother was killed as he waited to collect food at an aid distribution centre in Rafah.
“Let them stop these massacres, stop this genocide. They are killing us,” she said, as Palestinian men gathered for funeral prayers.
The Red Crescent also reported that 14 more Palestinians were injured on Sunday by Israeli fire near a separate site in central Gaza.
Ceasefire talks falter
Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering of a new Arab and US mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli prisoners held in Gaza by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails.
 
 

Hamas said on Saturday it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable.”
On Sunday, dozens of Pales­tinians marched at the funeral of a Gaza doctor, Hamdi Al-Najjar, who was critically injured late in May in an air strike that killed all but one of his 10 children.
Najjar died late on Saturday.
“We could die any time, but we are still staying in our land, remaining to work to do our duty towards our people,” said Mohammed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals.
The Israeli military has confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Younis that day, but said it was targeting suspects in a structure that was close to Israeli soldiers.
The military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the military had evacuated civilians from the area before the operation began.
Israel began its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as prisoners into Gaza.
Israel’s campaign has devastated much of Gaza, killing over 54,000 Palestinians and destroying most buildings.
Much of the population now lives in shelters in makeshift camps.

The call followed a rally by PM Narendra Modi in the opposition-ruled state, where CM Banerjee urged him not to exploit the sindoor, sacred to conservative Hindu women, to extract political benefit.
 
 

“You seem to be treating all Hindu women as your spouse,” CM Banerjee had said, asking the prime minister to apply the vermilion powder that depicts a woman’s married status to his wife.
Earlier, the chief minister had disallowed Yusuf Pathan, a former cricketer, from being included in the Indian squads traveling across the world to canvass support for India’s issues with Pakistan.

Amit Shah assails Mamata Banerjee over her criticism of Modi; calls for her ouster in next year’s polls

She had said it was the party’s prerogative to choose who should go. A bevy of Muslim men have been included in the diplomatic squads to showcase India’s secularism, des­c­r­i­bed as phony under Mr Modi’s watch.
On Sunday, Amit Shah launched a blistering attack on Ms Banerjee, accusing her of “stooping low” by opposing Operation Sindoor and the Waqf Amendment Act to appease the Muslim vote bank, and alleged that the Murshidabad riots were “state-sponsored”, The Hindu reported.
Addressing party leaders and workers in Kolkata, Mr Shah gave a clarion call to uproot the All India Trinamool Congress government from power in the 2026 assembly elections.
There is widespread belief that the uptick in conflict with Pakistan was timed to milk narrow nationalism for elections due in Bihar in October; that’s where Modi headed after the Pahalgam killings on April 22.
Ms Banerjee had recently accused the Centre of politicising Operation Sindoor for electoral gains.
Mr Shah alleged, without showing any evidence, that Pakistan-backed terrorists killed innocent citizens in front of their families after asking them about their religion.
Turning his attention to the Murshidabad violence that erupted during protests over the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, Mr Shah alleged that it was “state-sponsored”.
“The way a TMC minister incited the violence, it can be said that the Murshidabad riots were State-sponsored, which caused injustice to the Hindus…Mamata Banerjee’s minister abused the BSF, and the party’s leaders were standing there and encouraging the rioters,” he claimed.
“If BSF personnel had been deployed, Hindus would have been protected. It was only after BJP workers approached the high court that the BSF was finally sent in,” Mr Shah said.
The home minister also accused the ruling party of facilitating illegal cross-border movement from Bangladesh.
“The Bengal elections will not only decide the future of the State, but it is also linked to the security of the country. Mamata Banerjee has left Bengal’s borders open for Bangladeshis. Infiltration is taking place with her blessings. Only the BJP government can stop this,” he claimed.

• All fuel stations may be legally required to offer digital payment modes
• Manufacturers, importers may charge extra 2pc GST on cash sales
• Emphasis will be on low-cost digital options instead of costlier POS systems
• Minor tax rate cut expected for salaried class
ISLAMABAD: As part of its strategic direction to declare ‘war on cash’, the federal government is likely to introduce differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital payments across various sectors, including fuel pricing, in the upcoming budget.
This is going to be the most crucial step among many other things that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has been hinting at in recent days and may unveil during his budget speech on June 10.
According to sources, the next year’s budget would also be envisaging lower tax rate on the salaried class — though by a tiny margin of 1 to 1.5 percentage points — under strict directions of the prime minister to give a message that the government is at least beginning to ease burden where tax rates are too high, even if it is unable to reduce them significantly.
Sources also said that policymakers had already been working on the technical and administrative aspects of the move to support the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which has failed miserably so far to document retail businesses in a manner that could yield revenue outcomes over the past two decades, despite repeated attempts and models.
 
 

The finance minister is believed to have held at least three successive consultative sessions with the FBR, the Ministry of Petroleum, banks, financial institutions, and a few hired or co-opted consultancy firms to explore technical solutions.
The campaign against the cash-based economy would work both ways — from top-down and bottom-up — to encourage and compel both consumers and businesses to reduce costs for documented transactions and increase expenses for cash. It aims to gradually shift the economy from low-cash to eventually cashless, where technically feasible.
An official said that all petrol pumps across the country — from Chaman to Khyber and Karachi to Azad Kashmir — would be required by law to provide digital options, including QR codes, debit and credit cards, and mobile payment services, in addition to cash.
The government-notified petroleum prices would apply only to digital transactions, while cash sales would involve an additional cost of about Rs2-3 per litre.
Consumers would be free to conduct cash transactions at a higher rate, but would be encouraged to opt for digital payments instead.
“This is a regulated environment and implementable at the outset,” the official said, adding that this would also help track petroleum supplies from borders and ports to refineries and depots.
On the other hand, importers and manufacturers would have to charge a standard 18 per cent general sales tax on digital payments from their suppliers or retailers, with an additional 2pc GST applicable on sales settled in cash.
Extra cost
“If wholesalers, distributors and retailers are ready to pay higher tax and their customers are willing to absorb the additional cost, it’s their choice, but it will involve substantial finances,” an official said.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial, when approached for comment, said only: “We must move towards a cashless economy,” but declined to elaborate ahead of the budget announcement.
Sources said the new initiative might appear synonymous with the filer and non-filer categories for banking transactions — a policy that did not yield desired results given its limited scope. However, the new policy is likely to have far greater outreach, capturing even small and informal business transactions through a carrot-and-stick approach.
The Finance Bill 2025-26 would provide a piece of legislation under which every business — big or small — would be required to offer cash and digital options. The cash transaction would carry an additional tax or fee compared to digital payments.
Unlike digital options like point-of-sale systems, which involve additional expenditure in the form of POS machines, payments under the upcoming scheme will also be available through simple QR codes and other digital solutions. Countries like India, Indonesia, and Bangla­desh have reportedly achieved landmark successes in this regard.
Another official said the FBR has been unable to persuade major businesses — including event managers, jewellers, marriage halls, and many professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and beauty salons — to shift away from cash to digital solutions.
At a pre-budget meeting last week, Finance Minister Aurangzeb promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and the documented sector to others through digitisation. He hinted at significant steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
At a public event the same week, he also announced that the upcoming federal budget would introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction.
Earlier, he announced the government’s “war on cash” as part of a strategy to tap into over Rs9.3 trillion in circulation and maximise revenue potential. He has been talking about maximum utilisation of technology, end-to-end digitisation and auditing towards this end besides simplifying processes.
The finance minister also put on record some time ago that non-filers and under-filers were evading taxes of around Rs1.3tr at the individual level. “We must declare war on cash if we aspire to join the G20 (a group of major economies),” he said, adding that it was only possible when transactions are documented.
According to the minister, Pakistan’s economy was potentially valued at more than $700 billion — significantly higher than the current estimate of $410bn — leading to over Rs7tr in annual tax evasion. “We will ensure this documentation,” he promised.
On the petroleum side, the government introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly last month to digitally track petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration. The practice causes massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually, besides affecting the environment and vehicle engines.
The dual-pricing mechanism in the upcoming budget is expected to complement that legislative move and provide end-to-end traceability across the fuel supply chain.

• Hasina’s trial over ordering mass killings kicks off
• Top court overturns ban on Jamaat-i-Islami
DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday began issuing new banknotes removing images of its founding president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, whose trial on charges of orchestrating crimes against humanity also commenced in her absence.
The caretaker government, which has run the South Asian nation of some 170 million people since Ms Hasina fled last year, introduced the currency changes as it navigates a volatile political landscape.
Ms Hasina, 77, was overthrown in August 2024 following a student-led uprising.
“Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,” Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan said.
Until now, all notes featured the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971 and was assassinated in a 1975 coup.
New designs for the Muslim-majority nation include images of Hindu and Buddhist temples, historical palaces, artwork by the late painter Zainul Abedin depicting the Bengal famine, and the national martyrs’ memorial.
On Sunday, notes for three of the nine denominations were released. “The new notes will be issued from the central bank’s headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,” Khan added, noting that “other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases.” Existing notes and coins will remain legal tender.
This is not the first time banknote designs have reflected political shifts.
Initial 1972 notes featured a map, later replaced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s image during periods led by his Awami League party. When the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party was in power, historic sites were featured.
‘Systematic attack’
Meanwhile, at the opening of Ms Hasina’s trial, prosecutors alleged she orchestrated a “systematic attack” to crush the uprising that toppled her.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 during her government’s crackdown, according to the United Nations.
Ms Hasina, in self-imposed exile in India, has defied an extradition order and rejected the charges as politically motivated.
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures linked to Ms Hasina’s ousted government and her now-banned Awami League party.
“Upon scrutinising the evidence, we reached the conclusion that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” ICT chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told the court.
Mr Islam lodged five charges each against Ms Hasina, ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun (in custody) and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal (on the run), including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder”.
‘Not an act of vendetta’
Prosecutor vowed impartiality, saying, “This is not an act of vendetta but a commitment to the principle that, in a democratic country, there is no room for crimes against humanity.”
Investigators have reportedly collected extensive evidence, including video footage and Ms Hasina’s phone conversations.
The prosecution alleged Ms Hasina ordered security forces to crush protesters, including directing them to open fire from helicopters, and specifically ordered the killing of student protester Abu Sayeed. They say such acts are tantamount to “crimes against humanity”.
The ICT court opened its first trial connected to Ms Hasina’s government on May 25. In that case, eight police officials face charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters on August 5, the day that Ms Hasina fled the country. Four of the officers are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
JI’s registration restored
On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-i-Islami, allowing it to participate in future elections.
The court overturned a 2013 high court order, initiated under Ms Hasina’s government, that had banned the party. “The Election Commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,” commission lawyer Towhidul Islam told AFP.
The party’s lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the decision would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multi-party system.” Ms Hasina had banned Jamaat-i-Islami, rivals of her father, and cracked down on its leaders. The Awami League itself was banned in May by the interim government, pending the outcome of trials against Hasina and other leaders.

Haris, playing in his 17th T20I, carted seven sixes and eight boundaries in his 107 off just 46 balls as Pakistan chased down a challenging 197-run target in 17.2 overs for their first home T20I series win in three-and-a-half years.
Pakistan won the first two matches by 37 and 57 runs at the same venue.
Parvez Hossain smashed four sixes and seven boundaries in his solid 34-ball 66 to lift Bangladesh to 196-6 in their 20 overs.
Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan for one in the first over, but Haris, whose hundred came up off 45 balls, added 92 for the second wicket with Saim Ayub and an unbroken 60 for the fourth with Salman Agha, who made 15 not out.
Ayub hit four sixes and two boundaries in his 29-ball 45 while Hasan Nawaz scored 13-ball 26 as the home batters enthralled a near-capacity 30,000 crowd at Gaddafi Stadium.
Earlier, Parvez shared a 110-run opening stand with Tanzid Hasan (32-ball 42 with three sixes and as many boundaries) after the tourists were sent in to bat.
The Parvez-Tanzid stand gave Bangladesh an ideal start for their highest T20I total against Pakistan, beating the 175-6 they made against them at Pallekele in 2012.
Towhid Hridoy, who scored 25 from 18 balls with a six and two boundaries, then added 49 for the third wicket with Litton Das, who made 22.
Fast bowlers Abbas Afridi (2-26) and Hasan Ali (2-38) were the pick of the home bowlers.</p><small>2025-06-01 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/012310214efea4d.jpg?r=231639' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914783/us-china-trade-row-could-ease-after-trump-xi-talks-treasury-chief' target='_blank'><strong>US-China trade row could ease after Trump-Xi talks: Treasury chief</strong></a><br><p>United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that President Donald Trump could speak with China’s Xi Jinping “very soon” and that such a call could help break the logjam in the trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies.
Trump on Friday accused Beijing of violating a deal reached last month in Geneva — negotiated by Bessent — to temporarily lower staggeringly high tariffs they had imposed on each other, in a pause to last 90 days.
China’s slow-walking on export license approvals for rare earths and other elements needed to make cars and chips have fueled US frustration, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday — a concern since confirmed by US officials.
But Bessent seemed to take the pressure down a notch, telling CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’ that the gaps could be bridged.
“I’m confident that when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out,” Bessent said, noting that China was “withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement.”
When asked if rare earths were one of those products, Bessent said, “Yes.”
“Maybe it’s a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it’s intentional. We’ll see after the president speaks with” Xi, he said.
On when a Trump-Xi call could take place, Bessent said: “I believe we will see something very soon.”
Since Trump returned to the presidency, he has slapped sweeping tariffs on most US trading partners, with especially high rates on Chinese imports.
 


New tit-for-tat levies on both sides reached three digits before the de-escalation this month, where Washington agreed to temporarily reduce additional tariffs on Chinese imports from 145 per cent to 30pc. China, meanwhile, lowered its added duties from 125pc to 10pc.
In an interview with ABC’s ‘This Week’, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said China was “slow-rolling the deal,” adding: “We are taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation.
“Our president understands what to do. He’s going to go work it out,” Lutnick said.</p><small>2025-06-01 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/012215088a7c626.jpg?r=223656' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914774/coas-munir-vows-to-crush-indian-sponsored-terrorists-with-support-of-baloch-tribal-elders' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir vows to ‘crush Indian-sponsored terrorists’ with support of Baloch tribal elders</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has vowed to “crush” terrorists in Balochistan, stating that India’s involvement in terrorism in the country’s largest province was “no longer hidden”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
His comments came during a grand jirga in Quetta on Saturday, organised to interact with tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with particular focus on terrorists receiving support from India. The COAS and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif delivered speeches and interacted with tribal elders.
In April, at least six people, including three students, lost their lives and over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar. Following the attack, the military accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Reaffirming that the enemy’s “nefarious designs will fail”, the field marshal said: “It is an open malicious act of terrorism waged on our people, our progress, and our peace. Pakistan has concrete evidence of India’s involvement with terrorist networks in Balochistan.
“The Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the nation and the brave Baloch people, will confront and crush every enemy, foreign or domestic, that dares to challenge our sovereignty.”
Stating that Pakistan was ready to respond to any act of aggression, the field marshal said, “Peace in Balochistan is non-negotiable and that the future of Pakistan is directly linked to a stable, prosperous Balochistan.”
Earlier during the event, PM Shehbaz underscored that terrorist groups under the umbrella of Fitna Al Hindustan sought the support of locals, which must be denied to them.
“Indian-sponsored proxies operating in Balochistan have intensified their efforts to undermine peace, destabilise the province, and disrupt development initiatives led by the Government of Pakistan and the Armed Forces,” PM Shehbaz emphasised.
The prime minister reiterated the need for engagement at the grassroots level and ensuring that terrorists find no social space.
The tribal elders agreed to stand “shoulder-to-shoulder” with the government and the armed forces, reaffirming their commitment to the security, stability, and development of the province.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p><small>2025-06-01 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01221106f361b0c.jpg?r=222620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Delegation presenting Pakistan’s stance on escalation with India to land in New York tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, along with a nine-member high-level parliamentary delegation, will visit New York tomorrow on a two-day visit to present Pakistan’s perspective on the recent military clash with India and counter New Delhi’s disinformation campaign on the conflict.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with the neighbouring country. He entrusted PPP Chairman Bilawal to lead the delegation.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
According to Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), the delegation members would conduct several meetings, including with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang, and the ambassadors of permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Besides these meetings, the delegation will also brief the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) members at the UN, the report said.
Bilawal, along with other members of the delegation, would interact with media representatives after the visit.
The visit follows a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
As New Delhi launched air strikes in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-06-01 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/012213279f00211.jpg?r=221518' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914772/motor-racing-piastri-wins-in-spain-angry-verstappen-demoted' target='_blank'><strong>Motor racing-Piastri wins in Spain, angry Verstappen demoted</strong></a><br><p>Formula One leader Oscar Piastri won the Spanish Grand Prix from pole position in a McLaren one-two with Lando Norris on Sunday while Max Verstappen was demoted from fifth to 10th for a late collision with George Russell’s Mercedes.
Piastri beat teammate and title rival Norris by 2.471 seconds for his fifth win in nine races this season, and McLaren’s seventh, to stretch his championship lead to 10 points.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc completed the podium after passing Verstappen’s Red Bull six laps from the end of a race that saved the drama to the end.
“It’s a nice way to bounce back from Monaco. A superb weekend,” said Piastri, who finished third last weekend in a race won from pole by Norris.
Verstappen, who made four stops in total and ended up fighting on the slower hard tyres against rivals with softs, collided with Leclerc and then twice with Russell after a safety car restart with six laps to go.
“I’ve seen those sort of manoeuvres before on simulator games and go-karting but never in F1,” said Russell, who has had clashes before with four times world champion Verstappen.
“I don’t really know what was going through his mind.”
Penalty points
Nico Rosberg, Mercedes 2016 world champion and now a pundit for Sky Sports television, said Verstappen should have been black-flagged for what looked to him like intentional retaliation for the earlier contact.
The 10-second penalty was added to Verstappen’s time post-race, with the driver also given three penalty points to take his total tally to 11 for the 12 month period - one step from a one-race ban.
Verstappen and Leclerc also faced a post-race investigation for their clash.
“I tried to push him to the left, there was a bit of contact but fortunately no consequences,” said Leclerc.
Verstappen claimed the Monegasque had rammed into him and should have given back the place.
Russell finished fourth after eventually being let through by Verstappen, who was incensed to be told to do so but reluctantly obeyed.
Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg finished a surprising and morale-boosting fifth for the future Audi team after passing Ferrari’s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton on the penultimate lap.
Hamilton was a disappointing sixth, Isack Hadjar seventh for Racing Bulls and Pierre Gasly eighth for Renault-owned Alpine.
Ferrari moved up to second from fourth in the constructors’ standings, now 197 points behind McLaren.
Verstappen remained third in the drivers’ championship but now 49 points behind Piastri in what is becoming a McLaren battle.
First points
Home hero Fernando Alonso scored his first points of the season with Aston Martin, who had only one car on the grid due to Lance Stroll’s withdrawal through injury after Saturday’s qualifying.
Piastri led away at the start with Verstappen seizing second from Norris while Hamilton and Leclerc moved up to fourth and fifth as Russell lost out.
Hamilton let Leclerc through on lap 10 of 66 after the two Ferraris had run nose to tail.
Norris took back second place from Verstappen on lap 13, the Dutch driver making no attempt to defend against the quicker McLaren and pitting in the next lap for fresh tyres.
Verstappen took the lead again on lap 23 after Piastri pitted, with Norris making his first stop on lap 21 and coming out behind the Red Bull, but that lasted only until Verstappen pitted for a second time on lap 30.
He came in for a third stop on lap 47 but Norris pitted the lap after to defend second place.
A safety car deployment on lap 55, after Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli beached his Mercedes in the gravel, bunched up the field and triggered a rash of stops.
The McLarens came in together for fresh tyres, double-stacking, and resumed ahead of Verstappen who questioned the switch to a set of hards but was told that was the only option available.
“That safety car just came at the wrong time,” he said. “On the straight, I got driven into already and then into Turn One as well. Then they told me to give the position back.”</p><small>2025-06-01 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01175409c1f884a.jpg?r=175621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914758/jui-fs-fazl-assails-child-marriage-law-announces-protest-rallies-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F’s Fazl assails child marriage law, announces protest rallies across country</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday rejected the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025, announcing nationwide protest rallies aimed at “creating awareness” among the public.
The bill, which sought to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18 in Islamabad, was signed into law by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and the Parliament — ruling that “classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.”
 
 

Addressing a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief rejected the law, alleging that it “made fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult”.
“Pakistan is a strange country — during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women’s rights that decriminalised fornication,” Fazl said. “It took it out of the realm of sin.
“Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulemas and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and sunnah,” he added, lamenting that despite constitutional guarantees, the Constitution was “being trampled”.
Announcing that the JUI-F would “take steps” to protest the legislation, Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29.
“We will stage rallies, but they won’t focus on one subject, like Al-Aqsa Mosque,” the party chief explained. “Now, we will host rallies to create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance.”
He added, “God willing, we will present our stance to the world freely. Islam is a faith that moves with the world and can be beneficial.”
Underage marriages are practised in some parts of the country, most commonly in rural areas, driven largely by poverty and limited access to education. According to a 2019 World Health Organisation report, about 21 per cent of girls in Pakistan were married before 18.
The same year, the Senate passed the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018 — a private member bill presented by PPP  Senator Sherry Rehman, proposing that the legal minimum age of marriage in the country be set at 18.
At that time, JUI-F had opposed the bill as well, calling it “contradictory to Islamic principles,” and suggesting that the bill should be sent to the CII before being discussed in the Senate. It was, however, not passed by the National Assembly.
Similarly, in 2021, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2021 presented by PPP MPA Nighat Orakzai — aimed at banning marriages of people under the age of 18 — could not become law.
In 2014, the Sindh government had promulgated the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013.</p><small>2025-06-01 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01204044f4de566.png?r=210926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914767/may-sees-modest-rise-in-attacks-but-militants-fail-to-escalate-amid-regional-crisis-report' target='_blank'><strong>May sees modest rise in attacks, but militants fail to escalate amid regional crisis: report</strong></a><br><p>Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India in May, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in Pakistan, according to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on Sunday.
The PICSS monthly security assessment recorded 85 militant attacks in May —up slightly from 81 in April — resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.
A total of 182 people were injured, comprising 130 civilians, 47 security personnel, four militants, and one peace committee member.
This marks a five per cent increase in militant attacks compared to April. Notably, there was a 73pc rise in security personnel deaths, and a dramatic 145pc increase in civilian injuries (from 53 in April to 130 in May).
However, injuries among security personnel decreased by 20pc, falling from 59 to 47.
In operations initiated by security forces during the month, at least 59 militants were killed, while five security personnel lost their lives. Additionally, seven security personnel and five militants sustained injuries. Security forces also arrested 52 suspected militants during various intelligence-based operations.
Combining militant attacks and security operations, the overall casualty toll for May stood at 172 deaths — including 57 security personnel, 65 militants, 46 civilians, and four peace committee members.
A total of 194 people were injured, comprising 130 civilians, 54 security personnel, nine militants, and one peace committee member. Militants also abducted at least 19 individuals during the month.
A striking aspect of the May security landscape was a 78pc rise in the deaths of security personnel, contrasted with a 68pc decline in militant deaths compared to April.
Notably, May was the first month since October 2024 in which militant fatalities were recorded in double digits (65), a sharp drop from 203 in April.
Provincial overview
Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained the most affected provinces, accounting for 82 of the 85 attacks nationwide.
Balochistan experienced the highest level of violence, with 35 militant attacks that left 51 people dead — including 30 civilians, 18 security personnel, and three militants — and 100 injured (94 civilians, five security personnel, one militant). Militants also abducted nine individuals in the province.
A particularly tragic incident occurred in Khuzdar, where a blast targeted an Army Public School bus, killing eight children (mostly girls) and two staff members, and injuring 35 others.
In the merged tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 22 militant attacks led to 45 deaths, including 23 security personnel, 12 civilians, six militants, and four peace committee members.
Additionally, 58 people were injured, comprising 30 security personnel, 27 civilians, and one peace committee member.
In mainland KP, excluding the tribal districts, 25 militant attacks resulted in 14 deaths, including 10 security personnel and two each from civilians and militants. Additionally, 24 people were injured, including 12 security personnel, nine civilians, and three militants.
Sindh witnessed three militant attacks, resulting in the deaths of two civilians and one security personnel.
No militant attacks were reported from Punjab, Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), or Gilgit-Baltistan.
However, Punjab recorded the highest number of militant arrests, with 39 suspects detained in intelligence-based operations. In Azad Kashmir, security forces conducted a raid in Rawalakot, killing four militants reportedly affiliated with Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-01 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01184719ee34af2.jpg?r=202253' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914761/navy-conducts-comprehensive-exercise-to-counter-sub-conventional-asymmetric-threats-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Navy conducts comprehensive exercise to counter sub-conventional, asymmetric threats to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy on Sunday conducted a comprehensive two-day exercise “focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours of Pakistan,” a statement said on Sunday.
The naval exercise took place amid heightened tensions with India, following four days of clashes involving fighter jets, missiles, drones, and artillery, before a ceasefire was declared.
On Friday, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said his country would use the “firepower of their navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan.”  In response, a spokesperson for Pak­is­tan’s military referred Reuters to a May 12 statement, which said there would be a “comprehensive and decisive” res­ponse whenever Pakis­tan’s sovereignty was “threatened and territorial integrity violated”.
According to a press release issued today by the Pakistan Navy’s Director General Public Relations Commodore Ahmed Hussain, the naval fleet conducted a comprehensive two-day exercise focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours.
“The exercises were aimed at validating and refining tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to ensure robust defence of critical maritime infrastructure against evolving asymmetric threats,” the statement said.
“The exercise involved coordinated operations by PN (Pakistan Navy) Fleet units, Pak Marines, SSG (Navy) and Naval Aviation assets,” it added.
 
 

The statement said that the exercise scenarios were “designed to simulate a range of sub-conventional threats” including sabotage, infiltration and unconventional attacks, enabling participating units to enhance inter-agency coordination, situational awareness and rapid response capabilities.
Commander Coast (Comcoast) Rear Admiral Faisal Amin also visited various operational setups at ports and harbours during the course of the exercise, witnessing live-action simulations carried out by participating units, the statement added.
Comcoast Amin appreciated the high level of preparedness and professional conduct demonstrated during the exercises.
He emphasised the importance of maritime installations, adding that the secure functioning of ports and harbours was directly linked to national economic stability and growth.
 






“Pakistan Navy remains committed to maintaining a high state of readiness to respond to all forms of threats and continues to strengthen its capacity to defend the maritime frontiers against emerging challenges,” the statement said.
The latest fighting between Islamabad and New Delhi had erupted after 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed in an April 22 attack in India-held Kashmir’s Pahalgam area.
India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
A ceasefire took effect on May 10 and a top Pakistani military official told Reuters on Friday that both countries were close to reducing their troop build-up along their border to pre-conflict levels.</p><small>2025-06-01 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011434545ca1cc0.jpg?r=194952' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914749/two-bridges-in-russia-collapse-in-blasts-7-dead' target='_blank'><strong>Two bridges in Russia collapse in ‘blasts’, 7 dead</strong></a><br><p>The overnight collapse of two bridges in Russian regions bordering Ukraine that killed seven people were caused by explosions, Russian officials said on Sunday, treating them as “acts of terrorism”.
In Russia’s Bryansk region, an explosion caused a road bridge to collapse onto a railway line late Saturday, derailing a passenger train heading to Moscow and killing seven people, authorities said.
A separate rail bridge in the neighbouring Kursk region was blown up hours later in the early hours of Sunday, derailing a freight train and injuring the driver.
Authorities did not say who was behind the explosions, but investigators said a criminal inquiry was underway.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on the incidents throughout the night, the Kremlin said.
Videos posted on social media from the Bryansk region showed rescuers clambering over the mangled chassis of a train belonging to national operator
Russian Railways, while screams could be heard in another video.
“There are seven dead as a result of the collapse of a bridge onto railway tracks,” Alexander Bogomaz, the Bryansk region’s governor, wrote on Telegram. At least 71 people were injured, 44 of whom were in hospital, he told reporters.
“Last night… in the Zheleznogorsk district, a bridge collapsed while a freight locomotive was passing. Part of the train fell onto the road below the bridge,” Kursk region governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Telegram.
“One of the locomotive drivers suffered leg injuries, and the entire crew was taken to hospital,” he said.
‘Illegal interference’
There was no immediate comment from Russian investigators as to who was behind the blasts.
A spokeswoman for Russia’s Investigative Committee said the incidents had been “classified as acts of terrorism”, without elaborating.
But senior ruling party lawmaker Andrey Klishas blamed Ukraine, describing it as a “terrorist enclave”.
Russia has been hit by dozens of sabotage attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale military assault on its neighbour in 2022, many targeting its vast railroad network.
Kyiv says Russia uses railroads to transport troops and weaponry to its forces fighting in Ukraine.
An AFP reporter saw relatives waiting for loved ones to arrive from the Bryansk region at a station in central Moscow.
“Russian Railways said that those who had survived would be coming here,” said 30-year-old entrepreneur Sergey Trinkinets. “My dad finally got in touch. He said he had some bruises and wasn’t feeling very well, so I came to meet him.”
In one video posted on social media, purportedly taken at the scene of the incident in the Bryansk region, someone could be heard screaming as eyewitnesses rushed to find help.
“How did the bridge collapse? There are children there!” a woman can be heard shouting in the video.
Russia’s emergency ministry said a team was on site in the Bryansk region, while Russian Railways said it had dispatched repair trains to the scene.
The incidents came on the eve of a possible meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul, amid a US-led diplomatic push to end the three-year-long conflict.
Moscow’s three-year assault on Ukraine has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.

Earlier this week, both nations agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Pakistan on Friday announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level, as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”
According to the statement, Muttaqi spoke to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar over the phone and discussed upgrading diplomatic relations.
“Muttaqi called it a positive step and expressed hope that the remaining stages would be completed soon,” the statement said. “Both sides expressed that upgrading the level of diplomatic relations would pave the way for expanding cooperation in many areas.”
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Muttaqi welcomed Pakistan’s decision to upgrade its diplomatic relations to the Ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to follow suit.
“Both leaders also reviewed the implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM’s visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations,” the FO said in a statement.
It added that both nations agreed to “work closely” to swiftly finalise a framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity.
Experts believe that the conversation between Dar and Muttaqi indicates that the two sides remain focused on increasing convergence and cooperation in their bilateral interactions.
“After a period of unprecedented friction in the relations for the past three years, the actions by both sides to upgrade diplomatic representation, releasing held goods of Afghan companies at Pakistani ports, addressing impediments in trade and transit and extension of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan are positive and forward-looking measures,” Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Ahmad Khan, told Dawn.com.
He added that these decisions should be implemented to “strengthen bilateral relations and make progress for achieving regional connectivity with Central Asia and beyond”.
China has played a key role in the normalisation of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both nations made the announcements days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated in a statement “to strengthen exchanges and diplomatic contacts late last month.
“Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed a clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,” he said after he hosted Dar and Muttaqi at an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing.
Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory.
Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harbouring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70 per cent increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.
Russia accepts Afghan-nominated ambassador to Moscow
Separately, Russia officially accepted Afghanistan’s nomination of an ambassador to Moscow, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday, as economic and political ties grow between the two sanction-hit nations.
Russia in April suspended its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than two decades as a terrorist organisation, in a move that paved the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan.
“We hope this new phase will allow both countries to expand cooperation in various fields,” said Muttaqi in a statement.

The arrests took place in the northeastern state of Assam, where Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, “81 anti-nationals are now behind bars for sympathising with Pak”.
Sarma, from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist ruling party, said in a statement, “Our systems are constantly tracking anti-national posts on social media and taking actions”.
One of the persons was arrested after he posted a Pakistani flag on his Instagram, Assam police told AFP. No further details about other arrests were given.
There has been a wider clampdown on social media since an April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-occupied Kashmir, the deadliest on civilians in the disputed territory in decades.
New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing the terrorists it said carried out the attack, charges that Pakistan denied. India and Pakistan then fought a four-day conflict, their worst standoff since 1999, before a US-brokered ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
India’s counter-terrorism agency last month arrested a paramilitary police officer for allegedly spying for Pakistan, while authorities have arrested at least 10 other people on espionage charges in May, according to local media.
A week prior to arresting the police official, Indian police arrested 10 people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi — including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation.
Sarma is also pushing efforts to stem the contentious issue of illegal immigration.
Assam shares a long and porous border with neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Indian media reported that Assam’s government has allegedly rounded up dozens of alleged Bangladeshis in the past month and taken them to the frontier to cross.
The Times of India newspaper on Saturday reported that Assam was “dumping them in no-man’s land”, suggesting that at least 49 had been pushed back between May 27-29 alone.
The Assam government has not commented on the reports.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy, after the Dhaka government was toppled in an uprising last year.
Bangladesh has also moved closer to China, as well as to Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-01 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011819570b8c38c.jpg?r=183217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914762/poland-votes-in-tight-presidential-race-between-pro-eu-and-nationalist-visions' target='_blank'><strong>Poland votes in tight presidential race between pro-EU and nationalist visions</strong></a><br><p>Poland was voting on Sunday in a tight presidential election that will determine whether the country cements its place in the mainstream of the European Union or turns toward Donald Trump-style nationalism.
Both Rafal Trzaskowski of ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO) and his rival Karol Nawrocki, backed by nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), are hoping to mobilise their supporters and clinch the race.
Trzaskowski had a narrow lead in pre-election opinion polls, but the difference was within the margin of error. Voting was due to end at 9 pm (1900 GMT), with exit polls published soon afterwards. The electoral commission says it hopes final results will be announced on Monday morning or early afternoon.
Parliament holds most power in Poland, but the president can veto legislation, so the vote is being watched closely in neighbouring Ukraine, as well as in Russia, the US and across the EU.
Both candidates agree on the need to spend heavily on defence, as US President Trump is demanding from Europe, and to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion.
But while Trzaskowski sees Ukraine’s future membership of NATO as essential for Poland’s security, Nawrocki has recently said he would not ratify it as president as this could draw the alliance into a war with Russia.
Trzaskowski says strong relations with both Brussels and Washington are essential for Poland’s security, but Nawrocki, who met Trump in the White House in May, prioritises relations with the United States.
Turnout stood at 24.8 per cent at noon, the head of the electoral commission, Sylwester Marciniak, told reporters on Sunday. That compared with 24.7pc at the same stage of voting in the second round of the presidential election in 2020, when the final turnout was at 68pc.
“The most important thing is foreign policy,” said IT specialist Robert Kepczynski, 53, who was voting in Warsaw. “We can’t look both ways, to the US and the EU, and looking only to the US for help is short-sighted.”
Economist Maria Luczynska, 73, said that going to vote made her emotional. “(The election) is important because this is how we decide our future. What country my daughter, my grandchildren will live in.”
If Nawrocki wins, he is likely to follow a similar path to outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally who has used his veto power to block the government’s efforts to undo the previous PiS administration’s judicial reforms, which the EU says undermined the independence of the courts.
Coming around a year and a half since Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office, the vote provides the toughest test yet of support for his broad coalition government, with Nawrocki presenting the ballot as a referendum on its actions.
In 2023, huge queues outside polling stations in large cities forced some to stay open later than planned. Analysts said that high participation by younger, liberal, urban Poles was crucial in securing a majority for Tusk.
Trzaskowski is hoping that such scenes will be repeated on Sunday. “Encourage everyone, so that as many Poles as possible vote in the presidential election,” he told a rally in Wloclawek, central Poland, on Friday.
Nawrocki, who draws inspiration from Trump and his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, told supporters in Biala Podlaska in the country’s east that “these elections could be decided by single votes”.
Social issues
The two candidates also differ on social issues, with Trzaskowski favouring the liberalisation of abortion laws and introduction of civil partnerships for LGBT couples, while Nawrocki says predominantly Catholic Poland should reject such moves.
The first round of the election on May 18 saw a surge in support for the anti-establishment far-right, suggesting that the KO-PiS duopoly that has dominated Polish politics for a generation may be starting to fracture.
Nevertheless, after a tumultuous campaign in which Nawrocki in particular faced a slew of negative media reports about his alleged past conduct, once again candidates representing the two main parties are facing off in the second round.
PiS has traditionally enjoyed high support in small towns and rural areas, especially in the south and east. These areas are typically more socially conservative than larger cities and poorer, creating a sense of exclusion that PiS has tapped into.
“They want to build a Poland for the elites,” Nawrocki told voters in Biala Podlaska, referring to his opponents from KO.
KO, meanwhile, campaigns on a pro-European centrist agenda that appeals to more liberal-minded Poles who mainly live in cities or bigger towns.
Trzaskowski took heart from the turnout at a rally in Ciechanow, central Poland. “Looking at this mobilisation, I see how much hope you have - hope in a future in which Poland plays a leading role in the European Union,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0114173052d59c4.jpg?r=141737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914744/punjab-govt-bans-temporary-mechanical-rides-on-eve-of-eidul-azha' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt bans temporary mechanical rides on eve of Eidul Azha</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab home department has banned the operation of temporary mechanical rides installed during Eidul Azha holidays, fairs, festivals and other seasonal events for a short period of time at any location of the province, according to a notification issued on Sunday.
In the past, several accidents have been reported due to malfunctioning and falling mechanical rides, resulting in the loss of lives, including children, and injuries to several other riders. Such incidents were reported at amusement and water parks in different cities, including Lahore and Multan, in the province.
Mechanical ride accidents are generally reported during Eid holidays or Christmas holidays, as more families visit amusement parks with their children to enjoy the rides.
A notification issued today by the Punjab home department said that temporary mechanical rides typically setup or installed during Eidul Azha holidays, fairs, festivals, and other seasonal events for a short period of time “shall not to be allowed to operate at any location of Punjab on the eve of Eidul Azha 2025.”
However, mechanical rides installed on a permanent basis at different amusement parks, theme parks and play areas “will be allowed to operate, subject to the provision of a fitness certificate by the owners/operators of mechanical rides”.
The operators must verify to their respective deputy commissioners “that each ride has undergone the necessary safety inspections and meets all regulatory standards for the safety/ protection of public”.
A similar ban was imposed during Eidul Fitr holidays earlier this year.
Eidul Azha will be observed on Saturday, June 7. The announcement was made by Maulana Syed Abdul Khabir Azad, chairman of the committee, following a meeting held in Islamabad to assess moon-sighting reports.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011650376448339.jpg?r=165048' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914753/aurangzeb-hails-ipsos-consumer-confidence-survey-results-reiterates-positive-economic-direction' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb hails Ipsos consumer confidence survey results, reiterates positive economic direction</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Sunday hailed the results of the Ipsos Consumer Confidence Survey for the second quarter of 2025, saying the findings reflected the government’s successful microeconomic strategy over the last 14 months.
The survey was conducted by Ipsos, a global market research firm that gathers insights on consumer behaviour, public opinion, and market trends. The firm uses methods like online polls, interviews, and focus groups across 89 countries.
A press release by the Ministry of Finance said today that Aurangzeb welcomed the survey findings, calling them a strong affirmation of the improving economic outlook and public sentiment across Pakistan.
“The survey reveals a significant surge in consumer confidence, with 42 per cent of Pakistanis now believing the country is heading in the right direction — the highest level recorded in six years,” the release said.
Perceptions of the economy being strong also reached their most favourable levels since August 2019. Notably, optimism had overtaken pessimism for the first time since consumer confidence tracking began, marking a key psychological shift among the population.
Aurangzeb noted that this data reflected the success of the government’s disciplined and targeted macroeconomic strategy implemented over the last 14 months.
“The stabilisation of key economic indicators — including the containment of inflation, strengthening of the exchange rate, rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves, and improved fiscal discipline — has created a foundation for renewed public trust and economic recovery,” the press release said.
He highlighted that consumer confidence in making major purchases and investments had doubled compared to the same period last year, indicating that households are beginning to feel more secure in their financial prospects.
Similarly, confidence in job security was now at its highest since 2019, a sign that labour market conditions were gradually stabilising in response to pro-growth policies and reforms.
Aurangzeb further pointed out that this upswing in confidence spanned across urban and rural areas, and was particularly evident among youth and women — demonstrating the broad-based nature of the economic turnaround.
He linked this optimism to sustained government efforts to create an enabling environment for private sector growth, boost exports, enhance social protection, and encourage financial inclusion.
The finance minister reaffirmed that the government remained committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability, accelerating structural reforms, and ensuring that economic growth translates into real and inclusive progress for all citizens, per the release.
“The findings of the Ipsos survey are a timely validation of Pakistan’s economic direction and a clear signal that the country is on a steady path toward recovery and resilience,” the press release quoted him as saying.
In April, Aurangzeb said Pakistan had reached a crucial juncture in its economic recovery and transformation.
While speaking at a conference, he highlighted key achievements, including a historic reduction in inflation to 0.7pc, the lowest in 60 years; foreign exchange reserves doubled; a 3pc currency appreciation; and a current account surplus exceeding $1bn in March.
Pakistan also witnessed a 44pc increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), a 24pc rise in IT exports, and record-high remittances projected at $38bn. Pakistan achieved a fiscal surplus for the first time in 24 years, with the highest primary surplus in two decades.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011707433e63967.png?r=181127' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914759/is-operative-captured-at-pak-afghan-border-in-joint-pak-turkiye-intelligence-operation' target='_blank'><strong>IS operative captured at Pak-Afghan border in joint Pak-Turkiye intelligence operation</strong></a><br><p>An operative of the militant Islamic State group (IS) was captured at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in a joint intelligence operation conducted by Pakistan and Türkiye, the latter’s security sources said on Sunday.
Paki­stan and Turkiye, which share strong bilateral relations, reaffirmed their commitment to enha­ncing defe­nce and security cooperation during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Istanbul.
Ozgur Altun, also known by the codename “Abu Yasir Al Turki”, was arrested in a precision operation jointly conducted by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)  and Türkiye’s National Intelligence Organisation (MİT).
Following intelligence sharing, the ISI had been briefed on Altun’s presence in Afghanistan and his intent to cross into Pakistan. After his arrest, he was deported to Türkiye for further investigation.
Altun was identified as the highest-ranking Turkish member of IS and played a key role in the group’s media and logistics networks.
Türkiye’s MİT had tracked Altun’s activities and found that he was allegedly coordinating the movement of IS fighters from Europe and Central Asia to the Pakistan-Afghanistan region.
He was also accused of directing plots targeting concert venues and other civilian sites in Türkiye and across Europe.
The development follows a similar arrest made in March when an operative of the IS-Khorasan was detained by Pakistani authorities and brought to the United States, with President Donald Trump hailing Islamabad’s help.
Mohammad Sharifullah, a “top-tier operational commander”, was responsible for killing 13 US service members in 2021 suicide bombing outside Kabul airport during the chaotic US military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
 
 

Though largely crushed by a US-led coalition several years ago, the IS has managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild.
They include an assault on a Russian concert hall in March 2024, which killed at least 143 people, and in August that year, authorities said a 19-year-old Austrian suspected of masterminding a planned attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna had vowed allegiance to the IS.
It also claimed responsibility for two explosions in the Iranian city of Kerman in January 2024 that killed nearly 100 people, and an assault by suicide attackers on a mosque in Oman in July that year, which left at least six dead.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01131518dd06f1f.png?r=152636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914735/congress-says-modi-govt-misled-nation-on-aerial-combat-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Congress says Modi govt ‘misled’ nation on aerial combat with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India’s Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had “misled the nation”, amid a furore about the now-acknowledged aircraft losses to Pakistan during the recent conflict.
The remarks come a day after India’s top general confirmed that his country’s fighter jets were downed by Pakistan but did not specify a number. That admission followed a statement by Subrahmanyam Swamy, a member of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but a staunch critic of the Indian premier, that Pakistan had downed five Indian planes.
“The Modi govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge wrote in a post on X.
 






He said that in the wake of the remarks made by India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan in Singapore during an interview, there were some very important questions which needed to be asked.
“These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” he said.
“The Congress party demands a comprehensive review of defence preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil review committee,” he added.
Congress leader and Telangana Minister Uttam Reddy separately demanded transparency from the Indian government to reveal the extent of losses, Deccan Herald reported.
“The fact that the fighter aircraft were downed is something that the government needs to stop denying. The CDS himself mentioned that. “Earlier Air Marshal Bharti had mentioned it indirectly in his briefing along with the DGMO,” Reddy, himself a former air force pilot, was quoted as having said.
Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a Dawn.com report, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on the night of May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.
BJP lawmaker criticises Indian Air Force
BJP legislator Ranbir Pathania questioned the role of Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel at the Udhampur base in Indian-occupied Kashmir during Operation Sindoor, allegedly used derogatory words against them, Indian outlet The Telegraph reported.
The BJP defended the legislator, saying his statement has been twisted, while Congress has asked the party to apologise. Pathania also issued a video statement, denying the use of foul language against the force.
In a video uploaded by Congress, Pathania appears to be ridiculing the IAF at Udhampur for its performance during Operation Sindoor. “Everybody knows what happened at the air force station, it was their incompetence; they were sleeping. What is our fault? We have held them in very high esteem,” a man purportedly Pathania can be heard saying.
The BJP leader denied abusing soldiers, saying he is proud of the army and his video had been edited. However, he defended his stand against the IAF’s land acquisition in the area.
The Congress said the statement was shameful and reprehensible, saying it was “an insult to our army and our brave soldiers.”
It added, “The BJP should apologise to the entire country and the army on this matter and should dismiss Ranbir Pathania from his post. If the BJP does not take any action against its MLA, then it will be considered as the thinking and statement of Narendra Modi and the BJP.”
Pathania on Wednesday joined a protest in a village in Udhampur, where he accused the IAF and the local administration of violating the legal rights of landowners by taking over their land without paying any compensation. He said notices had been issued to locals asking them to vacate the land.</p><small>2025-06-01 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0116203362367e7.jpg?r=163349' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914752/pakistan-signs-charter-as-global-water-organisation-launches-operations-to-address-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs charter as Global Water Organisation launches operations to address challenges</strong></a><br><p>The Global Water Organisation (GWO) has officially launched its operations from its headquarters in Riyadh, with founding member states, including Pakistan, signing its charter.
The newly established organisation — formed under the leadership of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and the patronage of the Saudi environment minister — aims to enhance international collaboration to address the growing pressures on global water systems. Aside from Pakistan, the founding countries of the GWO include Kuwait, Qatar, Spain, Greece, Senegal and Mauritania.
According to a statement from the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) on Sunday, the launching event “marked a major milestone in fostering international collaboration to address global water challenges.”
Federal Minister for Water Resources, Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo, represented Pakistan at the invitation of Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, Abdul Rahman Bin Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley, to share the country’s perspective.
“Pakistan along with other founding members signed the GWO charter, formally committing to the organisation’s shared vision of strengthening international cooperation on water scarcity, sustainable resource management, and climate resilience, particularly in arid and water-stressed regions,” the statement said.
Pakistan also offered to establish a GWO sub-office in Pakistan, the statement added.
In December 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the leadership and initiative of the crown prince to establish the GWO.
“We are proud to join this initiative, as one of its founding members and look forward to providing, all possible support, in achieving its important goals,” he had said while addressing the One Water Summit on the Margins of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Riyadh.
According to the Saudi Press Agency, the founding nations of the GWO concluded their inaugural meeting in Riyadh on May 28 by signing the organisation’s founding charter, “cementing a shared vision for achieving global water resource sustainability and addressing escalating challenges facing this vital sector.”
The charter signatories seek to address growing challenges facing the water sector by promoting social, economic, health, and environmental development to ensure equitable access to water and sanitation for all and achieve sustainable management.
The GWO represents a pivotal step in addressing one of humanity’s most pressing challenges, as water scarcity affects billions worldwide and climate change intensifies pressure on global water resources, it said.
The charter signatories emphasised the importance of achieving the organisation’s objectives, which represent a new milestone for international cooperation in water management. The participants underscored the significance of this groundbreaking initiative in fostering collaborative solutions to water-related challenges.
The founding nations stressed the importance of adopting a unified strategic vision and mission focused on water resource sustainability and promoting global progress toward practical solutions for water-related environmental and climate challenges.
The agreement establishes enhanced cooperation and coordination among member states to protect water resources in terms of both quantity and quality, ensuring continued water supplies for future generations.
The organisation called for strengthening partnerships with non-member countries, United Nations organisations, international financial institutions, and all relevant stakeholders to support the organization’s objectives.
The members emphasised establishing best practices and international standards in water management while enhancing knowledge and methodological exchange between countries. The meeting highlighted the importance of research, encouraging innovation and development in sustainable technologies, and providing joint mechanisms and programmes.</p><small>2025-06-01 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0112344497f0198.jpg?r=142246' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914742/escalation-can-outpace-diplomacy-with-no-crisis-management-in-place-warns-pakistans-top-general' target='_blank'><strong>Escalation can outpace diplomacy with no crisis management in place, warns Pakistan’s top general</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.
The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched air strikes in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue 2025 organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.
During a panel discussion, titled “Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms”, Gen Mirza said: “It has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.”
He then stressed that an “early resolution of Kashmir [dispute] in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and as per the aspirations of the people is essential” for an enduring peace in South Asia.
The CJCSC cautioned: “Given the Indian policies and polities’ extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.
“When there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the UNSC resolutions that will address many issues.
“The core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,” the CJCSC pointed out.
He added that unless countries did not “enter conflict resolution” — which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution — issues would “always erupt”.
Other speakers on the panel included Canada’s Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji’s army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India’s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate discussion on defence innovation yesterday.
 
 

In an apparent reference to the Kashmir dispute, the CJCSC also noted: “Crisis prevention is better than crisis fighting. Suppressed disputes, whether territorial or ideological, cannot be indefinitely managed.”
Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored “how regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries’ belligerence”, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations (DGMO) hotline.
The top general further said that following the military conflict, the “threshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan”.
“Emboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,” CJCSC Mirza asserted.
He went on to state that Pakistan desired a “peaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour”.
“We seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,” he added.
The CJCSC stressed the need for Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks instead of chalking out new mechanisms. “States need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.”
‘Conventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower’
During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of strategic stability had been lowered to “dangerous levels”.
He stated, “The threshold of what we say conventional warfare has significantly degraded.”
Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were “always confined to the disputed territory”. “[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.”
The CJCSC highlighted: “Instead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.”
 
 

He noted that strategic stability hinged on conflict resolution, adding: “The lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first, […] there could be a chance — I’m not trying to create an alarm but I’m speaking based on logic — there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place.”
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least 40 civilians losing their lives with 121 others injured.
The military has confirmed that 13 security personnel, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.
Gen Mirza noted that by those attacks, India had “crossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border”.
He recalled that India’s strikes on Pakistan “disturbed the deterrence stability”, which had to be restored while remaining within the conventional domain. However, he added, strategic stability was still disturbed.
Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, “jingoistic” role of Indian media and its leadership’s mindset, he said, “Had there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.”
The top general mentioned the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the “interlocutors”.
 


‘Asia-Pacific direly needs organic security architecture’
Speaking on crisis management in Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza termed it the “geopolitical cockpit of the 21st century”. “Its trajectories will shape the security architecture not only for this region but for the world.”
Offering eight observations, he stated that the crisis management debate in the Asia-Pacific must also focus on South Asia, adding that structures holding the modern state system were losing vitality.
He also called for institutionalised protocols, inclusion of key stakeholders and peaceful dispute resolution; highlighted the importance of communication; and stressed that emerging technologies compress the decision space.
“Misconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation. We must disarm not only militarily but rhetorically,” Gen Mirza observed. “Power and interests, not morality or principles, now reign supreme.”
On the challenges faced by the Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza made four observations, one being: “Asia-Pacific today appears to be descending into an extended era of great power contestation and strategic uncertainties.”
 
 

He further pointed out that the Asia-Pacific direly needed an “institutional security architecture organic to the region itself”, which was missing as it had “largely been guided by extra-regional powers”.
On South Asia, the CJCSC remarked: “A looming threat of a global scale resides.
“South Asian strategic outlook is shaped by competing interests of the global power play, complicated Iran-West relations, perpetual instability in Afghanistan, India-Pakistan-China equation and the unresolved Kashmir dispute that remains at the core of India-Pakistan dyad, leading to regional instability in the geostrategic realm.”</p><small>2025-06-01 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011515539f45911.jpg?r=152335' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914751/indias-monsoon-rains-kill-at-least-30-in-northeast-parts-of-country' target='_blank'><strong>India’s monsoon rains kill at least 30 in northeast parts of country</strong></a><br><p>Flash floods and landslides after torrential monsoon rain over the last two days killed at least 30 people in India’s northeast, officials said on Sunday.
State disaster management officials said eight people died in Assam, and nine in Arunachal Pradesh, many of them in landslides as earth loosened by the water slumped into the valley below.
Another five people died in a landslide in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, state authorities said.
The officials said that six people lost their lives in Meghalaya, while at least two others were killed in the states of Nagaland and Tripura.
A red alert warning was issued for several districts in the region after the non-stop downpour over the last three days.
Rivers swollen by the lashing rain — including the mighty Brahmaputra, which rises in the Himalayas and flows through India’s northeast towards its delta in Bangladesh — broke their banks across the region.
The Indian army said that it had saved hundreds “in a massive rescue operation” across Manipur state.
“People have been shifted to safer places,” the army said on Saturday. “Food, water and essential medicines were provided.”
Conrad K Sangma, the chief minister of Meghalaya state, has ordered officials to remain on high alert “especially in landslide-prone and low-lying areas”, according to a statement.
Scores of people die each year during the rainy season due to flash floods and landslides across India.
India’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
Last month, India’s financial capital Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.</p><small>2025-06-01 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01123105e70a996.jpg?r=130947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914725/hundreds-arrested-as-celebrations-turn-wild-in-paris-after-psgs-champions-league-win' target='_blank'><strong>Hundreds arrested as celebrations turn wild in Paris after PSG’s Champions League win</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of Paris Saint-Germain supporters took to the streets of the French capital on Saturday to celebrate their club’s victory in the Champions League final, but clashes with the police led to the arrest of over 500 people, while two people lost their lives amid the celebrations in separate instances.
As per the French interior ministry, a woman riding a scooter died after she was hit by a car in the southwest of Paris, while a 17-year-old in the southwestern town of Dax was stabbed to death during the celebrations. In total, 559 people were arrested, including 491 in Paris.
The majority of fans celebrated peacefully, but Paris police said scuffles broke out near the city’s Champs-Élysées avenue and PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium, where 48,000 had watched the 5-0 win against Inter Milan in Munich on big screens.
Most of the people detained were suspected of possessing fireworks and causing disorder, Paris police said.
AFP journalists saw police use a water cannon to stop a crowd reaching the Arc de Triomphe.
“Troublemakers on the Champs-Élysées were looking to create incidents and repeatedly came into contact with police by throwing large fireworks and other objects,” police said in a statement.
In a video posted by a user on X, police can be seen dispersing the fans.
 






Videos circulating on social media, posted by a French press agency CLPRESS, show burning vehicles as the celebrations turned into riots.
 






 






Outside Paris, police said a car careered into fans celebrating PSG’s win in Grenoble in southeastern France, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously.
All of those hurt were from the same family, police said.
The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest.
A source close to the investigation said it was believed the driver had not acted intentionally.
In Paris, most fans showed their joy by singing and dancing in the streets, with cars sounding their horns, after their team won the biggest prize in European club football for the first time in their history.
 






One 20-year-old PSG supporter, Clement, said: “It’s so good and so deserved! We have a song that talks about our struggles and it hasn’t always been easy.
“But we got our faith back this year with a team without stars. They’re 11 guys who play for each other.”
French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he would host the victorious players on Sunday to congratulate them.
In a separate message on X, Macron hailed a “day of glory for PSG”.
“Bravo, we are all proud,” he wrote. “Paris is the capital of Europe tonight.”
Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo hailed it as a “historic” win.
The PSG team will hold a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées today, when tens of thousands of supporters are expected to gather to get a glimpse of their returning heroes.

PSG’s young team achieved what the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could not do in their colours as they became only the second French side to win the trophy after Olympique de Marseille in 1993.
“Making history was a goal from the start of last season,” the club’s manager, Luis Enrique, said.
“I really felt a connection with the players and the fans, a very strong connection that we saw throughout the season. We were able to handle the tension and excitement in the best possible way.”
Luis Enrique, visibly emotional after the final whistle and wearing a T-shirt with a tribute to his daughter Xana who died in 2019, has turned PSG from a side of superstars into a group of humble players finally playing as a team.</p><small>2025-06-01 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01144724b4cf08e.jpg?r=144946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914747/arshad-nadeem-thanks-nation-for-javelin-victory-ahead-of-arrival-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem thanks nation for javelin victory ahead of arrival in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>Less than 24 hours after striking gold in the javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship, javelin phenom Arshad Nadeem on Sunday thanked the nation for its support and prayers, dedicating the win to Pakistan.
Yesterday, Arshad returned to international competition and won a gold medal with a throw of 86.40 metres in the men’s javelin final in Gumi, South Korea. India’s Sachin Yadav took silver with an 85.16m and Japan’s Yuta Sakiyama took home bronze with an 83.75m throw. Both athletes threw a personal best.
In a post on Instagram today, Nadeem said: “It is because of all your prayers that Allah made me successful in the finals, and gave respect to Pakistan, when I won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship.

“This is a result of your prayers, and the hard work of me and my coach, Salman Iqbal Butt,” he said in a short video message as he adorned a green and white Pakistan jersey.
He noted that he would be arriving at Lahore International Airport at 10:20pm tonight.
“It gives me great happiness that this was my first competition since the Paris Olympics, and Allah delivered victory to Pakistan,” the 28-year-old said.
Nadeem, who holds the Olympic record after throwing a monstrous 92.97m at Paris 2024, narrowly missed breaking the championship record of 86.72m.
The triumph also marks the first time Pakistan has won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in 50 years.
Nadeem will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships, the only major tournament where he has yet to win gold.</p><small>2025-06-01 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01130834a4fea39.jpg?r=135355' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914740/2-killed-in-kps-kohat-explosion-rescue-officials' target='_blank'><strong>2 killed in KP’s Kohat explosion: rescue officials</strong></a><br><p>An explosion occurred near a house on Sunday in Darra Adam Khel, district Kohat of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing two people, rescue officials said.
