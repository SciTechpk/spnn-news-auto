The island is co-hosting the biennial cricket tournament with India and will hold 20 games between February 7 and March 8.
The Indian and Pakistani teams will play each other at least once, in their Group A clash in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on February 15.
Cricket matches have long been a stage for expressing political tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which fought a four-day conflict last year.

 

Sri Lanka has given the “highest priority” to ensuring the tournament runs smoothly and is “paying special attention to the India-Pakistan matches”, sports minister Sunil Kumara Gamage told AFP late on Wednesday.
Elite commando units, usually assigned to guard visiting heads of state, will be deployed to protect all participating teams, police and security officials said.
“From the time they step out of the airport till they return to their aircraft, they will be protected by armed guards,” an official said, asking not to be named.
India and Pakistan have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, opting to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead. Hence, for the T20 World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shifted their matches to Sri Lanka.
Bangladesh also tried to have their matches moved out of India due to security fears, but the ICC rejected the request.
An angry Bangladesh then withdrew from the tournament, and Scotland were drafted in as their replacement.
Pakistan has indicated that it may yet boycott the event in solidarity with Bangladesh.

 

Sri Lanka maintained a studious silence throughout the India-Bangladesh row.
Cricket Secretary Bandula Dissanayake told AFP Colombo wanted to avoid being drawn into regional disputes.
“In these disputes among India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are remaining neutral, all of these are friendly nations,” he said.
But he added that Sri Lanka would be willing to host future tournaments for any of the countries if asked.
Sri Lanka has also used the T20 World Cup as an opportunity to upgrade its international venues.
It has commissioned new floodlights at the Singhalese Sports Club, one of two stadiums in Colombo.
The Pallekele Stadium in Kandy was unaffected by a deadly cyclone that damaged buildings in the region in November, and will host a T20 international between Sri Lanka and England from Friday.</p><small>2026-01-29 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29104516233e93d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969710/pakistan-armed-forces-undergoing-major-transformation-in-multiple-domains-cdf-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan armed forces undergoing major transformation in multiple domains: CDF Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the armed forces were “undergoing major transformation in multiple domains”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
According to an ISPR press release, the army chief made the remarks while addressing troops of the Bahawalpur Garrison at Khairpur Tamewali (KPT) in Punjab, where he witnessed a high-intensity field exercise ‘Steadfast Resolve’.
The corps, based at Bahawalpur Garrison, is a key strike formation of the Pakistan Army. Its area of responsibility includes the southern Punjab desert zone and its order of battle includes multiple divisions. It focuses on modern, technology-enabled, multi-domain operations, often conducting exercises in areas like Khairpur Tamewali.
“COAS & CDF highlighted that Pakistan Armed Forces are undergoing major transformation in multiple domains,” the military’s media affairs wing said.
“Character of war has evolved massively, with technological advancements driving the evolution, dictating huge mental transformation at all tiers,” the army chief observed.
He added: “In the future, technological manoeuvres will replace physical manoeuvres and will fundamentally alter the way offensive and defensive operations are undertaken.”
“Therefore, Pakistan armed forces are embracing and absorbing technology at a rapid pace. In this process, innovation, indigenisation and adaptation shall remain fundamental.”



CDF Munir also lauded the troops’ high morale, professional competence and operational preparedness.
He reaffirmed that the armed forces remain fully prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity “against all threats, emphasising the need to maintain optimum readiness to meet the requirements of future battlefield and security challenges”, the ISPR added.
The ‘Steadfast Resolve’ exercise encompassed the “integration of niche technologies like unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced surveillance assets, electronic warfare assets and modern command-and-control mechanisms, reflecting the armed forces’ focus on technology-enabled multi-domain operations”, the statement said.

During his visit to Bahawalpur Garrison, Field Marshal Munir was also briefed on “various operational, training and administrative aspects of the Corps, with special focus on preparations for multi-domain warfare”.
Upon his arrival at the garrison, the CDF was received by the Bahawalpur Corps commander. He also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered prayers for the martyrs, paying tribute to their sacrifices.
Earlier, COAS Munir inaugurated the “ROHI eSkills Learning Hub (STP) aimed at promoting digital skills and learning opportunities for students, particularly from southern Punjab and across the country”.
He also inaugurated the APS Abbasia Campus, reaffirming the army’s commitment to “quality education and character building”, the ISPR said.
Field Marshal Munir also visited the EME Regional Workshop, where he was briefed on the maintenance regime to sustain modern platforms through advanced technologies, indigenisation, and other combat support measures.
In August 2025, the Army Rocket Force Command was established to bolster the country’s conventional strike capability. As part of it, the army successfully conducted a training launch of the Fatah-4 cruise missile in September.

 

The army chief has emphasised the importance of technological advancements in modern warfare on multiple occasions.
In December, he highlighted that the multi-domain operations conducted during the conflict with India in May 2025 had now become a textbook example and case study for future warfare.
He also noted that the country needed to keep up with emerging spheres in warfare, such as cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, outer space, information operations, and quantum computing.
Earlier this month, CDF Munir addressed officers at the Lahore Garrison, where he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies”.
Last week, the army chief visited the National Police Academy in Islamabad, where he stressed that a strong and people-centric police force was indispensable for ensuring internal security and the rule of law.</p><small>2026-01-29 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/290219029f93baa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969552/tirah-buried-under-snow-and-circumstance' target='_blank'><strong>Tirah: buried under snow and circumstance</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been ‘under the weather’ lately; not just because of the low temperatures and heavy snowfall in the mountains, but also rising political temperatures.
Months of political confrontation between Peshawar and Islamabad have now reached fever pitch.
In KP, the ruling PTI has been in agitation-mode ever since the incarceration and jailing of its founding chairman — assigning everything else, even governance, to a secondary care list.
But the latest row over a military operation in the lofty mountains of picturesque Tirah has squeezed space for any meaningful conversation, consultation and even coordination, especially on the all-important issue of security in the troubled province.
That is, unless, all stakeholders take a strategic pause, pull back and allow temperatures to cool down.
How did we get here?
Tirah Bagh Maidan — spread over approximately 542 sq km, comprises thick forests, narrow gorges, passes and high-altitude peaks more than seven thousand feet tall — adjoins Afghanistan’s famous Tora Bora mountains to the northwest.
Home to the Afridis, Tirah overlooks the plains of Bara, and shares a long boundary with Peshawar. The terrain is tough and winters here can be challenging due to heavy snow in the upper reaches, prompting its inhabitants to move down to the plains of Bara and Peshawar in the winters, and return when the snow melts.
For months, the military and state intelligence apparatus — the civil administration included — watched as the security situation in Tirah took a serious turn as a motley crew of terrorist outfits started pouring into its many villages, attacking security outposts, and exacting taxes on one of its main agricultural products: hemp.
Lashkar-i-Islam (LI), the original native militant outfit, which had weakened after the killing of its chief Mangal Bagh in the neighbouring Afghan province of Nangrahar, were the first to return to the Valley. Then followed the Jamaatul Ahrar and the IS-Khorasan.
But it was the Hafiz Gul Bahadur’s group’s unusual alliance with LI in Khyber that triggered alarm bells amongst security minders in Peshawar and beyond the Indus.

 

Gul Bahadur, whose group hitherto operated in its native North Waziristan, appeared to expand its operation by creating a strategic arc from the north to the west, inching ever closer to Peshawar.
Intelligence was pouring in as terrorists mounted attacks, not just within the limits of Khyber but also on police posts dotted along Peshawar’s boundary with the tribal districts.
More troubling were attempts by IS-Khorasan to set up a stronghold in Tirah. Things became more self-evident after intelligence agencies and the counterterrorism department traced a failed suicide bomber — an Azeri national who had wanted to target a JUI-F rally in Peshawar — to Tirah.
Discussions to mount a military operation — the second for Tirah — to bring this strategic area under control assumed more seriousness. This was long before incumbent Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, himself a native of the area, took oath of office in October 2025.
The Tirah ‘operation’
Call it a military operation, limited military action or an intelligence-based operation — the plan for intervention in Tirah was fully mapped out in the summer of 2025. Everyone was on board, including Afridi’s predecessor. This is when local jirgas from the valley were pressed for action.
Fresh off the heels of a successful operation in the Bajaur tribal district, authorities presented the same three-choice model to Tirahwals: press the outlaws to leave; raise a tribal lashkar (militia) to flush them out if they refuse; or, evacuate and allow security forces to clean up while avoiding collateral damage.
After all, the authorities had successfully evacuated nearly twice as many families and twice the number of Bajauris, and resettled them back into their 54 villages in October, with the provincial exchequer providing nearly Rs4bn for that exercise too.
Tirah, at least in its scale, was not much different. Authorities were optimistic; the model had worked in Bajaur and there was no way it wouldn’t work here as well.

 

The outcome was as expected: the terrorists refused to leave, and the natives declined to take up arms. So it was a foregone conclusion, they must pack up and leave.
Next was getting the tribespeople to vacate their areas. A broadened 24-member jirga was constituted to work out the details of the evacuation, the exit and return dates, settle the question of expenses during the interim period and compensation for possible damage to properties during the operation.
Understandably sceptical, the Afridis took their time, played hardball and negotiated the agreement down to the minutest details.
Taking it personally
But while security forces took their time to free up men and resources from Bajaur and redeploy them in Tirah, while waiting for the wise Afridi elders to reach an agreement, winter descended.
As the Tirawals moved lock, stock and barrel down to the plains, the snow — late by around two months — caught up with them. Despite their best laid plans, it seemed the weather was something no one had calculated for.
Enter Sohail Afridi. If the dramatic exit of the more predictable Ali Amin Gandapur was a shock for policymakers in Islamabad, the entry of this little-known dark horse was equally surprising.
But more surprising, probably, was the reaction to his nomination and ultimate vote of confidence. The grapes had turned sour for the student activist even before he could devour them, and he didn’t take this lying down.
In the days leading up to his inauguration, Afridi went around telling anyone who would listen — especially those trying to cool down tempers and set up a working environment to cope with the twin challenge of governance and security in KP — that the powers that be were out to humiliate him.

 

They were engaging in mud slinging, he would say, trying to link him with the narco-lobby. Predictably, in his maiden speech before the Provincial Assembly last October, Afridi threw down the gauntlet. “I am a champion of agitation politics,” he roared, to applause and desk-thumping.
Ever since becoming the chief executive, Afridi has been fuming as well as musing. To his aides and well-wishers, he says the federal government and the powers that be have been relentless in their bid to sling mud at him and embarrass him; the handling of the situation in Tirah being their latest salvo.
“You ask me to cool down, but look at what they are doing to me,” he told one aide. But in typical cricketing parlance, he says, the feds have been treating him with one full-toss after another, “I am relishing hitting them over the boundary”.
Balancing act?
But stuck, perhaps, between the growing challenges of governance and security, is his own party’s dilemma.
The PTI has been struggling to balance its political narrative of agitation with the strategic and security imperative. For all his misgivings, Ali Amin Gandapur knew this art well, and walked the tightrope all nineteen months of his rule. But he ended up paying the ultimate price, in the shape of his unceremonious ouster from office.
Sohail Afridi knows this, understands it, and has been well-briefed by all stakeholders — including his own provincial security apparatus. Yet, he is still struggling to find ways to balance his party’s own political narrative with the military operation, drone strikes and other security imperatives.
He is angry, but also enjoying the limelight. In him, the PTI has found a new poster boy, a veritable cheerleader to lead an otherwise demoralised party cadre, which felt increasingly betrayed by its frontline leaders.
Would he have behaved any differently had those in power courted him well in time, it is hard to say.
But spare a thought for the beleaguered bureaucrats caught in the middle of this power struggle, as space for officialdom to work through the complex challenges that face the province has been squeezed to almost zero.

 

Nothing illustrates the ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ predicament of civil servants better than the Khyber deputy commissioner’s Dec 26, 2025 notification regarding the “voluntary movement of population”.
Seizing upon the document, the federal government relishes every opportunity to brandish it, apparently in a bid to embarrass CM Afridi, who continues to insist and call the evacuation a ‘forced displacement.”
This has undoubtedly pushed the bureaucracy into a tight corner, hampering its ability to cope with security demands on the one hand and a belligerent chief minister on the other.
The resulting schism, and deepening mistrust between federal institutions and the province will only complicate the political and security situation further than it needs to be.

The operation was launched in the tehsil’s Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan area.
During the operation, security forces have targeted militant hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continues in the area.
Continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters is being carried out in the region, indicating the sensitive nature and importance of the operation.
Security forces have completely cordoned off the area and are conducting combat operations against the militants.
The objective, security forces said, is to completely clear the area and restore law and order.
Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with police in Domel area. The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the killed militants.
On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district.
The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district. According to a senior official of the district police, the victims were all travelling in the same vehicle when armed men opened “indiscriminate fire” on them.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-01-29 05:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/697aca3cb16b4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969666/rebuilding-reserves' target='_blank'><strong>Rebuilding reserves</strong></a><br><p>THE State Bank left the interest rate unchanged this week, surprising some observers, but it had good reason to do so. In the narrative it built to support its decision, the State Bank effectively argued that that battle against inflation has been won, but the battle to rebuild the external sector remains a work in progress despite significant strides.
These are the two large battles in the war the country waged against economic volatility since July 2023. I use that date because that is when Pakistan had veered perilously close to the edge of a sovereign default and was rescued by an extraordinary bailout arranged by the IMF, China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Had that bailout not come, the country was going to shut down, perhaps within weeks. We move on too fast and forget too much in this country.
Two tasks were of the utmost urgency starting then. First was to douse the flames of the inflation that had engulfed the country since early 2021, rising to an unprecedented inferno by May 2023. Never had we seen inflation reach 38 per cent year on year like we did that month. And never had we seen devaluations of the sort that began to hit in 2021. By the time that wave of devaluations peaked a few years later, the dollar had nearly tripled in value against the rupee. Never have we seen a devaluation of this magnitude in such a short period of time.
Two successive IMF programmes have been required to pull back from the brink of this near catastrophic volatility that ran between 2022 and 2023. The first was the Stand-by Arrangement in July 2023, and the second was the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September 2024. The latter programme is still running, and going by the numbers it contains, Pakistan is still far from being out of danger.

Against the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the battle is still on.

When the EFF began Pakistan’s Net International Reserves (NIR) were negative $11 billion. If you took all the money Pakistan owed in the short term out of the reported foreign exchange reserves, you were left $11bn in the hole. That’s how dire the situation was. This number had gone negative in 2017 for the first time after a few decades, and had barely managed to reach the zero line a few years later, when it plunged once again when the external sector drains of the PTI’s much-vaunted growth rates began.
The Fund programme set a stringent timeline for raising this figure, slowly but surely, back up to the zero line. At the time of signing, the Fund targeted that Pakistan’s NIR should break into positive territory by 2028, four years into the future. Based on that timeline, Pakistan is slightly ahead of the curve. By now the NIR were supposed to be aiming for a target of negative $7.5bn. The data shows that they were at negative $6.6bn by September of 2025 and could realistically touch negative $4.8bn by June of this year, if things keep moving as they are.
This is good news certainly. But notice the figure is still negative, meaning all the dollars and gold and other reserve assets that the country has are still overshadowed by the claims that non-residents have on the country. To put it simply, we owe more than what we have when it comes to foreign exchange, and while that is the case, the country cannot be said to be ready to grow.
A war began in July 2023. A war against catastrophic economic volatility. That volatility was showing up in two areas: inflation and foreign exchange depletion. Each front required a full-fledged battle to put the fire out. Against inflation they won the battle many months ago. But against the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the battle is still on.
This is probably one of the reasons why the State Bank is so aggressive in ‘buying’ dollars from the banks. I put the word buying in quotation marks because banks don’t always get to decide the price at which they will sell these dollars, and in some cases they don’t even get to decide whether they will sell or not. What is puzzling, however, is the sheer zeal with which this goal is being pursued, to the point where they are over-performing on the targets set by the IMF. In September and October of 2025, for example, they bought up more than a billion dollars each month. This is unusual.

 

The long hard slog to bring the foreign exchange reserves back into positive territory is going to continue for at least another year to 18 months — despite the over-performance so far. To do this, it is necessary not only to accumulate reserves, but also to retire the liabilities that were built up during the period of the great volatility of 2022 and 2023. The improvement is happening but it is far from over. And the last thing the economy can afford at this time is a resurgence of the trade deficit to act as a drain on the reserves.
This is what the State Bank pointed to in its monetary policy announcement. It pointed out that “economic activity continues to gain momentum faster than anticipated” and that “the trade deficit has widened in the wake of a substantial increase in imports”. These trends are expected to gather more momentum, it says, upgrading its growth forecast slightly to the 3.75- 4.75 range, with the possibility that “[t]his economic momentum is likely to strengthen further in FY27”.
The economy has started showing signs of an incipient revival with the result that the current account immediately registered a deficit of $1.2bn in from July to December. This is manageable. But the wheels can come off very fast if this trend picks up. So the State Bank has done the right thing to not juice the trajectory further. The battle to rebuild reserves is still on.

Speaking at a Security Council open debate on the Palestinian question on Wednesday, Pakistan emphasised that the establishment of “an independent, sovereign, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital” is the ultimate goal supported by the international community and essential for regional stability.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the unresolved Palestinian question lies at the heart of Middle East instability. He highlighted decades of Israeli occupation marked by dispossession, repression, and the denial of Palestinians’ inalienable rights, including self-determination.







Referring to continued Israeli aggression in Gaza, Ahmad noted that over the past two years, the crisis has escalated to an unprecedented scale, causing widespread civilian casualties, mass displacement, near-total destruction of infrastructure, and severe humanitarian deprivation. He stressed that humanitarian needs are growing rapidly.
The ambassador welcomed renewed diplomatic engagement, including the High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan, endorsed by Security Council resolution 2803. 
He said the second phase of the plan should help consolidate the ceasefire, secure a permanent cessation of hostilities, facilitate transitional arrangements, and enable recovery and reconstruction, while providing humanitarian assistance at scale and preparing the ground for a credible political process toward Palestinian self-determination.
Pakistan, along with other Arab and Islamic countries in the Group of Eight, supports the Board of Peace under resolution 2803, which is intended as a transitional mechanism to consolidate a permanent ceasefire, aid reconstruction in Gaza, and advance a just and lasting peace.







Pakistan has also expressed willingness to participate in the proposed Gaza Stabilisation Force, a US-led multinational initiative to stabilize the territory following the ceasefire.
At the same time, Islamabad has voiced deep concern over continuing tensions. Ambassador Ahmad warned that ceasefire violations persist, civilian lives remain at risk, and pressure on humanitarian organizations impedes aid and protection. 
He strongly condemned Israeli actions against UN facilities, including the recent demolition of a UN compound in Sheikh Jarrah, stressing that such acts undermine stabilization efforts and threaten limited progress. He underlined that UNRWA’s operations remain essential and must be safeguarded.
Outlining Pakistan’s priorities, Ahmad called for full respect for the ceasefire, recovery and reconstruction in Gaza without delay, and the prevention of annexation, forced displacement, or any alteration of the territorial unity of Palestinian territories. 
He urged an immediate end to illegal settlement activity, settler violence, and attempts to alter the demographic, legal, or historical character of the occupied territory, including holy sites, emphasizing that accountability is indispensable for durable peace.
Pakistan has long supported Palestinian self-determination and statehood, consistently advocating a two-state solution in line with UN resolutions and international law.
Concluding his statement, Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed that Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people “remains firm and unwavering” and called on the Security Council to ensure diplomatic efforts deliver concrete, measurable results for the betterment of Palestinians.</p><small>2026-01-29 04:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/697acab9be7a8.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969667/regression-not-justice' target='_blank'><strong>Regression, not justice</strong></a><br><p>THE announcement by the Afghan Taliban regime of a new penal code to govern their country’s criminal justice system should concern not only the Afghans but anyone who is attentive to the relationship between law, power and social order. What has emerged from Afghanistan through official statements and media reporting is not a coherent legal framework aimed at justice or social stability. Rather, it reflects a deliberate regression towards pre-modern norms that institutionalise inequality, undermine accountability and legitimise coercion under the guise of religious authority.
A penal code is intended to be the backbone of the legal system. As such, it defines crimes and prescribes punishments. But most importantly, it signals who is equal before the law. Against that measure, the proposed framework fails at the foundational level.
A most disturbing feature of the code is the apparent exemption given to religious scholars and the ruling elites from prosecution, or their insulation from ordinary judicial processes. Not only is this kind of selectivity incompatible with the principles of modern constitutionalism, it also contradicts the very Islamic legal tradition that the Afghan Taliban claim to uphold. Classical Islamic jurisprudence is rooted in the principle that no individual, regardless of his or her status or piety, is above the law. The insistence of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on equality before justice is a well-established axiom across Islamic legal schools.
By putting clerical authorities beyond legal scrutiny, the Taliban are not reviving religious law but are transforming it into an instrument of clerical absolutism. Historically, legal systems that fuse unchecked religious authority with political power have tended towards arbitrariness and abuse. The law is no longer a mechanism of justice; instead, it turns into a means of enforcing obedience.

The Afghan Taliban’s new penal code reveals a troubling philosophy of governance.

What is just as troubling is the reported recognition of social categories that resemble ‘slaves’ or, in other words, permanently subordinate classes that are subject to differential punishment. This kind of stratification goes against the fundamental principles of justice across legal traditions. While historical Islamic societies grappled with the legacy of slavery, Islamic jurisprudence evolved mechanisms which were aimed at restriction and gradual elimination — and not the creation of new, legally entrenched underclasses.

 

From a sociological perspective, penal systems that codify inequality generate deep and lasting instability. They erode social cohesion, delegitimise authority, and foster resentment. No society in the modern world has achieved stability by formally declaring that some people are less protected by the law than others.
Perhaps the most alarming element of the Taliban’s penal framework is the declaration that nine-year-old girls are legally women eligible for marriage. While child marriage has existed in Afghanistan’s past (as it has in many traditional societies) the decision to codify it into a contemporary legal system is not cultural inevitability; it is political choice.
Scholarly discourse in Islam does not equate biological age with moral or legal adulthood. Classical jurists emphasised rushd (intellectual maturity), welfare (maslaha) and consent as essential components of marriage. Contemporary Muslim scholarship has overwhelmingly recognised that child marriage is harmful and not aligned with religious ethics. The Taliban’s interpretation represents a selective reading of tradition, stripped of its moral safeguards.
The economic context matters. In many parts of Afghanistan, the practice of walwar (whereby families receive money in exchange for marrying off daughters) has long commodified girls. Afghan reformers, clerics and civil society actors have criticised this practice for decades. Enshrining it in law does not preserve culture; it perpetuates exploitation and poverty while entrenching gender-based violence.
Beyond individual provisions, the broader structure of the penal code reveals a troubling philosophy of governance. Women and girls are reduced to legal dependents without agency, while male guardians, clerics and enforcers are granted expansive authority. This is not merely a gender issue; it is a systemic one. Societies that deny half their population legal autonomy inevitably suffer economic stagnation, social decay and moral erosion.
Comparative legal research has demonstrated consistently that legal systems which are exclusionary correspond with greater rates of violence, poverty and institutional collapse. Afghanistan has already been devastated by decades of war and isolation, and it cannot absorb the long-term consequences of such regression.
Seen in this context, the penal system appears to be designed less to deliver justice than to discipline society by employing fear and hierarchy. Discretionary power replaces legal protections and judicial independence submits to clerical decree. Accountability flows downward; and not in the opposite direction.
If we compare the situation to that in other countries, it is clear that even states that incorporate elements of Islamic criminal law do so within a framework that includes procedural safeguards, evidentiary standards and appellate mechanisms. The Taliban’s approach is different to this, not because it is ‘more Islamic’, but because it is less legal.
Just as stark are the international implications. A penal code that basically institutionalises discrimination, child marriage and immunity for the elite will only isolate Afghanistan further, complicating humanitarian engagement and deepening sanctions-related pressures. The highest cost will not be borne by the international community but by ordinary Afghans who are trapped in a system that offers them neither justice nor recourse.
How Afghan society responds is not certain. Some may endure in silence; others may resist quietly or choose pragmatism. History suggests, however, that legal systems that are built on coercion instead of consent rarely endure. Obedience imposed through fear is brittle, and legitimacy without justice is temporary.
The Taliban’s penal code is not merely conservative or traditional. It is structurally unjust and intellectually inconsistent, selectively invoking religion to consolidate power while discarding the ethical foundations of Islamic jurisprudence itself. A legal system that sanctifies inequality, commodifies children and shields elites from accountability cannot build a stable society. It can only deepen Afghanistan’s isolation, and prolong the suffering of its people.

The FCC judgement settles more than 2,200 pending cases and secures recovery of an estimated Rs310bn in unpaid tax revenues — no doubt, a big relief for a fiscally strained state. Only the petroleum exploration sector has been granted relief because even a constitutionally valid fiscal step cannot be arbitrarily enforced where it risks breaching contractual obligations and triggering international arbitration.
The ruling reaffirms parliament’s exclusive authority to impose taxes, declaring that earlier high court interventions staying super tax recoveries amounted to judicial overreach. A precedent has thus been set that is likely to deter future judicial interference in tax collection.
However, the judgement does not address the question of whether legal certainty on a contentious tax measure can be equated with tax equity and sound economic policy. The super tax’s evolution from a temporary levy to a permanent feature of the tax regime shows it cannot.
Introduced in 2015 as a one-time levy to fund the rehabilitation of people displaced by the Zarb-i-Azb military operation in KP, the tax was repeatedly extended and expanded from select sectors to virtually the entire corporate landscape, as well as high-income individuals to bolster FBR collections. This gradual institutionalisation of an emergency levy as a permanent revenue spinner signals fiscal compulsions originating from the state’s failure to broaden the tax base. The levy confirms the state’s inability to effectively bring untaxed or undertaxed segments — notably large parts of retail, real estate and agriculture — into the net.

 

No wonder successive governments have either turned to a narrow pool of documented taxpayers — extracting more from those already compliant — or relied on more borrowings to finance and sustain their budgets. It is rightly feared by compliant businesses that the FCC decision may embolden the state to continue down this path. In other words, the ruling might have brought legal finality on the impugned levy but it has also exposed deep structural flaws in the taxation framework. A tax system dependent on easy-to-collect withholding taxes, surcharges and super taxes is neither equitable nor sustainable.
Without expansion of the tax base, improved enforcement and compliance and a shift away from stop-gap revenue measures, levies like the super tax risk becoming a permanent substitute for tax reform. It may suit the FBR but is costly for economic growth and investment. The FCC has spoken on the constitutionality and legality of the super tax. The answer to the question on how to fix the broken tax system has to come from our political leadership.

From Lamborghinis to Porsches to Ferraris, scores of ultra-luxury cars can be seen gliding through major cities, leaving awe-inspired spectators in their wake. Sometimes, the ‘owners’ of these status symbols use them to amplify their presence on social media, drawing a plethora of envious comments.
Yet, on paper, many of these luxury vehicle owners report incomes that barely register against the value of the vehicles they drive. Officials are at pains to point out, however, that owning expensive items is not a crime in and of itself. However, the gap between visible wealth and declared earnings in many cases is so wide that it warrants scrutiny to ascertain whether these assets are properly documented as per the law.
In Pakistan, tax compliance remains among the lowest in Asia. According to reports, less than two per cent of the population pays income tax, and the state’s chronic revenue shortfalls have pushed it repeatedly into International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes.
Against this backdrop, the open display of extreme wealth, coupled with modest or negligible tax filings, has begun to test not just enforcement capacity but the credibility of the tax system itself.
This disconnect is what triggered a shift in how the state monitors its taxpayers; in September 2025, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) quietly operationalised its special unit called the Lifestyle Monitoring Cell (LMC). This was a digital subdivision within FBR, designed to do what traditional audits often failed to achieve, i.e. match publicly-available displays of wealth with people’s declared incomes.
The revelations
Relying on open-source intelligence, the cell represents a departure from paper-based scrutiny towards real-time observation of wealth, behaviour and spending. To improve enforcement, five regional offices were established in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Faisalabad, and Multan. These, along with the main unit, operate under the jurisdiction of the Director General of Intelligence and the Inland Revenue Department’s investigation division, to ensure legal cover for their activities..

In less than three months, the LMC detected an estimated Rs12.3 billion in concealed assets across 38 cases – largely linked to luxury vehicles, high-end events, frequent international travel, and other premium assets.

Within weeks, LMC’s focus moved squarely into the public domain. A team of 40 FBR investigators began systematically scanning different social media platforms, cross-checking individuals whose online lifestyles appeared disproportionate to their tax filings.
Authorities stress that the objective is not to target fame or status, but to identify mismatches between lifestyle and tax compliance, with social media serving as an evidentiary starting point, rather than a conclusion.
In less than three months, the LMC detected an estimated Rs12.3 billion in ‘concealed’ assets across 38 cases – largely linked to luxury vehicles, high-end events, frequent international travel, and other premium assets.
A breakdown of the data analysis shows that 19 cases are purely linked to luxury vehicles, followed by seven cases involving expensive weddings, while five are related to foreign travel.
Another four cases involve foreign travel combined with high-value personal acquisitions, including luxury cars, horses, and wedding-related spending, while one case is linked to the purchase of an exotic motorbike.
In the cases involving foreign travel, the individuals in question had not declared the related expenditures in their tax returns.
How it works
The LMC scans social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, to identify influencers, celebrities, real estate magnates, businesspeople, and individuals with a high net worth, whose public displays of wealth appear inconsistent with their declared tax profiles.
Tax officials say the exercise has moved beyond paper disclosures, with concealed income identified through open-source intelligence, gathered via social media, which feeds directly into their enforcement work.
The LMC has matched visible consumption with income tax returns for the tax year 2025 and issued tax concealment notices to the relevant Regional Tax Offices (RTOs) for further action in major cities of the country.
“In more than 70pc of the cases, the identified individuals have been selected for audit,” an FBR official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, adding that the investigations are based on “firm grounds”.
“Those under scrutiny will be required to justify the sources of income used to acquire fleets of luxury vehicles and other high-value assets.”

No longer ‘luxuries’
There is also another side to this story: self-expression or show-casing one’s lifestyle can now attract the attention of the taxman. As the scope of enforcement expands into online spaces, questions are emerging that go beyond tax recovery.
“This new enforcement drive blurs the boundary between personal display and professional accountability,” a taxpayer, who chose not to be named, told Dawn.
Observers note that the heightened scrutiny of social media may push individuals to stop public displays of luxury altogether, not necessarily to improve compliance, but to stay out of the digital taxman’s line of sight.
There is also a wide variation in spending patterns and lifestyle visibility across provinces and cities. Faisalabad and Sialkot, for instance, are widely associated with some of the most expensive cars seen on social media, yet only one such vehicle is on the FBR’s radar so far.
That case surfaced after the vehicle’s driver was penalised for speeding, with the incident going viral on social media and drawing official attention.
A breakdown of the afore-mentioned 38 cases shows that Lahore accounts for 10, followed by Karachi with seven. Bahawalpur accounts for four cases, Islamabad three, Multan two, while one case each has been recorded from Sargodha, Rawalpindi, Abbottabad, and Gujranwala.
Officials say eight additional cases are in the final stages of scrutiny and are expected to be concluded soon.
These include one high-value case from an industrial town in Punjab involving what is described as the “city’s most expensive Lamborghini”, while the remaining cases are linked to different cities across Punjab.

Collectors’ hamartia
Most cases flagged by the LMC centre on luxury vehicles, where ownership patterns sharply diverge from declared incomes in tax returns. Official data shows that 21 individuals were found displaying high-end cars on their social media accounts, often registered in multiple cities, while reporting income levels that could not justify such assets.
These luxury vehicles were not declared in the individuals’ wealth statements, and will now be examined through individual audits, officials said. The LMC is using income tax returns for the tax year 2025 to determine the extent of concealed income linked to the possession of these vehicles.
According to tax officials, the aggregate value of vehicles under investigation exceeds Rs10.6bn. However, in several cases, the declared taxable income remained minimal or inconsistent with the assets reflected in wealth statements.
Three individuals, two based in Lahore and one in Karachi, were identified as owning fleets of vehicles valued at more than Rs1bn. None of these assets was declared in their wealth statements, indicating a possible concealment of income.
One Lahore-based individual stands out for the sheer scale of high-end vehicle ownership.
Officials say the taxpayer was found to possess 30 luxury vehicles, including two Lamborghini Aventadors valued at Rs300m each, a Rolls-Royce Phantom worth Rs280m, a Bentley Continental GT priced at Rs200m, a Mercedes S600 Maybach valued at Rs180m, two BMW 7 Series cars worth Rs110m each, two Lexus LX-570 vehicles at Rs110m each, and two Porsches valued at Rs50m each.
The remaining 17 vehicles were assessed at values ranging between Rs25m and Rs100m per car, excluding two lower-priced units.
The total market value of the fleet has been estimated at Rs2.7bn. According to the FBR, none of these high-value vehicles were declared by the taxpayer in income tax returns filed over the years.
An initial assessment by tax officials indicates that the cost of the vehicles is 937 times higher than the net assets declared by the taxpayer for the tax year 2019, pointing to what officials describe as a gross misdeclaration and non-disclosure of income and expenditures.
Another Lahore-based individual was found to be in possession of 11 luxury vehicles, with a combined market value of Rs1.05bn.
Here too, the FBR said the cost of the vehicles alone exceeds more than double the net assets declared by the taxpayer in their income tax returns.
A Karachi-based taxpayer was also found to be in possession of 26 luxury vehicles, but had not correctly reported his actual wealth or income in tax declarations. According to tax officials, none of the luxury vehicles owned by the individual were declared in income tax returns, whose total market value was estimated to be around Rs1.163bn.
The most expensive vehicle in their collection is a Honda NSX, valued at Rs140m, followed by a 1958 Mercedes 190SL estimated at Rs130m, a 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith valued at Rs110m, a 1954 Mercedes Adenauer 300 at Rs95m, and a 1931 Blue Kaufen estimated at Rs90m. The remaining vehicles in the collection were assessed at values ranging between Rs2m and Rs65m.
In a country where a 1,001-horsepower supercar has become the ultimate status symbol, a purple Lamborghini Revuelto, estimated to cost Rs508m, was recently flagged by the City Traffic Police in the industrial heartland.
Several other individuals own fleets of vehicles worth hundreds of millions of rupees, but have not declared these assets in their wealth statements. Analysis of the data shows that one individual from a city in south Punjab was found to possess vehicles valued at an estimated Rs624m, while another from the same city owned vehicles worth Rs180.50m.
In other cities, undeclared vehicle fleets were identified with estimated values of Rs479.36m in Rawalpindi, Rs167m in Sargodha, Rs574m in Multan, Rs415m in Lahore, Rs686m in Islamabad, Rs224m in Lahore, Rs569m in Karachi, and Rs138m in Islamabad.
Eight additional cases involving fleets of expensive vehicles are currently in the pipeline, officials say.
These cases, they say, further underline how investment in luxury vehicles has become a common practice, often used by affluent individuals as a means of parking wealth while keeping it outside the tax net.

Lavish weddings
After luxury vehicles, the next major lifestyle category under scrutiny is lavish weddings. Officials estimate that the cost of just seven such ceremonies that are under the scanner stands at Rs725.6m: three cases were detected in Lahore, followed by two in Karachi, and one each in Islamabad and Multan.
These weddings involved multi-day celebrations where designer wardrobes, jewellery, premium venues, and high-end entertainment collectively pointed to undeclared liquidity.

In several cases, the families hosting these events had declared modest income in their returns, including salaried employment or small business earnings, while financing celebrations that featured imported décor and celebrity performers.
Tax officials estimate concealed income ranging between Rs55.5m and Rs238m per case, based on assessments of the scale, vendor pricing, and duration of the events in question.
According to officials, these expenses were again not reflected in the taxpayer’s wealth statement.
Taxmen have relied heavily on tagged service providers, event planners, jewellers, and fashion designers to reconstruct spending estimates.
Unlike asset-based cases, the investigation focuses on cash flow rather than ownership, with officials stressing that such expenditures are treated as indicators of undeclared earnings, rather than taxable events in themselves.
Foreign travel
Four cases involve frequent foreign travel, often to premium destinations, and are documented extensively through personal social media accounts. Unlike vehicles or property, the LMC has not assigned precise monetary values to these trips.
Instead, travel frequency itself has been treated as a risk indicator.
In these cases, individuals reported limited domestic income and no foreign earnings, yet travelled multiple times each year, often staying in luxury accommodation and engaging in high-end leisure activities.
Two cases involving celebrities were detected by the LMC, one in Lahore and the other in Karachi.
Tax officials say several other celebrities are not yet on the radar of digital tax enforcement despite indications of concealed assets, but may be netted once the scope of scrutiny widens.
In the Lahore case, a playback singer was identified as having concealed assets estimated at Rs224m.
According to officials, the taxpayer owns expensive vehicles, including Range Rovers and Mercedes models, while digital footprints point to consistently high-value spending patterns that are not supported by declared earnings or expenses in tax filings.
Officials noted that the cost of the vehicles alone is almost double the taxpayers’ declared net assets, even before accounting for declared income.

Meanwhile, a Karachi-based actor’s concealed assets have been estimated at Rs403.534m, according to tax officials.
Officials said the actor has travelled extensively within the country and abroad, frequently using private jets and chartered flights, and has stayed in high-end hotels during overseas trips since 2020.
The actor is also reported to own luxury watches valued at Rs50.680m, while the estimated cost of vehicles in his possession stands at around Rs350m.
Tax officials said the actor did not declare any vehicles, high-value watches, or travel-related expenses in their income tax returns or wealth statements.
The wide gap between declared earnings, which officials say may understate income from endorsements and influencer sponsorships, and the scale of personal spending has raised concerns over undeclared income streams, possible tax evasion, or reliance on undisclosed sources of funds.
Champion horses
The LMC has also begun monitoring the equestrian community, which is known for owning high-quality champion horses used in traditional sports.
Tax officials identified one such individual, who is estimated to have concealed assets worth Rs14m linked to imported horses. The taxpayer owns a farm housing pedigreed horses, with officials estimating that imported breeds typically cost between $10,000 and $30,000 per horse.
Officials further noted that the ongoing expenditure required to maintain such a large farm, including feed, veterinary care, and staff salaries, cannot be justified by the modest income declared in the taxpayer’s returns.
In addition, the individual was found to have travelled to 13 destinations, a pattern of travel that tax officials say is not compatible with the income and assets reported in tax filings.

Real estate
In Pakistan, real estate has long been one of the primary sectors where untaxed money is parked. However, it has not fully come under the focus of the LMC so far.
Tax officials said that several high-value properties and their owners have already been identified, and the related cases are expected to be finalised in the coming days.
So far, only one case directly linked to real estate has been formally documented. It involves properties owned by an individual valued at Rs395m, along with ownership of 10 vehicles worth Rs174.5m. The total value of concealed assets in the case has been estimated at Rs569.5m.
According to tax officials, the combined cost of the vehicles and immovable properties is almost 80 times the net assets declared by the taxpayer, aside from declared income.
Officials said the presence of such high-value assets against low declared income and minimal declared expenses clearly points to non-disclosure of personal expenditures and income.

Moradian, director of the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, had been in Iran’s spiritual capital since late December, conducting diplomatic and academic research.
His hometown of Herat, just across the Afghan border, shares deep linguistic and historical ties with Mashhad, giving him access to local networks and perspectives largely inaccessible to foreigners.
His account, published by The Atlantic, paints a picture of genuine unrest met with brutal repression but one that diverges sharply from both the regime’s dismissals and Western media proclamations of imminent revolution.

Researcher who spent weeks in Mashhad during January unrest says Washington, Western media’s assertions bore little resemblance to ‘on ground reality’

The early demonstrations, Moradian says, were modest affairs. In affluent neighbourhoods, small groups of masked young people chanted slogans before being quickly dispersed. “They easily could have been mistaken for agitated sports fans,” he recalled.
However, the situation intensified on Jan 8, coinciding with directives from the US-based former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi calling for nationwide disruption.
This was simultaneous with social media provocation from US officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who publicly insinuated foreign intelligence operations within the crowds.
Driving through the city just after midnight on Jan 9, Moradian visited several reported flashpoints: Ahmad Abad Street, Vakil Abad Boulevard, and the working-class district of Tabarsi.
“The scenes were startling: burning buses and cars, destroyed footbridges, shattered traffic lights,” he said. Protesters had dispersed by then, but riot police remained on patrol as municipal workers cleared debris. He noted the absence of ambulances.
The ‘million-protester’ claim
Despite Trump’s assertion that day of mass demonstrations exceeding one million participants, Moradian found the figure implausible.
Having visited four of approximately ten reported protest sites, he said: “To imagine tens of thousands of protesters in these urban pockets is already a stretch, and far shy of a million.”
With internet and telecommunications severed across the city, residents were cut off from digital news and forced to rely on direct observation. “From my room I could hear occasional gunshots echoing across the city,” Moradian said.
Following a televised address by the supreme leader, Khamenei, which drew a firm line against “agitators” and accused them of acting as ‘foreign’ agents of instability, security forces visibly escalated their presence.
State media reframed the unrest from social crisis to armed insurrection involving “terrorists and Zionist agents”.
By Jan 10, the riot police carrying shotguns had been replaced by forces armed with AK-47s and heavy machine guns.
Morodian noted that lengthy lines appeared at bakeries as people searched for stability. The neighborhoods were eerily calm, contradicting reports of ongoing mass mobilization.
Competing narratives
The information environment grew increasingly confused. State television claimed order had been restored, while London-based opposition outlet Iran International and others reported a revolution on the brink of success.
Neither account, Moradian suggests, matched the grim reality facing ordinary residents: mass arrests, casualties, and pervasive fear.
Trump’s claim that Mashhad had “fallen” contained only a sliver of truth, he said: security forces did appear to temporarily withdraw during the second night of intense unrest, before returning in force.
The human cost, however, was substantial. Local accounts suggested the toll among protesters was quite high. A major police station was reportedly dedicated solely to processing inquiries from families searching for missing relatives.
“I asked my Mashhadi acquaintances if they personally knew people who had been killed or injured,” he said. “Two-thirds said they did.”

In a judgement pronounced on Jan 27 and uploaded on Wednesday, the FCC ruled that Section 4B does not create any unreasonable or hostile classification among persons forming the same class. The court held that parliament was fully competent to impose, abolish, remit, alter or regulate such taxes through a Finance Act as part of a Money Bill under Article 73(2)(a) of the Constitution.
The court observed that the classification introduced under Section 4B is income-based, rests on an intelligible differentia and bears a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The provision, it said, suffers from no lack of legislative competence and does not, on its face, transgress any fundamental right warranting judicial invalidation.
The verdict was delivered by a three-judge bench comprising FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah. The judgement noted that any perceived inequities or hardships arising from the operation of Section 4B fall within the legislative domain and do not, by themselves, justify judicial interference in fiscal matters.

Verdict says parliament can enact laws with retrospective or prospective effect, as long as ‘past and closed transactions’ are not disturbed

The FCC held that Section 4B squarely falls within Entry 47 of Part I of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, namely “taxes on income”, and was therefore intra vires. It ruled that Section 4B applies as enacted for tax year 2015 and onwards at the rates prescribed in Division IIA, Part I of the First Schedule to the ITO. Consequently, the decisions of various high courts upholding Section 4B as a validly enacted “tax” were declared to represent the correct position of law.

 

Section 4B was inserted through the Finance Act of 2015 to impose a super tax for the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons on individuals earning more than Rs500 million. Similarly, Section 4C was introduced through the Finance Act, 2022, imposing a super tax on persons earning more than Rs150m from tax year 2022 onwards.
The FCC also declared Section 4C to be intra vires the Constitution and applicable as enacted for tax year 2022 onwards at the rates prescribed in Division IIB, Part I of the First Schedule. The court reaffirmed that the legislature enjoys plenary power to enact laws with retrospective or prospective effect, subject to the caveat that such laws do not disturb past and closed transactions.
The judgement clarified that the closing of accounts for a tax year does not preclude the imposition of a fresh charge where none existed earlier, particularly when returns for tax year 2022 were yet to be filed. Accordingly, the FCC set aside the judgements of the Sindh, Islamabad and Lahore High Courts to the extent they held that Section 4C could not apply retrospectively to tax year 2022.
Rejecting preliminary objections regarding maintainability, the FCC held that it possessed inherent powers to transpose parties for just adjudication. Since the federation was already a respondent, it could be transposed as an appellant. The court also noted that in several pending matters, appeals had been filed by the Federation in addition to the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR) and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), rendering the appeals maintainable.
The FCC set aside the Islamabad High Court’s Pakistan Oilfields judgement of March 15, 2024, insofar as it held that amended rates under Division IIB could not apply retrospectively to tax year 2023. It held that the definition of “income” under Section 4C, including income from all sources, was validly enacted. Consequently, the IHC’s direction to the FBR to issue a nationwide circular to implement its order was declared to be without jurisdiction.
The court ruled that super tax under Section 4C is a standalone tax on income, independent of the tax levied under Section 4 of the ITO, and therefore applies to capital gains under Section 37A as well. However, in the case of exploration and production (E&P) companies, Sections 4B and 4C will apply only to the extent that they do not exceed the aggregate tax rates stipulated under the Fifth Schedule and relevant petroleum concession agreements.
The FCC held that Section 4C would not apply to E&P companies where it would result in taxation exceeding the threshold prescribed in Rule 4 of the Fifth Schedule, nor would it override exemptions granted to benevolent and provident funds. In the case of banking companies, Section 4C will apply from tax year 2023 onwards at rates amended by the Finance Act, 2023.
Published in Dawn, January 29th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-29 03:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29081023ab1d237.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969620/bara-civil-society-resents-seasonal-migration-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Bara civil society resents ‘seasonal migration’ claim</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: As the government doubled down on its claim that no military operation was being planned or currently underway in the Tirah Valley, civil society in Bara criticised federal ministers for what they termed “derogatory and humiliating remarks” about displaced families.
Taking umbrage at the assertion about ‘seasonal migration’ by Tirah residents, Bara Tehsil Chairman Mufti Kafeel argued that no such event had taken place since 2015, when residents were allowed to return to their homes after completion of a military operation.
Some questioned why registration centres were established for these families when they were supposedly going to Bara on a ‘joy ride’, as the ministers seemed to claim.

 

Former MNA Hameedullah Jan Afridi said the defence minister’s statement was tantamount to rubbing salt in the wounds of the people of Tirah and Bara.

Talal Chaudhry accuses PTI of concocting narrative to ‘hide their corruption’; says any military action will only be launched ‘after informing everyone’

Talking to Dawn, he said that these statements were “unbearable, shameful and completely opposite” to the facts about the displacement of residents.
“We reject this baseless and misleading statement and want to clarify that the residents of Tirah have not left their homes voluntarily nor is this a seasonal migration,” he insisted.
He claimed these people were forced to leave their houses in inhospitable conditions in the name of eradicating terrorism.
He reminded the federal ministers that displacement from Tirah started only after an agreement was reached between government officials and a representative jirga of local elders, in which all modalities about transport fare and compensation for damages were sorted out prior to the start of a planned military operation.

 

Another former parliamentarian from Bara, Shafeeq Afridi, said the statement made a mockery of the sufferings of thousands of children, women and elderly residents of Tirah, who were made to wait in lines for long hours in order to get themselves registered.
He said that describing the current displacement in light of a book written by an English author in 1880 was tantamount to twisting historical facts and misleading the people.
“The federal government cannot absolve itself of its constitutional responsibilities towards its law-abiding citizens by simply referring to history books written by foreigners, as we live in a different Pakistan now,” he stated.
He also questioned the rationale behind the ban on taking edibles to the restive valley, as well as the strict monitoring of the movement of residents in the entire valley. He said women and children were not even allowed to venture out of their homes prior to their displacement.
Bara Siyasi Ittehad President Hashim Khan Afridi, meanwhile, held both the federal and provincial governments responsible for the miseries of the displaced families and insisted that the plan to conducting a military operation and prior evacuation of families was finalised with the mutual consent of both governments.
‘Concocted narrative’
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, however, continued to point the finger squarely at the government in Peshawar, claiming that it was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation.
“As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they [KP govt] were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it,” he said in televised remarks on Wednesday.
“Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.”
However, the minister added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP).”
“Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted.
The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is that [the provincial government] wants to do it, but they are scared”.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a global race for critical minerals and rare earths, Pakistan on Wednesday reaffirmed China’s central role in transforming its mineral sector beyond extraction to unleash the potential of around $8 trillion of estimated resources, as the two sides signed a series of memoranda of understanding (MoUs) at the Pak-China Mineral Cooperation Forum.
At the daylong session, the two sides launched the ‘Pak-China E-Mining Platform’, a digital initiative aimed at improving information sharing, project connectivity and cooperation between Pakistani authorities and Chinese enterprises and to enhance transparency, efficiency and collaboration in the development of the mineral sector.
The forum also led to the signing of MoUs, among which was an accord for ‘A Framework for Cooperation to Explore Opportunities in Digital Cross-Border Industrial Trade’, signed between Wah Nobel (Pvt) Limited and MCCT International, as well as between JW Corporation and MCCT International.

 

In addition, an MoU for cooperation in Pakistan’s mineral sector was also signed among the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC), POWERCHINA International and Pak China Investment Company Limited, focusing on investment facilitation, technical cooperation and joint development initiatives.
Organised by the China Chamber of Commerce in Pakistan (CCCPK), the event brought together Pakistani ministers, diplomatic representatives, Chinese enterprises and industry stakeholders.
The petroleum division said more than 800 people attended, including representatives from over 70 Chinese companies and over 100 Pakistani firms.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who is also Pakistan’s focal person for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), said Pakistan wanted strategic partners such as China to develop the mineral sector, just like CPEC’s cooperation has delivered tangible results across the economy, including the power sector, infrastructure development and industrial connectivity.
“Chinese enterprises bring advanced expertise to the entire mining value chain, including geological surveying, modern extraction techniques, mineral processing, smelting, refining and manufacturing,” he said.
The minister added that Pakistan wanted to move beyond extraction to develop mineral processing plants, smelters, refining facilities & mineral-based industrial units linked with special economic zones and transport corridors.
In his keynote speech, Ambassador Jiang Zaidong reaffirmed China’s strong interest in investing in Pakistan’s mining sector and in supporting capacity building and technological advancement.
He emphasised China’s role as an active contributor to global economic development and highlighted the importance of sustainability and benchmark construction standards in mining projects.
Speaking on the occasion, CCCPK Chairman Wang Huihua said mining and minerals were emerging as a new pillar of Pak-China economic cooperation and that the chamber would facilitate dialogue, promote responsible investment and strengthen linkages between Chinese and Pakistani enterprises.
Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said Pakistan’s policy direction was now to move towards responsible and value-added mineral development.
He promised Pakistan’s commitment to policy stability, streamlined approvals and federal-provincial coordination to position Pakistan as a reliable long-term partner in the global mineral supply chain, and formally invited Chinese companies to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum this year.

The substituting of the sentence of rape with less punishment sparked considerable controversy, with rights organisations including the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) criticising the verdict.
One of the judges on the bench, however, had dissented from the majority ruling passed on Dec 2, 2025.
Filed by Additional Prosecutor General, Pun­jab, Ahmad Raza Gilani, the petition under Article 188 of the Constitution has pleaded before the SC to revisit its decision and restore the conviction and sentence of the respondent under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
“The impugned judgment is profoundly stigmatic, casting a permanent shadow over the victim and her entire family for generations to come,” the review petition regretted, adding such an approach runs contrary to the principles of justice, dignity and victim protection and with respect calls for clear judicial disapproval.
Headed by Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aqeel Ahm­ed Abbasi and Justice Salahuddin Panwhar, the SC on an appeal of Hassan Khan against Dec 18, 2018 rejection of his plea by the Lahore High Court (LHC) had commuted the sentence of the convict from 20 years of imprisonment to five years after reclassifying the offence from rape to consensual extramarital affair.
Whereas Justice Panhwar had rejected the appeal by holding that sexual harassment often went unreported in society where victims were fearful of the consequences.
“This is unusual that Punjab government has come in review by filing a set of petitions, since the State usually restrains itself from moving review petitions against the SC decisions in criminal cases,” said a senior counsel on condition of anonymity, also recalling that the last such review petition was filed by the Punjab government in 2015 against the SC judgement in Mujahid versus the State where a three-judge bench had held that DNA was not permissible evidence.
Against the fornication judgement, the Punjab prosecution department argued in its review petition that in the cases of sexual violence, delay in reporting the crime and absence of marks of violence did not carry significant importance.
Citing the 2011 Mukhtaran Mai case, the review petition recalled how the SC had held that delay in reporting rape was natural due to trauma, fear and social stigma. Thus, it claimed, the delay of reporting crime after seven months of occurrence in the present case must not have material bearing on the prosecution case when even a child’s birth from rape was established. The review petition pleaded that if the judges in the present case differed with earlier SC judgements, then it would be appropriate to send the matter to the chief justice for the constitution of a larger bench so that one authoritative verdict should come.
The petition regretted that one of the distressing aspects of the case was that a child was born as the result of the nefarious act, but the SC failed to address or clarify the legal and social status of the child. While imputing criminality to the victim, it added, the SC also failed to appreciate the extraordinary hardship faced by the victim’s family in coming forward with a visibly pregnant victim to seek justice. While the SC was not empowered to record conviction in deviation from the prescribed mandatory mode of taking cognizance it departed from the mandatory provisions and converted the conviction and sentence under Section 376 to Section 496-B of the PPC.
Therefore, the judgement is void ab initio, constitutes an error apparent on face of the record and therefore required to be rectified within contemplation of Article 188 (review jurisdiction).
In another petition, the Punjab prosecution department has requested the SC to revisit the Nov 25, 2025 decision in which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim had converted the death sentence of Shahzad Liaquat to 20 years of life imprisonment on the grounds that the convict had no prior planning or intention to commit the murder.
Case of 16 murders
Likewise, the prosecution department in yet another review petition contended before the SC to review its Nov 10, 2025 ruling in which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan had ordered that the sentences of convict Muhammad Ishaq for murdering 16 persons in Bahawalpur would run concurrently.
The review petition pleaded that the courts were required to examine gravity of actions and while directing the sentences to run concurrently, it awarded the sentence of life imprisonment to the murderer of 16 persons as if he had killed one person. It urged the apex court to restore the death sentence earlier awarded by the trial court.

GILGIT / ISLAMABAD: The difficulties of Gilgit-Baltistan residents intensified on Wednesday as snowfall disconnected road access to remote areas, with temperatures dropping below minus 15 degrees Celsius in the region. As freezing temperatures persisted, people took to the streets to protest prolonged power outages.
A patient in Astore allegedly died due to the unavailability of transportation facilities for treatment.
A fresh spell of snowfall on Monday and Tuesday brought life to a standstill across parts of GB amid freezing temperatures, power outages and road closures. The suffering of residents due to snow, harsh weather, lack of electricity and other basic facilities continued in remote areas on Wednesday.
Police said up to six inches of snow was recorded in parts of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang, Hunza, Nagar and Ghizer, disrupting routine life and making travel hazardous.
Locals said a patient from the Mirmalik area of Astore was being shifted on foot to Rattu hospital after roads were blocked by snowfall, but he died before reaching the hospital.
According to a statement issued by the Astore assistant commissioner, locals attempted to shift a patient from Chamriot to a nearby hospital.
Following the information, a rescue team comprising the Astore Disaster Management District assistant director, two doctors and a snow-cutter machine was dispatched. The team reached Dadujil after clearing the road, but doctors confirmed that the patient had died four to five hours earlier.
Officials of the GB Communications and Works Department said the Karakoram Highway, Ghizer-Shandur road, Astore Valley road and Baltistan road were opened for traffic in the evening.
Travellers were advised to exercise caution as snowfall had made roads slippery and hazardous.

Confined to homes
Residents in remote areas remained confined to their homes due to blocked roads, freezing temperatures and unavailability of electricity and firewood.
Shafqat Hussain, a resident of Astore, said there was fear of food shortages in snow-hit areas if roads were not opened urgently.
Upper areas of Skardu, Ghanche, Ghizer, Hunza, Nagar and Shigar were also facing communication disruptions, road closures and electricity shortages.
Residents were facing water shortage as pipelines and streams froze, forcing people, particularly women, to fetch water from distant places.
In the border area of Dansar Thang in Kharmang district, heavy snowfall created a severe drinking water crisis. Locals said women were forced to fetch water from dangerous mountain routes four kilometres away. They demanded emergency provision of clean drinking water and basic health facilities.
Residents in the Nilt area of Nagar district staged a protest by blocking the Karakoram Highway for several hours.
Protesters said the area had been without electricity for several days. They added that residents already faced daily power outages of up to 20 hours, but electricity had been completely unavailable for the last few days.
Similar demonstrations were held in Gilgit’s Basin area, as well as in Ghanche, Ghizer and Diamer.
The Provincial Emergency Operation Centre, GB, issued an alert warning of widespread rain, thunderstorms and snowfall from Jan 30 to Feb 2. It cautioned about extremely cold temperatures, avalanche risks, landslides, road closures and hazardous travel conditions, advising residents to remain alert and travellers to avoid non-essential travel during heavy snowfall.
Meanwhile, temperatures in major urban centres of the country varied on Wednesday morning. Islamabad and Pesha­war recorded five degrees Cels­ius, while Lahore was at 10 degrees.
In the south, Karachi’s temperature was 12 degrees Celsius. Colder conditions prevailed in northern areas, with Quetta recording minus five degrees Celsius, Murree minus one and Muzaffarabad zero degrees Celsius.

ISLAMABAD: After a suspension of nearly two years amid a “mistaken identity” controversy, Sadaf Ihsan was reinstated on Wednesday as a member of the National Assembly on a reserved seat for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, drawing condemnation from Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which termed the decision “unjust” and “biased”.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued a notification restoring its March 4, 2024, declaration of Ms Ihsan as the returned candidate, shortly after a full bench rejected petitions filed by JUI-F and Hina Bibi for being “devoid of merits and facts”.
The controversy surfaced after the ECP’s March 4, 2024, notification, when the JUI-F disowned Ms Ihsan and claimed it had not fielded her as a candidate, alleging impersonation and insisting its priority list carried the name “Sadaf Yasmeen” rather than “Sadaf Ihsan”.
The ECP suspended Ms Ihsan’s victory notification on March 11, 2024. The matter was later remanded to the commission by the Federal Constitutional Court on Dec 24, 2025, with directions to decide it afresh within a month.
In its order, the ECP noted that counsel for the JUI-F had argued that a political party could not object to an alleged wrong entry in nomination papers, or to the acceptance or rejection of a candidate’s nomination papers, as no remedy was provided under the law.
The commission rejected the contention, saying the law allowed a voter of the constituency, an objector or an appellate tribunal, upon receiving information from any source, to raise objections or file an appeal regarding acceptance or rejection of nomination papers.
The ECP observed that the party could have approached the commission earlier but did so after a “considerable delay”, and said it was the duty of political parties to prepare reserved-seat priority lists with due diligence on the prescribed Form-66 under the Election Rules, 2017.
It said the returning officer had given the JUI-F an opportunity to submit a properly drafted list, but the party, in its second submission, corrected only three names at serial numbers 1 to 3 and again left the name of “Sadaf Yasmeen” incomplete.
The order also noted that Hina Bibi, who was on the priority list and had pursued her case regarding acceptance of nomination papers up to the Supreme Court, did not raise an objection to the acceptance of Ms Ihsan’s nomination papers.
The commission also questioned the existence of “Sadaf Yasmeen”, observing that she did not appear before any forum, including an inquiry committee and the Supreme Court, despite notices. It said her counsel appeared before the commission on the last date of hearing without notice and submitted a power of attorney.
The ECP also noted that two different copies of Ms Yasmeen’s identity card had been submitted, showing different temporary and permanent addresses and different issuance dates.
It observed that Ms Yasmeen was not a voter of the constituency at the time the party submitted its list as she was a resident of Karachi’s East district and that her identity card details were changed on Feb 18, 2025, about a year after the 2024 general elections.
Rejecting the JUI-F’s claim that Ms Ihsan was an “alien” to the party, ECP said Ms Ihsan had been a JUI-F member since 2018 and that original documents regarding her membership were provided by an authorised representative of the party.
According to the order, Ms Ihsan appeared in the party’s 2018-19 membership list at serial number 4 with membership number 506,885 and held a membership card. The commission said membership cards of 29 other members of her family were also produced, including her mother, father, brother, sister-in-law and brother-in-law.
‘Unjust, biased’ decision
Meanwhile, JUI-F has criticised the ECP decision to reinstate Sadaf Ihsan as an MPA on a reserved seat allocated to the party. In a statement, JUI-F spokesperson Aslam Ghauri said the decision was regrettable. “We are being forced to accept a stranger in our parliamentary party,” he said, calling the decision unjust, biased and “contrary to the electoral system in the country”.
The spokesperson alleged that the ECP had ignored an order of the Peshawar High Court and referred the matter to a tribunal, which he said was tantamount to making “a mockery of the Constitution and law”. He claimed the party’s reserved seat had been awarded to “a stranger” instead of a party candidate, describing it as a “daylight robbery” of the party’s mandate.
The party also faces an internal disciplinary matter in the Senate after it terminated the basic membership of Senator Ahmed Khan for supporting a government-sponsored bill against party lines.

In a three-page statement, Somiya Arshad requested the FCC to order the formation of a comprehensive, independent judicial commission with international observers to probe all aspects of the case, including pre-murder threats, coordinated FIRs, nominated accused, institutional links and any transnational involvement.
On Jan 14, the FCC had dropped hints about closing the suo motu proceedings, observing that the court’s facilitation had already borne fruit with the signing of a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) agreement between the governments of Pakistan and Kenya in September last year.
Arshad Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple sedition cases were registered against him in different cities.
In the fresh application, Somiya Arshad also requested the FCC to order the immediate sharing of the report of the Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT), constituted by the government, along with all related investigation documents, with the family.

 

The statement further urged the FCC to issue directions for the summoning and questioning of nine individuals nominated by the late mother of the slain journalist, as well as relevant officials identified in the fact-finding report prepared by a two-member team.
It also asked the FCC to ensure the sealing and confiscation of properties linked to the prime accused and to expedite action under the MLA agreement.
The statement read that the indications given by the FCC on Jan 14 suggested that the proceedings might be nearing closure. However, it added that any premature closure would deny justice and undermine public confidence in the rule of law, especially given the slow progress of the investigation, lack of family access to key reports and unaddressed nominations of accused persons.

In a statement, the power division said the minister had taken notice of the “non-crediting of units of net-metering consumers under PPMC instructions”, which had been reviewed “with immediate effect”.
Informed sources said power distribution companies (Discos) had complained that some net-metered solar consumers — commonly referred to as “prosumers” — had installed solar systems significantly larger than permitted under the rules, which allow generation capacity up to 150 per cent of sanctioned load. The Discos argued that such installations created challenges for grid stability and financials.
They said the PPMC had directed Discos and the Power Information Technology Company (PITC), which handles billing for all Discos, to stop counting export units for consumers found to have exceeded the allowed capacity, instead of denying the benefit of only extra units exported beyond the authorised capacity.

Leghari intervenes as govt comes under criticism for violating its own policy

Sources said implementation of the directive led to the blocking of credit for all exported units for affected consumers, including a number of influential politicians and businessmen, among them leading parliamentarians.

 

Most of them belonged to Lahore, where the Lahore Electric Supply Company’s first billing cycle immediately coincided with the application of PPMC’s notification, followed by other Discos as well.
A large number of bills on the first three days after the Jan 23 notification caused a lot of hue and cry in Lahore, although there were fewer complaints in other Discos, including Islamabad Electric.
The power minister had to intervene for damage control as the government came under criticism for violating its own policy for renewable energy through a unilateral notification without stakeholder consultation or approval from any competent forum.
Mr Leghari directed that consumers who had already received their bills should be corrected in next month’s billing and stop issuing fresh bills to remaining consumers at the outset. In addition, only extra units beyond authorised capacity should not be credited in favour of prosumers.
The power division said some net metering consumers had installed systems with capacities exceeding the approved limit under their licences for distributed generation capacity.
“Last month, a number of such consumers were not given any credit for the electricity sold to the national grid,” it confirmed and conceded that “this practice was not correct”.
Mr Leghari reiterated commitment to securing consumers’ rightful entitlements without any compromise, the statement said. Under the revised directives, only those units exceeding the approved capacity will not be credited.
Units exported to the national grid within the approved capacity would now be credited accordingly as before, it said, adding that instructions had been issued to all Discos for implementation.
“For consumers whose net metering units were not credited in their bills, the relevant adjustments will be made in the next billing cycle,” it said.

The department updated its travel advisory for Pakistan on Jan 26, advising travellers to think twice before visiting due to crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and the risk of kidnapping. 
Pakistan has been placed under a Level 3 advisory, a category that indicates a high risk where terrorist attacks may occur without warning. According to the State Department, typical targets include “transportation hubs, hotels, markets, shopping malls, military and security sites, airports, trains, schools, hospitals, places of worship, tourist locations, and government buildings”.
Some regions, including parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have been designated Level 4: Do Not Travel areas. 
The advisory urges US citizens not to travel to Level 4 areas “for any reason”, warning that assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, particularly against government officials and private citizens. The warning also applies to US citizens of Pakistani origin.
The State Department noted that local laws prohibit demonstrations without a permit and warned that “US citizens have been detained for participating” in such activities.
A Level 3 advisory indicates “serious risks to safety”, and travelers are advised to reconsider their travel plans. Level 4 is the highest advisory level and discourages all travel.

Speaking to the media, Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran said that the body was found from the disposal station on Outfall Road.
Asked about the various reports about the water flow not being fast enough to carry away a person, he said, “You should also look at the time difference. When it happened, the water flow was fast; those are peak hours.”
He said that the water flow receded as the night progressed.
Asked whether the family would register a case, Kamran said, “Whatever the family says and whatever their opinion is, we will act according to that.”
Meanwhile, Lahore Operations SSP Mohammad Tauqir told Dawn that police had taken the woman’s husband into custody, adding that he was the one who had alleged that his wife had fallen into the sewerage line along with their minor daughter at around 7:30pm.
He said the police were questioning the husband. “It would be premature to say she was murdered or died in an accident,” he said.
According to the official, the husband was taken into custody on the statement of the woman’s father who alleged that the couple was not on good terms for the past few months.
The SSP said that the deceased woman’s father had expressed his doubts over the role of her husband, who had called Rescue 1122 and alerted it about his wife falling down the sewerage pipeline along with their minor daughter.
“We are investigating the case and will share more details once it is completed,” he said, adding that the minor girl was still missing.
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and constituted a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter and submit a report within 24 hours.
It should also be mentioned that two officials of Tepa, a subsidiary of the Lahore Development Authority, were placed under suspension with immediate effect “on account of an incident [regarding] uncovered manholes”.
Earlier in the day, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson had said that teams were dispatched immediately after receiving a report of the incident and launched a vigorous search operation after receiving reports of the incident.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.
The same month, a three-year-old boy’s body was recovered from an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.

A day prior, the party said it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly.
According to a senior doctor at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time. Another doctor, however, has denied this and said it was better not to discuss it as the PTI would make an issue out of such a development.
During a press conference in Islamabad, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said that Imran was allegedly taken to the hospital over the weekend before being taken back to jail.
He called the situation “distressing for the nation, the party and the family”.
“The family should have been taken on board for moving him for medical treatment. To this day, we have still not been informed about the disease for which he was taken to the hospital, which doctor examined him, why he was taken back [to jail] and why the need arose for doing so,” he said.
In an apparent reference to the government, Gohar said they “are trying to consolidate their power” by making changes in the law but the people’s trust in them was failing.
He added that denying meetings with the PTI chief was causing great concern.



“The government is not understanding, but we will try to make them understand through this press conference; try to understand these problems. Let the meetings happen … do not deny meetings until February 8 under any circumstances,” he requested.
“A meeting with the family is very important. We demand that today, if not tomorrow, a meeting be arranged between Khan sahib and his family, and we are informed about his health. This is our demand,” he said.
Gohar urged the government to consider the demand so that the “anxiety within the nation, the party and his (Imran) family be immediately put at ease”.
Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that Imran was the most popular leader in Pakistan.
“He (Imran) is a former prime minister of Pakistan … whom Pakistan loves,” he said. Gohar termed the current situation, where Imran had been taken to the hospital without his family being informed, an “injustice”.
He said that as a result of this, the government was losing its credibility in the eyes of the nation. “This is condemnable and they will have to answer for it at some point one day,” he said.
Abbas said that the government had faced a resounding defeat in the Feb 8, 2024 general election. “If the [results] of the Feb 8 polls were accepted, then the political crisis would have ended,” he asserted. He called on the nation to join the opposition’s nationwide protest call for Feb 8.
Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that Imran and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, being kept in isolation in jail was “unacceptable”. He said that the latter was last allowed to meet her daughter on November 4.
Raja said that Imran’s personal physician, who was not related to politics in any way, was not allowed to see him. He said that petitions had also been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) by the party’s senators and MNAs for meeting Imran.
“I learnt today that the IHC has refused to hear these petitions as regular petitions. An objection had been placed on both pleas, saying that the petitioners had no right to approach the court,” he said.
“We mentioned in our petition very clearly that we have grave concerns about the reports regarding Imran Khan sahib’s health and that his personal doctors should be allowed to examine him immediately. But we were told that this petition does not qualify for a hearing,” Raja asserted.
“We went to the chambers of the chief justice … and we urged him to use his administrative powers and tell the advocate general that a meeting be arranged,” he added, saying that the situation “bordered on barbarism”.
He again questioned why the party was not informed about Imran being taken to the hospital.
“We demand that a meeting with Imran be arranged,” he said, also calling for the end of the couple’s solitary confinement.
Senior PTI leaders request proper medical treatment for Imran
Separately, senior PTI leaders incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail demanded that the government provide Imran proper medical treatment.
PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Omar Safraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Reasheed also appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was being administered as soon as possible.
“Imran Khan’s eye infection has resulted in central retinal vein occlusion and may produce permanent damage to the eye and loss of vision, if not treated properly,” the five leaders expressed in an open letter shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday.
The open letter — written by Rashid on behalf of all five incarcerated leaders — said learning about Imran Khan’s eye infection, which had resulted in central retinal vein occlusion, was extremely distressing.
“This condition is extremely serious and if not treated properly, may produce permanent damage to the eye resulting in loss of vision,” the PTI leaders said.
They urged the government to stop its “petty behaviour and ensure that he (Imran) is admitted to a hospital of his choice and given proper treatment” and called the denial of proper treatment “shameful”.
“We appeal to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment is given as soon as possible,” they said.
“The action taken in this case should be visible to the people of Pakistan,” they added.
Meeting with Imran jail authorities’ decision: Tallal Chaudhry
Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry, meanwhile, said that allowing meetings with the incarcerated PTI founder was ultimately the decision of the jail authorities, adding that securing a meeting would be “difficult” if the PTI kept giving calls for protests outside the prison.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the state minister refrained from commenting on whether or not Imran was taken to a hospital for an eye procedure.
“Instead of speculating or sensationalising, I urge people to wait for the reports to be confirmed,” he said.
Asked whether the government’s silence on the issue was tacit confirmation, Chaudhry replied, “It’s not like that. The truth is that this is a narrative built by those people (the PTI) who spread propaganda and play the sympathy card about his (Imran) life and health, and how he can’t speak to his children and they can’t get visas, because their other narratives have failed.”
Chaudhry said that if it was proven that Imran underwent a procedure, “then it confirms that he is receiving all medical facilities”.
Asked why meetings with the PTI founder were not being allowed, the state minister replied that jail authorities would not allow a meeting if it became a law and order problem or if they were dictated.
“There are approximately 850 people who have met the PTI founder for hours, including his family, lawyers, his political team and doctors,” Chaudhry said.
At this point, Khanzada noted that there had been no meetings for two months.
“He is in prison and it is the government’s responsibility [to take care of him], do not worry,” Chaudhry replied.
Asked if there would be a meeting tomorrow (Thursday) — one of the days designated for meetings with Imran by the Islamabad High Court — the state minister replied that only jail authorities could make that decision.
“I will confirm one thing: the rumours these people spread about his life and health are not true. He is receiving all the facilities … more so than other prisoners,” Chaudhry said.
“Only jail authorities can decide on a meeting, but if they (the PTI) continue dictating, making calls and threats, or affecting the public, then this will make securing a meeting difficult,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-28 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2823361844c6185.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969551/us-agents-involved-in-latest-minneapolis-shooting-put-on-leave-reports' target='_blank'><strong>US agents involved in latest Minneapolis shooting put on leave: reports</strong></a><br><p>At least two federal agents who were involved in Saturday’s fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minneapolis have been placed on administrative leave, two US media outlets said on Wednesday.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the two immigration agents who discharged their weapons during the deadly encounter with Alex Pretti were put on leave as part of standard procedures, Fox News reported.
MS NOW earlier reported that agents involved in the shooting of Pretti were being put on leave, citing an unnamed source.
Representatives for DHS could not be immediately reached to confirm the reports.
Immigration agents on Saturday fired multiple shots at Pretti, an ICU nurse at a hospital for veterans.
His death was the second fatal encounter between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and US citizens in Minnesota this month, sparking a national uproar.
US review of Pretti’s killing does not mention him brandishing firearm
Meanwhile, an initial US government review of the fatal shooting of Pretti made no mention of him brandishing a firearm, despite initial statements by Trump officials highlighting the weapon.
A preliminary review by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said Pretti, 37, was shot by two federal officers, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer, after he refused to move out of the street following an order from a customs officer.
The DHS said he “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, but did not mention that the weapon was holstered.
The CBP review, conducted by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility and shared with lawmakers on Tuesday, is standard protocol and shared with members of Congress to promote transparency, CBP spokesperson Hilton Beckham said.
Beckham said the notifications “provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings”.
Details in the preliminary review reinforced the disconnect between how Trump officials portrayed the shooting and the video evidence.
The review said that a customs officer tried to move Pretti and a woman out of the street, but that they “did not move”.
The officer then fired pepper spray at Pretti and the woman, it said.
CBP customs officers normally work at ports of entry, screening passengers and goods entering the US, but some have been detailed to work on immigration enforcement by the Trump administration as part of its crackdown.
The identities of the agents and officers at the scene and whether they had any experience with crowd control in urban environments have not been made public.
The CBP internal assessment said that the agency’s personnel tried to take Pretti into custody and that “a struggle ensued”.
A Border Patrol agent shouted “He’s got a gun!” multiple times during the struggle, the review said. Five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer fired at Pretti.
Video showed an agent removing Pretti’s gun from his waist prior to the shooting. The review was based on footage from body-worn cameras and CBP documentation, it said.</p><small>2026-01-28 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28205645767444a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969547/president-zardari-uae-vice-president-discuss-economic-trade-ties' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari, UAE vice president discuss economic, trade ties</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday met the vice president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with the two discussing ways to further strengthen bilateral relations, with a focus on expanding economic, trade and investment cooperation.
According to the President’s Secretariat, Zardari met Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the ruler of Dubai, at Zabeel Palace.
“The two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral relations, with a focus on expanding economic, trade and investment cooperation between Pakistan and the UAE,” the handout said.
Ït went on to say that President Zardari congratulated the sheikh on his two decades as Dubai’s ruler and “commended Dubai’s remarkable transformation into a global centre for tourism, finance and emerging technologies”.







It further stated that both sides exchanged views on “benefiting from Dubai’s development experience, particularly in ports, logistics, infrastructure, information technology and digital financial services”.
During the meeting, the president also highlighted Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms, including investment facilitation and privatisation, and explored opportunities for enhanced cooperation with the UAE in infrastructure development, logistics, food security and technology-driven sectors, the handout said.
“President Zardari extended an invitation to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to visit Pakistan,” it added.
It further said that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen the brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE and “expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties”.
During the meeting, the leaders underscored the importance of high-level exchanges, recalled the recent visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan, and acknowledged the UAE’s continued support for Pakistan’s economic development, it said.
“They also highlighted the valuable contribution of the Pakistani community in the UAE in strengthening people-to-people links.”
First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE were also present on the occasion, according to the statement.
Logistics company DP World says Pakistan ‘natural hub’ for trade
Meanwhile, President Zardari also appreciated Dubai-based logistics company DP World’s “strong and sustained partnership” with Pakistan and its contribution towards logistics, port operations and infrastructure, in a meeting with its chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), according to a separate handout.
During a meeting with DP World Chairman and CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the president reviewed the “evolving Pakistan–DP World engagement, noting that the recent inter-governmental agreements reflect strong commitment on both sides”.
“The president said these initiatives align with Pakistan’s objective of positioning itself as a regional trade and transit hub through enhanced connectivity and modern logistics infrastructure,” it said.







It further added that bin Sulayem highlighted Pakistan’s strategic geographic location at a time of global uncertainty and stressed that the country occupied a critical position as sea routes faced growing pressures.
According to the statement, DP World’s CEO noted that Pakistan’s direct connectivity with China and Central Asia, combined with its access to the Arabian Sea and its surface connectivity through road and rail networks, placed it at the centre of regional and inter-regional trade flows.
“He said Pakistan serves as a natural hub linking key parts of the world by sea and land, and reaffirmed that the UAE would continue to work closely with Pakistan, drawing on decades of a trusted and enduring relationship,” it added.
President Zardari reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing institutional facilitation and fast-track approvals to partner enterprises, and underscored the importance of deepening long-term cooperation in rail freight modernisation, inland logistics and integrated freight corridors, the handout said.
President Zardari, who is currently on a four-day official visit to the UAE, has held several meetings with the UAE leadership, including President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p><small>2026-01-28 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/282039389254031.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545/pakistan-orders-screening-of-travellers-in-view-of-nipah-virus-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan orders screening of travellers in view of Nipah virus threat</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday decided to enforce “strict and enhanced health surveillance” at all entry points in the country with immediate effect in order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus.
Nipah, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.
It is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organisation (WHO) because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40 per cent to 75pc, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.
The measures taken by authorities in Pakistan coincide with those taken multiple other countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia — after India confirmed the detection of two cases in December last year.
In this connection, the Border Health Services-Pakistan (BHS-P) — an ancillary department of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination — issued an advisory which referred to a regional alert reported by international and regional public health surveillance mechanisms, including the WHO South East Asia Region Epidemiological Bulletin.
Citing the alert, the advisory said in view of the “suspected cases of Nipah virus infection in West Bengal, India, and considering the high case fatality rate, zoonotic nature, and potential for human-to-human transmission, it has become imperative to further strengthen preventive and surveillance measures at Pakistan’s borders”.
“In order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus in Pakistan and to ensure early detection and prompt response, the competent authority has decided to enforce strict and enhanced health surveillance at all points of entry with immediate effect.
“These instructions shall be applicable to all points of entry, including international airports, seaports, and ground/ land border crossings, without any exception,” the advisory said.
Outlining the instructions, the advisory said all in-charges at entry points should ensure 100pc screening of all arriving passengers, transit passengers, crew members, drivers, helpers, and support staff.
“No individual shall be allowed entry into Pakistan without health clearance by BHS-P,” it said.
Under the new measures, mandatory verification of the country of origin and complete travel and transit history for the preceding 21 days shall be carried out for each and every traveller, irrespective of their nationality or travel status.
“All in-charges at points of entry shall exercise special vigilance for travellers originating from, or transiting through, Nipah-affected or high-risk regions. Any false declaration, concealment, or misreporting of travel history shall be immediately documented and reported to the competent authorities for further necessary action,” the advisory stated.
Moreover, travellers are also required to undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at entry points.
“Screening staff shall remain alert for early signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection, including fever, headache, respiratory symptoms and neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness or altered consciousness.
“Any individual consistent with suspected Nipah virus case definition shall be immediately isolated at the point of entry, restricted from onward movement, and managed strictly in accordance with infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols,” it was instructed in the advisory.
Such suspected cases should be promptly referred to the designated isolation facility or a tertiary care hospital in coordination with provincial and district health authorities, the advisory said, adding that the “conveyance concerned (aircraft, vessel, vehicle) and surrounding area shall be immediately disinfected as per approved standard operating procedures”.
In-charges at entry points have been further directed to ensure strict compliance with IPC measures, including the mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, and environmental sanitation.
Any lapse in surveillance or IPC practices should be treated as serious negligence, the advisory said.
Moreover, “daily case/ nil reports from all points of entry shall be recorded in the BHS-P system already in vogue and shared with National Command and Operation Centre and the National International Health Regulation Focal Point”.
Any delay, weak surveillance, under-reporting, or non-compliance with these instructions should not be tolerated, the advisory stated.
“All in-charges at points of entry are directed to ensure strict compliance with the above instructions in letter and spirit. These measures shall remain in force until further orders are issued by the competent authority,” it added.
Separately, the National Institute of Health (NIH) also issued an alert to health departments, healthcare providers, and BHS-P regarding the potential threat of Nipah virus spillover into Pakistan.
The alert said that while Pakistan had not yet reported a human case, a significant situation was emerging in South Asia.
“As of January 2026, an outbreak has been confirmed in West Bengal, India. […] Due to its high case fatality rate ranging from 40pc to 75pc and the potential for human-to-human transmission, health authorities are placing the region on high alert,” it added.
According to the advisory, there was currently no specific anti-viral treatment or licensed vaccine available for the virus.
Management remains primarily supportive and focuses on symptomatic treatment, including management of fever, respiratory distress, and neurological complications,” it said.
“Severely ill patients often require hospitalisation and may need intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation. The clinical effectiveness of ribavirin (broad-spectrum antiviral medication) remains inconclusive and it is not routinely recommended,” it said.
It urged travellers to avoid contact with symptomatic individuals or contaminated materials.
“Travellers returning from affected areas within 21 days who develop symptoms should self-isolate, seek medical attention, and inform the provider of their travel history and exposure,” it said.
It further directed the provincial health department to designate at least one tertiary-care hospital or infectious disease unit for the isolation and clinical management of cases.
It also urged provincial public laboratories to review and strengthen their capability for safe sample handling and transportation. Further, it directed that rapid response teams be placed on standby for case investigation, contact tracing, and coordinated field response for any cluster of acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).
It further said that provinces with international airports or land border points needed to main realtime communication with BHS-P for any alerts or travellers requiring follow-up.
‘Risk in Pakistan minimal’
Talking to Dawn, Microbiologist Prof Dr Javaid Usman said that the virus was named after a place in Malaysia.
“The virus is spread through the droppings of fruit bats and pigs,” he said. He further said that if cases were reported in Pakistan, it would be through carriers.
“Currently, a few cases have been reported in the Indian state of Bengal due to which neighbouring countries have announced to screen their masses,” he said.
Replying to a question, he said that the major symptoms of the virus included fever and neurological disorders.
“People can have fits. The virus can spread through respiratory droplets, saliva and the blood of a patient who has tested positive. So positive samples are kept in isolation,” Dr Usman said.
Chief of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan, told Dawn that this was the 51st outbreak since 2001.
“Although we have issued advisories to alert airport authorities, there are very few chances of identifying patients as the incubation period of the virus is 9 to 14 days,” he said.
Infectious disease expert Dr Rana Safdar told Dawn that Nipah virus was listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen due to a high fatality rate (up to 80pc).
“Its progression is therefore being closely monitored. While efforts are underway, to date no effective vaccine or treatment is available so the management of infected cases is largely supportive,” he added.
Dr Safdar said, since its identification in 1998, the outbreaks of Nipah virus had been sporadically occurring in South and Southeast Asia, largely in rural settings. Countries which have previously reported outbreaks include Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Bangladesh and India, he said.
“While the principle ‘infectious diseases respect no boundaries’, holds, due to the peculiar transmission dynamics, the risk of spread to surrounding countries thus far remains moderate to low. Given the current outbreak in India’s West Bengal and the associated media hype, there is no reason to panic as the risk of the virus in Pakistan stays minimal,” he said.
“While executing preventive measures, it’s important to consider that the usually deployed passenger screening at airports does not help much in preventing virus importation. We otherwise need to remain prepared, anticipating and mapping risk and enhancing vigilance in identified vulnerable zones,” Dr Safdar said.

The case has been registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah presided over the case’s proceedings and observed that the KP chief minister had failed to appear before the court despite being summoned.
Subsequently, he ordered the Afridi’s arrest and directed relevant authorities to produce him before the court.
The case’s hearing was adjourned till February 10.
The court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Afridi in the case at a previous hearing on January 4 as well over his repeated absences.
During that hearing, Judge Shah had observed that the CM repeatedly ignored summons and remained absent from proceedings without any lawful justification.
The court had noted that despite being given multiple opportunities to present himself before the court and respond to the allegations, the CM failed to comply with judicial directions.
The court had taken a serious view of Afridi’s persistent non-appearance and termed it a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process.
The case
The case against Afridi was registered after he alleged during an interaction with the media outside the Adiala jail on November 6, 2025 that security forces in KP would bring dogs into mosques and tie them down there, thereby violating the sanctity of holy places. His statement sparked an outcry, drawing condemnations.
Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against him on November 9 on behalf of the state and under Sections 11, 20 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR stated that following an inquiry dated November 8, it transpired that Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives, uttered false, misleading, derogatory and intimidating words against state institutions, which were recorded [and] disseminated and propagated” through social media platforms. In this connection, the FIR particularly mentioned the PTI’s YouTube channel.
It said that in a video uploaded on the channel, Afridi had made a statement “containing offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations, with the intent to malign, defame and cause harm to the reputation and integrity of the state institutions of Pakistan”.
The “false, fake and ill-will content, publicly and intentionally uttered and promoted by the accused and others through social media is an organised attempt to undermine public trust on state institutions, including racial hatred, create unrest in the country and destablise national security”, it was alleged in the FIR.
In the FIR, Afridi was also accused of being involved in “preparing, publishing, sharing and circulating fake and misleading contents publicly on social media with the intention to incite violence, create racial hatred, panic, fear, disorder and unrest among the general public alongwith promoting anti-state sentiments, which is detrimental to the security, integrity and stability of Pakistan”.</p><small>2026-01-28 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2820364390a5bda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969546/26-countries-including-pakistan-named-founding-members-of-trump-led-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>26 countries, including Pakistan, named founding members of Trump-led ‘Board of Peace’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s newly formed “Board of Peace” on Wednesday announced 26 countries designated as founding members of the initiative, including Pakistan.
A week after Trump formally introduced the initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the body launched an official account on the social media platform X.
A post on Wednesday said that the Board “welcomes Pakistan as a founding member of our growing international organisation”.







The list of founding members also includes Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Albania, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, El Salvador, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, spanning the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caucasus.
Notably absent from the list are major European countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, amid sharp disagreements with Trump on issues including Greenland and tariff policies, which have strained relations between Washington and several European capitals.
Ukraine questioned how it could participate alongside Russia and Belarus.
Belarus accepted the invitation to join, while Russia was not included in the board, despite President Vladimir Putin saying Moscow was ready to allocate $1 billion from Russian assets frozen by the previous US administration to the body’s budget.
Trump rescinded Canada’s invitation, citing Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which he warned against economic coercion by major powers.
Trump announced the establishment of the Board of Peace on January 15 as part of his broader plan for Gaza, under which the ceasefire agreement was reached. The board was authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2803 in November 2025.
The board was originally conceived to oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, but its charter expands its mandate to peace-building in all areas affected by or at risk of conflict.
Further details on the board’s mandate, leadership structure, and timeline for implementation have yet to be formally announced.</p><small>2026-01-28 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28154216b011f04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969532/governor-kundi-blames-barrage-of-statements-by-kp-govt-for-tirah-exodus' target='_blank'><strong>Governor Kundi blames ‘barrage of statements’ by KP govt for Tirah exodus</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in the province’s Khyber district.
The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists.
Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there was typically around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was between 50 to 60pc this year.
“It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated [their homes].”
“In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government,” he said.
The governor noted that the KP government had issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara.



He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during the winter, but stay in the homes of host families.
Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation was planned, official statements were issued and necessary preparations were made.
Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who had accompanied the governor to Bara, said their visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents.

 

“This is our duty, these are our people,” he said.
“Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised.
‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’
Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues.
Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.”
The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”.

 

“They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability.
“[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.”
The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices.
“Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated.
Noting that the KP CM hailed from the merged districts, the governor said he should “provide a solution for the injustices that he says people there have faced in the past”.
“I will again ask my province’s government to come to its senses. Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts,” he said, an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “Tehreek-i-Intishaar” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside the province, including to Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi.







“If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places.
He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”.
Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province.
PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry
Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation.
“The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said.
Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces.
“As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.”
Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard.
“Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.”
However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP).

 

Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”.
“Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted.
The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.”
The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance.
Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case, Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated.



The interior ministry official declared that the “routine” intelligence-based operations (IBOs) will continue under the NAP, and they were taking place with the “cooperation” of the KP government and its chief minister.
“But to make themselves appear good in the public’s eyes and make the army bad, lies are told,” he remarked, noting that military operations had previously been carried out after proper announcements.
“Whenever there is such a need, we do not need to hide. We will do it openly,” Chaudhry said.
“But repeatedly making false accusations against the army cannot hide your lack of capability, incompetence, or corruption, or the Rs4bn that went in your pockets in Tirah Valley,” he added.
The minister highlighted that the KP government was responsible for distributing the allocated funds, adding that the deputy commissioner who was involved in the December agreement with the tribal elders was also under the provincial administration.
“The action for which you are fully responsible, not just a participant, you pin the blame for it on someone else,” Chaudhry quipped.</p><small>2026-01-28 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281852460a48481.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969541/trump-threatens-iran-over-nuclear-talks-says-time-is-running-out' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens Iran over nuclear talks, says ‘time is running out’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed threats to attack Iran, saying “time is running out” to make a deal on nuclear weapons, after Tehran rejected talks.
“Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal — NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS — one that is good for all parties. Time is running out,” the US leader said in a social media post, noting that “a massive armada is heading to Iran.”







“As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn’t, and there was ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse!”
The dialling up of threats came after Iran’s top diplomat said the country would not come to the table under the shadow of military action.
“Conducting diplomacy through military threat cannot be effective or useful,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in televised comments on Wednesday.
“If they want negotiations to take shape, they must certainly set aside threats, excessive demands and raising illogical issues.”

 

Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Earlier this month, he threatened to strike Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. But the prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.
With a US naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier lurking in the region, top Iranian officials also reached out to key Arab states in behind-the-scenes diplomacy to rally support.
A strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln has now arrived in Middle Eastern waters, US Central Command said, without revealing its precise location.</p><small>2026-01-28 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281801329528f82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969531/sindh-high-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-student-union-elections-at-karachi-university' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh High Court dismisses plea seeking student union elections at Karachi University</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday dismissed a plea seeking student union elections at the University of Karachi (KU) and imposed a Rs10,000 fine on the petitioners for frivolous litigation.
A two-member SHC bench, presided over by Justice Adnanul Karim Memon and Justice Zulfiqar Ali Sangi, heard a petition filed in May 2024.

 

During the hearing, Justice Memon questioned the need for lifting the ban on student unions and remarked, “Education is already in ruins, why do you want to make it worse?
“What is the purpose and benefit of a student union?” the judge asked the petitioners’ counsel, Advocate Usman Farooq.
At this, the lawyer replied that a student union’s purpose was to provide representation to students in policy-making.
“Just as there are labour unions at factories, do students now want to threaten their vice-chancellors?” Justice Memon remarked.
Noting that the case file had documents dating back to 2021, he inquired whether the petitioners were still students.
The bench then announced a short order, dismissing the plea and ordering the petitioners to submit Rs10,000 to the SHC as fine for frivolous litigation.
The petition, a copy of which was available with Dawn, had been filed by Karachi residents Taimoor Ahmed, Muhammad Basiq Bin Nadeem and Hassan Ahmed under Article 199 (jurisdiction of high court) of the Constitution.
The Sindh government, the KU registrar and vice chancellor, and the Sindh Assembly speaker were made respondents in the case.
The petition requested the SHC to direct the respondents to “immediately commence the process of conducting student union elections” at KU in accordance with the Sindh Students Union Act 2019, the University of Karachi Act 1972, and the Constitution.
It also urged the court to order KU to formulate regulations and procedures for the conduct of student union elections within the stipulated time frame, “ensuring transparency and fairness in the electoral process”.
While the ban on student unions in Sindh was imposed in 1979, it was extended to the rest of the country in 1984 by the regime of former dictator Gen Ziaul Haq through Martial Law Orders. The orders were rescinded by the first government of ex-premier Benazir Bhutto in 1988.

 

Three years later, the unions were challenged in the Supreme Court on the grounds that they were contributing to on-campus violence.
Then, in 1993, a three-member SC bench headed by then-chief justice Afzal Zulla imposed a ban on the political nature of student unions — a restriction often blamed for the leadership crisis in the country’s political landscape.
The verdict in the M. Ismail Qureshi vs Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba secretary general M. Owais Qasim case prohibited student groups from affiliating with mainstream parties and barred students from holding positions in university statutory bodies, which would have allowed them to participate in policymaking alongside the university administration.
In December 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench admitted for hearing petitions challenging the decades-long ban on student unions in educational institutions.

“Our effort is to complete the main corridor on University Road — where there is heavy public movement and where citizens face difficulties — by March,” said the senior minister while speaking to the media in the metropolis.
“The remaining BRT work will continue, including bridges, underpasses, and U-turns,” he added.
He further said the condition of the main thoroughfare and its adjoining routes is now “far better than before”.
“Wherever the roads appear damaged, it is only because development work is currently under way,” he added.
Referring to the lack of construction activity, he maintained that the provincial government was not at fault, as there were “some serious issues at the national level”, adding that with an increase in the exchange rate, the project’s cost ballooned.
He added that the Sindh Transport Department will soon commence work on the Yellow Line BRT project. “People are currently facing difficulties, and they will face more difficulties [after the work commences]. We know this, and we apologise to the citizens.”
The provincial minister said that the Sindh government was answerable to the people on every platform and could be questioned on the matter.
“As I said, people will face difficulties, for instance, when work will commence on Yellow Line,” he reiterated, adding that however, once such projects were complete, “you, as well as your future generations, will [have access to these] facilities”.
The minister said an easier option was to buy buses and simply run them on roads. “But given the situation of traffic and population growth, what would you have done in the future? If you have no routes [to run those buses], what will you do?”
“So, we apologise for the inconvenience that you are facing today, but these difficulties will end soon once these projects are complete,” he said. “These projects worth billions are for Karachi, as Karachi is the hub of Pakistan, Karachi is the hub of Sindh, and it belongs to all of us. The responsibility of Karachi’s development lies with all of us, especially those who are in governments.”
The minister said that was why a major portion of Sindh’s budget was spent on Karachi.
He claimed that no other city in Pakistan had “state-of-the-art government hospitals” similar to the ones in Karachi, where not just people from the port city but from across the country were being provided medical treatment.
“All of us have to work together for Karachi’s development […] because if Karachi will progress, the entire country will progress. So Karachi’s progress is Sindh government’s priority,” he asserted.
Memon was also asked about the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) accusing the Sindh government of its “incapability” in the area of development and demanding the chief minister’s resignation.
In his response, Memon said it did not matter what they demand. He asserted that the Sindh government had been carrying out development work in Karachi.
He also insisted that the port city had an “empowered local government system and that is why local bodies are functioning here”.
On MQM-P’s demand to make Karachi a federal territory, he said two of the party’s leaders were federal ministers. “They should then demand from the federal government to [make Karachi a federal territory] within 24 or 48 hours and warn that they would otherwise resign,” he said, adding that they would not do so.</p><small>2026-01-28 13:09</small></div><hr>
