According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that an intelligence-based operation was conducted in KP’s Mohmand district upon the reported presence of terrorists there.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s* location, and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that another intelligence-based operation was conducted in the general Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan district, where, during the ensuing fire exchange, four more terrorists were neutralised by the security forces.
In another encounter that took place in Bannu district, one more terrorist was killed, the statement added.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.”
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan.  In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Last week, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
In August, security forces neutralised 50 terrorists during a four-day operation in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-11 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11090241a08b1c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941079/nepals-former-cj-accepts-request-to-lead-interim-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Nepal’s former CJ ‘accepts request’ to lead interim govt</strong></a><br><p>• Soldiers guard parliament, patrol streets after two days of deadly protests
• Kathmandu airport reopens; over 13,500 prisoners escaped during unrest
KATHMANDU: Soldiers guarded Ne­­p­al’s parliament and patrolled deserted streets on Wednesday with the capital Kathmandu under a curfew, as the country’s former chief justice Sushila Karki claimed to have “accepted Gen Z protesters’ request to lead interim government” after two days of deadly anti-corruption protests forced Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign.
The upheaval in the poor Himalayan nation was unleashed by a social media ban that was announced last week but was rolled back after 19 people were killed on Monday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to control crowds.
The death toll from the protests had risen to 25 by Wednesday, Nepal’s health ministry said, while 633 were injured.
Nepal’s army said that relevant parties were coordinating to tackle the situation after the protests and resolve the issue. Media also said preparations were being made for authorities and protesters to hold talks, without giving details.
Most of the protesters were young people voicing frustration at the government’s perceived failure to fight corruption and boost economic opportunities, leading to the demonstrations being dubbed the “Gen Z protests”.
The young agitators want former chief justice Karki as the interim prime minister, said Raman Kumar Karna, the secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Associ­a­tion, who was consulted by the protesters.
“When they requested me, I accepted,” Karki told Indian news channel CNN-News18.
“Gen Z” representatives told reporters that they met army officials later and proposed Karki as their choice to head an interim government.
Ministers’ homes set ablaze
Burnt-out vehicles and twisted metal littered the area around parliament, where army firefighters battled to douse a blaze in the main hall, while the building’s exterior was charred after protesters set it ablaze on Tuesday.
TV footage showed youths cleaning up some damaged buildings and clearing debris from roads and the areas near parliament.
Several other government buildings, from the supreme court to ministers’ homes, including Oli’s private residence, were also set ablaze in the protests, with the unrest subsiding only after the resignation.
Armoured vehicles kept vigil in streets that were largely deserted, with shops and markets shut. Firefighters were engaged at different locations, while the process of clearing roads was also under way, army spokesman Raja Ram Basnet said.
“We are trying to normalise the situation first. We are committed to protect the life and property of people,” Basnet said, adding that prisoners had set Kathmandu’s Dilli Bazar Jail on fire before the army controlled the situation.
Nepali police said on Wednesday that more than 13,500 prisoners broke out of jails across the country during anti-government protests this week.
The main airport in Kathmandu also reopened on Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said, more than 24 hours after flights had been suspended.
Army warns of ‘strict action’ In a post on X, the army said prohibitory orders imposing a curfew would remain in force until Thursday morning.
“Any demonstrations, vandalism, looting, arson, and attacks on individuals and property in the name of protest will be considered punishable crimes and strict action will be taken by security personnel,” the post said.
For years a lack of jobs has driven millions to seek work in countries such as Malaysia, the Middle East and South Korea, mainly on construction sites, so as to send money home.

A statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China said “responsible individuals” at the Instagram-like platform would be punished after Xiaohongshu, known as RedNote in English, failed to “fulfil its main responsibility of content management”.
It gave no details of the punishments.
The statement criticised Xiaohongshu for hosting “numerous posts hyping celebrities’ personal dynamics and trivial matters and other negative content frequently populating the hot search list”.
“A clear, clean and healthy cyberspace aligns with the interests of the people,” it added.
Xiaohongshu was launched in Shanghai in 2013 and has hundreds of millions of monthly active users.
It translates literally to Little Red Book, but is not a reference to Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong’s book of quotations.
Unlike TikTok’s sister app Douyin or the micro-blogging site Weibo, Xiaohongshu leans heavily towards apolitical content such as lifestyle, travel, beauty and food topics.
Xiaohongshu’s “Explore” page is similar to TikTok’s “For You” page – both curated by an algorithm that suggests content based on users’ interests and interactions on the platforms.
It is also an online marketplace similar to TikTok Shop, where users can directly buy items including clothing, make-up and accessories.
It is seen as relatively less censored than other platforms: users can be found posting LGBTQ content and discussing the merits of women remaining single, topics often considered sensitive in China.
Xiaohongshu has also popularised “da ka”, or “check-in” tourism, where travellers plan itineraries around scenic or trending spots specifically to take photos for social media.
And similar to Instagram and TikTok, the platform has also become a hub for influencers endorsing sponsored products.</p><small>2025-09-11 05:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/110953284dbdaf4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941143/conservative-influencer-charlie-kirk-shot-dead-manhunt-on-for-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk shot dead, manhunt on for suspect</strong></a><br><p>US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination.
Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people.
The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later.
State police issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.
“There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals,” the statement said. “There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.”
In a video message taped in the Oval Office and posted to Trump’s Truth Social online platform, the president vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.
“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it,” Trump said.
Cellphone video clips of the killing posted online showed Kirk addressing a large outdoor crowd on the campus, about 40 miles (64 km) south of Salt Lake City, around 12:20 pm MT (18:20 GMT or 23:20 PKT), when a gunshot rang out. Kirk moved his hand toward his neck as he fell off his chair, sending onlookers running.
In another clip, blood could be seen gushing from Kirk’s neck immediately after the shot.
Jeff Long, chief of the university police department, said he had six officers working the event and coordinated with the head of Kirk’s private security team, which was also on site. Trump ordered US flags flown at half-staff until Sunday in Kirk’s honour.
The killing was the latest in a series of attacks on US political figures, including two assassination attempts on Trump last year, that have underscored a sharp rise in political violence.
“This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,” Utah’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox said at the press conference. “I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.”
With the suspect still at large, there was no clear evidence of a motive for the act of violence.
Trump, who routinely describes political rivals, judges and others who stand in his way as “radical left lunatics” and warns that they pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric.
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” Trump said in the video. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”
On Capitol Hill in Washington, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the US House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing.
Kirk’s appearance on Wednesday was the first in a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.

Asked about shootings, then shot
Seconds before he was shot, the married father of two young children was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, according to multiple videos of the event posted online.
“Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked.
He responded, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” He was shot moments later.
Kirk and the group he co-founded, Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.
After winning his second presidential term, Trump credited Kirk for mobilising younger voters and voters of colour in support of his campaign.
“You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,” Trump said at a rally in Phoenix in December. “It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.”
Kirk had 5.3 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio program, “The Charlie Kirk Show.” He had also recently appeared as a guest co-host on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” He was part of an ecosystem of pro-Trump conservative influencers including Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens and others, who helped to amplify the president’s agenda.
Kirk frequently attacked mainstream media and engaged in culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.
At the White House, staff members, many of them young and admirers of Kirk, were ashen-faced as news of the shooting spread.

Political violence on the rise
Republican and Democratic politicians alike expressed dismay over the shooting.
Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement: “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values. We pray for his family during this tragedy.”
The US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
In July 2024, Republican Trump was grazed by a gunman’s bullet during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. A second assassination attempt two months later was foiled by federal agents, with opening arguments in that suspect’s trial set to begin on Thursday.
In April, an arsonist broke into Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.
Earlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic Senator John Hoffman and his wife. And in Boulder, Colorado, a man used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a solidarity event for Israeli hostages, killing one woman and injuring at least six more.
In 2022, a man broke into Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer, leaving him with skull fractures and other injuries.
In 2020, a group of right-wing militia members plotted unsuccessfully to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

• HRCP highlights plight of climate refugees
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has ente­red this year’s flood season with more substantial economic buffers than it had before the 2022-23 floods, but the country’s improved macroeconomic situation comes with new constraints, according to a `targeted analysis’ carried out by the Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWS) Network.
The analysis expects that the 2025 floods will primarily drive short-term, localised, food insecurity among flood-affected households.
Produced at the request of the US government as a part of FEWS NET’s global coverage, the report notes that this time, the flood response will be constrained by limited fiscal intervention capacity, in contrast to the emergency subsidies in 2022-23.
The 37-month IMF Extended Fund Facility explicitly prohibits the use of untargeted subsidies and market interventions that were used during the previous floods.
According to the analysis, increases of eight to 10 per cent in wheat prices are expected in coming months due to flood-related market supply disruptions, but will likely return to near-normal levels once affected roads are restored.
However, production losses of Kharif season crops due to flooding are expected, particularly for rice, sugarcane, cotton, and vegetables.
The government can deploy foreign reserves in the event that emergency imports are needed, and negative food inflation provides a substantial cushion against the level of price spikes that devastated household purchasing power in 2022, according to the analysis.
 
 

The ongoing floods are expected to affect the Kharif season, which started in April. While complete information on the extent of crop damage due to flooding is not yet available, early findings indicate a significant localised impact.
They are expected, however, to affect household income from agricultural labour and crop sales, particularly in Punjab, the report warns.
HRW report
In a separate statement, global rights watchdog Human Rights Watch has called upon the government to address unchecked development amid a changing climate.
It noted that unchecked development exacerbates the effects of floods, and one representative example is the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project, which the government launched in August 2020 to address Lahore’s many problems — pollution, sewage, water, housing and employment — while aiming to revive the city’s “lost glory”.
This is just the latest in a string of failures by successive governments in Pakistan to enact needed reforms and policies to regulate development, HRW said.
It assailed the government over its history of conducting “poor quality environmental assessments for politically connected infrastructure projects”.
“In this case, it ignored warnings by independent environmental activists and experts who called the project ecologically and financially unviable and argued that building barrages and other dams on the river and replacing farmland with paved concrete could swell water levels upstream and cause flooding.”
Today, most of the area earmarked for the project is submerged, along with parts of Lahore city itself, HRW regretted.
Protecting the vulnerable
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), has called for expanding the rescue and relief operations that are currently underway, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable segments.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the rights body highlighted the plight of climate refugees, who have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods.
“Particular attention must be given to the most vulnerable — women, children, the elderly and persons living with disabilities.”

According to industry leaders, industrial output remained subdued as workers failed to report for duty due to safety concerns and transportation issues.
Faisal Moiz Khan, President of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI), stated that nearly half of the 4,500 industrial units in the area remained closed. Workers were reluctant to return after the torrential rains in the third week of August left several people stranded in factories late into the night.
 


Additionally, around 100-125 factories in sectors A to D in F.B. Area, including export-oriented units, suffered damage as the swollen Lyari River inundated production facilities, destroying raw materials and finished goods worth millions of rupees.
Moiz pointed out that the overflow from Thado Dam had submerged roads leading to the Super Highway, exacerbating the city’s already struggling infrastructure. “The city faces serious problems during the rains due to poor infrastructure,” he added. NKATI represents 70 per cent of Karachi’s export-oriented industries.

Flooding destroys raw materials, disrupts supply chain

Ahmed Azeem Alvi, President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), echoed similar concerns, reporting that 60pc of workers in 3,500 factories did not report to work despite there being no significant road blockages. “A shortage of workers has led to a 25-30pc reduction in production activities,” Alvi said, adding that workers were hesitant to leave their homes due to fears of being unable to return if the rains worsened.
In the Korangi industrial area, which houses over 4,000 factories, the output was down by 30pc due to a low turnout of workers, who accounted for less than 50pc of the usual workforce.
Junaid Naqi, President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), mentioned that entry points to the area were closed in the morning, and workers were already on edge due to the overflow of Lyari and Malir rivers. Additionally, power disruptions, caused by tripping of feeder lines, further worsened the situation, leading to the suspension of multiple shifts.
 
 

Sheikh Mohammad Tehseen, President of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), said that production activities across industrial zones had been severely affected, with factory attendance down by 50-60pc.
“The supply chain has been disrupted, slowing down the delivery of raw materials and cargo shipments to seaports,” he added. Tehseen also urged the government to collaborate with industrial associations to restore business activities and normalise the economic cycle.
The e-commerce sector also faced challenges as logistical disruptions hindered the movement of goods. Shoaib Bhatti, President of the Pakistan eCommerce Association (PEA) Karachi, reported delays in shipments both domestically and internationally, with quick commerce services suspended in various parts of the city. Long electricity and internet outages further hampered online shopping services, causing losses for e-commerce businesses.
Rauf Ibrahim, Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), noted that 80-90pc of shops in key wholesale trade areas, including Dandia Bazaar, Jodia Bazaar, and Lea Market, remained closed.
The remaining 10-20pc of shops that were open closed by 2 pm due to the adverse weather conditions. The combined impact of heavy rains, flooding, and infrastructural limitations has caused widespread disruption in Karachi’s industrial and commercial sectors, with long-term effects expected if the situation does not improve soon.

Lyari and Malir rivers serve as Karachi’s main storm drains, channelling rainwater through a network of nullahs into the Arabian Sea. Once natural seasonal streams, they are now heavily constricted by urban sprawl, encroachments, and solid waste, turning many drains into open sewers. This blockage reduces their capacity to carry stormwater, causing frequent urban flooding during monsoon downpours.
Four more people died in rain-related incidents in the metropolis today, raising the death toll since yesterday to eight, while three were missing, according to rescue services.
Edhi rescuers recovered the bodies of three men and a woman after a van carrying four people fell into the rain-filled Konkar Nadi in Gadap Town, a statement issued by the Edhi Foundation said.
The rescue operation to find the other missing people was underway, the spokesperson added.
Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the body of an 18-year-old man, identified as Ahmed Qadir, was brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital from North Nazimabad’s Block-C after he “died of an electric shock”.
A man was saved alive and the search for another was underway after the two went missing in the Malir river, a statement issued by Rescue 1122 said.
The man rescued was identified as Mustafa Ali Gul, while Farhan Akram remained missing. Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad and the Malir deputy commissioner were present on the site, Rescue 1122 added.
 






Two others were rescued alive after they were trapped in the Lyari river, Rescue 1122 said in a statement, shared by the Sindh Information Department.
 






Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah refuted rumours of the operational section of Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway (Malir Expressway) caving in or being breached to divert waters.
Asked about a video being shared on social media that showed a paved section caving in during a media talk in Karachi, CM Shah explained: “Malir Expressway is under construction at that place. A bund is being built properly on the river, so when water from the river comes and it (the bund) is incomplete, then the water will pass through some location or another.
“That is it. There is no issue,” he added, advising people to “use their energy” for a better cause.
The CM’s spokesperson, Abdul Rasheed Channa, also issued a statement refuting reports of Shahrah-i-Bhutto caving in, saying: “It is not [a] real picture.”

A further statement from the chief minister’s spokesperson said there was “no truth” to the news of an operational part of the highway being washed away.
“The unpaved part of Shahrah-i-Bhutto has sunk down in the rainwater, and work is still ongoing. This is the part of Shahrah-i-Bhutto that has collapsed and neither a retaining wall has been built nor stone pitching has been done. This is part of the Malir section, which is under construction and is not yet open to traffic,” the statement said.
It added that sections of the road that were open for traffic were still being used by the public.
 






According to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) data as of 8pm, Karachi received the highest amount of rainfall in Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 7 (32.6 millimetres).
PAF Masoor Base recorded 20mm, Keamari 19mm, Korangi 18.9mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 16.9mm, Surjani Town 13.8mm, North Karachi 12.8mm, University Road and Orangi Town 11.8mm, Airport Old Area 11.5mm, PAF Faisal Base 11mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 8mm, Saadi Town 7.7mm, Jinnah Terminal 5.2mm, Nazimabad 5mm and Bahria Town 3.4mm.
Water enters Saadi Town; 318 relocated from near Malir river
Separately, CM Shah visited various locations across Karachi — including the Lyari river, Jinnah Avenue, Saadi Town and Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway — to review water drainage following the rains.
Footage from DawnNewsTV showed that the road linking Superhighway to Thado Dam was inundated, with water gushing into a stream and people gathered near the spot.
 


The Sindh CM, accompanied by Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, visited the flooded Saadi Town through the Malir Cantonment route, the provincial Information Department said on X.
“The water entered Saadi Town due to overflow of the Lath and Thado Dams,” the chief minister was informed. He met with the local residents and directed authorities to carry out speedy water drainage.
During his visit to Jinnah Avenue, CM Shah “inspected the drainage of water from the dams via Mehran Nala and reviewed the machinery deployed for dewatering”, the Information Department said.
 






In a statement detailing his visit to the Lyari river, the chief minister was quoted as saying that the flow of water in the Lyari river was “high, but the flows are running smoothly”.
He explained that the river began from the mountains of Manghopir and Gadap, gathering rainwater from those areas. “The Lyari river passes through Orangi Town, SITE area, Nazimabad, Liaquatabad, Gulbahar, Lyari Town, Kharadar, Meethadar and West Wharf, and then reaches the port.”
 






CM Shah, Ghani and Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also visited the Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway, which is expected to be completed by the year’s end, and the Qayyumabad Chowk near Korangi Causeway.
Separately, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X earlier today, said that so far, 318 people have been “rescued [and] moved to safe [places] from around the [areas] close to Lyari Naddi and teams are still present on ground”.
“All major arteries of the city as well as underpasses are clear and open for traffic,” he asserted.
 






In Saadi Town, joint efforts by Rescue 1122 and the Pakistan Army resulted in the rescue of 10 people, Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said in a statement.
“Near Saima Society, two men, three women and six children were safely moved,” Khan told Dawn.com. “Eight people were trapped in Nashr Basti and Isa Nagri due to waterlogging,” he added.
Memon said large-scale rescue and relief operations were underway in view of the recent rains and rising water in the rivers. “The situation in Karachi after the rains is gradually improving. Due to the filling of the dam and heavy rains, the Lyari and Malir rivers overflowed,” he said.
Schools to remain closed today
Meanwhile, the Sindh government has ordered the closure of all educational institutions across the Karachi Division following heavy monsoon rains and a forecast of further showers.
“All the educational institutions (public/private) will remain closed within the territorial jurisdiction of Karachi Division,” said a notification by the Karachi commissioner, dated September 9.
 






The PMD said in its weather forecast for today that yesterday’s depression over southwest Sindh moved nearly westwards and was now lying 60 kilometres west of Karachi.
“It is likely to move further westwards and gradually weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area in next couple of hours. Under its influence: light to moderate rainfalls are expected in Karachi division, Jamshoro, Thatta and Sujawal districts today,” the PMD said, adding that hot and humid weather was expected in most parts of the province.
It said the weather forecast for Karachi division for Thursday was partly cloudy and humid with
chances of drizzle/light rain and partly cloudy and humid on Friday.
Memon said a new spell of rain was predicted in 24-48 hours, adding that the Sindh government was on full alert. “If there is no more rain, the situation will return to normal in a few hours,” he said.
Several hundred straw-mud houses in the rural areas of Tharparkar and Dadu districts were swept away as the two districts had been receiving intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells of monsoon rains for the last six and four days, respectively.
PM directs NDMA to expedite relief activities in flood-affected areas of Sindh
Taking notice of the flood situation in Karachi and other areas of Sindh, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to fully cooperate with the provincial government and Sindh Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) in relief operations.
The prime minister also appreciated the active rescue operations being carried out by Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and Rangers in Karachi.
According to a press statement issued by the PM Office, the prime minister also expressed sorrow over the drowning of citizens in the Gadap stream.
The prime minister instructed relevant authorities to locate the missing persons in the floods as soon as possible.
“The awareness campaign should be further activated to inform the public about the flood situation to protect as many citizens as possible,” he added.
The premier also directed authorities to take immediate steps to restore the flood-affected communication infrastructure.
“The federal and Sindh governments are fully mobilised to deal with the flood situation,” he said, emphasising that the relief and rehabilitation of families affected by the floods in Karachi must be prioritised.</p><small>2025-09-11 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11092628c5d908b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941099/interfaith-body-set-up-to-tackle-hate-speech-extremism' target='_blank'><strong>Interfaith body set up to tackle hate speech, extremism</strong></a><br><p>
National Paigham-i-Aman body is a subcommittee of National Committee
on Narrative Building
Senate committee alarmed by misuse of Peca by provinces

ISLAMABAD: The government has notified a special panel — comprising clerics, religious leaders of non-Muslim communities and senior officials — to counter extremism, hate speech, terrorism and sectarianism in the country.
The Ministry of Information has set up the National Paigham-i-Aman Commit­tee (NPAC), which will draft a unified national stance against extremism and terrorism.
The NPAC, a subcommittee of the National Committee on Narrative Building (NCNB), has been tasked with devising a unified national narrative that promotes peace, harmony and religious moderation.
The NCNB, which was notified earlier this month, is a 20-member body that includes the information ministers of all four provinces, GB and AJK, as well as federal minister. It also includes representatives of the military, intelligence agencies, the foreign and IT ministries, as well as the PTA chairman.
It is meant to deal with “information operation, formulation, dissemination, propagation and evaluation of [the] national narrative against the spread of terrorism [or] extremism through media, communication and cyber networks for smooth implementation of Revised National Action Plan 2021,” according to a notification.
Meanwhile, the director general of the Internal Publicity Wing of the information ministry will serve as the NPAC secretary, while Maulana Tahir Ashrafi has been appointed its coordinator.
 
 

The committee’s first meeting will focus on formulating its terms of reference, which will be submitted to the NCNB for approval.
Speaking to Dawn, Allama Arif Wahidi said the committee could be seen as an extension of the Paigham-i-Pakistan initiative, launched in 2018. “The Paigham-i-Pakistan narrative was the theoretical step to counter religious extremism. The target of this committee is to implement the idea and devise practical steps to stop the dividing forces in society,” he said, adding that these steps would also be implemented by provinces.
Allama Tahir Ashrafi told Dawn that the move reflected the government’s intent to adopt a more inclusive and strategic approach to peacebuilding through institutional coordination. He added that the initiative aims to centralise national efforts to craft and disseminate a cohesive narrative countering extremism in multiple dimensions — religious, sectarian and ideological.
Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee voiced reservations after being informed that provinces were still registering cybercrime cases under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), despite amendments barring them from doing so.
 
 

The Senate Standing Committee on Information, while reviewing the implementation of Peca, expressed concern that the law was being misused.
Director general of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the committee, chaired by Senator Syed Ali Zafar, that 10 journalists were currently facing cases under Peca, adding that 611 cases of financial fraud and 320 of harassment were also under investigation.
The committee members noted that under recent amendments, the provinces were no longer authorised to register cases under to Peca 2025, which must now be referred to the NCCIA. The officials said that any cases filed by provincial authorities after the amendment were invalid. “All these cases are illegal — now what should we do with them?” asked the committee chairman.
The lawmakers decided to form a subcommittee to review the issue of illegal case registrations. Senator Zafar ruled that 378 cases registered under Peca by provincial authorities were unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

While governments may not always recognise it, we are bound by an ecosystem that inextricably links our resilience through shared climate realities from one end of South Asia to the other.
Shared ecosystems
1) Rivers: The Indus River system serves as a central artery for India and Pakistan, comprising six major tributaries: eastern (Beas, Ravi, Sutlej) and western (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).
These sha­red waters account for over 90 per cent of Pakis­tan’s agricultural use and support seven Indian states and territories: Punjab, Haryana, Chandi­garh, Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, Rajas­than, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. Heavy monsoons and poor transboundary management are increasingly causing deadly flooding in the Punjab and Sindh floodplains.
2) Mountains: The Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan ranges have interconnected geological features. The Himalayan watershed exte­nds across northern India through occupied J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Ar­­u­nachal Pradesh, extending westward from Pak­is­­tan.
 
 

The Karakoram lies primarily in Gilgit-Bal­tistan and extends into disputed Ladakh and Aksai Chin. The Hindukush runs through Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan, merging with the Karakoram at its eastern end.
These three ranges converge near Jaglot in northern Pakistan, where the Gilgit and Indus rivers meet. This complex system houses some of the world’s largest glaciers and has become a hotspot for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), creating a geologically volatile landscape.

Only coordinated Indo-Pakistani climate governance can prevent downstream disasters.

3) Deserts: The Thar desert spans India and Pakistan, spreading desertification and drought in both countries.
This arid subtropical desert ex­­p­­eriences low irregular rainfall, soil erosion and water scarcity, driving demand for inter-basin tra­nsfers like the Beas–Bikaner and Indira Gandhi canals. Most of this desert lies in India, primarily Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana. The remainder extends into Pakistan’s drought-prone districts in Sindh and Punjab. The Pakistani Punjab portion is known as the Cholistan desert.
4) Coasts: This maritime climate zone affects monsoon patterns, cyclones and ocean currents impacting India and Pakistan’s coastal weather.
 
 

Pakistan faces transboundary threats from powerful Arabian Sea tropical cyclones along India’s 2,500-kilometre western coastline.
Recent years have seen increased storm frequency and intensity, creating growing shared risks.
5) Delta: The vast Indus delta mangroves are also divided. From Thatta, Badin, Sajawal and Karachi to India’s Gujarat coast, these mangroves depend on the Arabian Sea’s tidal waters and freshwater flows of the Indus that regulate salt levels, sediment and nutrients essential for growth.
The Rann of Kutch also straddles the border, with the larger portion in Gujarat and a smaller part in Sindh. It serves as a seasonal flooding basin during the monsoons, transforming itself from desert to marsh.
6) Interconnectedness: Climate disasters create predictable chain reactions: upstream heatwaves trigger downstream flooding, mountain glacial bursts cause delta flooding, and Arabian Sea storms affect the entire coastal ecosystem.
Almost all climate-triggered events when originating in Indian states or held territory, cascade downstream to Pakistan. This upstream-downstream dynamic creates disaster chains that demand anticipatory joint management as the following three case studies demonstrate:
a) Kashmir floods: In September 2014, unprecedented floods caused by heavy post-monsoon rains devastated the Kashmir region and downstream areas on both sides.
The disaster originated from Indian-held Kashmir’s meteorological conditions, with the Jhelum and Chenab swelling beyond danger levels, submerging Srinagar and numerous villages. The floods then followed the natural downstream flow into Pakistani Punjab, affecting over 1.1 million people and inundating more than 700 villages. Floodwaters breached riverbanks, displacing millions and causing deaths. This disaster demonstrated Pakistan’s vulnerability to upstream water management decisions and underscored the urgent need for shared early warning systems.
b) Transboundary heatwave: The spring 2022 heatwave originated in India’s northern plains before sweeping into Pakistan, breaking temperature records and reaching over 49 degrees Celsius in parts of Pakistan.
In India, the heatwave severely damaged the wheat crop, reducing yields and spiking global wheat prices. As the heatwave moved downstream to Pakistan, it triggered accelerated glacier melt leading to Glofs and intensified rains that worsened the floods, submerging a third of the country and displacing millions. This event exemplified how atmospheric extremes originating upstream create compounding climate impacts downstream.
c) Arabian Sea cyclones: Tropical cyclones for­ming in the Arabian Sea develop closer to India’s longer coastline before affecting Pakistan, following weather pattern movements. Cyclone Kyarr (2019), while not making landfall, caused coastal flooding and tidal surges in Maharashtra and Gujarat before impacting Sindh and Balochistan.
Cyclone Tauktae (2021), one of the deadliest cyc­lones in the Arabian Sea, devastated India’s west coast before bringing destructive rain and ferocious winds, forcing evacuations and causing infrastructure disruptions. These events show how climate threats move from upstream origins to downstream impacts.
Global lessons
Despite having no diplomatic relations since 1993, Armenia and Türkiye demonstrate that shared dam management is possible even amid hostile political tensions, operating the Arpaçay Dam through monthly meetings that maintain equitable water-sharing based on agreements of 1927.
Conversely, Ethiopia’s unilateral construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without downstream consent created permanent regional tensions with Egypt and Sudan, demonstrating precisely the type of conflict that cooperative management could prevent.
These shared ecological realities demand im­­mediate joint climate management between India and Pakistan. Each case study demonstrates how disasters originating in India cascade downstream to Pakistan, making collaborative early warning systems and shared water infrastructure management essential for Pakistan’s resilience. Without joint management of upstream barrages and da­­ms, Pakistan remains dangerously vulnerable to decisions made by upstream floodgate controllers.
A major lesson from the 2025 floods emerges: only coordinated Indo-Pakistani climate governance can prevent downstream disasters and eliminate suspicions of water terrorism. Joint management of upstream water infrastructure would ensure transparent, cooperative responses to extreme weather events, protecting both nations while building trust. The alternative is a continuation of cascading disasters that neither country can manage by itself.

Iran agreed a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Tuesday, af­­t­er it suspended cooperation following its war with Israel in June.
The 12-day war saw Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nucl­ear facilities, which the IAEA has not been able to access since.
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the agreed document “provides for a clear understanding of the procedures for inspections”.

UN nuclear watchdog says deal covers ‘all facilities’;  Iran’s FM says inspections require separate negotiations

It “includes all facilities and installations in Iran, and it also contemplates the required reporting on all the attacked facilities, including the nuclear material present at those”, Grossi told the Vienna-based agency’s Board of Governors meeting.
Iran’s stance
But Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi appe­ared to downplay the extent of the deal, saying the agreement itself “does not create access” for IAEA inspectors.
Araghchi said in an interview aired Wednesday that “currently no access is given to the IAEA inspectors”.
“Based on the reports that Iran will provide later, the type of access should be negotiated in due course,” he added.
The most recent inspection did not include access to other key sites, including Fordo and Natanz, which were hit in the June strikes.
“Iran and the agency will now resume cooperation in a respectful and comprehensive way,” Grossi told the board meeting, adding the “practical steps… need to be implemented now”. “There may be difficulties and issues to be resolved for sure, but we now know what we have to do,” he added.

In a telephone call with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Rubio “emphasised the importance of open and constructive communication on a range of bilateral issues”, the State Department said.
Rubio as a senator was known for his tough line on China and in his confirmation hearing warned of an all-out global struggle to prevent Beijing from outpacing the United States as the pre-eminent global power.
Rubio met Wang in July on the sidelines of the Asean Regional Forum in Malaysia, in a meeting both sides described as positive and constructive, despite tension over Washington’s tariffs. Rubio said at the time that the odds of US President Donald Trump meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping were high.
 
 

The rise of global trade barriers since Trump’s return to the presidency has exacerbated challenges for China’s export-driven economy. While US and China in August extended a truce for 90 days, President Trump urged EU officials on Tuesday to hit China with tariffs of up to 100pc as part of a strategy to pressure Russia to end Ukraine war.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s regime in Sri Lanka fell in July 2022, when mobs enraged by the severity of the crisis brought on by sovereign default a few months earlier stormed the presidential palace, forcing the president and his ministers to flee the country.
Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government in Bangladesh fell before a mob of students that marched on her residence in Dhaka two years later in August 2024. And now Nepal, where the prime minister has resigned as violent mobs of youth burned down the parliament building and overran the residences not only of the government leadership but other political figures as well.
It is hard to escape the impression that all three episodes of a popular uprising causing the countries’ leadership to abdicate authority and flee are connected in some way. The points of divergence are obvious and visible. The immediate trigger in Sri Lanka was the severe degradation of life brought on by sharp economic deterioration after a default. This included food and energy shortages, spiking inflation and mass unemployment.
 
 

In Bangladesh, the immediate trigger seemed to be an announcement about quotas for government jobs, something that was a burning issue in that country for many years as Sheikh Hasina used these quotas to entrench her power by assigning them to loyalist groups. In Nepal, the immediate trigger appeared to be the shutdown of social media sites by the government, though the intensity and ferocity of the uprising seemed to suggest deeper frustrations being vented.
The three uprisings in three years were all organic, in the sense there was no party vanguard, no organising force making them happen. The mobs did not consist of people brought in convoys of buses supplied by a political party, nor did they have a leadership at the helm, except perhaps a loosely knit group of student leaders that messaged out to everyone else. None of these uprisings were built on organised crowds, mobilised by party leaders, transported on vehicles supplied by the party or fuelled by speeches on loudspeakers delivered by party leaders riding in party-supplied cars.
This is the key thing to understand about these uprisings. How did the trigger event lead to the formation of such a large mob so fast?
 
 

This can only happen if there are some common elements binding all the people who joined the mob in the first place. This can include disaffection with the material conditions of life, perhaps following a protracted bout of inflation that burned away large amounts of purchasing power and left the people to fend for themselves in the face of the awful choices that grinding austerity thrusts upon us. Or it can be large-scale loss of trust in the institutions of society, where even a fake news item can trigger mass solidarities of the sort it takes to make an uprising.

The uprisings in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal were all organic.

In Sri Lanka, the trigger was a sudden overnight power blackout for a population already reeling from the effects of sharply rising fuel prices. In June 2021, for instance, the government had sharply raised the price of petrol for the first time in many years, bringing it to Sri Lankan rupees157. From there onwards, till the month of default in March 2022, the price had reached Rs338. In July, when the uprising hit, it had reached Rs450.
This is a near tripling of the price of an essential fuel in one year. For perspective, it took almost two decades for the same price to triple in Sri Lanka, going from somewhere around Rs50 in the mid-1990s to around Rs150 in the mid-2010s. For this price to do in one year what it took 20 to do in years past is evidence of a massive shock to the purchasing power of the masses.
 
 

In Bangladesh, a key role seems have been played by unemployment. That country always had high rates of youth unemployment, and even higher rates of graduate unemployment. Among university graduates, government jobs were always deeply aspirational. The pandemic was the first shock to employment, especially among the youth.
This trend seems to have dovetailed with the growing centralisation of power by Sheikh Hasina, in which quotas for government jobs were reserved for her party loyalists only. The resentment this built, blew up in July 2024 when the high court issued a questionable judgement reinstating a controversial quota system that handed over government jobs to Hasina loyalists. Following the uprising, the judges who authored that judgement were removed from service.
It is too early to say what lay behind the Nepal uprising. But in time it will become clear what conditions created the large-scale disaffection that needed only a single trigger to ignite. The generalised anger among the youth — who comprised the rank and file of that movement — against the entire political class shows the anger had deep wellsprings.
In Pakistan, the ground is quite fertile for something similar to happen. The speed with which protests by schoolchildren spread across Punjab following a fake rumour about a female student having been a victim of a violent crime shows that such organic crowds can form rapidly here too, without direction from any party.
 
 

It would be hard for such a mob to march on the capital, since unlike the other three countries, Pakistan’s capital is a long distance away from population centres (except Rawalpindi). But provincial capitals are still vulnerable.
The long bout of inflation that has eaten away more than a third of people’s household income in some cases, coupled with the very low levels of trust in government institutions, sets the stage for such an event here. This is why recourse to repression must be tempered, and a credible focus on employment creation must become a government priority.

It is a strategic earthquake.
On Tuesday, Israeli jets struck a residential compound in Doha, targeting Hamas’s exiled leadership as they met to consider a US-backed Gaza ceasefire proposal. Based in Qatar since earlier assassinations forced them abroad, these men make up the group’s political bureau. The targeted leaders survived; others did not. Among the dead were bodyguards, aides and a Qatari officer.
 
 

A dangerous precedent has been set. For the first time, Israel has carried its campaign far beyond the battlefields of Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran, into the territory of one of the US’s closest Arab partners.
For years, Israel has treated its confrontation with Iran and its allies as a roving conflict without frontiers. Hezbollah in Lebanon, the former Assad regime in Syria, Houthi forces in Yemen, even Iranian soil itself — all have felt the reach of Israeli air strikes, assassinations and sabotage. Such operations, though destabilising, were often framed as part of a shadow war between two regional rivals, and tolerated by outsiders so long as they were confined to that axis.
But Qatar is no Iranian proxy. It is a wealthy Gulf emirate, host to America’s largest military base in the Middle East, and a ‘major non-Nato ally’ formally recognised by Washington. By striking in Doha, Israel has crossed a line with profound implications for regional security. It marks the first attack inside a Gulf monarchy, a symbolic escalation that will alarm every Arab capital and force uncomfortable questions about whether any state’s sovereignty is truly respected. Qatar, like Turkey and Egypt, has acted as a mediator in ceasefire talks. To bomb its capital while negotiations are underway is to undermine diplomacy itself.
 
 

It could also entangle the US, a prospect that some might even deem necessary if America is to knock some sense into Israel. Washington was reportedly briefed in advance, but Britain and other allies were not. The perception that Israel acts with impunity, heedless of the sovereignty of a partner as close as Qatar, will fuel Arab suspicions that the West cannot or will not rein it in.
The OIC and Arab League should draw the obvious conclusion. For decades they have responded to Israeli aggression with words and resolutions. And it is precisely this pattern of hollow declarations that has emboldened Tel Aviv’s war machine. Unless there is collective resolve — economic boycotts, diplomatic isolation, suspension of normalisation — Israel will continue to export its Gaza war across borders. So long as the belligerent state acts unchecked, no country, however distant, is immune. Today’s blow in Doha may become tomorrow’s strike in Cairo, Riyadh or beyond.

The demonstrators vented their anger against Macron, who is already facing political turmoil after the parliamentary opposition united to defeat his government on Monday.
Tens of thousands of security forces who had been deployed across the country removed blockades as fast as possible, officials said, meaning that France was, for now, not blocked despite some scuffles.
The president appointed a close ally as his new prime minister, conservative Sebastien Lecornu, who took office facing the same challenge to rein in France’s ballooning debt as his predecessor.

New PM promises a ‘profound break’ with past policies

“It’s the same shit, it’s the same, it’s Macron who’s the problem, not the ministers,” Fred, a representative for the RATP public transport branch of the CGT union, said at a protest in Paris. “He has to go.”
In Paris, police fired tear gas on youths blocking the entrance to a high school and firefighters removed burnt objects from a barricade.
Police said they had stopped a large group of about 1,000 protesters from entering the Gare du Nord train station in the city.
“I was expecting either a dissolution (of parliament) or a left-wing prime minister and we have neither, it’s frustrating,” said 18-year-old student Lisa Venier, who was among the protesters near the Gare du Nord.
Protesters torched a bus in the western city of Rennes, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told reporters. He also said some protesters had attacked police with heavy cobblestones, but did not specify where.
Retailleau warned that protest rallies scheduled for later in the day could be infiltrated by hard-line, ultra-left groups and become violent.
The “Block Everything” movement — a broad expression of discontent that has no centralised leadership and is organised in ad hoc fashion on social media — sprung up online in May among right-wing groups, researchers and officials said, but has since been taken over by the left and far-left.
The movement reflects popular discontent with a dysfunctional ruling elite preaching a painful gospel of austerity. It is drawing comparisons to the 2018 “Yellow Vest” protests, which arose over fuel price hikes but morphed into a broader movement against Macron and his plans for economic reform.
Anger over budget cuts
A teacher taking part in the protests in Paris said he was against the budget cuts that Prime Minis­ter Francois Bayrou had planned and that led to his defeat in Mon­day’s parliamentary confidence vote.
“Bayrou was ousted, (now) his policies must be eliminated,” said teacher Christophe Lalande, calling for more funding for schools and hospitals.
At another protest in the city, unionist Amar Lagha said: “This day is a message to all the workers of this country: that there is no resignation, the fight continues.” In the western city of Nantes, protesters blocked a highway with burning tires and bins. Police used teargas to disperse people trying to occupy a roundabout.
New French PM
France’s new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu on Wednesday promised a “profound break” with the past as he took over from Francois Bayrou who resigned after losing a confidence vote in parliament.
Speaking at a handover ceremony, Lecornu promised to find “more creative” ways than before to work with opposition parties as he assembles his cabinet, in a bid to end the political crisis.

“Pakistan today assumed the chair of the Shanghai Coope­ra­tion Organisation’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure for 2025-26,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement after the 44th meeting of the RATS council in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyz Republic, decided to pass the chairmanship to Islamabad.
Pakistan welcomed the decision, calling it “a reflection of the confidence of SCO member states in Pakistan’s dedicated efforts and contribution towards regio­nal peace and security, particularly in combating terrorism”.
The FO said Islamabad would work to foster regional cooperation “guided by the Shanghai spirit of mutual trust, equality, and shared responsibility”.
 






The Tashkent-based RATS was created to coordinate counter-te­r­rorism, counter-separatism, and counter-extremism efforts amo­ng SCO members. Its mandate includes intelligence sharing, bu­­ilding databases of banned grou­­ps, joint drills, extradition arran­gements and coordinated operations.
 
 

But progress has often been constrained by political tensions, particularly between Pakistan and India as the Kashmir dispute and terrorism allegations have repeatedly undermined RATS initiatives.
During India’s 2022 chairmanship, efforts to expand a shared intelligence database stalled over disagreements, while participation in RATS-led drills and events has been inconsistent.
Meetings in 2023 and 2025 also saw public exchanges of accusations between the two countries, leaving China and Russia to play balancing roles.
Analysts say such disputes have eroded RATS’s neutrality and limited its ability to function as a seamless multilateral platform.
Despite these challenges, Pakistan pledged to work with SCO partners, international organisations and the United Nations to advance collective counter-terrorism efforts.
The Foreign Office said Pakistan would host events on cyber counterterrorism, information operations, border security, terrorist financing and capacity-building during its tenure.
“In order to develop cooperation, it is planned to hold expert events on the territory of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, including a practical seminar in the area of countering the use of the internet for terrorist, separatist and extremist purposes,” RATS Council said in an information note on the meeting in Kyrgyzstan.
The RATS Council, in its meeting, also approved plans for an executive cxommittee and expert groups, including measures to curb terrorist financing and prevent extremist movements across SCO states.
Members agreed to hold joint information campaigns against international terrorist organisations next year.
In a statement, the council condemned terrorist attacks committed this year on SCO territories, as well as military strikes on civilian facilities and Iran’s nuclear energy infrastructure, echoing language in the Tianjin Declaration of SCO heads of state.

The Anti-Terrorism Balochistan (Amendment) Bill 2025 was tabled by Parliamentary Secretary Mir Zareen Khan Magsi on behalf of the provincial home department, whose minister in-charge is Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.
The bill said it aimed to strengthen the counter-terrorism framework in accordance with international standards. “In light of the evolving security challenges and the sensitive nature of terrorism related cases, the bill see­ks to empower the government to implement add­i­tional protective measures for the safety and security of judges, public prosecutors, defence counsels, witnesses, and other individuals involved in such proceedings,” it said.
The bill introduces a procedure for handling “sensitive terrorism-related cases through a confidentially appointed BS-21 officer”. This officer, who will remain anonymous, would determine whether a case required extraordinary protection under this new iteration of the anti-terrorism measures.
“If so, the chief justice concerned constitutes a panel of five judges and forwards it to the designated authority, who then assigns the case to judge selected from that panel”.
A similar procedure will be adopted for prosecutors from a panel of five in consultation with the prosecutor general concerned. The new amendment also “enables the use of anonymity protocols” as well as virtual proceedings, besides advanced security technologies to safeguard all participants in the trial process.
Similarly, the identities of all those involved in the trial will remain hidden for security purposes and if a courtroom “is used for physical hearings, it shall be situated in secure premises, accessible only to judges, counsels, public prosecutors, witnesses, defence counsels and persons concerned with the trial”.
 
 

Under this bill, the “designated authority” shall be nominated by the provincial government and its identity “shall be kept confidential and shall only be communicated to the chief justice”.
The authority will consult with the chief justice for performing functions, such as deciding whether a case or a class of cases requires extraordinary protection measures, assigning cases to the judges; and consulting and coordinating with the Balochistan government.
“These measures aim to preserve judicial independence, uphold due process, and ensure the effective prosecution of terrorism related offences,” the bill read.
Opposition concerned
JI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman warned that the proposed law would undermine justice and human rights. “We will now serve justice through WhatsApp,” he quipped. According to the JI leader, if any innocent person were killed under the new law, the current government would be responsible. He said that instead of bringing this law, reforms should be introduced in the judiciary. “This law is a murder of human rights and justice,” he claimed.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti defended the bill. He said the counter-terrorism law would not be used against political workers, but solely to punish terrorists in accordance with the law. CM Bugti emphasised that the bill did not deny fair trial rights, and defence lawyers would have access to witnesses before judges.
On the issue of missing persons, the chief minister pledged that the government would permanently resolve the matter through legislation. “Any person arrested will be immediately reported to their family and the magistrate,” he assured. CM Bugti also announced strict action against poppy cultivation, revealing that 35,000 acres of poppy had already been destroyed this year. He vowed to confiscate lands given to Afghan cultivators and end illegal trawling in Makran, calling it “another form of terrorism”.
Levies-police merger
The provincial assembly also passed the Balochistan Forensic Science (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Balochistan Levies Force Bill 2025 under which the Levies would be merged into the Balochistan police.The Maulana argued that the bill required further consultations. Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani, however, noted that the government had invited the opposition for dialogue but could not force their participation.

“In view of the sensitivities attached to the highest institution like the judiciary, it is my humble request to all honourable judges that the best forums for expressing grievances are their tea rooms, the chambers of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, or the committee rooms,” he said.
This marked the minister’s first response to a recent series of letters written by several Supreme Court judges — a development he termed “unfortunate” and part of a troubling trend that has emerged in recent months.
Speaking informally to the media after attending a ceremony outside the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Islamabad, the law minister recalled that even during the New Judicial Year ceremony earlier in the week, apex legal bodies such as the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association had advised judges to resolve such issues privately rather than through public correspondence.
 
 

“This is not in the interest of the judiciary, as such tendencies erode the dignity and reputation of the top court,” he remarked.
He added that if the concerns raised in these letters were genuinely reflective of the internal situation, it was all the more reason to resolve them within institutional boundaries. “Bar councils have always been at the forefront when it comes to safeguarding the judiciary,” he noted, suggesting that lawyers’ bodies remain the appropriate avenue for internal accountability.
The minister’s comments come in the wake of a recent letter by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, along with Justices Munib Akhtar, Ayesha A. Malik, and Athar Minallah, criticizing the convening of Monday’s full court meeting to approve the new Supreme Court Rules 2025 as a mere “cosmetic exercise.”
“The convening of the full court at this stage is not only puzzling but also fallacious,” the judges wrote, alleging that the meeting was intended to give a “veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process.” In a prior letter, Justice Shah questioned whether the CJP was fostering judicial independence or seeking compliance to turn the court into a “regimented force.”
He expressed reluctance in writing the letter but felt compelled by what he described as an “unavoidable institutional duty.” “What compels me to write is your persistent and complete indifference,” he wrote, lamenting that his repe­ated letters and communications on crucial matters had gone unanswered.

• Pakistan, Algeria and Somalia request emergency Security Council session
• MBS, UAE ruler also back Qatar; Canada says will ‘evaluate’ ties with Israel
DOHA / ISLAMABAD / JERUSALEM: As the world rallied around Qatar after Israel’s reckless targeting of Hamas leaders on its soil, it’s leader declared that Benjamin Netanyahu had been wasting their time with the mediation process.
Doha and Egypt have been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
But despite their best efforts, and great flexibility demonstrated by Hamas, Isra­el has repeatedly moved the goalpost, and ‘ghosted’ neg­o­tiators after the Palesti­nian group agreed to the last draft, already vetted by the US.
Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohamed bin Abd­ulrahman Al Thani said the Israeli PM was leading the Middle East towards chaos, adding that today, the entire Gulf region was at risk.
He also revealed that in the wake of the Israeli aggression, Qatar was reassessing everything about its mediating role in the Gaza conflict — as well as Hamas’ future on its territory.
The Qatari PM’s remarks came as the world bristled over Israel’s unprovoked attack, which claimed the lives of at least five members of Hamas’ negotiating team.
Even its most staunch ally, the United States, seemed to waver, with President Donald Trump giving Netanyahu a rare slap on the wrist while denying any role in the attack.
Trump said he was not notified in advance of the Israeli attack on the Gulf state, and said he wasn’t “thrilled about the whole situation”.
Qatar, in addition to its role in the Gaza negotiations, is home to a huge US airbase, and also recently gave Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
“This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” Trump said in a post on social media, insisting that he viewed Qatar as a strong ally and friend.
Trump also focused on the possible damage to his efforts to end the war in Gaza, saying that unilaterally bombing Qatar does not advance Israel or America’s goals.
The US president added that he had assured Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in a phone call that “such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”
Israel, however, doubled down, insisting that it would strike its enemies anywhere in the world.
“There is no place where they can hide,” Defence Minister Isr­ael Katz wrote on X, while Isra­eli ambassador to the US Yech­iel Leiter told Fox News that even if they failed to kill Hamas leaders in Tuesday’s airstrike, the would “succeed next time”.
World rallies around Doha
Pakistan on Wednesday joined Algeria and Somalia in convening an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council and backed calls for a summit of Muslim countries after Israel carried out air strikes in Doha targeting a Hamas delegation of peace negotiators.
The UNSC session, initially scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, was postponed after Qatar requested rescheduling to allow its Prime Minister to attend. The meeting is now set for Thursday.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan had formally requested an urgent UN Security Council session to take up Israel’s “aggression against Qatar as a grave threat to international peace and security”.
He also called on the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, on behalf of the Org­anisation of Islamic Coo­peration (OIC) and in coordination with Gulf states, to hold a debate on the strikes.
The upcoming UNSC meeting is expected to address the serious implications of the Israeli escalation and discuss appropriate international resp­onses.
Saudi Crown Prince Moha­mmed Bin Salman also came out in support of Doha, saying that Riyadh rejected and condemned Israel’s “assaults” in the region.
 
 

“The brutal aggression against the sisterly state of Qatar requires Arab, Islamic and international action,” he said in a televised address, calling on the international community to confront Israeli aggression.
Meanwhile, the attack generated a flurry of diplomacy between Arab states. United Arab Emirates President She­ikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan led a delegation of some of his most senior ministers to Qatar on Wednesday, where he met with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and his cabinet.
Jordan’s Crown Prince Huss­ein is also expected to visit Qatar, while the Saudi crown prince is expected to arrive today Thursday, an official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The visits, which were not previously scheduled, were a show of regional solidarity with Qatar following the Israeli strikes, the official said.
Canada also said it was evaluating its relationship with Israel after the attack on Qatar, saying it considered the action unacceptable, especially given Qatari attempts to facilitate peace in the Middle East.

• Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur and Rahim Yar Khan at risk amid rising river levels
• Over 4.2m affected, 2.19m relocated as floods hit 4,400 Punjab villages
• Guddu Barrage fluctuates between medium and high flood
• Five dead, hundreds rescued in Karachi after Lyari and Malir rivers swell
LAHORE/GUDDU: With South Punjab still in the throes of a devastating flood crisis, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has confirmed a high-lev­el flood situation, particularly in the Sutlej River, after India relea­sed more water on Wednesday.
All barrages in south Punjab on the Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi rivers are flowing at extremely dangerous levels, submerging vast swathes of low-lying areas and posing a severe threat to urban centres, such as Jalalpur, Alipur and Rahim Yar Khan tehsils.
Flood conditions in Jalalpur Pirwala, one of the most badly affected areas, intensified again after the Sutlej started rising and increased pressure on a major embankment.
On Wednesday, a rescue boat carrying 19 people overturned in the area, leading to the death of a child. All others were safely rescued, officials said.
Seven villages in Liaquatpur have been submerged due to the floods. In Alipur, a child died and five people went missing after a boat capsized.
The situation has worsened further due to the breach of the Azm­a­tpur embankment in the Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district.
The ancient city of Seetpur is now at severe risk from floodwaters. Dozens of settlements, inclu­ding Khairpur Sadat, Khan Garh Doma, Azmatpur, Kundarala and Sultanpur, have been inundated.
Water flow
According to Flood Forecasting Data released at 11pm on Wednesday, the water flow at Ganda Singh Wala headworks on the Sutlej River was 182,188 cusecs (steady trend) and was classified as “very high flood”.
Downstream, the flow was steady at 121,698 cusecs (high flood) at Sulemanki headworks and 121,010 (high flood) at Islam headworks.
On the Ravi River, the water flow was normal at both Jassar and Shahdara headworks and was in low flood at Balloki. However, at Sidhnai headworks, the flow was categorised as “very high” at 94,556 cusecs (falling trend).
On the Chenab River, the flow at Panjnad was “very high” at 598,731 cusecs (rising) and “medium” at Trimmu at 231,154 cusecs (steady). The flow at other headworks on the river — Marala, Khanki, Qadirabad and Chiniot — was normal.
Meanwhile, Guddu Barrage recorded a brief spell of high flood on Wednesday morning before returning to medium flood levels by the afternoon, leaving officials puzzled as the anticipated peak has yet to arrive fully.
 
 

The barrage reached high flood stage at 6am with an upstream inflow of 502,844 cusecs and downstream discharge of 492,443 cusecs. “This indicated a high flood when the barrage passed a flow of 500,000 cusecs,” an official said.
Guddu Barrage Chief Engineer Sardar Shah said that following the morning surge, about 10,000 cusecs were diverted into the Begar Sindh Feeder canal on the right bank, which irrigates rice-growing districts in the command area.
Soon after, flows at Guddu fell to 493,281 cusecs upstream and 471,549 cusecs downstream by 1pm. By 11pm on Wednesday, the inflow was 495,509 cusecs, and the outflow was 472,094.
A gauge at Chachran also showed a decline, dropping from 10.5 feet to 10.3 feet by afternoon, indicating the Indus rise had been short-lived.
Mr Shah noted that with a 48-hour time lag between Panjnad and Guddu, the peak recorded at Panjnad on the evening of Sept 7 should have reached Guddu by Tuesday night. Instead, the rise was observed on Sept 10. He said if another peak is building upstream, it could arrive late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, authorities at Sukkur Barrage said they were monitoring the situation closely. Upstream discharge at Sukkur was recorded at 405,665 cusecs and downstream at 382,355 cusecs, with officials watching for the expected peak.
Evacuations accelerated
Meanwhile, Punjab’s Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that over 4,400 villages have been affected due to severe flooding in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
He said that 2,190 villages were affected due to flooding in the Chenab River, 651 villages in the Sutlej River and 1,495 villages in the Ravi River.
More than 4.2 million people have been affected due to the flood situation in the rivers, while 2.19m  people trapped in the floods have been relocated to safe locations.
He said that 404 relief camps and 488 medical camps were established in districts severely affected by floods.
Besides, 421 veterinary camps have been established to provide treatment facilities for livestock. In the affected districts, 1.581m animals have been relocated to safe locations during rescue and relief activities.
Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, while Tarbela Dam is 100pc full, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is 90pc full, Pong Dam is 99pc full and Thein Dam is 97pc full. He said that 76 citizens lost their lives in various incidents.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said that the intensity of monsoon rains has decreased and no further increase in river flows was expected.
However, a Met office forecast indicated that isolated showers were expected in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and the Pothohar region.
Five dead in Karachi
In Karachi, five people were killed and hundreds rescued as heavy downpours and hill torrents from the Kirthar range swelled the Lyari and Malir rivers to record levels, inundating low-lying neighbourhoods and damaging infrastructure.
Floodwaters submerged homes in Gadap, Scheme 33 and along the M-9 motorway, with major relief operations carried out by Edhi Foundation, Rescue 1122, security forces and civic agencies.
A 20-metre section of the Hub Canal and a gas pipeline were damaged, while part of the under-construction Malir Expressway collapsed. Authorities suspended heavy traffic on the M-9 amid fears of further inflows from Balochistan.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said more than 400 people were rescued in the city, while 172 people stranded on the motorway were evacuated.
Separately, four bodies were recovered from a flash flood incident in Gadap Town and a teenage boy died of electrocution in North Nazimabad.
Schools were closed on Wednesday but are set to reopen today (Thursday) as the weather system has moved away from the area.

With Tuesday’s strikes, Israel is expanding military actions that have ranged across the Middle East to include the Gulf Arab state, where the Palestinian group has long had its political base. Qatar, which has acted as a mediator alongside Egypt in talks on a ceasefire in the almost two-year-old conflict in Gaza, condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
In a post on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar wrote that Pakistan requested the meeting along with Somalia and Algeria, after “unprovoked illegal Israeli aggression” in Qatar to “discuss the situation and seize itself of this grave matter”.
“Pakistan expresses its complete solidarity and firm support with the government and brotherly people of Qatar,” Dar wrote.
 






‘Our enemies are not safe anywhere’: Israel
Meanwhile, Israel warned its enemies they were not safe anywhere a day after the strikes, which drew a rare rebuke from United States President Donald Trump.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed that “Israel’s long arm will act against its enemies anywhere”, following Tuesday’s deadly attack on the Gulf state, which hosts a large US military base and has spearheaded repeated rounds of Gaza truce efforts.
“There is no place where they can hide,” Katz wrote on X, adding: “Everyone who took part in the October 7 massacre will be held fully accountable,” referring to Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the nearly two-year Gaza war.
 






Meanwhile, the Israeli ambassador to the United States said that if Israel failed to kill Hamas leaders in the Tuesday air strike, it would succeed next time.
“Right now, we may be subject to a little bit of criticism. They’ll get over it. And Israel is being changed for the better,” Yechiel Leiter told Fox News’ ‘Special Report’ programme late on Tuesday. “If we didn’t get them this time, we’ll get them the next time.”
 
 

Hamas said six people were killed in the strikes, including an aide and an adult son of its top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, as well as three bodyguards and a Qatari security officer.
But the group said its senior leaders had survived, affirming “the enemy’s failure to assassinate our brothers in the negotiating delegation”.
The White House said Trump did not agree with Israel’s decision to take military action and had warned Qatar in advance of the incoming strikes. But Doha said it had not received the warning from Washington until the attack was already underway.
Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, sought to justify the decision, telling an Israeli radio station: “We don’t always act in the interests of the United States.
“It was not an attack on Qatar; it was an attack on Hamas,” Danon told 103FM, adding: “It is too early to comment on the outcome, but the decision is the right one.”
According to sources close to Hamas, six Hamas leaders, including Hayya and former top leader Khaled Meshaal, were in the targeted building at the time. AFP has been unable to reach any of them since then.
‘Shaken conscience of world’
Along with the United States and Egypt, Qatar has led multiple attempts to end the Israel-Hamas conflict and secure the release of the remaining hostages.
In Gaza City on Wednesday, the Israeli military destroyed another high-rise building as it intensifies its assault on the territory’s largest urban centre despite mounting calls to end its campaign.
The military’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, had earlier issued an evacuation warning to those living in and around the Tiba 2 tower. The military said later it had “struck a high-rise building that was used by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the area of Gaza City”.
 






AFP images showed huge plumes of smoke billowing into the sky as the residential tower in western Gaza City crashed to the ground. Palestinians were seen searching through the rubble for any salvageable items.
The Gaza conflict has created catastrophic humanitarian conditions for the population of more than two million, with the UN last month declaring a famine in Gaza City and its surroundings.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she would push to sanction “extremist” Israeli ministers and curb trade ties over the dire situation.
“What is happening in Gaza has shaken the conscience of the world. People killed while begging for food. Mothers holding lifeless babies. These images are simply catastrophic,” she said.
Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, hit back, writing on X that Europe was sending “the wrong message that strengthens Hamas and the radical axis in the Middle East”.
 






‘Not thrilled’
Following Israel’s targeting of Hamas leaders in the Gulf, Qatar’s prime minister said it reserved the right to respond to the attack, which it said constituted a “pivotal moment” for the region.
Trump said he was not notified in advance of the Israeli strikes and “not thrilled about the whole situation”. In a post on social media, he insisted that “this was a decision made by Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me”.
“I view Qatar as a strong ally and friend of the US, and feel very badly about the location of the attack,” he said, adding Hamas’s elimination was still a “worthy goal”.
 


Russia and China joined an international chorus of condemnation, with Moscow saying the operation undermined peace efforts in the Middle East.
Germany, one of Israel’s staunchest supporters, has taken note of those proposals targeting Israel and will participate in a dialogue about future measures, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said today.
Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians. Of the 251 hostages seized during the assault, 47 remain in Gaza, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.
Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,656 Palestinians, most of them civilians.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2025-09-10 19:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/10213340291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941009/swabi-police-arrest-226-people-for-resisting-raid-on-musical-show' target='_blank'><strong>Swabi police arrest 226 people for ‘resisting raid on musical show’</strong></a><br><p>Police on Wednesday arrested 226 individuals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swabi for allegedly resisting a raid and participating in a ‘musical show’.
Swabi Deputy Superintendent of Police Ijaz Khan Abazai told Dawn.com: “The number of arrested individuals was 226, and a number of them belonged to various areas outside the district, and the larger issue was that they tore the uniforms of three police personnel when they were resisting the police order to close the show.”
He added that the arrested included two members of the transgender community as well.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at the Swabi City Police Station on the complaint of Station House Officer (SHO) Saidul Amin under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions), 294 (obscene acts in public) and 506 (criminal intimidation of the Pakistan Penal Code and other legal sections.
It read that a musical show was underway in Raz Muhammad market in the district headquarters, and the police sought to find out what was happening when they were alerted about the matter.
“The music event was playing ‘immoral’ songs at high volume through loudspeakers, and obscene and ‘immoral’ dancing in ‘half-naked’ clothes continued, and when they were told to stop the show, they resisted the order with full vigour,” the FIR added.
It added that some of the audience members were carrying pistols and they resorted to aerial firing during the event. The FIR also stated that some audience members were also making videos and sharing them on social media.
SHO Amin said that personnel from the Zaida and Tehsil Topi police stations, along with other police posts, were called and a raid was conducted.
Senior police officials had said on Sunday that Swabi police arrested a TikToker who was allegedly making videos while dressing as a girl and uploading them to his account to “mislead people, especially the youth“.
Last month, a Lahore magistrate dismissed a case against transgender persons for allegedly organising an “objectionable” private party after police had arrested them earlier.</p><small>2025-09-10 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/10220446fd0125a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941001/kuldeep-stars-as-india-crush-uae-in-opening-encounter-of-t20-asia-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Kuldeep stars as India crush UAE in opening encounter of T20 Asia Cup</strong></a><br><p>Kuldeep Yadav returned figures of 4-7 to lead holders India to a crushing nine-wicket win over hosts United Arab Emirates in their opening match of the men’s Asia Cup 2025 on Wednesday.
Kuldeep struck three times in one over with his left-arm wrist spin as tournament favourites India skittled UAE for a paltry 57 in 13.1 overs after they elected to field first in the T20 in Dubai.
India romped home to victory in 4.3 overs after left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma hit 30 off 16 balls and vice-captain Shubman Gill stood unbeaten on 20.
 






But it was the bowlers who set up victory for the reigning T20 World Cup champions as medium-pacer Shivam Dube claimed three before Kuldeep wrapped up the innings.
Put in to bat, UAE opener Alishan Sharafu started briskly with boundaries before falling to pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah for 22 off 17 balls.
Skipper Muhammad Waseem struck 19 to be the only other batsman to make double figures in an otherwise shambolic show by the rest of the team.
Kuldeep’s three wickets, including Waseem, in his second over, rattled the opposition batting which soon fell apart.
In reply, Sharma came out attacking as he smashed left-arm spinner Haider Ali for a six and a four.
He hit two more sixes in his blitz before being caught out off pace bowler Junaid Siddique.
Gill finished off the chase with a boundary as skipper Suryakumar Yadav, unbeaten on seven, looked on from the other end.
India won the previous Asia Cup, which was played in a 50-over format in 2023, when they beat hosts Sri Lanka in the final in Colombo.
The 17th edition of the Asia Cup kicked off with the Group ‘B’ match between Afghanistan and Hong Kong, where Azmatullah Omarzai hammered a 20-ball fifty as his team beat Hong Kong by 94 runs in the opening match on Tuesday.
Pakistan and India meet on September 14 in the most-awaited match of the T20 tournament, which serves as a build-up for next year’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.
The tournament trophy was also unveiled by ACC President Mohsin Naqvi at a ceremony with team captains ahead of the tournament’s first encounter between Afghanistan and Hong Kong.
Teams:
India: Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav (captain), Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Jasprit Bumrah.

KE is the only electricity generator, transmitter, and distributor for Karachi and its adjoining areas, and the only listed electricity supplier. It was privatised in 2005. Shanghai Electric Power had agreed to buy a controlling shareholding in KE from Abraaj Group back in 2016 for a sum of $1.77 billion.
The transaction never materialised because the seller failed to obtain the required approvals from different authorities and liquidity constraints as a consequence of mounting circular debt in the country’s power sector. In June 2023, Shanghai Electric reiterated its commitment to the deal.
 
 

In a statement issued a day ago, the Chinese company said: “On September 9, 2025, the company convened the fifth meeting of the ninth board of directors and reviewed and approved the proposal to terminate and write off the equity acquisition of KE company in Pakistan, agreeing to terminate this major asset purchase.”
It added that since the planning of the “major asset purchase”, the company had strictly adhered to relevant laws, regulations, and normative documents, actively promoting the various tasks involved in this major asset purchase.
“Given that the counterparty has consistently failed to meet the conditions precedent for closing and the changes in the business environment in Pakistan have rendered this transaction no longer aligned with the company’s international development direction, after careful study and analysis, in order to effectively safeguard the interests of the company and all its shareholders, the company has decided to terminate this major asset purchase.
“As KES energy company has failed to meet the conditions precedent stipulated in Article 4.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement, Shanghai Electric is entitled to terminate the agreement in accordance with Article 4.8 of the Share Purchase Agreement,” the statement read.
The company had withdrawn its offer last year as well.
Who owns K-Electric?
Cayman Islands-registered KES Power Ltd owns 66.4pc shares in KE. The government of Pakistan controls 24.36pc shares in K-Electric, while the rest is owned by institutional investors and the general public.
KES Power is then owned by another Cayman Islands-based firm, IGCF SPV21 Ltd, which controls 53.8pc shares in the holding company of the Karachi utility. The rest of the shareholding in KES Power belongs to Saudi and Kuwaiti investors.
IGCF SPV21 Ltd, in turn, is “ultimately owned” by Infra­structure and Growth Capital Fund L.P. or IGCF, which is the fund that Abraaj Group managed until its eventual collapse following its chief’s arrest for misappropriating investors’ money in 2019.
The tussle between KES Power’s minority shareholders controlling 46.2pc stake and SPV21 Ltd with 53.8pc ownership began in October 2022. That was the time when Sage Venture Group Ltd — a British Virgin Islands-registered special-purpose company of AsiaPak Investments Ltd — became “general partner” of IGCF following a court-sanctioned sale of certain assets of Abraaj Investment Management, which was undergoing official liquidation internationally at the time.
A general partner brings in capital from investors and manages a private equity fund on behalf of its limited partners. The new general partner, as well as its parent company, are ultimately owned by Shaheryar Chishty, a Pakistani citizen who previously worked in international banking and now owns multiple companies in the country’s power sector.</p><small>2025-09-10 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/10212930c134c93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941002/cabinet-approves-resumption-of-new-gas-connections-declares-climate-and-agriculture-emergencies' target='_blank'><strong>Cabinet approves resumption of new gas connections; declares climate and agriculture emergencies</strong></a><br><p>Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik on Wednesday announced that the federal cabinet has approved the resumption of new gas connections across the country, ending the ban imposed in 2021.
Briefing the media on cabinet decisions along with Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, he said the government had responded to strong public demand by lifting the restriction on new connections.
He said the cabinet took several key decisions, including restoring new domestic gas connections, particularly in newly developed housing areas where residents had been forced to rely on LPG cylinders and alternative fuels.
The minister assured that both Sui companies had already completed procurement processes for meters and pipelines, and would immediately begin processing pending applications once the official notification is issued.
Existing applicants would also be given the option to convert their requests to RLNG-based connections by paying the prescribed security fee to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, he added.
Highlighting the government’s commitment to easing the energy burden on citizens, the minister said the decision would help reduce household fuel expenses and provide much-needed relief amid inflation.
He explained that although RLNG would remain costlier than domestic natural gas, it would be around 30–35 per cent cheaper than LPG, thereby easing household fuel costs.
“We already have a surplus of RLNG and adequate electricity availability, but we are working to strengthen governance and sustainability in the sector,” he added.
 


He said that one bidding round for domestic gas exploration had already been completed, while another would conclude soon.
Chaudhry said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had decided to lift the ban on domestic gas connections imposed in 2021 to address a longstanding public demand.
He expressed gratitude to the premier and the petroleum minister for resolving a major issue that households had been facing for years. “The difficulties caused by the suspension of gas connections will now be resolved,” he added.
Malik said efforts were also being made to attract international companies, including those from Turkiye, China and the United States, for both onshore and offshore exploration.
“By gradually boosting local production, we aim to reduce reliance on RLNG and provide cheaper, indigenous fuel to the people,” he said.
He reiterated the government’s determination to achieve sustainability in the energy sector, reduce dependence on costly imports, and gradually shift towards indigenous fuel resources.
On the floods, he said the prime minister was personally supervising a comprehensive damage assessment in consultation with provinces. The federal government, he assured, would fulfil its responsibility to provide maximum relief to the victims.
Cabinet declares climate, agriculture emergencies
Meanwhile, Chaudhry said the federal cabinet declared both a climate and agriculture emergency in the country.
Sharing details of the cabinet meeting, he said the premier had decided, and the cabinet endorsed, the immediate enforcement of a climate emergency.
Climate change, he said, was already one of the most debated subjects globally and was severely affecting Pakistan through shifting weather patterns.
“Unfortunately, in past decades, we failed to protect our forests and trees, while encroachments narrowed natural waterways — rivers, streams, and channels that once allowed easy passage of rainwater. This has worsened the flooding situation we see today,” he said.
The minister added that the climate minister was tasked with submitting a comprehensive report to PM Shehbaz within 15 days. He added that the cabinet would deliberate on the report, to figure out how Pakistan could cope with climatic challenges and prepare effective strategies to protect the nation from such devastating losses in the future.
“Since 2022, we have witnessed the devastation caused by floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Punjab. Now, this water is flowing into Sindh from the five-river basin, and our prayers and efforts are focused on minimising the losses there as well,” he said.
The minister said the floods had caused massive destruction, particularly to agriculture, along with human and financial losses — a matter discussed in detail during the cabinet meeting.
An agriculture emergency, he said, would help assess the extent of damage to agriculture across the country and determine how farmers can be compensated for their losses.
Chaudhry stressed that climate and agriculture challenges could not be addressed without the cooperation, support, and consultation of provincial governments.
Therefore, he said the prime minister had decided to convene an immediate meeting of all provincial stakeholders under the leadership of their respective chief ministers.
“This country belongs to all of us, and together we must overcome its challenges,” he said, adding that stakeholders from GB and Azad Kashmir would also participate in the huddle.</p><small>2025-09-10 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/101650591a58e11.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940983/soldiers-guard-nepals-parliament-patrol-streets-after-two-days-of-deadly-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Soldiers guard Nepal’s parliament, patrol streets after two days of deadly protests</strong></a><br><p>Soldiers guarded Nepal’s parliament and patrolled deserted streets on Wednesday amid a curfew in the capital Kathmandu, after two days of deadly anti-corruption protests forced Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to resign.
The upheaval in the Himalayan nation was unleashed by a social media ban that was announced last week, but was rolled back after 19 people were killed on Monday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to control crowds.
The death toll from the protests had risen to 25 by Wednesday, Nepal’s health ministry said, while 633 were injured.
Burnt-out vehicles and twisted metal littered the area around parliament, where army firefighters battled to douse a blaze in the main hall, while the building’s exterior was charred after protesters set it ablaze on Tuesday.
TV footage showed youths cleaning up some damaged buildings and clearing debris from roads and the areas near parliament.
 






“I have been informed by the (parliament) security chief that the fire has destroyed the entire infrastructure. Nothing is left,” Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the lower house of parliament, told Reuters from his home in Kathmandu.
Several other government buildings, from the Supreme Court to ministers’ homes, including Oli’s private residence, were also set ablaze in the protests, with the unrest subsiding only after the resignation.
Armoured vehicles kept vigil in streets that were largely deserted, with shops and markets shut. Firefighters were engaged at different locations, while the process of clearing roads was also underway, army spokesman Raja Ram Basnet said.
“We are trying to normalise the situation first. We are committed to protecting the life and property of people,” Basnet said, adding that prisoners had set Kathmandu’s Dilli Bazar Jail on fire before the army controlled the situation.
The main airport in Kathmandu also reopened on Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said, more than 24 hours after flights had been suspended.
Talks to defuse crisis
In an appeal on X, the army said prohibitory orders imposing a curfew would remain in force until Thursday morning.
“Any demonstrations, vandalism, looting, arson, and attacks on individuals and property in the name of protest will be considered punishable crimes and strict action will be taken by security personnel,” the post said.
The army said that relevant parties were coordinating to tackle the situation after the protests and resolve the issue. Media also said preparations were being made for authorities and protesters to hold talks, without giving details. Reuters could not independently confirm the information.
 
 

Former Supreme Court Judge Balaram KC urged the protesters to set up a negotiation team, with the army helping to maintain law and order, and called for fresh elections.
“Parliament should be dissolved and fresh elections held,” the constitutional expert told Reuters. “They should discuss forming the next caretaker government.”
Most of the protesters were young people voicing frustration at the government’s perceived failure to fight corruption and boost economic opportunities, leading to the demonstrations being dubbed the “Gen Z protests”.
For years, a lack of jobs has driven millions to seek work in countries such as Malaysia, the Middle East and South Korea, mainly on construction sites, so as to send money home.
“If shedding blood is good for our future, then it was right for me to participate in the protests,” Suman Rai, 20, who suffered injuries during the demonstrations, said as he lay on a hospital bed with his head and left wrist heavily bandaged.
Wedged between India and China, Nepal has struggled with political and economic instability since protests led to the abolition of its monarchy in 2008.
“It is highly condemnable to kill and injure hundreds without addressing the genuine demands of the youths. This is against the values of the peace-loving Nepali society,” King Gyanendra, the last of Nepal’s monarchs, said in a statement.
In a post on X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to Nepal’s citizens to maintain peace and order, while Beijing also said it hoped social order and national stability will be restored as soon as possible.</p><small>2025-09-10 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/10183707f5d2a26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940998/kamala-harris-slams-biden-us-presidential-re-election-bid-as-recklessness' target='_blank'><strong>Kamala Harris slams Biden US presidential re-election bid as ‘recklessness’</strong></a><br><p>Former US vice president Kamala Harris said it was “recklessness” to let Joe Biden run for a second term as president, in an excerpt released on Wednesday from her upcoming memoir.
Harris — who replaced Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate but lost to Donald Trump — admitted that the then-81-year-old got “tired” and was prone to stumbles that showed his age.
She also lashed out at White House staff, whom she accused of failing to support her — and sometimes actively hindering her — while she was Biden’s deputy.
“‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotised. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,” Harris said in the first extract from “107 Days”, published by The Atlantic magazine.
 
 

“The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”
Biden stunned the world by dropping out of the race in July 2024 after a disastrous debate with Trump, sparking questions about his age and mental acuity.
 
 

Harris denied that there had been any conspiracy to hide Biden’s condition but said it was clear there were issues with his age.
“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgement, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best,” she wrote.
“But at 81, Joe got tired. That’s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.”
Harris also lashed out at White House staff, whom she said failed to support her when she was vice president, saying that Biden’s team did not want her to outshine her boss.
“When the stories were unfair or inaccurate, the president’s inner circle seemed fine with it. Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more,” Harris wrote.
She added that she had “shouldered the blame” for Biden’s border policy, which Trump capitalised on in the election.
Harris lost comprehensively to Republican Trump after the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history, lasting just over three months — the 107 days in the title of her memoir.</p><small>2025-09-10 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/10163539c7ac2c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940978/ptis-hassan-niazi-moves-lhc-against-his-military-custody-court-martial' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Hassan Niazi moves LHC against his military custody, court martial</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Hassaan Khan Niazi, party founder Imran Khan’s nephew, on Wednesday moved the Lahore High Court (LHC) against his military custody, a court martial carried out against him and the full operation of the military court.
Niazi was handed over to the military for trial in 2023 over his alleged involvement in the May 9 riots at Lahore’s Jinnah House. He was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment last December.
Niazi filed a petition with the LHC today through his lawyer, Faisal Siddiqui, contending that after being arrested in the May 9 case, he was not presented in a civilian court.
“The transfer of the petitioner’s custody directly to the military authorities without any judicial oversight is patently and wholly without jurisdiction,” the petition, available with Dawn.com, argued.
“No application under Section 549(3) (delivery to military authorities of persons liable to be tried by court-martial) [of the] CrPC (Criminal Code of Procedure), 1898, was filed before any court, including the ATC (Anti-Terrorism Court) Lahore … for [the] delivery of custody of the petitioner for trial by court-martial.”
The petition contended that Niazi had not been produced in a civilian court and was illegally handed into the military custody of the 54th Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Battalion by Sarwar Road police station “on a mere letter by a military functionary under the [Federation of Pakistan] without any judicial oversight or judicial process whatsoever”.
“Neither Section 549(3) of the CrPC, 1898, nor Sections 94 (order in case of concurrent jurisdiction of court martial and criminal court) and 59(4) (civil offences) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, nor any other provision of the Army Act or any other law empowers the transfer of custody of the petitioner directly from police custody to the military authorities for trial by court-martial without a transfer order by the Civilian Criminal Court,” the petition argued.
The petition added that Niazi was “singled out” of the hundreds of people nominated in the 2023 first information report (FIR) and thousands of people nominated in May 9 cases.
Niazi requested that the court declare the “transfer of the custody of the petitioner from [Sarwar Road police station) to the Commanding Officer 54 Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Battalion … without any judicial proceedings or judicial order, is without jurisdiction, without lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
A similar request was made to declare that the letter demanding Niazi’s transfer be declared without jurisdiction, along with “all subsequent judgments, orders, proceedings or actions, including court-martial proceedings, based on the transfer of the custody of the petitioner … without any judicial proceedings or judicial order”.
The petition also urged the court to “direct the respondents to either release the petitioner or produce him before the [Anti-Terrorism Court, Lahore], in relation to a criminal case arising out of FIR No 96 of 2023 dated [May 10], for further proceedings in accordance with law”.</p><small>2025-09-10 12:03</small></div><hr>
