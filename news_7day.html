The action was taken on KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s instructions after the incident was highlighted by journalists.
“A video of a young girl had gone viral on TikTok in which the girl was being harassed by men while she was dancing at a private event,” Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan said.
He added that the Mardan police took prompt action and arrested four people.
“The men physically harassed the victim, who was used to be sent to private parties by her relatives.”
The police spokesperson said that after the video went viral on TikTok, journalists including Asad Ali Toor brought up the issue with the KP chief minister, who then ordered the Mardan District Police Officer (DPO) Zahoor Babar Afridi to take action.
“The girl’s grandmother and close relatives are among the arrested individuals, who used to send the teenage girl to private dance events for the sake of money.”
Khan said that a first information report has been lodged at the City police station and further invetigation into the case is underway.
Separately, DPO Afridi asked citizens in a statement to keep watch on their children and protect them from getting involved in such immoral activities.
“Public should report incidents like exploitation of children and abuse to the police” the statement quoted him as saying.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
Last month, the Punjab Police said they arrested a man suspected of molesting a minor girl in Multan district after a video of the incident went viral online.
Also, last month, police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Punjab’s Kasur district went viral online.</p><small>2025-08-04 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04175926ea1a3da.jpg?r=204620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928694/moving-beyond-limits-how-one-student-from-kp-defied-disability-to-top-matric-exams' target='_blank'><strong>Moving beyond limits: How one student from KP defied disability to top Matric exams</strong></a><br><p>Muhammad Sudais Khan, a 17-year-old student from rural Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has emerged as a remarkable symbol of perseverance, proving that physical limitations cannot suppress determination and talent.
Born as a disabled person, who had both his hands and one foot rendered non-functional, Sudais faced an uphill journey on the road to getting an education.
This year, not only did he sit for his Matriculation examinations under the Peshawar Board, but he also shocked the community by scoring an impressive 890 marks, all accomplished with just one toe.
Despite all the hardship, Sudais answered each question using the only working toe on his left foot, without ever letting his physical constraints define his potential.
His achievement, unprecedented and inspiring, has turned him into a symbol of resilience and a role model for people of all abilities across KP and beyond.
“I was not expecting this much appreciation from the people,” Sudais told Dawn.com.
He said that his public school was very supportive of him, saying that “my friends and school fellows never let me feel my disability”.
A biology teacher at his school, Abdullah Jan, called him an example for the world, saying, “His success is a motivation for students.”
Sudais had to face various challenges to mark his name in this spot. Being a disabled person is full of hardships, including mobility issues. “More than the disability, the transportation was a bigger challenge for me,” he said.
He added that his school was about seven to eight kilometres away from his home, adding, “I had very limited resources to fulfil my transportation needs.”
Sudais’s parents were happy and surprised at the same time about his success. His father, Muhammad Nawaz Khan, who drives a Qingqi rickshaw, told Dawn.com that walking from home to school was a barrier for Sudais.
“Every morning, I had to take him in a Qingqi for 7-8km to his school,” he said, adding that Sudais’ education was the goal. He continued, “We will work hard for his education.”
Sudais quoted his mother as saying: “I am the happiest mother today.” He further shared his mother’s remarks, stating: “Besides all of your barriers, I had a feeling that you (Sudais) will get success where everyone will get to know you.”
 

Peshawar Division Commissioner Riaz Mehsood greets Sudais Khan in Peshawar, Aug 2. — DawnNewsTV

Sudais’ achievements have become talk of the town, with government officials offering rewards for his hard work after his exemplary success.
Peshawar Division Commissioner Riaz Mehsood invited Sudais and his family, awarding him with cash and certificates. “With one hand and a foot disability, this is a big success,” Mehsood said. “We will further help Sudais in his educational struggle,” he added.
MPA Laik Muhammad Khan also acknowledged the hard work and motivation of the young student and announced a Rs50,000 cash prize for him. “More children will learn from his example,” he said.
As Charsadda celebrates one of its brightest stars, Sudais’s story reminds us all that courage can break any barrier when paired with opportunity.</p><small>2025-08-04 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04204159fdaa0b3.jpg?r=204206' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928704/trump-warns-he-will-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns he will ‘substantially’ raise tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil.
Trump last week said he would impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.
In a post on Truth Social today, Trump assailed New Delhi for buying Russian oil and then selling it.
“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,” Trump wrote. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine.
“Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,” the US president wrote.
 


India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p><small>2025-08-04 15:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04195643e899e9a.jpg?r=195702' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928700/teenage-girl-shot-down-allegedly-by-uncle-over-honour-in-battagram' target='_blank'><strong>Teenage girl shot down allegedly by uncle over ‘honour’ in Battagram</strong></a><br><p>A teenage girl was gunned down allegedly by her uncle on Monday in a ‘honour’ killing case in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Battagram district.
The incident comes a few days after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.
According to Battagram police Public Relations Officer Ghulam Nabi, “The uncle of the victim allegedly gunned down his niece in the name of honour.”
A first information report (FIR) dated Aug 4, seen by Dawn.com, said that the incident occurred during the early hours of Monday.
In the FIR, the suspect confessed that he had been a guest at his brother’s house for two days. “My brother went outside at night and told me to take care of the house,” the FIR quoted him as saying.
He further said that he heard the sound of the gate of the house opening at around 2am, prompting him to wake up.
“Using a flashlight, I saw that my niece was at the gate and going out with three people.”
Upon seeing his niece leaving the house, he fired at the victim and the cartridge ran out, the FIR read.
The suspect said that the victim’s mother gave him a pistol, adding, “After chasing them, I deliberately fired at Zahida Bibi out of honour.”
The firing killed the girl and injured one boy, while the other two people fled the scene, the FIR said.
The police arrested the suspect and recovered the weapons used in the crime.
The case was registered at the Battagram city police station under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempt to murder) and 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
Last week, a couple was shot dead by the woman’s family over ‘honour’ in Balochistan’s Mastung district.
On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-08-04 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04195018d59173a.jpg?r=195159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928701/pakistan-approves-first-ever-ferry-licence-for-routes-to-iran-gcc-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan approves first-ever ferry licence for routes to Iran, GCC countries</strong></a><br><p>The maritime affairs ministry on Monday approved its first-ever ferry service licence to an international ferry operator, authorising the company to operate routes connecting Pakistan with Iran and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Last month, the ministry announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with GCC countries.
The approval followed a high-level meeting of the licensing committee, comprising officials from maritime affairs, defence, foreign affairs, and interior ministries, along with representatives from the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation as well as port and shipping authorities.
According to a statement issued by the ministry, Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry hailed the move as a historic step aligned with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision and Pakistan’s National Maritime Policy.
“This licence creates the opportunity for boosting regional connectivity, religious tourism, and economic activity via sea routes,” he emphasised.
The new ferry service is expected to serve hundreds of thousands annually, particularly pilgrims travelling to Iran and Iraq, alongside workers and tourists bound for GCC states.
“The ferry service will alleviate pressure on land routes and reduce travel costs compared to air transport for the Pakistani diaspora and religious travellers,” he noted.
“Initial operations will commence from the ports of Karachi and Gwadar using modern ferry vessels equipped with essential amenities to ensure safe, affordable travel. Expansion of routes and port calls is planned based on demand and bilateral agreements,” he added.
“This ferry service launch forms part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to develop its blue economy, improve trade logistics, and promote maritime tourism, reflecting a renewed commitment to sustainable regional sea transport infrastructure.”
Last week, amid a deadlock in negotiations over the government’s decision to ban land travel to Iran for pilgrims during Arbaeen — the chehlum of Imam Husain — the Maritime Mini­stry was deliberating to launch a ferry service to facilitate travel of zaireen (pilgrims) to Iran and Iraq.
Last month, five private companies proposed routes for the newly announced ferry service from Gwadar to the Gulf region, according to the maritime ministry.</p><small>2025-08-04 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041837437bbf2a0.png?r=183829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928666/pm-shehbaz-announces-rs4bn-for-mapping-damage-reconstruction-of-gb-after-floods' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces Rs4bn for mapping damage, reconstruction of GB after floods</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced Rs4 billion for mapping damage to infrastructure in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and reconstruction efforts following recent floods in the region.
The prime minister was on a one-day visit to GB to review monsoon damages and distribute relief funds to flood-affected people. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
A statement posted on the X account of state broadcaster PTV News said PM Shehbaz emphasised the need for timely preparation to deal with natural disasters and announced a Rs4bn fund for infrastructure restoration and the activation of a 100-megawatt solar project soon. The PM also laid the foundation stone for a Daanish School.
 






Addressing a cheque distribution ceremony for flood affectees, he recalled, “A huge cloudburst occurred here, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.”
Noting the loss of lives and the damage caused to people’s property, the premier prayed for those who died and for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“I have come here specifically to express my sympathies and to assure you that I will keep coming here till you get resettled in your homes,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan was in the “red zone” of 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the prime minister underscored that both federal and GB governments had to work around the clock to combat climate change.
 


He ordered the early completion and functioning of the advanced weather warning system in GB and noted that Pakistan required preparedness to ward off damage and losses from climate change and weather-related disasters.
The prime minister said that he was visiting GB, along with cabinet members, to express sympathy with the affected families and assured them that they would be rehabilitated, adding that the federal government departments and the relevant departments in GB would work closely for this purpose.
PM Shehbaz said he had directed the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority to conduct mapping of the damages and submit a report in this regard, adding that he would visit the area in August.
Earlier, the prime minister distributed cheques containing compensation amounts among the family members of those who lost their loved ones in the recent rains and floods.
Chief Minister Gilgit Baltistan Haji Gulbar Khan, in his remarks, highlighted the damages, rescue and relief activities in the region after recent floods.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions Engineer Amir Muqam lauded the prime minister for his commitment and dedication to the public welfare projects.
He said, contrary to the past, GB’s budget had now been increased to Rs186 billion annually.
Premier orders weather alert system for tourist spots
Earlier today, PM Shehbaz chaired a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains. He termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”.
He emphasised that an advanced weather alert system must be established for tourist destinations based on seasonal forecasts, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
 
 

The prime minister said local populations should be resettled away from natural water passageways to help prevent emergencies in the future.
He also ordered the NDMA and the climate change ministry to jointly establish a forecasting and monitoring centre for GB in the coming months.
A comprehensive system must be developed for immediate rescue and assistance in emergency situations, the premier stressed. He instructed the NDMA to ensure close cooperation with provincial governments and relevant institutions to enhance rescue and relief efforts.
“All rehabilitation measures for those affected by the recent monsoon must be completed promptly,” PM Shehbaz asserted, issuing directives for a survey of damage to roads and infrastructure, and the restoration of communication links in all affected areas on a priority basis.
The Ministry of Climate Change informed the meeting about progress on the ongoing installation of an early warning system for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), with the premier ordering its completion in two months.
Regarding the July 21 heavy rains in GB’s Thak-Babusar, Thor, Kundus, and Ishkoman areas, the meeting was informed that over 600 people were rescued, while damaged roads were repaired and reopened to restore connectivity, APP reported.
 
 

Five tent villages were established for rescue operations, and 10 helicopters, along with two C-130 aircraft, were deployed to transport stranded tourists and individuals to safe locations.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz instructed Water Minister Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo to remain in GB to complete consultations and planning for a better water management system.
PM highlights ‘key role’ of the climate change ministry
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter.
He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.
Emphasising that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.
He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.
“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the top 10 countries that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” PM Shehbaz noted.
 






Recalling the devastating 2022 floods, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”
In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred losses worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.
PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.
The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of Daanish Schools he had promised. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.
He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.
“I will try to ensure this project’s completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.”
Premier meets with GB CM, governor
During his day trip, PM Shehbaz held separate meetings with the GB governor and chief minister to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.
Governor Shah briefed the prime minister on the flood situation and damages caused by the recent rains, as well as on the progress of development projects underway in Gilgit, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.
The governor also updated the premier on the region’s overall law and order situation. Recently, GB’s Tangir district witnessed two honour killing incidents within a week, taking the lives of four people.
In his meeting, CM Gulbar informed PM Shehbaz about the rescue and relief activities in the wake of the monsoon rains, Radio Pakistan reported.
Gulbar, an estranged member of the PTI who was backed by the PML-N and PPP during his election as chief minister, appreciated the premier’s decision to establish Daanish schools in GB.
They also discussed the law and order situation in GB and progress on development projects.
 






Federal govt cooperation akin to oxygen: GB govt
Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.
 






The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.
“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” PTV said.
In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister. GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods.”
As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters.
 
 

“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.
Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were rescued today, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.
Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts.
On Friday, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members went missing after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.
Glof alert issued for GB, KP ahead of likely rains
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued an alert for an increased risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The alert noted that a wet spell was likely to affect both regions in the current week as “scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls”, were expected.
 






As per the PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country from today till Thursday.
 






At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04184401477fa06.jpg?r=192927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928697/coas-aims-to-build-a-more-sustainable-multi-faceted-relationship-with-america-report' target='_blank'><strong>COAS aims to build a more sustainable, multi-faceted relationship with America: report</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is aiming to build a sustainable and multi-faceted relationship with the United States, British magazine The Economist reported on Sunday.
Relations between Washington and Islamabad have grown deeper since US President Donald Trump took office. On July 31, both nations struck a trade deal lowering US tariffs on Pakistan to 19 per cent, while also establishing an agreement to explore Pakistani oil reserves.
In June, the COAS made a five-day official visit to the US, where he met with Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. During the trip, Field Marshal Munir stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.
 
 

The COAS’ visit followed a four-day military confrontation with India in May, after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
“There he was, enjoying a private lunch with Donald Trump in the White House on June 18, just over a month after Pakistan’s brief conflict with India,” The Economist wrote about the June luncheon.
“Then, at the end of July, came further snubs for India: branding it a ‘dead economy’, Mr Trump imposed tariffs of 25pc while hailing a new trade deal with Pakistan.”
The Economist wrote that the field marshal’s fortunes “reflect a shift in American policy that affects India, China and the Middle East”.
Speaking to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, The Economist quoted him as saying that Field Marshal Munir is “well versed” with The West, despite not having trained in the US or the UK.
“To India’s dismay, America and Pakistan are now rebuilding ties with a focus on trade, counter-terrorism and consultation on Middle Eastern policy.
America may even sell arms again to Pakistan,” the magazine noted.
Additionally, The Economist recognised that Pakistan recently earned Washington’s praise for killing and capturing leaders of a local offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group.
In June, United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.
“He (Munir) has sparked interest from Trump associates in Pakistan’s crypto and mining sectors … and he has positioned Pakistan as a potential means to advance America’s interests with Iran and its efforts to get more Muslim countries to establish diplomatic ties with Israel,” the magazine wrote.
America, in turn, toned down its criticism of Pakistan’s programme to
build longer-range ballistic missiles, which officials from former president Joe Biden’s administration considered a threat to the US, The Economist wrote.
“It has resumed some aid programmes [and] it is also considering selling weaponry, including armoured vehicles and night-vision goggles, to help Pakistan combat local insurgents.
“American officials are examining Pakistan’s evidence to support its
claims that India backs those insurgencies, although they are unconvinced, so
far.”
In January, prior to Trump’s inauguration as president, the US said Pakistan played a pivotal role in US counterterrorism efforts over the years, but it “has never been a formal ally bound by treaty obligations”, according to former White House official John Kirby.
Meanwhile, Pam Bondi, who is currently serving as the US attorney general, emphasised during her confirmation hearing that global cooperation would be essential to counter the growing threat posed by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups like Islamic State-Khorasan Province.</p><small>2025-08-04 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04190101e1cb154.jpg?r=190251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928698/russia-urges-caution-in-nuclear-rhetoric-after-trump-comments' target='_blank'><strong>Russia urges caution in nuclear ‘rhetoric’ after Trump comments</strong></a><br><p>Russia urged caution on Monday after United States President Donald Trump said he would deploy two nuclear submarines following an online row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.
Trump said he had ordered the deployment in response to what he alleged were highly provocative comments by Medvedev, saying the submarines would be positioned in “appropriate regions”.
Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.
“Russia is very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation. And we believe that everyone should be very, very cautious with nuclear rhetoric,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including from AFP, on Monday.
The row between Medvedev and Trump erupted against the backdrop of the US leader’s ultimatum for Russia to end its military offensive in Ukraine or face fresh economic sanctions, including on its remaining trading partners.
Medvedev — one of Russia’s most prominent anti-Western hawks — accused Trump of “playing the ultimatum game” and said that Trump “should remember” that Russia was a formidable force.
“Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,” he said.
 






Medvedev, who has not posted on social media since the spat, is currently the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. He served one term as president from 2008 to 2012, effectively acting as a placeholder for Putin, who was able to circumvent constitutional term limits and de facto remain in power.
The chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday backed Trump’s actions.

The Lahore-based player won the Tekken 7 tournament in Japan in 2019 as well as the Evolution Championship Series in the US. In August 2022, he finished third in the EVO 2022 Tekken 7 competition. He won the Tekken 7 competition at EVO Japan 2023 in April 2023 and gained his 5th EVO title in July 2024.
EVO 2025 was held at the Las Vegas Convention Centre from Aug 1-3.
Siddique repeated history to win his 6th EVO title against fellow Pakistani and a former member of the team founded by Ash himself, Atif Butt.
EVO posted the winning moment on X with Ash using Nina Williams and Butt using Anna Williams, characters from the Tekken fighting game franchise who are sisters, terming it “greatness on another level”.
 






“I’m feeling so blessed,” EVO quoted Ash as saying after his win and becoming a six-time title holder, adding that he remains “grateful in victory”.
 






“Our player Arslan achieves the Evo World Championship for the sixth time in his career. The right path to achieving the World Cup, God willing,” said his e-sports club, Saudi Arabia’s Twisted Minds, further calling Ash by his moniker as the greatest of all time (GOAT) in the competitive Tekken scene.
“Six-time EVO champion. Undisputed GOAT of Tekken.”
 






Ash himself said in a post on Instagram: “Six EVO titles. What started as a kid grinding in gaming arcades became something I never imagined. Thank you to everyone who believed in me. This is for Pakistan.”

“I’m still not able to get over the thought of how I ended up in second place again. Just like last year’s Evo final, runner-up once again. Anyway, I sincerely want to thank everyone for their support,” said runner-up Butt.
 






Yuta “Chikurin” Take rounded out the top three in third position.
 






According to the website for the tournament, EVO is the world’s biggest fighting game tournament with a long history where fighting game players from around the world gather in Las Vegas to compete against each other.</p><small>2025-08-04 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04165721d96b95e.png?r=165851' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funeral-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Funeral held in absentia for missing tourists in GB’s Babusar after 14 days of search efforts</strong></a><br><p>A search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Babusar area concluded on Monday after 14 days, while their funeral prayers were held in absentia.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.
After deadly floods swept across GB’s Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of seven people had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region’s death toll stands at 10.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, “The funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.”
He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. “All vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,” he said.
“[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,” he added.
Last week, the GB government had intensified the search operations on Babusar Highway.
Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.
5 family members rescued after 4 days in Ghizer
Separately, five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer district have been rescued and taken to a safe place, Ghizer’s Rescue 1122 said today.

According to Ghizer Rescue 1122’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.
“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told Dawn.com.
“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”
According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.
On Thursday, cloudburst-induced floods in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The next day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had resulted in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-04 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04113959388fab5.png?r=114024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928646/pakistan-clinch-series-win-2-1-after-defeating-west-indies-by-13-runs' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan clinch series win 2-1 after defeating West Indies by 13 runs</strong></a><br><p>Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub combined for a 138 opening partnership and Pakistan defeated the West Indies by 13 runs on Sunday to capture their T20 International Series.
Pakistan won the series opener by 14 runs but dropped the second match by two wickets to set up a Sunday night decider at Lauderhill, Florida.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Pakistan were rewarded with a powerhouse performance by Farhan and Ayub.
 






Pakistan went 189 for four as Farhan hammered the hosts for 74 runs on 53 balls, smashing five sixes and three fours, while Ayub lasted 19 overs, finishing on 66 from 49 balls with two sixes and four fours.
Farhan was caught by West Indies captain Shai Hope at long off from a delivery by Shamar Joseph on the second ball of the 17th over.
Hasan Nawaz entered but was retired after only 15 runs, caught by Romario Shepherd at long off from a delivery by Roston Chase on the penultimate ball of the 18th over.
Mohammad Haris was run out for only two runs by Gudakesh Motie to start the 19th over and Ayub finally exited on the last ball of the penultimate over,
Jason Holder’s delivery grabbed by Sherfane Rutherford at sweeper cover.
Set 190 to win, West Indies struck for 30 runs on the first 10 balls from Hasan Ali and Mohammad Nawaz.
Jewel Andrew was caught by Hasan Ali at long on, bowled by Haris Rauf for 24, the first West Indies wicket falling at 44.
Ayub caught Hope bowled out by Nawaz for seven in the ninth over with the hosts still 116 runs from victory.
Alick Athanaze lasted 13 overs before being taken for 60, caught by Khushdil Shah bowled by Ayub with West Indies on 110, needing 80 runs off the last 42 deliveries.
Chase was retired on the last ball of the 17th over and his replacement, last-ball hero Holder from the win a night earlier, was bowled out by Sufiyan Muqeem two balls later for a duck, leaving the hosts 41 runs shy with 16 balls remaining.
Rutherford smashed a six to reach a half-century with seven balls remaining before exiting on 51 as West Indies couldn’t pull off another last-over comeback.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated the cricket team on its win, praising players’ determination and teamwork.
“Pakistani players won hearts by playing their best game,” he said in a statement. “Hopefully, the national team will continue to achieve successes in the future.”
 






While congratulating the players, Prime Minister also praised PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and the team management on the victory.
In a post on X, he “expressed the hope that team would prepare for the upcoming matches with even greater hard work and dedication to continue this streak of success”.

However, the audio in the clip is doctored.
On July 31, an X user, who seemed to be Indian from previous posts, shared a video that showed a split frame of Bilawal in the National Assembly and Indian politician Gaurav Gogoi in the Lok Sabha.
In the clip, Bilawal could allegedly be heard saying: “Who attacks in the dead of the night? We can easily do propaganda in front of the Indian prime minister. Our people are sitting in their parliament.”
The caption of the post said: “Our people are sitting in India’s parliament — Bilawal Bhutto. Hello Gaurav Gogoi Asm ji, who are those ‘our people’ of Bilawal Bhutto sitting in the Indian Parliament?”
It gathered more than 100,000 views and was shared 5,200 times.
The same video was also shared by other Indian accounts, as can be seen here, here and here.
The video was also shared by Indian accounts on Instagram, as seen here.
Moreover, an image of Bilawal along with the statement “our people are sitting in their parliament” was also shared by Hindutva accounts as can be seen here, here, here and here, racking up 611,378 views collectively.
None of the posts provided any other additional details about the context of the alleged video, such as when it was from or a link to the full address.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as well as current relations between the neighbouring countries.
Observing the video revealed inconsistencies in Bilawal’s audio in the clip, the most prominent among them being issues in lip-syncing, the mispronunciation of “prime minister”, and the use of Hindi words.
Reviewing the alleged clip via reverse image search showed that Bilawal’s video is actually from May 7, 2025, when he spoke in the National Assembly on the four-day India-Pakistan conflict.
In his original speech, the former foreign minister said: “Only thieves and cowards attack at night. If they had even an ounce of courage, they would have announced their attack during the day.”
 


He added: “We do not condone war and never have, but India should brace itself because Pakistan is yet to respond, and it will not do so during the night, or on the basis of lies, but as per international laws and UN Charter.”
The same was also corroborated by a keyword search that yielded reports by credible news outlets Dawn and Express Tribune, both of which did not report anything on Bilawal talking about the Indian parliament.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows Bilawal saying “our people are sitting in India’s parliament” is false. The video is doctored and dubbed over.

England, set 374 to win, were bowled out for 367, with fast bowler Siraj taking 5-104, including a sensational burst of 3-9 on Monday’s final morning.
It is India’s narrowest winning margin in a Test match.
“To be honest, it is so amazing,” Siraj told Sky Sports. “From day one to here, everyone fought so hard, so we are very happy.
 






“I just wanted to make sure I hit the right areas, the wickets would fall, and anything else would be a bonus.
“When I woke up, I believed I could do it.”
After resuming on 339-6, England lost four wickets for 28 runs on the final morning of a dramatic series.
The home side were soon 354-8 after Siraj, the leading bowler on either side this series, struck twice to remove Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton.
When injured England last man Chris Woakes came in to bat with his left arm strapped up owing to an injured shoulder, England still needed 17 more runs for victory.
Gus Atkinson hit a six off Siraj before England got the target down to single figures.
But Siraj set the seal on a superb series by bowling Atkinson (17) as he knocked over the batsman’s off stump to spark delirious scenes among the India team and their supporters in south London.
India were without Jasprit Bumrah at the Oval after deciding to stand by a decision to only play the world’s top-ranked Test bowler in three games of this five-match series.
Siraj, who featured throughout, ended the series with 23 wickets at 32.43.
Smith and Overton had struggled to get the ball off the square on their Surrey home ground on Sunday.
And with play starting Monday beneath grey skies, conditions favoured India’s quicks.
Overton pulled the first ball of the day, from Prasidh Krishna, for four – a shot greeted by huge cheers from England fans in an impressively large Oval crowd — and under-edged the second for another boundary
Siraj took up the attack from the Pavilion End and promptly twice beat Smith on the outside edge.
And with the third ball of his over Siraj had Smith caught behind, without the batsman adding to his score, to leave England 347-7.
The next delivery saw new batsman Atkinson edge the lion-hearted Siraj just short of the slip cordon.
But it was his Surrey county colleague Overton who fell next, lbw for nine to a Siraj ball angling into his pads. Overton reviewed but Kumar Dharmasena’s decision was upheld on umpire’s call.
Tailender Josh Tongue was then given out lbw to Krishna but the batsman’s review saw the decision overturned.
England had been cruising to victory while Harry Brook (111) and Joe Root (105) were sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 195 on Sunday.
However, Brook’s exit sparked a mini-collapse, with England losing three wickets for 36 runs and Root also among those dismissed.</p><small>2025-08-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04172320de84d57.png?r=172353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691/pakistan-issues-another-tender-to-buy-01m-tonnes-of-sugar-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues another tender to buy 0.1m tonnes of sugar, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, European traders said on Monday.
The quantity is double the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is August 11.
The announcement is believed to indicate that Pakistan will make no purchase in its previous tender for 100,000 tonnes of sugar on July 31, traders said.
On July 8, Pakistan’s government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
 
 

Traders said three companies had participated in the July 31 tender, with the lowest price offer assessed at $539.00 a tonne cost and freight included (c&f).
Pakistan reportedly received no offers in a previous tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar on July 22, with traders saying the requirement to load shipments from August 1-15 was too short notice for realistic offers.
The new tender seeks small/fine and medium grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel, packed in bags transported either in ocean shipping containers or breakbulk.
Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1-15 for 50,000 tonnes and September 10-25 for 50,000 tonnes. For 50,000 tonnes of sugar in ocean shipping containers, shipment can also be made between September 1 and 20.
Shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20.
Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.
 
 

During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.
Despite the export surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.
Last week, the government decided to enforce strict monitoring of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04123958291465c.jpg?r=132737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928670/police-arrest-3-for-allegedly-gang-raping-woman-in-abbottabad' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 3 for allegedly gang-raping woman in Abbottabad</strong></a><br><p>Police on Monday arrested three suspects who allegedly gang-raped a woman last week in the Bakot area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district, springing into action after the incident sparked social media outrage.
Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the suspects had allegedly gang-raped a woman from Rawalpindi on Wednesday.
“District Police Officer (DPO) Umar Tufail took action and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects after the incident was highlighted on social media, including Facebook and TikTok,” Spokesperson Afzal said.
He added that the Bakot station house officer (SHO), Arshad Khan, was sent to the village, where he had also found the local community angered over the incident.
 
 

On the SHO’s complaint, a first information report (FIR) was lodged at the Bakot police station yesterday under sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 375A (rape) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, police arrested the suspect who owned the house where the woman was allegedly raped by him and his friends.
The FIR added that one of the suspects brought the woman to his friend’s house in his car from Rawalpindi, where he and his friends raped her, one after the other. In his statement, the homeowner confessed to committing the crime while also identifying his two accomplices.
The police stated in the FIR that the accomplices were also arrested, while a search for the victim continued and the investigation was underway.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In July, a newlywed 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari, who was admitted to a hospital in critical condition after an alleged marital rape and “brutal sexual violence” at the hands of her husband, succumbed to her injuries. Her spouse was arrested by the police.
Earlier that month, Karachi police arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p><small>2025-08-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041314300568515.jpg?r=131556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928668/shameless-actions-pakistan-condemns-israeli-ministers-storming-al-aqsa-mosque' target='_blank'><strong>‘Shameless actions’: Pakistan condemns Israeli ministers storming Al-Aqsa mosque</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, calling Tel Aviv out for its “shameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region”.
Early on Sunday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, shielded by Israeli police, led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B’Av, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.
“This sacrilege against one of Islam’s holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.
 






He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.
The prime minister said that Israel’s “shameless actions” were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.
“Pakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” PM Shehbaz added.
The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.
“The presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‘the Temple Mount is ours,’ are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‑Aqsa Mosque,” the statement said.
It said that Israel’s expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.
“These provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.”
The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‑Aqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
 
 

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 60,839 and injured nearly 149,000 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office.
Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Last month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
On July 29, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the UN and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.

The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
According to a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Sindh, the trailer was travelling at a high speed when it crashed into a bungalow in DHA Phase 2.
He said that as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the urban search and rescue team, along with two ambulances and one disaster response vehicle, rushed to the scene.
“Two people trapped as a result of the collision were rescued safely,” he said, adding that they were transported to the hospital via ambulance with minor injuries. He added that both of the injured victims were trailer staff.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the two people trapped were the driver and cleaner of the trailer, who were rescued and taken to the hospital “after immediate medical assistance”.
“The police of the bungalow have contacted the owners, who are currently in Islamabad,” the DIG said.
He added that according to initial investigations, the accident occurred as a result of slippery conditions on the road due to rain.
Accidents frequently occur in the metropolis due to violations of traffic rules, with speeding and unsafe overtaking being major contributing factors. Speeding increases the risk of crashes and the severity of injuries, while unsafe overtaking often leads to head-on collisions.
Last month, a 59-year-old man was killed when a dumper truck ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad. The incident angered area residents, who damaged the truck and beat the driver before police intervened.
Earlier in the same week, at least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, while a separate collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p><small>2025-08-04 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04111541342bb32.jpg?r=111939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928661/76-dead-dozens-missing-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>76 dead, dozens missing after migrant boat sinks off Yemen</strong></a><br><p>At least 76 people have been killed and dozens are missing after a boat carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants sank off Yemen, in the latest tragedy on the perilous sea route, officials told AFP on Monday.
Yemeni security officials said 76 bodies had been recovered and 32 people rescued from the shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden. The UN’s migration agency said 157 people were on board.
The accident occurred off Abyan governorate in southern Yemen, a frequent destination for boats smuggling African migrants hoping to reach the wealthy Gulf states.
Some of those rescued have been transferred to Yemen’s Aden, near Abyan, a security official said.
UN agency the International Organisation for Migration earlier gave a toll of at least 68 dead.
The IOM’s country chief of mission, Abdusattor Esoev, told AFP that “the fate of the missing is still unknown.”
Despite the civil war that has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a key transit point for irregular migration, in particular from Ethiopia which itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict.
Each year, thousands brave the so-called “Eastern Route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea route last year, with 462 from boat accidents.
Last month, at least eight people died after smugglers forced migrants to disembark from a boat in the Red Sea, according to the UN’s migration agency.
The vessel that sank off Abyan was carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants, according to the province’s security directorate and an IOM source.
Yemeni security forces were conducting operations to recover a “significant” number of bodies, the Abyan directorate said on Sunday.
On their way to the Gulf, migrants cross the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Red Sea that is a major route for international trade, as well as for migration and human trafficking.
Once in war-torn Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, migrants often face other threats to their safety.
The IOM says tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Yemen and suffer abuse and exploitation during their journeys.
In April, more than 60 people were killed in a strike blamed on the United States that hit a migrant detention centre in Yemen, according to the Houthi rebels that control much of the country.

Here’s how it can win the water war</strong></a><br><p>On the morning of May 31, flow gauges on the Chenab River recorded an alarming decrease in the river flow. The development made headlines in the aftermath of the conflict between India and Pakistan, which broke out on May 7. As with a similar episode at the end of April, it led some to wonder anxiously: Can New Delhi shut Pakistan’s water supply just like that?
The bulk of Pakistan’s water supplies originate from three rivers — Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab — which are allocated under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Two of these western rivers are buffered by large dams on the Pakistani side: Tarbela on the Indus and Mangla on the Jhelum. Each can absorb changes in flow with little effect on irrigation deliveries. The Chenab, however, is different.
Pakistan does not have a Tarbela-sized reservoir here, and upstream on the Chenab River, India operates three modest dams (Baglihar, Salal and Dulhasti). A closure at these structures can therefore look, at first glance, like the country’s tap has been turned off.
 
 

Here, we explain why and how the Chenab River flows can be disrupted (not blocked). Then we discuss what potential disruptions later in the year may look like. And, through this, we illustrate that while Pakistan must press its case against India’s illegal violations of the IWT, it also has room through smarter water management to blunt the impact of any Indian actions.
Pakistan’s vulnerability
Begin with the Indus River, which has an average annual flow of roughly 75 billion cubic metres (BCM) — enough to fill about 30 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Two Indian run-of-river plants on the Indus River can together hold 0.02 BCM when their gates are closed — that is less than 0.03 per cent of the Indus’ annual flow, or only a few hours of discharge even in the low-water season. Once India’s small reservoirs fill, the water must spill onward, and the brief dent disappears inside normal reservoir operations downstream.
The situation on the Jhelum is similar. Mangla Dam on the Jhelum River sees about 27 BCM in an average year; Indian upstream infrastructure can store around 0.06 BCM, barely 0.2pc of the river’s flow. As things stand, and likely in the future, there is virtually no way India can cause any noticeable disruption to irrigation flows managed through the Indus and Jhelum rivers.
The Chenab, by contrast, reaches Marala with no Pakistani reservoir to cushion it. India’s infrastructure on the Chenab has a combined live storage — referred to as water that can be actively withheld or released — capacity of around 0.1 BCM.
This is where Pakistan’s water system is most vulnerable.
The Indian violations
Earlier in May, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) reported an unusual change in average daily flows of Chenab as it entered Pakistan via Marala Barrage. As illustrated in the figure below, the seemingly normal daily average flows of around 50,000 cusecs recorded on May 27 and 28 abruptly increased over the next two days and then drastically decreased on May 31 and June 1, before returning to expected levels on June 2 and onwards.
The average river flows of Chenab can vary significantly at this time of the year due to a combination of glacial melt, rainfall and water management practices. However, day-to-day changes in flows typically do not exceed 5,000 cusecs, and even if they do, they are typically linked to precipitation or snowmelt upstream in the basin and can therefore be predicted.
 


Here, though, the disruptions in Chenab’s daily average flows reported between May 28 and June 2 were induced via upstream reservoir operations, as confirmed by subsequent reports.
The abrupt rise in flows on May 29 and 30 was due to reservoir flushing (emptying) by India on the same days — a process where accumulated sediments are removed from a reservoir by releasing water at high flow rates, which helps restore the reservoir’s storage capacity and improve water quality. It can also help prevent flooding by managing water levels and mitigating the risk of sediment buildup.
The reported live capacity of India’s reservoirs on Chenab is 0.1 BCM, which equates to around 21,000 cusecs of surplus average daily flow across two days. This aptly explains most of the abrupt rise in the river flow on May 29 and 30.
The reservoir flushing was followed by reservoir filling — when water is gradually filled in the reservoir up to its intended operating level — on May 31 and June 1 (see red bars in the above figure for illustration), coinciding with the sharp fall in flows at Marala. Once India’s facilities reached their capacity, the flow returned to normal from June 2 onwards. The total water that reached Pakistan during these five days (May 28-June 2) did not change or decrease; only the timing of it was affected.
The disruption in the flow of the Chenab River always heavily depends on the time of the year and strategies used by India for the flushing and filling of its reservoirs. The IWT has predefined rules for flushing and filling and its abeyance, which means that India could i) flush or fill its reservoirs at will, and ii) choose any strategy to maximise impact on Pakistan.
The figure below illustrates what a hypothetical worst-case scenario may look like in dry winter months (November to January), when average daily flows in Chenab can reduce to 7000 cusecs or lower.
 


This worst-case scenario in Chenab during this time could feature quick flushing (lasting two days) resulting in a huge relative surge in flows at Marala barrage, followed by slow filling (due to naturally low winter flows) resulting in reduction of flows at Marala to a trickle that could last for around a week (as opposed to the two day disruption observed in May). Again, it is worth reiterating that even in this worst-case scenario, the volume of water in Chenab will not reduce. Only its timing would be altered.
How to blunt Indian actions
Can Pakistan manage this level of disruption in flows in Chenab? Pakistani policy makers see the answer in concrete. Last month, the government confirmed it is studying a Rs220 billion Chenab Dam that would add storage on the Chenab. A reservoir of that size could cushion sudden draw-downs, but building a dam is expensive and will take many years. Pakistan cannot afford to wait that long or spend that much before acting.
Fortunately, the most effective countermeasures do not hinge on new megastructures. Real-time telemetry, flexible canal rotations, and coordinated reservoir operations can be deployed within a single irrigation season at a fraction of the cost.
These quicker fixes are not theoretical. Pakistan’s irrigation system is already highly engineered and interconnected. When Irsa noticed these Indian induced disturbances, it released water from the Mangla Dam to compensate for reduced flows on May 31 and June 1 and meet the demands of farms served by canals linked to both Chenab and Jhelum rivers. However, the reduction in flows was preceded by a surge as well.
 
 

Hence, if flow monitoring, operational allocation decisions at various government levels, for example, Irsa provincial irrigation departments, and canal gate operations are managed with synchrony, time efficiency and adaptiveness, disruptions in Chenab can be handled effectively. Pakistan’s water management and operation authorities need to be swift in determining the start of a disruption event and adapting operations accordingly. As demonstrated by the country’s effective military response to Indian aggression, preparation is half the battle.
India’s recent treaty violations (and those in the future) must be contested through diplomatic channels, but Pakistan’s most effective countermeasures lie in the country’s own hands. First, adaptive and coordinated water management using real-time telemetry can allow irrigation engineers to modify crop rotations and reservoir operations as soon as unusual flow patterns are detected.
Second, the 10-day warabandi schedule can be made elastic. Warabandi is a rotational water distribution system used on both sides of the water to ensure equal water access for farmers. It involves preparing a fixed schedule for allocating water to each farm, ensuring that every landholder receives a predetermined share of water based on their landholding size.
Allowing a “floating start”, in which the entire rotation slides forward when an upstream interruption occurs, preserves each farmer’s share over the full cycle even if one day is lost. The change is administrative, not infrastructural, yet it converts a sudden change into a manageable rescheduling exercise.
None of these steps requires new legislation or massive investment. By adopting them while pressing its treaty case, Pakistan demonstrates that measured, data-driven management is the strongest reply to hydraulic theatre.
Violations purely for show
Annual reservoir flushing is not new. Schedule E of the Indus Waters Treaty explicitly allows India to flush its reservoirs to purge sediment, provided two conditions are met: (i) Pakistan receives advance notice, and (ii) the drawdown is timed for seasons when the water flow is high and the impact downstream is low.
For years, this coordination worked. Indian dams were flushed in the high-flow season, briefly dipping Marala’s gauges. The surge of summer meltwater masked the loss, and canal operations scarcely noticed. This is what has changed since India decided to put the treaty in abeyance unilaterally.
Reservoir flushing in late spring yields India little more than routine silt removal, but doing it without notice and unscheduled turns a maintenance chore into a prime-time spectacle for its domestic audience.
 
 

Several Indian television channels framed May’s drawdown as proof that “Pakistan’s water tap can be shut at will”, echoing the same outlets that aired fabricated claims of the Karachi port being destroyed during the recent skirmish. The pattern is clear: limited hydraulic facts are stretched into psychological warfare for domestic ratings. Such behaviour is unbecoming of a state that seeks regional or global leadership.
Violating the Indus Waters Treaty for a little more sediment flushing undermines New Delhi’s credibility far more than it inconveniences Pakistan’s canals. It advertises a willingness to bend rules for symbolic gain while delivering no tangible advantage in irrigation or power.
The temptation to answer theatre with theatre should be resisted. Pakistani media and officials are on firmer ground when they treat the incident as what it is: a violation that disrupts Chenab’s flow for a few days (while the total volume of water stays the same). Understanding and reporting the full context (rather than the hype) denies the tactic its intended psychological payoff.
India’s unscheduled sediment flushes can disrupt canal timetables for a few days, but it does not and cannot strangle Pakistan’s water supply. That reality should guide every response. Islamabad is right to demand that treaty rules on notice and timing be honoured. Yet the most convincing diplomatic brief is one backed by domestic readiness: gauges that speak in real time and a rotation calendar flexible enough to absorb short shocks. By improving its readiness, Pakistan can undercut the psychological edge of future draw-downs and strengthen its standing in any future negotiations. Proactive planning, not alarmist rhetoric, is the surest way to keep the Chenab flowing.</p><small>2025-08-04 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041057439d08bcd.jpg?r=110120' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928551/couple-shot-dead-over-honour-in-rajanpur-a-year-after-love-marriage' target='_blank'><strong>Couple shot dead over ‘honour’ in Rajanpur a year after love marriage</strong></a><br><p>DERA GHAZI KHAN: A man and a woman who had married of their own free will a year ago were shot dead on Sunday, allegedly by the woman’s brother in the jurisdiction of Muhammad Pur Dewan police station in Rajanpur district.
Rajanpur District Police Officer (DPO) Farooq Amjad told Dawn that Saqlain, son of Ghulam Sadiq, a resident of Muhammad Pur Dewan, had contracted marriage with Ayesha Bibi, a year ago, without the consent of her family.
He said that on Sunday, when the couple was in their house, the armed suspect barged in and opened indiscriminate fire, leaving his sister and her husband dead on the spot.
The DPO said that on being informed of the incident, the police acted promptly and arrested the suspect.
 
 

The police, after collecting evidence from the crime scene, moved the bodies to the hospital for autopsy.
According to initial investigation, the double murder was committed over ‘honour’. A case is yet to be registered.
NOSE CHOPPED OFF: Four assailants chopped off the nose of a man in a brutal attack in the limits of Kot Mubarak police station on Sunday.
According to the police, four men attacked Jumma Oghani, a resident of Jumma Chowk, and after overpowering him, chopped off his nose with a sharp object, leaving him seriously injured.
The injured man was shifted to hospital.
Police sources say that the victim was in litigation with the attackers.
Police are conducting raids to apprehend the culprits.

“Around 20 armed men attacked the 132kV grid station in the wee hours, causing massive damage to the grid station,” Qesco officials said on Sunday.
The armed men snatched the 12-bore rifle from the security guards and vandalised the premises while holding the staff at gunpoint. They opened fire inside the grid station, damaging the control room, high-power transformer, current transformers, conservator tank, radiator tubes, AC/DC panels, auxiliary panels, and other essential electrical equipment, according to a Qesco spokesperson.
After holding the staff and guards at gunpoint for some time, the attackers reportedly threatened them to vacate the premises immediately or risk losing their life. Subsequently, the staff and guards fled to safety.
Later, Qesco officials submitted a written complaint to the local police station to lodge an FIR against the attackers.
Separately, some men sabotaged the 132kV Yaro industrial transmission line near Kuchlak Bypass by creating a technical fault using ropes.
 
 

During a joint patrolling operation with local administration and police, nearly 700m of conductors and various electrical components were found stolen.
The electric company later filed a written request with the police to pursue legal action against those behind the transmission line theft.
The spokesperson expressed serious concern over the rising number of sabotage and theft incidents targeting power infrastructure in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Dasht, and Sibi in recent weeks. The attacks not only disrupted power supply but also posed a significant threat to public safety and national assets, he added.
The Qesco appealed to all consumers to assist in protecting national infrastructure by reporting any suspicious activity related to theft or tampering of transmission lines.

• Punjab gears up for sixth spell of heavy rains
ISLAMABAD: At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday.
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country.  The dead include 102 men, 57 women and 140 children, while the injured include 239 children, 204 women and 272 men.
The severe weather has also caused widespread destruction, damaging a total of 1,676 houses, according to the agency’s data.
Of those, 562 homes were completely destroyed while 1,114 sustained partial damage.
The floods also led to the loss of 428 livestock, compounding the impact on local communities.
In response, the NDMA said it has carried out 223 rescue operations, successfully evacuating 2,880 people from flood-hit regions.
The authority has distributed more than 13,400 relief items to affected communities. These include almost 2,000 tents, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, and over 1,100 food packs.
Relief teams have also provided 1,282 kitchen sets, 350 life jackets, 1,122 hygiene kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps, among other essential items.
Medical support has been mobilised, with 71 camps set up to treat those affected by the disaster. So far, 577 people have received medical attention.
The NDMA said the crisis has affected multiple regions, with joint relief operations underway in collaboration with provincial and federal agencies.
As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.
Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit-Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.
Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.
Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.
Next spell likely to be heavier
In Punjab, Director General (DG) Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia warned residents on Sunday to prepare for a sixth round of heavy monsoon rains starting Aug 5.
“The ongoing rains could lead to medium to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with the risk expected to begin from Aug 5,” Mr Kathia said.
According to PDMA, monsoon rains in August are expected to be heavier than those experienced last month. Rain is predicted in dozens of districts, including Lahore, Mur­ree, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhu­pura, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Mian­wali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Khanewal, and Rajanpur.
The warning advised of a specific risk of landslides in the tourist destinations of Murree and Galliyat, where weak buildings and mud houses could also be damaged.

• Season comes to a close with climbers returning from K2, Broad Peak ‘empty handed’
FOR mountaineers, the mighty peaks in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Karakoram range became unusually precarious this year due to changing weather patterns, which have brought with them an increase in avalanches, rockfalls and other life-threatening hazards.
The mountains are comparatively dry, having lost much snow cover, and hence prone to avalanches — sometimes several times a day.
Baqir Ali, a mountain guide with four decades of experience, said he had never experienced such conditions on the peaks in his entire career.
A resident of Shigar’s Askole village, Mr Ali was part of Laura Dahlmeier’s team. The German Olympian recently perished after being struck by a rockfall at Laila Peak (6,096m).
“Several days before the incident, a French expedition team had cancelled their plan to attempt to climb Laila Peak due to the unfavourable weather condit­ions at the peak,” the 56-year-old told Dawn.
He said he had asked the German climber to do the same, but she continued her ascent in the alpine style — and at an altitude of 5,700m, she became the victim of falling rocks on July 28.
These precarious conditions made Hungary’s László Csomor abandon his expedition to Broad Peak (8,050 m) after more than a month and return to Skardu on Saturday.
His seven-member team had been at the base camp since June 27, hoping to summit the mountain. They, however, decided to call off the adventure, like more than two hundred climbers who had come to Pakistan to ascend its mighty peaks.
“This year, there was less snow at all mountains; rockfall was unusual; we would hear the sound of rockfall and snow avalanches 10 times in a day while sitting at the base camp,” László said, adding that he climbed to Camp 3 twice, but could not start the summit push due to bad weather. He blamed these conditions on less snow cover, saying that with enough snow, such threats diminish.
He said more than 90 climbers had been waiting at the base camp to summit K-2, while 30 mountaineers had been waiting to begin the Broad Peak adventure for the last month. Both peaks share the same base camp. Most of them have had to return with heavy hearts, as the climbing season for the Karakoram peaks nears its end.
László was also a witness to two accidents during his stay at the base camp – on July 11, Polish climber Waldemar Kowalewski fractured his leg in an avalanche on Broad Peak at 6,500m; while on July 19, porter Iftikhar Sadpara lost his life in a similar incident on K2’s Camp 1, located 500m above the base camp.
At least three people were killed and five were injured in such incidents during this season.
New challenges
“These conditions at the Karakoram range were new, and it was also challenging to climb the peaks because the snow was steep and unstable,” László said, adding that a decrease in snowfall made the slopes and hanging rocks prone to falls and avalanches, while crevasses had become bigger.
High winds also made the climb difficult. The foreign climber believed these changes were linked to climate change.
Mingma G, owner of Imagine Nepal and a renowned climber, also abandoned his Gasherbrum-II summit attempt due to avalanche risks. Traditionally, the climbing season for these peaks spans late June to mid-August. But this year, the risks are unusually high, forcing scores to abandon their summits.
“The weather at the peaks is not normal this year,” said Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator. Mr Qadri told Dawn that K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-II and many other seven-thousanders remained unclimbed in the summer, while a few summits at Gasherbrum-I and Nanga Parbat were recorded.
He said some climbers were still at the K2 base camp, to try their luck. However, the season is over and this summer, none of the climbers could move past Camp 3 on K2.
This year, about 22 climbers, including five Pakistanis, scaled Gasherbrum-I (8,080 m) on July 20 and July 22, whereas at least 24 mountaineers, including foreigners, summited Nanga Parbat (8,126m) in the Himalayas.
Distressing situation
Veteran Russian climber Denis Urubko and his wife Maria Cardell summitted Nanga Parbat in alpine style while also charting a new route for ascent in July. Currently, he is in Skardu and plans to scale K2 via a new route. However, he said the situation in the mountains was distressing.
“Glaciers and snow on mountains are melting fast, crevasses are becoming larger, and rockfall occurrences have become routine in the GB mountains,” Mr Urubko said.
He said the “classical route” to summit Nanga Parbat had also become a dangerous route due to speedy snowmelt, adding that these factors had made risks in the mountains higher than usual.
A senior government expert blamed these conditions on changes in the snowfall patterns induced by global warming. He said the region received snow late in the year, and it could not be converted into ice before the summer and thus remained unstable. In addition to that, the heatwave in June and July exacerbated the situation, leading to an unusual number of avalanches.
Livelihoods in danger
As mountains become precarious for climbers, the livelihoods of those who are linked to the tourism industry have also taken a hit. Out of 400 applications received by the GB tourism department, only over 200 climbers from multiple countries arrived to attempt summits, almost 50 per cent down from the previous year.
Thousands of people, including transporters, shopkeepers, hotel owners, porters, mountain guides, and tour operators, depend on the industry for income. Fida Hussain, a high-altitude porter from Shigar, feared that with the reduction of adventure tourism activities, they would also be left without jobs and income.

• Blames rupee devaluation for hike despite near same fuel prices
ISLAMABAD: The price of electricity is expected to increase by one-fourth over the next eight years, according to a power division forecast, after a 50per cent increase in the past three years due to massive currency devaluation.
The average tariff is projected at Rs29.70 per unit by 2034, up by Rs5.70 from the existing rate of Rs24, said the power division in a working paper shared with stakeholders in the last week of July.
The report said the increase in tariffs over the last three years can largely be attributed to the rupee’s depreciation which led to “second round effects of inflation and a contractionary monetary policy that further escalated overall tariff”.
The average power purchase rates increased by almost 50pc from Rs16.77 per unit to Rs24.88 between FY2022 and 2025.
This included about a 115pc increase in annual capacity charges from Rs971bn to about Rs2.1tr, although energy payments slightly dropped by 11pc from Rs1.43tr to Rs1.27tr.
All in all, power purchase rates increased by almost 250pc to Rs24.88 per unit in FY2025 from Rs7.17 per unit in FY2016 before the induction of mega power projects, mostly under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as capacity charges surged from Rs275bn to Rs2.1tr, an increase of 660pc, according to the power division.
Exchange rate impact
The power division said the average base tariff largely remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY25 in dollar terms ($0.12 per unit).
However, due to exchange rate losses, effective base rate jumped 44pc to Rs35.50 per unit from Rs25 as capacity charges increased by 66pc to Rs18.4 per unit compared to Rs11 per unit.
The energy price was reported at Rs10.94 per unit in FY25 against Rs10.2 in FY23, a nominal change. According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.
The fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.
Therefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.
The overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.
Despite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.
Going forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.
Deindustrialisation
The power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.
“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.
The power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.
Further compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.
The power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.

Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told Dawn on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional agreement of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.
Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.
“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.

Third round of talks between local elders and terrorists continues for several hours

On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook post also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.
However, in a social media post shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.
 
 

Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.
The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.
ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.
They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, bombing at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.
The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.
JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.
“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.
He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.
The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.
 
 

Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.
The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.
The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.
