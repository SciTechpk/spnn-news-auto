Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu Regional Police Officer, told Dawn.com that the Chairman of the Betani Qaumi Tehreek, Inamullah Khan, was returning from a weekly protest in the Pul Ahmadzai area when his vehicle was hit by an IED planted on Tejori road.
“Inamullah survived the attack,” Quraishi said. “However, initial reports suggest that a man was killed in the incident.”
Quraishi said that a police team had been dispatched to the site of the incident and that a detailed report would be submitted.
A police report shared later by Lakki Marwat Police’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Aamir Khan, stated that the incident took place at 8pm on Sunday.
“Near Bukhmal Ahmadzai checkpoint, an IED exploded near Inamullah’s vehicle, causing it to catch fire,” the report, shared with Dawn.com, read.
“Inamullah and the remaining leaders of the movement are safe, but two people were injured in the explosion, while a man was killed.”
The report added that the injured have been moved to DHQ Hospital Tajazai for medical treatment.
Later, the PRO reported that District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan reached the scene of the incident and that police were collecting forensic evidence.
“An investigation has been launched and a search operation is underway,” the PRO added.
In a video posted to Facebook, Inamullah can be seen appealing to the public to come out of their homes and “engage the attackers”, while gunfire can be heard in the background.
This incident comes days after the assassination of Awami National Party senior leader Maulana Khan Zeb by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”
A first information report was registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempted murder) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p><small>2025-07-13 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1317383173ea427.jpg?r=174720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923938/india-separatist-group-says-army-killed-leaders-in-myanmar-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>India separatist group says army killed leaders in Myanmar strikes</strong></a><br><p>Separatist militants in northeastern India said the Indian army carried out cross-border drone strikes on the group’s camps in neighbouring Myanmar on Sunday, killing three of its leaders.
Some separatist groups in northeastern India have ethnic, linguistic and cultural ties with minorities across the border in Myanmar and maintain a presence there.
Three commanders of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) were killed and 19 others wounded in a drone attack in Myanmar near the border, the separatist group said in a series of statements.
According to Indian outlet The Hindustan Times, the ULFA-I claimed that three of its members were killed in the attack that used over 150 Israeli-made drones.
In a statement, the ULFA-I claimed that the attack by “Indian occupational forces” took place at several camps from the border with Myanmar near Longwa in Nagaland till Pangsai Pass in Arunachal Pradesh between 2am (1:30am PKT) and 4am (3:30am PKT) on Sunday.
The outfit claimed that nearly 150-plus drones used in the attack were manufactured in Israel and France. It said the attacks claimed the life of the outfit’s lieutenant general Nayan Medhi (alias Nayan Asom), and injured 19 others.
In a second release, the ULFA-I said that two more leaders, “Brigadier Ganesh Asom and Colonel Pradip Asom, were killed in a subsequent missile attack.”
“While the last rites of Nayan Asom were being carried out, missile attacks were carried out in which Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom became martyrs and several officers, cadres and civilians sustained injuries,” the statement issued on Sunday said.
The ULFA-I statement added that Indian Army operations in the area across the border were still continuing till Sunday morning. The outfit vowed to give a befitting reply to the action on its camps.
Indian daily The Hindu reported that, according to the group, the subsequent strikes were carried out with missiles and struck a funeral for the commander killed in the drone attack.
Indian authorities have yet to confirm the strikes.
Camps belonging to another rebel group, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), were also targeted, the ULFA-I added.
The ULFA-I is one of several insurgent groups in India, and wants independence for the northeastern state of Assam, while the PLA advocates for the secession of Manipur state.
One faction of the ULFA laid down arms and signed a peace deal with the Indian government in 2023. According to the Indian outlet The Deccan Herald, the group was split, with those against talks making up the ULFA-I faction.
Separatist attacks have drastically reduced in recent years, but the violence has killed thousands of people, mostly civilians, over the last three decades.</p><small>2025-07-13 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13220309bfed719.jpg?r=220416' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923955/enrollment-in-non-formal-education-sector-increases-by-20pc-report' target='_blank'><strong>Enrollment in non-formal education sector increases by 20pc: report</strong></a><br><p>Enrollment in the non-formal education (NFE) sector increased by 20 per cent, according to the “National Non-Formal Education Statistical Report” for 2023-24 released on Sunday.
Pakistan faces a significant education crisis, with an estimated 25.37 million out-of-school children (OOSC) aged 5–16. NFE serves as a vital alternative, providing flexible and accessible learning opportunities for these children.
According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan 2024-25, the segregated data showed that the literacy rate was 60.6pc — with men at 68pc compared to 52.8pc among women. During the first three quarters of the ongoing financial year, the education-related spending decreased 29.4pc, dropping to Rs899.6 billion from Rs1,251.06bn.
According to the report by the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE), “The number of NFE centres across the country has reached 35,427, where more than 1.29 million students are studying, which shows a 20pc increase compared to the previous year.”
A total of 57pc of the students are girls, a development which the report termed as “encouraging progress towards gender balance”, adding that 82pc of teachers are women, reflecting their inclusion in the education system.
 
 

The report describes NFE as a “second chance education” model that is cost-effective, flexible, and socially inclusive. The monthly cost per child is Rs1,000 to Rs1,500, which is many times less than that of formal education, it adds.
The report highlights the significant disparity in enrollment rates by region and gender, saying, “According to the economic survey, the literacy rate of women is much lower than that of men, especially in rural Balochistan, where only 31pc of women are literate.”
Earlier in the week,  “Pakistan’s Non-Formal Education Report 2023–24,” was launched at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU).
“This number [of OOSC] has risen alarmingly, influenced by the impacts of COVID-19 and recent floods. Recent years have witnessed significant developments in the NFE sector,” said the report.
The report recommended the expansion of accelerated learning programmes (ALP), prioritising the expansion of ALP (Middle-Tech) programmes due to their high retention rates (70pc) and their ability to provide both academic and vocational skills.</p><small>2025-07-13 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13215558b02445a.png?r=215731' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923951/5-pti-mnas-expelled-from-party-for-voting-in-favour-of-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>5 PTI MNAs expelled from party for voting in favour of 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The PTI formally expelled its five members of the National Assembly (MNA) for voting in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill last August, it emerged on Sunday.
The Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2024, also known as the Constitutional Package, is legislation that takes away the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
 
 

The party last October decided to take legal action against its lawmakers, who had voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment in violation of the party’s policy.
Expulsion notices — dated July 12 and available with Dawn.com — were issued to MNAs Aurangzeb Khan Khichi (NA-159, Vehari IV), Muhammad Ilyas Choudhry (NA-62, Gujrat I), Usman Ali (NA-142, Sahiwal II), Mubarak Zeb Khan (NA-8, Bajaur), and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146, Khanewal III).
“[During] the PTI … parliamentary party meeting held on September 2, 2024 [in] Islamabad, … it was unanimously resolved that [the] PTI parliamentary party will not support the proposed amendments [to] the Constitution and will oppose the bill when it is moved in the National Assembly or is put to voting at any stage,” the notice read.
“You voted in favour of the bill and, therefore, you violated the directions and instructions of the PTI parliamentary party [that] were binding on you as a parliamentarian especially when you had won the election with support of [the] PTI and had taken oath that you would follow instructions of [the] PTI and that you would stand loyal to the party.”
The document recalled that show-cause notices were issued to the five MNAs in November to prove that they had not “defected” from the party, but they did not respond. Moreover, personal hearings were held for the MNAs, but they did not offer any explanation or defence, the notice read.
Two of the notices, addressed to Khichi and Mubarak Zeb, noted that they had defected and joined the PML-N. The remaining three notices took note of the fact that the recipients were sitting on treasury benches and “attended meetings of that [ruling] party”.
“Thus, you having voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2024, have violated the party’s instructions and directions which were binding on you,” the notice read.
“Therefore, you are hereby declared to have violated your commitment, oath and loyalty to the party. You have acted contrary to the instructions of the party … and joined another parliamentary party in the National Assembly. You are therefore expelled from the party (PTI) forthwith. Needless to add that you also stand disqualified on account of aforesaid conduct.”

Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the administration’s case on Sunday talk shows, just a day after a farm worker died in California after being injured in a raid on a legal cannabis farm.
On Friday, District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ordered a halt to “roving patrols” targeting suspected undocumented migrants in Los Angeles, saying a person’s race, language or workplace was not sufficient justification.
“Physical description cannot be the sole reason to detain and question somebody,” Homan said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’, adding: “It’s a myriad of factors.” But he acknowledged that appearance was one of those factors, and said there were sometimes “collateral arrests” of innocent people in targeted raids.
He said the administration would comply with the judge’s decision but fight it on appeal.
Noem called the judge’s ruling “ridiculous” and slammed what she called the “political” nature of the decision.
“We always built our operations, our investigations on case work, on knowing individuals that we needed to target because they were criminals,” Noem said on ‘Fox News Sunday’.
 


Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants, has taken several actions aimed at speeding up deportations and reducing border crossings.
As a so-called “sanctuary city” with hundreds of thousands of undocumented people, Los Angeles has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration since the Republican returned to power in January.
After ICE raids spurred unrest and protests last month, Trump dispatched the National Guard and US Marines to quell the disruption.
California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.
On Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided a cannabis farm in Ventura County outside Los Angeles. About 200 migrants were detained, and clashes erupted with protesters.
One worker being chased by ICE agents fell from the roof of a greenhouse and died on Saturday.
Homan called the death “sad” but specified that the man was not in ICE custody at the time of his death.
American dream ‘no longer’
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage.”
Trump said he was authorising law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these slimeballs, using whatever means is necessary to do so”.
“I am giving total authorisation for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the public,” he said.
Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.
The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.
The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an AFP reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.
“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions, but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.
“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.

Last week, Pakistan completed an extraordinary undefeated campaign to claim the Asian Youth Girls Netball Championship title, overpowering the Maldives 60-35 in the Plate Group (PG) final.
Eleven teams were participating in the championship and had been divided into two groups: Group A (Gold Cup Division) with Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and India, while Group B (Plate Cup Division) had Chinese Taipei, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia.
In an explanation letter issued by PSB on Sunday, reference was made to PNF’s letter, in which the federation claimed the team had secured first place. According to PSB, the claim was worded in a manner that created the impression of a gold medal victory.
The Board also raised concerns that PNF Chairman Mudassar Razzaq Arain reinforced this misleading impression during televised interviews on mainstream media, where he explicitly referred to a gold medal win and publicly thanked senior government officials for their appreciation.
A viral video of such an interview was also referenced in the official notice.
According to PSB, this purported achievement was used by the federation to apply for cash rewards under the 2024 Cash Award Policy, which subsequently led to government-level recognition and benefits.
The notice has instructed the netball federation to provide a comprehensive written explanation within three days. Failure to do so will result in the matter being referred to the competent authorities for further necessary action, according to APP.
Responding to the PSB’s letter, PNF Chairman Arain said in a video message that the sports board had misunderstood.
“I would like to clarify that Pakistan was in Pool ‘B’ and won all their matches in the Plate Division after competing against teams like Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia,” Arain said.
He added that the PSB had neither provided any funds nor assistance for participating in this championship.
Copies of the PSB’s letter have also been sent to relevant federal ministers, the chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, the secretary of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, and the president of the Pakistan Olympic Association, APP added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also lauded the team for their victory.
“Special appreciation for staying undefeated throughout the tournament!” he said in a post on X. “Very well played!”
The tournament took place from June 27 to July 4 at the Jeonju Hwasan Gymnasium in South Korea.</p><small>2025-07-13 16:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1320412252060e2.jpg?r=204834' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923949/rewriting-the-past-indonesias-new-history-books-spook-scholars' target='_blank'><strong>Rewriting the past: Indonesia’s new history books spook scholars</strong></a><br><p>The Indonesian government’s plans to issue new history books have sparked fears that mention of deadly riots in 1998 targeting mostly ethnic Chinese in the country will be scrubbed from the text.
The 10-volume account was ordered by the administration of President Prabowo Subianto, an ex-general accused of abducting activists in the unrest that preceded dictator Suharto’s fall, claims he denies.
Scholars fear his government could use the exercise to rewrite history and cover up past abuses.
Draft volume summaries and a chapter outline seen by AFP do not include any specific section on the 1998 violence.
A summary of Suharto’s rule in the volume dedicated to him only mentions how “student demonstrations … became a factor” in his resignation.

“The writing was flawed since the beginning,” said Andi Achdian, historian at Jakarta’s National University, who has seen the outline. “It has a very strong tendency to whitewash history.”
Suharto ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than three decades after grabbing power in the wake of a 1965-66 massacre.
The culture minister overseeing the government’s history project, Fadli Zon, told lawmakers last week the account “does not discuss May ‘98 … because it’s small”.
Neither does it promise to include most of the “gross human rights violations” acknowledged by former president Joko Widodo in 2023.
Jajat Burhanudin, a project editor, contradicted Fadli and dismissed concerns, telling AFP the new volumes would include 1998 events, with the draft outline just a “trigger for discussion”.
Officials say the new historical account is needed to strengthen Indonesian identity, but warned that any omission about its darkest past will raise eyebrows over objectivity.
“What is feared is that … the cases that have been accepted by the previous government to be resolved will be ignored,” said Marzuki Darusman, a former attorney general and head of a civil society coalition opposed to the volumes.
‘Updated’ history
While it remains unclear how the government plans to use the books, Jajat said the volumes could be used as “one of the main sources” for history books taught in schools.
Neither historian Susanto Zuhdi, who is helming the project, nor the presidential palace responded to requests for comment.
The revisionist history garnered renewed scrutiny after the culture minister questioned whether mass rape had occurred at the end of Suharto’s rule.
Ethnic Chinese Indonesians bore the brunt of the bloodshed during the riots, when rape squads — purportedly led by army thugs — roamed Jakarta’s streets.
“Was there really mass rape? There was never any proof,” Fadli told local media in an interview last month. “If there is, show it.”

A 1998 fact-finding report, commissioned by Indonesia’s first president after Suharto, found at least 52 reported cases of rape in the unrest.
“This project risks erasing uncomfortable truths,” said Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia.
Fadli told AFP the nation-building project would go ahead despite criticism.
“The consensus (is) we continue,” he said. “This is an updated version of our history,” he added, saying there would be a public debate “this month”, without elaborating.
‘Historical propaganda’
The project involves 113 academics, including historians, but at least one of them has resigned.
Archaeologist Harry Truman Simanjuntak told AFP he quit in a dispute over language — the term “early history” was used instead of “prehistory” for Indonesia’s ancient civilisation.
Fadli told lawmakers the phrase was avoided because it was created by Indonesia’s former Dutch rulers.
But Harry said it showed the political influence over the text.
“It was very obvious that the editors’ authority did not exist. They were under the control of the government,” he said.

The furore around the project has caused some opposition lawmakers and critics to call for its suspension or cancellation.
Activist Maria Catarina Sumarsih, whose son was killed in a military crackdown after Suharto’s fall, accused the writers of warping the past.
“The government is deceiving the public … especially young people,” she said.
Others said documenting Indonesia’s past was best left to academics.
“If the government feel this nation needs a history that could make us proud … it can’t be through the government’s version of historical propaganda,” said Marzuki. “It should be the result of the work of historians.”</p><small>2025-07-13 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1319244359eea97.png?r=192526' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923943/foreign-minister-ishaq-dar-to-travel-to-china-for-sco-meeting-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to travel to China for SCO meeting tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will travel to Tianjin, China, tomorrow for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, state media outlet Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their foreign ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders set for the autumn.
According to the report, the top diplomats from Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will also attend the event.
“The upcoming Council of Heads of State will take place on August 31 and September 1 in Tianjin, China,” Radio Pakistan reported.
“At the invitation of the Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Pakistan Ishaq Dar will lead the Pakistan delegation to the meeting of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.
The CFM is the third-highest forum in the SCO format. It focuses on the issues of international relations, as well as the foreign and security policies of the organisation, the FO said.
The press release added that the forum approves the documents, including declarations and statements that are to be presented for the consideration of the Council of Heads of State (CHS), as well as the decisions to be adopted by the CHS.
“The upcoming CHS will take place from August 31 to September 1 in Tianjin, China,” the FO said.
The FO also reported that Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov today and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement on Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project.
“Both leaders also agreed to meet again at the sidelines of the upcoming SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Tianjin, China,” the FO added.
 






Pakistan is heading into the meeting amid heightened tensions with India.
India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the fighting.
Last month, the SCO’s meeting of defence ministers failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal, while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reaffirmed the country’s commitment to combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and security within the body’s framework.</p><small>2025-07-13 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13192044068f2e3.jpg?r=194352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923944/frontier-constabulary-to-be-transformed-into-nationwide-federal-force-report' target='_blank'><strong>Frontier Constabulary to be transformed into ‘nationwide federal force’: report</strong></a><br><p>The government on Sunday decided to transform the Frontier Constabulary (FC) into a “nationwide federal force” and will operate in all provinces and territories, state broadcaster PTV reported.
According to the FC’s website, the force is commanded by a senior police officer and headquartered in Peshawar. The force is administered and maintained by the federal government, which has the power to deploy the FC in any part of the country for “better protection and administration of those areas”.
 
 

The report stated that the revamped force will be named the “Federal Constabulary” and empowered to function across all provinces, Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
“Sources confirm that this transformation will be formalised through amendments to the Frontier Constabulary Act of 1915, which are expected to receive approval from the federal cabinet,” PTV reported.
“Following the cabinet’s endorsement, a presidential ordinance will be issued to extend the jurisdiction of the FC across the entire country.”
PTV reported that following this process, recruitment will begin and new offices will be opened across the country. However, the force will still be commanded by senior officials of the Police Service of Pakistan.
This is not the first time such a move has been considered.
In 2018, then-Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the federal government was considering a proposal to upgrade the FC to the Pakistan Constabulary to bring the force and incentives for its personnel on a par with those of other civilian law-enforcement agencies.
Talking to reporters during a visit to the FC headquarters, the minister said legislation would be made to that effect.</p><small>2025-07-13 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13182402e608c8b.jpg?r=182504' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923940/pakistans-hockey-u-18-asia-cup-dream-comes-to-an-end-as-japan-wins-final-3-0' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s Hockey U-18 Asia Cup dream comes to an end as Japan wins final 3-0</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Men’s Hockey U-18 Asia Cup dream came to an end as Japan won the final 3-0 on Sunday in Dazhou, China.

Both teams drew 3-3 in regular time, forcing the game to a penalty shootout, which Pakistan clinched 4-3.
Before beating Malaysia, Pakistan had beaten hosts China 2-1 to qualify for the semi-final. They also defeated Bangladesh (6-3), Sri Lanka (9-0) and Hong Kong (8-0) during their campaign.
Last month, New Zealand beat Pakistan 6-2 in the final of the FIH Nations Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, retaining their title.
Pakistan is also reviewing the security situation in India before taking a call on sending its hockey teams to the neighbouring country for the Asia Cup and Junior World Cup to be held later this year, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on Saturday.
According to the PTI, a top official of the government has said that the national team will not be sent to India if there are security threats to them.

Ahead of celebrations this month for his 90th birthday that were attended by senior Indian ministers, the head of Tibetan Buddhists riled China again by saying it had no role in his succession. Tibetans believe the soul of any senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated after his death, but China says the Dalai Lama’s succession will also have to be approved by its leaders.
The Dalai Lama has been living in exile in India since 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, and Indian foreign relations experts say his presence gives New Delhi leverage against China.
Yu Jing, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said on X that some people from strategic and academic communities in India had made “improper remarks” on the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.
 






Yu did not name anyone but in recent days, Indian strategic affairs analysts and a government minister backed the Dalai Lama’s remarks on his succession.
“As professionals in foreign affairs, they should be fully cognisant of the sensitivity of issues related to Xizang,” Yu said, using the Chinese name for Tibet.
“The reincarnation and succession of the Dalai Lama is inherently an internal affair of China,” she said.
“[The] Xizang-related issue is a thorn in China-India relations and has become a burden for India. Playing the ‘Xizang card’ will definitely end up shooting oneself in the foot.”
 
 

Indian Parliamentary and Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju, who sat next to the Dalai Lama during the birthday festivities a week ago, has said that as a practising Buddhist, he believes only the spiritual guru and his office have the authority to decide on his reincarnation.
India’s foreign ministry said on July 4, two days before the Dalai Lama’s birthday, that New Delhi does not take any position or speak on matters concerning beliefs and practices of faith and religion.
Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will be attending a regional security meeting under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Tianjin in northern China on July 15 and hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines.
This will be one of the highest-level visits between India and China since their relations nosedived after a deadly border clash in 2020 that killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.
Late last month, India’s defence minister held talks with his Chinese counterpart in China on the sidelines of a defence ministers’ meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.</p><small>2025-07-13 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131616297404d29.jpg?r=165924' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923930/sindh-police-form-special-investigation-team-to-probe-death-of-actor-humaira-asghar' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh police form special investigation team to probe death of actor Humaira Asghar</strong></a><br><p>Police have formed a special investigation team to probe the death of actor Humaira Asghar Ali, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment earlier this week, it emerged on Sunday.
Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore on Friday following a sparsely-attended funeral, days after her body was discovered at her apartment in Karachi.
An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed, seen by Dawn.com, confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
According to the notification dated July 11th, available with Dawn.com issued by South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali, “A special team comprising of the following officers/officials is hereby constituted under the supervision of Deputy Superintendent of Police Imran Ali Jagrani (Clifton Division Acting Superintendent of Police)”, to investigate Humaira’s death.
The team will be headed by Defence Sub-Divisional Police Officer Aurangzaib Khattak with South Assistant Superintendent of Police Nida Junaid, Gizri Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Farooq, Sub-Inspector Muhammad Amjad and IT Branch Police Constable Muhammad Adeel as its members.
The notification directed the team to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
Police had earlier said that when approached, her family in Lahore — particularly her father — refused to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the entertainment industry.
On Thursday, however, her brother Naveed Asghar arrived in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial, calling out media outlets for portraying his family in bad light. Police had stated that the actor’s body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.
Speaking to journalists, Naveed said, “The body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.”
He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police.
 
 

“According to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,” he said.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p><small>2025-07-13 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13162621db16c38.jpg?r=170822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923932/malaysia-ex-pm-mahathir-100-discharged-from-hospital' target='_blank'><strong>Malaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital</strong></a><br><p>Malaysia’s former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has been discharged from hospital, his office said on Sunday, after being admitted for fatigue following a picnic celebration for his 100th birthday.
Mahathir, leader of the Southeast Asian nation for more than two decades, has a history of heart problems and has undergone bypass surgeries. He has been hospitalised repeatedly in recent years, most recently in October for a respiratory infection.
He was under observation at the National Heart Institute in Kuala Lumpur for fatigue-related issues on Sunday, his office said. “Mahathir has been allowed home as of 4:45pm (1:45pm PKT),” it said in a statement.
A physician who was a member of parliament until 2022, Mahathir drove himself on Sunday to the celebration, which also marked the 99th birthday of his wife, Hasmah Mohd Ali, a day earlier, local media reported.
The reports said he cycled for an hour before appearing tired. His birthday was on Thursday.
Mahathir was prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He returned as premier in 2018 after leading the opposition coalition to a historic win, but his government collapsed in less than two years due to infighting.</p><small>2025-07-13 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131559329e869d3.png?r=170348' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923927/imf-representative-hails-pakistans-strong-economic-reform-progress' target='_blank'><strong>IMF representative hails Pakistan’s ‘strong’ economic reform progress</strong></a><br><p>An International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative hailed Pakistan’s “strong” economic reforms carried out under the lender’s $7 billion loan programme, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) said on Sunday.
Pakis­tan had secured a three-year aid package deal in July 2024. The programme, approved by the IMF two months later, is set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici noted that the country’s performance under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) had been “strong so far”, according to a press release issued by the SDPI on its guest lecture in Islamabad.
Binici termed the EFF’s successful first review — also encompassing agreement on the federal budget blueprint — by the IMF Executive Board in May as a key milestone.
 
 

“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici was quoted as saying.
He stressed that structural reforms remained central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen tax equity, improve the business climate and encourage private-sector-led investment.
Addressing economists, researchers and policy experts, the SDPI statement said, Banici reaffirmed the Fund’s continued support for the country’s economic and climate reform agenda.
In March, Pakistan unlocked a new $1.3 billion arrangement with the IMF under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation.
Binici noted that the RSF was designed to help countries like Pakistan bolster resilience to climate-related vulnerabilities and meet international climate commitments, the SDPI press release said.
 
 

The IMF official mentioned that the key areas of reform under the RSF included enhancing public investment planning, promoting efficient and sustainable use of water resources, improving institutional coordination for disaster preparedness and financing, along with expanding the availability and transparency of climate-related data.
Binici stressed that “support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory”.
The IMF official also shed light on the evolving economic landscape across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region and Pakistan. He stated that growth across the Mena region, as well as in Pakistan, was expected to strengthen in 2025 and beyond.
However, he cautioned that “elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continue to generate exceptional uncertainty and weigh on the global economic outlook”, underscoring the urgent need for prudent and forward-looking policy actions.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri welcomed the IMF representative’s outreach, noting the importance of informed economic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in Pakistan’s journey toward sustainable development.
The lecture concluded with an interactive discussion on fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, external buffers and the role of international institutions in fostering inclusive growth, the statement added.
 
 

The IMF had also praised Pakistan’s implementation of the $7bn EFF as strong in March after both concluded the programme’s first biannual review on a positive note.
In May, an official said the IMF Executive Board found that Pakistan had “met all of the targets” under the package and made progress on some of the reforms.</p><small>2025-07-13 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131304554715319.png?r=134031' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918/pti-shows-willingness-to-talk-but-demands-accountability-from-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‘accountability’ from institutions</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.
Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a movement to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was imprisoned.
Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he claims are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into violence after facing state repression.
Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI’s Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: “We have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.”
He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a graft case, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.
 


Imran was jailed on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and faces pending trials related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important military installations come under attack, thousands of PTI workers and almost the entire top-tier leadership were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious charges.
The military considers the PTI the “planners and architects” of the May 9 riots and has demanded an apology from Imran, who in turn claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9. However, days later, he offered to apologise on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence.
At today’s press conference, Gandapur was accompanied by PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and MNA Latif Khosa.
“Come and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,” Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone’s collective responsibility to think about Pakistan’s future.
“The state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,” the PTI leader alleged. “And when you ask, they reply with delight that ‘we are non-political’.”
 
 

Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier’s son and brother, said: “My military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.”
“The state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,” he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because “those responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead”.
The KP CM quipped: “Where are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis.”
The chief minister called for a dialogue “based on reasons”, saying he was ready to be punished severely if it was proven that he “conspired”. “Whoever’s mistake there is, they will admit it […] we are ready if they punish us, but if the matter comes to punishment, then every person [responsible] will be punished.”
Asked if the PTI would hold a dialogue with the military establishment or politicians, Gandapur said that decision was up to Imran, noting he has previously stated that talks must be held with “decision-makers” but there was no objection to government officials being included in the process.
The PTI leader urged “those who are the beneficiaries of this system and those who have hijacked it” to hold talks, stressing that they are “answerable” and “must bear the burden” for the country’s economic situation and heightened terrorism.
Gandapur also assailed the 26th Amendment passed in October last year, saying the judiciary had been “handcuffed” through it.
 
 

Gandapur called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had “rejected” them.
He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the “culture” they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, “They (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.”
He asked if it was “right as a human and a Muslim” if a PTI leader’s home was raided and their privacy was violated. “If you are silent on this, then if this happens to you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.”
‘90 days to decide whether to continue politics’
Speaking about the PTI’s new movement, Gandapur referred to a “90-day announcement” made yesterday by his party, saying that they had begun from today.
He said the PTI has given itself 90 days to decide on its future. He detailed: “On August 5, we will take the movement to its peak through political means while following the laws and the Constitution.
“[…] We have set our targets that we have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country […] if politics do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward.”
“Hum aar ya paar karein gain (We will either do or die),” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”. He called the public to let the system continue as is if they wanted to remain “slaves” or join the PTI’s movement if they wanted “freedom”.
 
 

Responding to a query, Gandapur said that Imran was “leading the movement himself”.
Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.
A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as MPA Bhachar, reached Lahore via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran’s release.
The PTI in the northern Punjab region has decided to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support — a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13161703ac1e89e.jpg?r=161923' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923928/iranian-president-lightly-injured-in-israeli-strike-during-war-last-month-report' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president lightly injured in Israeli strike during war last month: report</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli strike that targeted a meeting of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council during the war between both countries last month, the Fars News Agency reported.
According to the report on Saturday, the missile attack occurred on June 17 as top Iranian leaders, including the heads of the three branches of government, were meeting in a secure lower level of a building in western Tehran.
The strike involved six projectiles that hit the entrances and exits of the building, an approach similar to an assassination operation on Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Fars said.
Officials managed to evacuate using a pre-planned emergency hatch, the agency reported, noting that Pezeshkian was “injured during the evacuation but was able to exit safely”.
 
 

The report also said Iranian authorities suspect a possible internal leak, citing the accuracy of the strike.
Fars criticised Western and Israeli-affiliated media outlets for ignoring a “blatant act of state terrorism” while condemning Iranian leaders’ religious rulings against figures like US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
A 12‑day armed conflict between Israel and Iran erupted on June 13 after Tel Aviv launched airstrikes on Iranian military, nuclear and civilian sites, killing at least 606 people and injuring 5,332, according to Iran’s Health Ministry.
Tehran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes on Israel, killing at least 29 people and wounding more than 3,400, according to figures released by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The conflict came to a halt under a US-sponsored ceasefire that took effect on June 24.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131437140a4807c.jpg?r=144035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923921/people-downstream-tarbela-dam-warned-of-water-release-as-spillways-to-be-opened' target='_blank'><strong>People downstream Tarbela Dam warned of water release as spillways to be opened</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority ((PDMA) on Sunday issued a warning for people downstream to stay away from the banks of the Indus River ahead of the Tarbela Dam’s spillways being opened.
A PDMA alert issued today said the spillways would be opened at 2:30pm on Sunday, with the water level likely to reach 160,000 to 260,000 cusecs due to the release of water from the dam.
It cautioned that flooding is likely in the Indus River and its tributaries and canals.
“The PDMA directs the district administration to keep the local population alert,” the notification said, urging the public to avoid going near rivers and canals.
It also cautioned parents that children should not go near canals.
“Fishermen and livestock keepers should move to safer places,” the advisory said. Tourists and locals were urged to heed the advisory.
 
 

“In case of any untoward situation, the public should call 1700,” the PDMA said.
A similar warning was issued earlier this month, with sources telling Dawn that the spillways of the Tarbela Dam were likely to be put into operation for the first time in the flood season 2025.
On Friday, the National Emer­gencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disa­ster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a weather alert warning that moderate to heavy monsoon rains are expected to affect multiple regions of the country for a three-day period commencing from July 13 (Sunday).
The forecast indicates moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall across various regions of Pakistan, as a result of which substantial rises in river flows were expected — most notably in the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla), and Chenab rivers.
The advisory stated that Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages were currently at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma were at medium flood levels.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1313592569d3398.jpg?r=155617' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923920/north-koreas-kim-offers-russia-full-support-on-ukraine-in-lavrov-talks' target='_blank'><strong>North Korea’s Kim offers Russia full support on Ukraine in Lavrov talks</strong></a><br><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered Moscow his full support for its war in Ukraine during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Pyongyang state media said on Sunday.
Lavrov’s visit to North Korea was the latest in a series of high-profile trips by top Moscow officials as both countries deepen military and political ties amid Russia’s offensive against Kyiv.
Pyongyang sent thousands of troops to Russia’s Kursk region to oust Ukrainian forces and has also provided the Russian army with artillery shells and missiles.
Moscow said Lavrov’s talks with Kim were held in a “warm comradely atmosphere”.
Lavrov expressed “sincere gratitude to Pyongyang” for its role in Kursk and support of Russia’s operation, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
 
 

Moscow also said the two sides “agreed” that the West was to blame for “the growing tension” on the Korean peninsula.
The ministry earlier posted a video on Telegram of the two men shaking hands and greeting each other with a hug.
It said the talks were held in Wonsan, a city on North Korea’s east coast where a massive resort was opened earlier this month — one of leader Kim’s pet projects.
Kim told Lavrov that Pyongyang was “ready to unconditionally support and encourage all the measures taken by the Russian leadership as regards the tackling of the root cause of the Ukrainian crisis,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
The North Korean leader also expressed a “firm belief that the Russian army and people would surely win victory in accomplishing the sacred cause of defending the dignity and basic interests of the country”.
He lauded Putin’s “outstanding leadership”, the report said.
The two men otherwise discussed “important matters for faithfully implementing the agreements made at the historic DPRK-Russia summit talks in June 2024”, KCNA said, referring to North Korea by its official acronym.
Lavrov told Kim that Putin “hopes for continued direct contacts in the very near future”, according to Russia’s TASS news agency.
He left Pyongyang and landed in Beijing on Sunday to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Foreign Ministers’ Council, TASS reported on its Telegram account.
 


Invincible alliance
Ahead of Lavrov’s recent visit, Russia announced that it would begin twice-a-week flights between Moscow and Pyongyang.
Lavrov lauded Wonsan as “a good tourist attraction”, adding: “We hope it will be popular not only with local citizens, but also with Russians.”
KCNA also issued a statement today on the meeting between Lavrov and his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui, held a day earlier in the coastal city, saying that bilateral ties were becoming an “invincible alliance”.
Moscow “expressed its firm support for the DPRK side in its just efforts for defending the security of the state” during the meeting, KCNA said.
In return, Choe demonstrated “full sympathy and support for all the measures taken by the Russian government to remove the root cause of the Ukrainian conflict”.
TASS earlier reported that Lavrov thanked the “heroic” North Korean soldiers who have been deployed to aid Russia during the ministerial meeting.
 
 

Around 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed and thousands more wounded fighting for Russia, Seoul has said.
North Korea only confirmed it had deployed troops to support Russia’s war in April, and admitted its soldiers had been killed in combat.
Both sides “emphasised their determination to jointly counter the hegemonic aspirations of extra-regional players, which are leading to escalating tensions in Northeast Asia and throughout the Asia-Pacific region”, Russia’s foreign ministry said.
The two heavily sanctioned nations signed a military deal last year, including a mutual defence clause, during a rare visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Pyongyang.</p><small>2025-07-13 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13132804ee4e137.jpg?r=132949' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923917/4-members-of-womans-family-killed-by-husband-his-relatives-in-kps-nowshera-police' target='_blank'><strong>4 members of woman’s family killed by husband, his relatives in KP’s Nowshera: police</strong></a><br><p>Four members of a woman’s family were shot dead a day ago in the Tatara area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, police said on Sunday.
Nowshera police spokesperson, Turk Ali Shah, told Dawn.com that a first information report (FIR) has been lodged at the Akbarpura police station under section 302 (intentional murder) and section 324 (attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the woman, whose parents, brother, and uncle were killed in the attack allegedly by her husband, his two brothers and father.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the complainant, a mother of two, said she married her husband a few years ago, but since then had been facing domestic issues and was living with her parents for the last four months. She stated that she had been pursuing a court case seeking a separate residence from her husband, refusing to continue living with her in-laws.
“The court recently asked my husband for a patch-up with me on the issue. He came to my parents’ home for reconciliation but started arguing with my family,” she said in the report.
The complainant said her brother-in-law, who was standing outside her parents’ house armed with weapons, came inside and opened fire at her parents and brother, killing them instantly.
Police spokesperson Shah said, “Efforts were underway to arrest the suspects who had fled the scene after the incident.”
Domestic disputes are not uncommon in Pakistan, often triggered by financial issues, inheritance, or family interference. In some cases, these escalate due to a lack of conflict resolution mechanisms, weak legal enforcement, and deeply rooted patriarchal norms.
Nowshera Police last month arrested the prime suspect in the murder of three children, with the alleged killer revealed to be the victims’ grandmother, according to a statement issued by Nowshera police.
On June 6, a man allegedly shot dead his son and daughter-in-law following an argument in the Tangi area of Charsadda district, police said.
In March, a man allegedly shot his elderly mother and two siblings dead in Nowshera district, a police spokesperson said. Rescue 1122 spokesperson said the suspect allegedly opened fire on his 82-year-old mother, brother and sister after a heated argument over power supply lines.</p><small>2025-07-13 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1311404607e34b5.png?r=135256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923882/ptis-five-jailed-leaders-demand-fresh-election' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s five jailed leaders demand fresh election</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s five senior leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat Jail have demanded fresh, free and fair general elections in the country, while learning lessons from the 1970 debacle, otherwise India will go ahead with its nefarious designs.
In an open letter on Saturday, PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed stated that Pakistan’s two provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, were undergoing the worst kind of terrorism, turmoil and instability.
They said both provinces were geologically important for having natural and mineral reserves, and the world was also eyeing those resources.
“Those rare earth materials had become significantly important for the outside world,” they highlighted.
The PTI leaders said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been a peaceful province during the PTI’s rule owing to former premier Imran Khan’s balanced policy but before and after Khan, the province remained a hub of terrorism that destroyed the economy and the society.
 
 

They said Islamabad’s relations with Kabul were strained for the past three years and on the other hand, Russia had accepted Taliban’s government in Afghanistan.
“The Afghan nation that continued calling Pakistan as its second home, is not only annoyed but opposing Pakistan,” the letter stated and added that friends had turned into foes and enemy’s proxies were attacking Pakistan from the land called ‘strategic depth’.
The PTI leaders said the federal government’s non-cooperation with the people-mandated KP government was a failed policy and asked how shunning dialogue was a wise approach.
Speaking about Balochistan, the party’s jailed leaders said the province had become a hub of anti-state elements and the law and order was so precarious that dozens of terrorism incidents had been reported during the past two weeks or so.
 
 

They regretted that both federal and Balochistan province governments had no idea about the gravity and seriousness of the situation.
“Both the governments, making tall claims, using state power and arresting Baloch leaders, were actually further deteriorating law and order instead of curbing terrorism in the province.”
The PTI leaders said Balochistan’s position required a serious situation analysis as the foreign infiltration and local issues needed to be tackled separately.
They regretted that the Balochistan government too was a fake-mandated Form-47 government and was contributing to increasing problems rather than resolving issues.

According to the PTI, a top official of the Pakistan government has said that the national team will not be sent to India if there are security threats to them.
Pakistan are scheduled to participate in the Asia Cup being held in Rajgir, Bihar, from Aug 27 to Sept 7, for which the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has sought clearance from the government. Pakistan are also due to feature in the FIH Junior World Cup, to be staged in Chennai in November-December this year.
Rana Mashhood Khan, who is the chairman of Prime Minister’s Youth Development and Sports Programme, said that the Pakistan teams would travel to India for the said events if the government was totally satisfied with the security situation in the neighbouring country.
Also on Saturday, a report by AFP news agency citing government sources said that Pakistan will not travel to India for upcoming hockey tournaments over “security” concerns, potentially jeopardising their place in next year’s World Cup.
The nuclear-armed neighbours traded the worst violence in decades during a four-day conflict in the month of May that killed 70 people.
“After the recent war the security and safety of our hockey players will be at risk,” said a Pakistan sports ministry source, who asked not to be identified.
Pakistan will also not participate in the Junior World Cup in India, the source added.
Once a top force in international hockey, with three Olympic gold medals and four World Cup titles, Pakistan in recent decades have slumped to 15th in the world rankings.
Not featuring in the Asia Cup will likely cost Pakistan a place in next year’s senior World Cup to be held in the Netherlands and Belgium.
A second government source also confirmed the decision to AFP.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office did not respond to AFP’s request for comment.
India stalled all bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which it blamed on militants based across the border.
Cricket since then has been the most affected sport, with the two countries only meeting each other in multinational events abroad.
India refused to visit Pakistan earlier this year when it hosted the ICC Champions Trophy, forcing the final — featuring India — to be staged on a neutral venue in Dubai.
In a tit-for-tat move, Pakistan will also not send its women’s cricket team to India for the 50-over World Cup later this year and the T20 World Cup in 2026. They agreed instead to play their matches in Sri Lanka.
Pakistan’s hockey team last toured India for the 2023 Asian Champions Trophy, finishing fifth amongst six teams.

The individual, identified as Irfan from Dera Ghazi Khan, was mistakenly presumed dead due to a mix-up in the identification of bodies.
Commandant Border Military Police Dera Ghazi Khan Asad Chandia (who had supervised transportation of bodies from Balochistan border to their native areas in Punjab) told that Irfan was among the 12 passengers who were forcibly offloaded from the bus by armed assailants. However, Irfan managed to escape execution.
The commandant said following his escape, Irfan did not return to the passenger coach but instead took an alternative vehicle to reach his native village, Wasti Buzdar, tehsil Taunsa Sharif. At present he is in a state of shock according to his family, Chandia said.
 
 

One Kashif, who is an employee of 1122 and hails from the same village, told Dawn that Irfan successfully escaped execution by hiding his mobile phone and identity card.
Due to his absence from the passenger list during the recovery process, authorities mistakenly identified the body of another victim, Sheikh Majid, as that of Irfan.
The confusion was cleared when local administration contacted Irfan Buzdar’s family to identify the body and they confirmed that Irfan had returned home safely but was not ready to give detail of his ordeal.
This revelation raises questions about the accuracy of initial reports and identification processes.
The Loralai attack, allegedly carried out by militants linked to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), resulted in the deaths of nine passengers. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation and renewed concerns over passenger safety in the region.
Talking to Dawn, DGK Deputy Commissioner Usman Khalid said the district administration does not allow public transport to enter Balochistan at night in order to prevent any untoward incidents. However, the recent fatal attack, which occurred in broad daylight, has raised serious concerns about the safety of commuters who prefer to travel during the day to avoid such threats.
 
 

In December 2023, Dera Ghazi Khan had received bodies of six barbers from Waziristan and three from Balochistan in January 2024.
Heirs of six barbers had also received compensation from government but the families of three truckers Ahmed Rasheed Zuhrani (23), two brothers Syed Ali Haider (16) and Syed Kumail Haider (25) could not get financial aid despite the fact that the DGK district government had officially requested and wrote to the provincial government for the compensation.

The police produced suspect Hashir Umar before the court on completion of his four-day physical remand.
The investigating officer informed the court that the process of determining the suspect’s exact age was still underway and that a co-suspect was yet to be arrested. He sought remand of the suspect for further investigation.
However, the magistrate turned down the request, sending the suspect on judicial remand.
 
 

The magistrate noted that no significant progress had been made in the investigation during the previous remand of the suspect. He said a mere claim of requiring more time for age determination or arresting a co-suspect was insufficient to justify extending physical remand.
He further noted that the report regarding the suspect’s age can be submitted at the time of filing the challan (charge sheet).
“It is settled law that physical remand cannot be given mechanically,” the magistrate said in his order.
Rejecting the request for the remand, the magistrate directed the police to produce the suspect again on July 26.
According to police, the underage driver was driving a black SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he hit at least three motorcycles.
Malik Amin died on the spot while his brother Malik Farid was among the injured persons who were shifted to a local hospital. Initial investigation reveals the SUV belongs to the owner of the house where the boy lives along with his maternal grandmother.

The new air service will help facilitate commerce, reduce travel time and costs for traders, and strengthen bilateral ties, said Ali Reza Rajai, Iran’s acting consul general in Quetta.
The announcement was made at a ceremony organised by the Pak-Iran Joint Chamber of Commerce.
The flights are intended “to facilitate trade and travel between Pakistan and Iran,” Rajai said, stressing the need for stronger cooperation.
Top officials from the airline, including Iran Air Chief Agha Karimi and Deputy Chief Agha Ismail, were also in attendance.
Mr Rajai said the new service would be critical for enhancing port-to-port cooperation between Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and Iran’s Chabahar Port.
He called for bureaucratic hurdles to be removed to improve bilateral business, including streamlined visa processes and affordable fares.

• Gohar says leadership will also take up suspension of 26 MPAs
LAHORE: The PTI top leadership arrived in Lahore on Saturday to devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on Aug 5 to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur describing the Lahore visit as the formal launch of the movement.
Before their departure, the party leaders held a meeting in Islamabad to discuss several issues, including the potential disqualification of the party’s Punjab Assembly lawmakers who had been suspended by the speaker.
In the evening, a caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar reached Lahore via G.T. Road. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign ahead of the two-year anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment on Aug 5.
 






PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s parliamentarians were going to Lahore for a meeting and added they would discuss the issue of 26 MPAs, suspended by the Punjab Assembly speaker. “The Punjab government has been unleashing fascism for the past two years, and now it is time that common sense should prevail,” he stressed.
Though there were reports that the Punjab police could block PTI parliamentarians’ entry into Lahore, the leaders had said they would stage a sit-in at the blocked point. However, the parliamentarians, led by CM Gandapur, made a smooth entry and camped at a farmhouse in Raiwind, Lahore.
The police, however, did raid party leaders and workers’ homes throughout the day and even went to the Shahdra Morr – Lahore’s entry point on G.T. Road – and took into custody five leaders, including Yasir Gillani from among those gathered to welcome the PTI caravan.
At a late-night party meeting in Raiwand, CM Gandapur told parliamentarians that they had reached the ‘political hub of the country’ to launch their protest campaign. “Any campaign launched from Lahore earns success and this too will be successful across the country,” he asserted.
Asserting that party leader Imran Khan is in jail for no valid reason, CM Gandapur advised party leaders to move forward through consultations and plans in respective jurisdictions to step up the protest campaign. “All the provinces should prepare their protest plans and implement them in line with their local issues and take the protest campaign to its peak by Aug 5,” he asserted.
He said the establishment had been ruling the country for decades and imposed multiple martial laws as part of different experiments, destroying the country. “The establishment this time has imposed a new kind of martial law, which is not official, but wielding every kind of power and pressure,” he observed and added that it destroyed the country but the perpetrators were not even showing any remorse.
At the meeting, Mr Bhachar said Punjab could not warmly welcome CM Gandapur because a “fascist government” was ruling Punjab that even lacked parliamentary as well as social norms. Mr Bhachar said the party’s 11 MPAs were suspended after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came to the assembly and her second visit led to the suspension of 26 members. “This clearly shows the level of fear the Punjab government is facing from PTI’s 107 tigers in the Punjab Assembly,” he asserted.
“Though the PTI leaders and workers are facing thousands of FIRs, the party is all set to launch a massive protest campaign aimed at the release of Imran Khan, his wife and all political leaders,” he added.
While the PTI parliamentarians have camped in Lahore, the party’s Punjab chapter, led by Aliya Hamza Malik, had already mobilised party workers across the province and assigned duties to step up the protest campaign and take to its pinnacle on August 5.
Before leaving for Lahore, the party’s interim chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said that the party had already sent a letter to the provincial government stating that it would hold a meeting in Lahore. However, he made it clear that the party was not planning to hold any rally or public meeting in the provincial capital.

According to the biannual performance report (July-December FY25) released by the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance, PTCL posted a loss of Rs7.2 billion during the period, pushing its accumulated losses to Rs43.6bn.
The report also noted that PTCL has moved up the ranking of loss-making SOEs, rising from 10th position in the first half of FY24 to 7th place in the current fiscal year.
The finance ministry cautioned that the proposed acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by PTCL, if not carefully managed, could further destabilise the Group’s finances. The ministry warned the move may hinder PTCL’s digital transformation goals and limit its ability to invest in core growth areas over the coming years.

Finance ministry flags risks to Telenor acquisition

The report also highlighted PTCL’s outstanding pension liabilities, which stand at Rs42.84bn.
Notably, PTCL had posted a net profit of Rs20.78bn in 2005-06 — the year its management control was handed over to UAE-based telecom firm Etisalat, which acquired a 26pc stake. The government of Pakistan retains a 62pc shareholding in PTCL, while the remaining 12pc is held by public investors through the stock market.
PTCL Group also comprises Ufone, its cellular subsidiary, and UBank, a microfinance institution.
The finance ministry described the planned acquisition of Telenor Pakistan as a bold strategic step to strengthen PTCL Group’s market position. The move promises potential synergies, cost efficiencies, and an expanded subscriber base. However, it also presents significant risks.

Myanmar has been mired in civil conflict since a military coup in 2021, with the junta battling a coalition of ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy resistance forces.
Saturday’s attack by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) targeted a military base in Kayin state at around 3pm local time, Thailand’s military said in a statement.
One hundred Myanmar soldiers and 467 civilians had crossed into Thailand on Saturday, where Thai military and police disarmed them and provided treatment and humanitarian aid, officials said.

Three kids among 22 civilians killed in monastery bombing

Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed there had been fighting near the border and said that joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the army.
“Some (Myanmar troops) defe­c­ted to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he said.
Myanmar’s civil war has caused huge waves of population displacement, with 81,000 refugees or asylum-seekers from the country currently living in Thailand, according to United Nations figures.
Strike on Buddhist monastery
More than 20 civilians, including children, were killed after an  air strike on a monastery in central Myanmar, an anti-junta fighter and a resident said on Saturday.
Myanmar has been consumed by civil war since the military ousted a democratic government in 2021, and central Sagaing region has been particularly hard-hit, with the junta pummelling villages with air strikes targeting armed groups.
The most recent occurred around 1am on Friday in Lin Ta Lu village when “the monastery hall where internally displaced people were staying” was hit with an air strike, said an anti-junta fighter, requesting anonymity.
He said that 22 people were killed, including three children, while two were wounded and remained in critical condition at the hospital.
“They had thought it was safe to stay at a Buddhist monastery,” the anti-junta fighter said. “But they were bombed anyway.”
Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.

• Orders issued for immediate restoration of irrigation channels amid drought threat
GILGIT: Extremely high summer temperatures and erratic weather patterns continue to cause destruction in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a cloudburst-induced flood damaged 13 homes, agricultural land, crops, and other properties in Gilgit and Ghizer on Saturday.
The flood also blocked Naltar Highway, Gilgit-Ghizar road and other link roads.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Deputy Director Raja Zahooruddin Babar described the cloudburst as “unprecedented,” as such an event had never been recorded in these areas before.
He said cloudbursts have happened in GB before; however, the scale of the disaster this time was unprecedented.
The cloudburst resulted in a heavy downpour in several areas of Gilgit and Ghizer districts, resulting in flash floods. At least 13 homes were damaged by the deluge along with farmlands, crops, water and irrigation channels and other properties in Shiroot and Shakyot areas of Gilgit.
A flash flood and landslides at Bargo Pari area in Gilgit damaged a car, two motorcycles and a tractor. Falling rocks blocked the Gilgit-Ghizer Road, which disrupted traffic for many hours.
Mr Babar of GBDMA stated that the road was later cleared and reopened for traffic. The authority is assessing damages in the area. No loss of human life or injury was recorded, he said. He added the cloudburst-induced flood also damaged farmlands and infrastructure in Biarchi and Gulapur areas of Ghizer. He said the authority was working to restore link roads in the area.
The Naltar expressway has been blocked at 10 locations from Nomaal to Naltar Valley.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain, along with Nagar Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan and other officials, visited the affected sites in Nagar district, including Hamari Tokorkot and Supultar nullahs.
Earlier on Thursday, floods damaged 20 homes and crops in Babusar area of Chilas.
On Friday, light rainfall across GB brought down the temperature.
Recovery efforts
This year, record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
The GBDMA DG has issued directives to expedite the restoration of irrigation channels damaged by recent floods.
The extensive damage to farmlands and crops and the unavailability of water posed a risk of drought in the region.
Mr Hussain told Dawn that GBDMA is prepared to protect vulnerable communities and dozens of households have been relocated to safer places.
The affected families in Nagar, Gilgit, Ghizer and Diamer have been provided with food and other items.

Over the past year, multiple attacks have been reported across KP in which remotely operated quadcopters were used to drop explosives. The military has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for these attacks.
In Bannu, the quadcopter dropped ammunition at the Miryan police station building, an official told Dawn.
“The munition fell in the compound of the pol­i­­ce station and did not cau­se any damage,” he claimed.
He said policemen depl­oyed at the station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The cops opened fire at the unmanned quadcopter but failed to hit it due to its high altitude.
It was the fifth quadcopter attack on the same police station in the Miry­­an area during the last month, showing a surge in the use of advanced quadcopter technology by terrorists.
A search operation was launched to arrest the at­­t­ackers and security was be­­efed up across the district.
Attack repulsed
In Lakki Marwat, cops repelled a midnight attack on a police station in the Serai Gambila town.
A police official said around a dozen armed men attacked the police station with light and heavy weapons late Friday night in a bid to take over the building.
“It was a multi-pronged attack as assailants circled the police station and tried to strengthen their position before launching the attack,” he added.
“After an intense exch­ange of fire, the assailants managed to flee the pla­ce,” he claimed, adding that all policemen deployed at the police station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The Serai Gambila poli­­ce station is located along the Peshawar-Karachi High­way near Gambila river.
It has been attacked several times in the past.
KP Inspector General of Poli­­ce Zulfiqar Hameed and Bannu Regional Police Of­­ficer Sajjad Khan lauded cops for “bravely” repulsing the attack and thwarting the terrorists’ plan to breach the police station building.
