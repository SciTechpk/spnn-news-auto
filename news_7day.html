Bihar, in eastern India, is one of the country’s poorest states and its third most populous, with over 130 million people. Its chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has previously sided with both Modi and the opposition, but is currently a key partner in Modi’s National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
The state is part of a politically crucial heartland region and any cracks within the NDA in November’s assembly vote in Bihar could threaten Modi’s coalition, with elections to follow within months in the states of Assam, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu. Modi’s national alliance, which has 293 out of 543 seats in the Parliament, has a strong voter base only in Assam.
Women are a key voting bloc in tight poll
The Vote Vibe agency said its opinion poll in Bihar showed the NDA had a marginal 1.6 percentage point lead over the opposition alliance, led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress party as of October 8.
“This election could swing either way,” the agency said in its outlook, noting that the NDA’s slight edge was due to its recent programmes, such as money transfers to 12.1 million women under a self-employment subsidy that totalled more than 121 billion rupees ($1.37 billion).
Nivedita Jha, an activist based in Bihar’s state capital Patna, said women will form a strong voting bloc in the poll because men usually leave Bihar in search of jobs in economic hubs such as Mumbai and New Delhi and not all return to vote.
“Women take the decisions because the men are not here,” she said. “They talk about the opposition which has promised more money if they come to power, and my understanding is that they trust the opposition more”.
Some Bihar voters are also angry about the revision of the state voter list. In one case, 85-year-old Jitni Devi said she was removed from the list and can no longer vote or access her pension.
“They have declared me dead,” she told Reuters. “People in my village tease me as a dead woman, and bank officials shoo me away when I go there to withdraw my money.”
The state election commission did not respond to queries about Devi’s case. The federal election body has previously said that all complaints are investigated thoroughly.
Young voters angry over unemployment
Anxiety among young voters in Bihar over employment is another election issue, despite a falling unemployment rate. Government data showed that 9.9 per cent of people aged 15–29 were unemployed in Bihar in the fiscal year 2023–24, a significant drop from 30.9pc in 2018–19, but concerns persist.
“For me, I have seen my father going out of Bihar for work, so the issue of jobs matters the most,” said Babloo Kumar, 25, who plans to vote for the first time in November.
A new political party, Jan Suraaj — founded by Prashant Kishor, Modi’s former poll manager — said it aims to reset the political agenda in Bihar.
“Joblessness, migration, increasing debts, loss in agriculture revenue are the issues in Bihar,” said the party’s national president Uday Singh. “There is a big dip in Modi’s popularity here”.
The opposition has promised a law guaranteeing at least one government job per family, if desired.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, said it remains confident of victory.
“The NDA alliance is in a very solid position,” said Guru Prakash Paswan, a BJP spokesperson. “People have strong faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision”.
Voting will be held on Nov 6 and 11 for 243 state assembly seats, and results will be declared on Nov 14.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16133503578c587.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949308/nations-welcome-pakistan-afghanistan-ceasefire-deal-for-regional-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Nations welcome Pakistan, Afghanistan ceasefire deal for regional stability</strong></a><br><p>China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran on Thursday welcomed Pakistan and  Afghanistan’s agreement to a 48-hour ceasefire after the two neighbours witnessed a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
China’s foreign ministry said today it supported countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire.
“China stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, told a regular press briefing.
Iran also welcomed the ceasefire between its eastern neighbours, urging dialogue and diplomacy after days of deadly clashes.
In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, and held a discussion regarding the matter.
According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO), “H.H. Prince Faisal appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and security in the region and emphasised the importance of collective efforts for stability.”
Per the statement, FM Dar “expressed gratitude for the Kingdom’s continued support” and also reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia to further strengthen cooperation on regional and international issues.
 






Following the announcement of the ceasefire, Dar also received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace.
On Wednesday, the Foreign Office (FO) said that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid recent border hostilities between the two countries.
 
 

“A temporary ceasefire has been decided between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours from 6pm today, at the request of the Taliban.
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said.
Taliban regime spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on X that Afghan forces were instructed to respect the ceasefire, “unless any aggression takes place”.
Pakistani officials on the northern and southern border with Afghanistan told AFP that “no violence was reported overnight, and the ceasefire remains in effect”.
Separately, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk welcomed the ceasefire and appealed to “both parties to prevent any further harm to civilians & commit to a lasting ceasefire,“ according to AFP.
The announcement came after the Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and capital Kabul, state media PTV reported.
Earlier in the day, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said security forces repulsed a separate attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 of their members.
It said Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
The fighting was the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following an incident in Kurram and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
Twenty-three Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 were injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border, ISPR said.
 
 

Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week.
For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself against terrorist groups such as the TTP.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries, and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16175520c5c6056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949333/nigerian-teenage-girls-chase-soccer-dreams-in-muslim-north' target='_blank'><strong>Nigerian teenage girls chase soccer dreams in Muslim north</strong></a><br><p>In north central Nigeria’s Muslim-majority state of Kwara, where religious traditions shape daily life, a group of girls are challenging cultural norms by playing soccer.
They’ve embraced the game’s team spirit, competitive thrill, plus the highs and lows of winning and losing, all whilst trying to ignore the disapproval of those who consider it unsuitable for women who choose to dress modestly.
As Maryam Muhammed laces up her boots and heads to soccer training at a local school in Ilorin, she feels the sweltering heat — made worse by her hijab and leggings — as well as the scorn from some in the local community.
Muhammed, 17, regularly hears taunts as she walks to her training sessions with the Model Queens Football Academy.
“They tell me I won’t achieve anything. But I believe I will achieve something big,” she said.
Despite the discomfort, it is important to her to cover up when she plays rather than wear shorts and a t-shirt.
“Sometimes it feels like I want to open the hijab, but I must not expose my hair,” she said. “I have to put it on as a good Muslim.”

Hijabs, which cover the head and neck, were barred by soccer’s world governing body FIFA on safety grounds in 2007, a move which led to the Iranian women’s team being banned from a qualifying match for the 2012 Olympics.
The ban was relaxed in 2012, and the hijab fully permitted in 2014.
Nouhaila Benzina of Morocco became the first player to wear a hijab at a senior women’s World Cup in 2023.
Mother criticised for allowing daughter to play
Muhammed’s mother, Kehinde Muhammed, has faced criticism for allowing her daughter to play.
“So many people discouraged me,” she said.
“But I respect my children’s decisions. I support her and keep praying for her.”
She sews hijabs to match team jerseys.
“I counsel her that this is the normal way you’re supposed to be dressed as a Muslim,” she said.

Model Queens coach Muyhideen Abdulwahab is trying to change perceptions.
“We go out to meet parents, to tell them there are laws in place for modest dressing,” he said. “Despite that, some still say no.”
Team member Bashirat Omotosho, 19, is passionate about the sport but cannot always attend training because she has to help her mother sell puff puff, a fried dough snack, at a roadside stall in order for the family to make enough money.
Sometimes the team jog past the stall as part of their training, which is frustrating for her.
“Training is often in the morning, but I have to be here,” she said, handing snacks to customers.
“I can’t leave my mum - this is how I earn money.”
Her mother, Titilayo Omotosho, was initially hostile to the teenager’s sporting ambition.
“Why would a lady choose football?” she asked.
But after her husband gave his blessing, the mother relented.
“Seeing other Muslim girls succeed, like Asisat, encouraged us to let her play,” she said, referring to Nigeria star Asisat Oshoala, the record six-time African Women’s Footballer of the Year.
Oshoala, who does not wear a hijab on the pitch, comes from Lagos, in southwest Nigeria, where Islam is less conservative.
Women’s game gains popularity
Despite growing interest, female participation in soccer remains low in Ilorin, said Ambali Abdulrazak, a local football administrator.
The Nigeria Women’s Football League (NWFL) is among Africa’s strongest, led by southern clubs from cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt, where infrastructure and societal support are robust.
In contrast, northern and central regions face cultural and religious barriers, though grassroots efforts are expanding.
Nationwide, the sport’s popularity is rising, driven by the success of the national women’s team, the Super Falcons, as well as increased sponsorships and grassroots programmes.
NWFL viewership has grown by 40 per cent since 2020, with match attendance up 35pc in 2024, according to Nigerian media company iTelemedia, which tracks audience trends across local leagues.

As the sun dipped, Muhammed and her teammates jogged across a sandy pitch at the local school during one of their training sessions, their voices rising between bursts of a muezzins call to prayer from a nearby mosque.
On August 29, Muhammed captained the Model Queens in a youth tournament final. They lost. At the whistle, she high-fived teammates and cheered as they received runners-up medals. Later, alone in her room, she broke down in tears over the defeat.
But the support of her family and her faith have kept her going.
“I really love this sport. I have passion for it,” she said. “Since my parents support me, there is nothing stopping me. Football is my dream.”

New Delhi neither confirmed nor denied it was shifting policy towards Russia.
“It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario,” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.
“Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”
 






Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has previously defended buying oil from Russia, a historic partner of India, despite Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Trump in August raised tariffs on Indian exports to the US to 50 per cent, with Trump’s aides accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine.
“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy,” Jaiswal added. “This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions.”
Meanwhile, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi criticised PM Modi, saying that he was “frightened” of Trump and that he allows the US president to “decide and announce” that India will not buy Russian oil.  The chief of the Congress party also said that Modi keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs.
 






India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85pc of its oil needs.
New Delhi traditionally relied on Middle East nations.
But since 2022, it shifted sharply toward discounted Russian crude, taking advantage of a buyer’s market created by Western bans on Moscow’s exports.
“Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement,” Jaiswal said.
“This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India.
Discussions are ongoing.”</p><small>2025-10-16 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16183507bbb6889.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949335/torkham-chaman-border-crossings-remain-closed-for-trade-due-to-escalating-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Torkham, Chaman border crossings remain closed for trade due to ‘escalating security situation’</strong></a><br><p>The Torkham and Chaman border crossings with Afghanistan remained closed for all trade activities last Sunday, in light of the “escalating security situation” along the Pak-Afghan border, it emerged on Thursday.
This development comes in the wake of military hostilities between Kabul and Islamabad. Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours.
According to a notification from the Directorate General of Transit Trade — dated October 15 and available with Dawn.com — transit vehicles headed to Afghanistan have arrived at the crossings but are unable to leave Pakistani territory.
“These vehicles are mounted with tracking devices and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) seals under the new tracking and monitoring system that was launched on October 1,” the notification read.
“These border terminals have limited parking spaces, leading to severe congestion,” it added. “Moreover, prolonged parking/stoppage of vehicles can encourage device theft as well as seal tampering that can lead to pilferage of bonded cargo. In addition, in the absence of return journeys, there is [a] possibility of a shortage of tracking devices at the Port terminals.”
The directorate stated that as of Wednesday, 107 vehicles arrived at Torkham, while 357 arrived at Chaman. An additional 37 vehicles are en route to Torkham and another 85 to Chaman.
“In order to avoid congestion at border stations and to ensure the security of the bonded goods, this directorate, in consultation with port terminal operators, bonded carriers, Afghan clearing agents and tracking companies, has temporarily stopped the processing of transit consignments till normalisation of border operations,” the notification concluded.
Torkham and Chama are key trade corridors between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with goods such as fresh produce moving across the border. Official data showed that Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan surged 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25, up from $558.03m in the previous fiscal year.
Trade across the border has been halted several times. Earlier this month, the disruption in internet service in Afghanistan impacted bilateral trade between Islamabad and Kabul via the Torkham border, with Pakistani customs authorities struggling to clear goods due to the non-availability of internet on the Afghan side.
In March, the cross-border movement of people via the Torkham border crossing was abruptly suspended after Pakistani and Afghan security forces were at loggerheads over construction activities on both sides of the border.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1611032888a389a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949293/aurangzeb-meets-saudi-finance-minister-briefs-him-on-ongoing-privatisation-of-pia-and-key-airports' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb meets Saudi finance minister, briefs him on ongoing privatisation of PIA and key airports</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met his Saudi counterpart on the third day of his ongoing US visit, the finance ministry said on Thursday, adding that the former briefed the latter about the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, D.C., where Aurangzeb arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip.
A foreign ministry statement issued today said Aurangzeb continued a series of high-level meetings in the US capital, including his engagement with Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan.
“He apprised his Saudi counterpart of the ongoing privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports, underscoring the government’s resolve to attract strategic investments through transparency and efficiency,” it added.
 






The development comes after a parliamentary committee was informed last month that the PIA Corporation Limited was expected to be privatised by November this year. The national flag carrier’s privatisation is a key condition under the $7bn IMF bailout package approved for Pakistan.
The planned sale of the PIA would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades, with divestment of loss-making state firms a central plank of last year’s bailout.
Regarding the said bailout package, Aurangzeb reaffirmed during his meeting with Al-Jadaan that Pakistan remained steadfast in pursuing economic reforms under the IMF programme to ensure long-term macroeconomic stability, the finance ministry statement said.
It added that the two finance ministers also reviewed the growing trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Moreover, the statement said, the two ministers agreed that institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) could play a vital role in mobilising private sector investments in Pakistan.
“Aurangzeb also sought Saudi support for infrastructure development projects, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a deeper economic partnership with the kingdom,” it said.
In a post on X, Al-Jadaan said, “We further explored opportunities to deepen cooperation and discussed topics of mutual interest.”
 






Aurangzeb invited proposals from the business community to further cement Pak-US ties
Apart from meeting his Saudi counterpart, Aurangzeb also interacted with leading Pakistani entrepreneurs over a working dinner hosted by Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at Pakistan House in Washington DC.
Aurangzeb invited proposals from the business community to further cement Pak-US ties, the ministry said. “The participants assured full support towards translating the government’s economic vision into reality.”
The minister briefed the participants about the country’s economic outlook, including macroeconomic stability and structural reforms. He highlighted streamlining of regulatory processes, improving the taxation system, and addressing issues related to energy, state-owned enterprises and privatisation.
Aurangzeb also highlighted that Pakistan’s improved credit rating by renowned global agencies has “contributed to reviving confidence of the business community”, the ministry said.
 






Other engagements
Aurangzeb also held other meetings earlier today, the finance ministry said, adding that the “engagements focused on reinforcing Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms, exploring new avenues for international investment, and strengthening bilateral financial cooperation”.
In a key meeting with US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black, he “highlighted significant investment opportunities within Pakistan’s oil and gas, mines and minerals, agriculture, IT and pharmaceutical sectors”.
 






The finance minister also underscored the consensus at the leadership level to enhance trade and investment ties, welcoming the DFC’s interest in facilitating private sector-led funding for projects in Pakistan, the finance ministry statement said.
Separately, he also met Azerbaijan’s first deputy finance minister, Anar Karimov, reaffirming strong economic and strategic ties between the two countries, the statement added.
In the meeting, “he congratulated Azerbaijan on successfully hosting COP29 and highlighted the Pakistan-Azerbaijan Preferential Trade Agreement (January 2025) and Transit Trade Agreement (December 2024) as key platforms to diversify bilateral trade beyond oil and rice into textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and agricultural products”.
 






During his meeting with MIGA Executive Vice President Hiroshi Matano, Aurangzeb expressed “appreciation for the agency’s support in ongoing arbitration matters and reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding both investor confidence and national interests”.
According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb welcomed MIGA’s proposal for a short-term trade finance facility to ensure access to “critical imports” such as food, fertiliser, energy and essential machinery, and emphasised the importance of its timely implementation.
He also acknowledged MIGA’s continued support for Pakistan’s power transmission and distribution sectors, the statement added.
 






The finance minister also attended the Borrowers’ Forum Roundtable, where he discussed the “crucial balance between servicing high debt obligations and financing essential social sector investments”, the statement said.
At the meeting, he commended the establishment of the forum as a “valuable platform for collective action, knowledge sharing, and policy coordination among debtor nations”. The statement further said that he also stressed the importance of improved debt management, enhanced technical capacity and better access to sustainable finance for climate resilience and infrastructure development.
The minister also met with members of the Pakistan Bank Fund Staff Association (PBFSA), the statement said, adding that he briefed them on recent fiscal, monetary and external sector progress and referenced the country’s upgraded sovereign credit ratings.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, energy reforms, privatisation, social protection, and inclusive green growth while responding to participant queries.”
 






Later, the statement detailed, Aurangzeb held a “productive meeting” with the senior management of Standard Chartered Bank, acknowledging the long-standing partnership between the Bank and Pakistan.
“During the discussions, the minister highlighted the external validation of the country’s ongoing economic reforms by international rating agencies. He briefed the team on Pakistan’s recent Panda Bond issuance and plans to tap international capital markets through Eurobonds and International Sukuk.
“The meeting also covered trade financing facilities, with the minister requesting the bank to share additional proposals for consideration to further strengthen collaboration.”
 






The finance minister also attended a session of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (CFMCA), held discussions with British economist Stefan Dercon and participated in a media interaction with the Wall Street Journal.
Yesterday’s address at Citi Macro Forum; ministerial meeting with IMF MD
He also addressed global investors at the Citi Macro Forum, where he, alongside the finance secretary and State Bank of Pakistan governor, presented a “comprehensive overview of the positive developments on Pakistan’s fiscal, monetary, and external fronts”.
He attributed the current economic momentum to effective stabilisation measures, structural reforms and prudent monetary management, noting the successful negotiation of a staff-level agreement with the IMF, the statement said.
 






Yesterday, Aurangzeb joined finance ministers and central bank governors from the MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) region in a meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
As a lead speaker, he underscored “Pakistan’s achievement of macroeconomic stabilisation and welcomed the staff-level agreement with the IMF. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to advancing reforms in taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, and privatisation”.
Moreover, he highlighted Pakistan’s “digital transformation and tariff policy aimed at enhancing competitiveness and exports”, while inviting international investment in key sectors including mining, digital infrastructure, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, the finance ministry statement said.

“Pakistani airspace will remain closed to Indian registered aircraft,” the NOTAM said.
Neither aircraft owned or leased by Indian airlines nor Indian military flights are allowed to use Pakistan’s airspace, the authorities said. The ban on the use of airspace will be in effect from Oct 15 to Nov 24.
 
 

The restriction was imposed due to ongoing tensions between the two nations. Pakistan initially shut its airspace on India in April this year and it has maintained the closure ever since.
Earlier on Tuesday, amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afgha­nistan, Pakistani authorities issued a Notam to restrict multiple air routes over its territory, for “operational reasons.”
Several routes were limited on Oct 15 and 16 between 7:30pm and 9:30pm each day. However, the restriction notice was withdrawn by Wednesday afternoon.

This $47.8 billion annual toll represents 5.88 per cent of GDP lost to healthcare costs, productivity losses, and 22,000 premature deaths.
Over 11 million children under five are regularly exposed to hazardous air quality, with 1.8 million people in Punjab alone suffering health consequences during smog episodes. This crisis stems from 25 years of policy drift.
While Pakistan drafted the National Environmental Policy (NEP) in 2005 and Climate Change Policy in 2012, it lacked clarity of purpose and implementation resolve. During these lost decades, all major Asian economies invested systematically in public transportation, clean technologies and inclusive propoor policies, leaving Pakistan dangerously behind.
Current approaches remain trapped in outdated administrative and punitive measures instead of systematic, integrated solutions. This reactive approach has proven ineffective against a crisis requiring comprehensive transformation. However, Pakistan can transform this economic burden into economic opportunity by monetising carbon reductions through international markets, potentially generating revenue while cleaning its air.

BEYOND THE CONVENTIONAL PARADIGMS, AN INTEGRATED APPROACH IS NEEDED TO FIGHT THE MENACE OF AIR POLLUTION WHILE TRYING TO TAKE PAKISTAN AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE WORLD ON MANY COUNTS.

The solution lies in systematic implementation of four concurrent tracks: carbon monetisation, transportation transformation, sectoral modernisation, and regional cooperation. There are no quick fixes.
Coherent, multisectoral implementation of these four tracks can hopefully set Pakistan on the right direction by 2030. Success requires treating this as an economic transformation opportunity rather than merely an environmental problem, leveraging international carbon markets while addressing the transboundary nature of air pollution through ‘smog diplomacy’ with regional powers.
The choice is clear: continue with failed administrative approaches and accept escalating health and economic costs, or embrace systematic transformation that can deliver cleaner air, economic growth, jobs, and regional leadership by 2030.
A crisis of national scale
Air pollution has emerged as Pakistan’s most pressing multifaceted challenge, transcending sectoral boundaries and posing unprecedented threats to public health, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) frequently soars to levels far exceeding WHO guidelines, contributing to a substantial burden of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases across the Indo-Gangetic Plain that affect over 900 million people regionally.
The 2024 smog crisis exemplified these impacts when pollution surges overwhelmed Pakistan’s healthcare system, with over 30,000 patients seeking treatment for respiratory ailments. Educational disruption affected 16 million children as schools and government offices were shut down, while parks, offices and markets closed across 18 districts. The World Bank estimates that one unit of PM2.5 causes $18.9 per capita in GDP wastage, making Pakistan’s economy “very air pollution intensive”. This pervasive environmental degradation is not static, but dynamic, exacerbated by climate variability and seasonal smog episodes. The crisis demands a series of actions to prevent escalating health and economic catastrophe.
The genesis
Pakistan’s air pollution crisis originated from incoherent policies implemented in the early 2000s, particularly the automobile loan liberalisation by a government that ironically also approved the NEP 2005, emphasising ambient air quality standards and vehicular emission controls.
Vehicle numbers surged from two million in 1999 to over 10 million by 2006, reaching 25 million by 2024, driving vehicular emissions to nearly half of Pakistan’s particulate and gaseous pollution. The NEP 2005’s medium-term implementation framework (2005-10) was never implemented seriously, while rapid vehicle expansion directly conflicted with environmental safeguards. All political governments from 2008 to 2024 continued with the same short-term approach.
During Pakistan’s period of policy drift, regional neighbours recognised air quality challenges and invested systematically in comprehensive metro systems, bus rapid transit (BRT), and emission standards. When environment became a provincial subject through the 18th Amendment in 2010, air quality management fell through institutional cracks. The National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) addressed air pollution as a climate challenge, but it was not until 2023 that Pakistan developed its National Clean Air Policy (NCAP). This institutional adrift cost Pakistan 25 years of potential progress, while the crisis deepened and neighbours advanced.
The current state
Pakistan’s air pollution stems from four primary interconnected sources: transportation and fuel quality, accounting for 45pc of year-round pollution through low-quality fuel and inadequate emission enforcement; industrial and energy production, contributing 40pc via coal-fired power plants and outdated processes; agricultural burning, contributing 10-20pc during post-monsoon seasons; and seasonal and structural factors, including winter inversions, deforestation, waste burning, and outdated brick kilns, compounding these sources across the regional airshed.
The economic burden includes healthcare expenditures, productivity losses, agricultural yield reductions, and premature mortality. The health crisis affects 11 million children under five in Punjab’s worsthit areas, demonstrating the urgent need for systematic transformation beyond administrative fixes.
Beyond administrative measures
Current policy responses remain trapped in reactive, command-and-control approaches with limited effectiveness and growing international implications.
The NCAP 2023 targets 38pc PM2.5 reduction by 2030, but remains constrained by relaxed standards, insufficient monitoring, and weak legal frameworks that increasingly conflict with international trade requirements. Under the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), these limitations pose trade risks as global markets demand credible environmental compliance, requiring Pakistan to strengthen clean air measures and align with stricter standards.
There are no shortcuts to decades of negligence.
Success requires implementation of four concurrent tracks, pursued simultaneously through multisectoral coordination. Only systematic implementation can set Pakistan on the right direction by 2030.
Track 1 involves monetising emissions through international carbon markets. The maturation of international carbon markets under the Paris Agreement presents Pakistan’s most transformative opportunity of reframing emissions from liability to tradable asset. Recent climate negotiations in Baku formally recognised voluntary cooperation mechanisms and regulated international carbon markets, enabling countries to convert reduced emissions into tradable credits.

When Punjab’s children breathe clean air by 2030, when Pakistani EVs get exported to global markets, and when carbon credits fund the nation’s green transition, the world will study Pakistan’s blueprint. This is not an environmental policy. This, instead, is an economic strategy disguised as climate action. The next five years will determine whether or not Pakistan will emerge as a new player in South Asia’s clean air landscape.

Pakistan has initiated this journey through the Delta Blue Carbon Project (2017) and approval of Policy Guidelines for Trading in Carbon Markets (2024). Thailand’s Bangkok E-Bus Programme demonstrates this financing model through Energy Absolute Public Company Limited’s partnership with Swiss entities. The project replaced thousands of internal combustion buses with electric vehicles through verified carbon credit sales to Switzerland’s KliK Foundation at over $30 per credit. South Pole verified avoided emissions sold as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes, while UNDP’s Carbon Payment for Development Programme enhanced credibility, targeting 500,000 tonnes of emission reductions by 2030.
Pakistan can replicate this model leveraging the Bank of Punjab’s joint venture agreements with Chinese manufacturers. Promising partners include such players as BYD, CATL, Geely, JAC Motors and Changan Automobile. These partnerships, combined with carbon credit financing under CPEC 2.0 can make Pakistan’s transition entirely self-funding, while creating domestic manufacturing ecosystems generating employment and export potential.
For Pakistan’s fleet of 25 million vehicle producing nearly half of national emissions, systematic electrification could generate billions in carbon revenues, creating self-sustaining financial models transforming pollution burdens into economic opportunities. Implementation requires establishing dedicated carbon market authority, quantifying emission reduction potential across sectors, and developing verified carbon credit pipelines for largescale projects.
Track 2 involves comprehensive transportation transformation. Urban air pollution fundamentally reflects transportation systems dominated by individual vehicles. Sustainable solutions require dual strategies: integrated mass transit development and large-scale vehicle electrification, moving beyond the administrative approach of temporary vehicle bans.
Current Pakistani mass transit projects operate in isolation when there should be a seamless network of buses, metro lines and feeder services. The transition’s scale necessitates public-private partnerships.
Likewise, Pakistan’s electric vehicle policy needs to go beyond setting symbolic targets. Pakistan should pursue state-backed acquisition of complete EV production lines through CPEC 2.0, providing investment certainty while securing technology transfer and local assembly capabilities. Large-scale EV rollout promises cascading benefits, including significantly reduced fuel import bills, creation of high-skilled manufacturing jobs, and profound public health improvements. The Bank of Punjab’s financing agreements demonstrate financial sector readiness to support this transition.
Success requires national vehicle retirement age standards, targeting highly polluting older vehicles, enforcing fuel quality standards reducing sulphur content, and introducing robust and mandatory vehicle fitness testing.
Track 3 involves sectoral modernisation of agriculture and industry. Agricultural crop residue burning and outdated industrial processes require systematic modernisation rather than punitive approaches. The Punjab Agriculture Department launched subsidised ‘happy seeder’ technology in 2020, enabling direct wheat sowing into unburnt rice stubble, complemented by satellite-based monitoring for real-time burning detection. Research has shown that farmers using this technology can generate up to 20pc higher profits compared to those who burn stubble, while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 78pc per hectare.
Scaling-up requires comprehensive farmer support, expanded subsidised residue management machinery, farming incentives, and soil health education campaigns. Converting crop residue to bioenergy could meet 14pc of Pakistan’s energy needs while creating rural employment and additional income streams for farmers. Establishing collection and processing networks would generate an estimated 100,000 agricultural sector jobs while reducing burning by 60pc by 2030.
In the industrial sector, many plants continue using highly polluting fuels and processes. Solutions require mandatory transition to clean production technologies through phased equipment mandates combined with economic incentives, like tax credits and subsidised loans, for clean technology investments. Technology transfer partnerships with countries maintaining advanced environmental standards can accelerate this transition while building domestic technical capacity.
Industrial modernisation ensures Pakistani exports meet international environmental standards, protecting market access worth billions in textile, cement and steel exports, while reducing emissions by 40pc by 2030.
Smog diplomacy
Track 4 involves regional cooperation and ‘smog diplomacy’. Research published in leading scientific journals has demonstrated that air pollution in South Asia operates as an interconnected regional system. As such, domestic policies alone cannot address pollution sources that are fundamentally transboundary in nature, requiring coordinated regional approaches that match the scale of atmospheric processes.
Under the Institutional Framework Development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked with diplomatic engagement to address cross-border pollution impacts with India through ‘smog diplomacy’ by building on the 1998 Malé Declaration framework.
This requires establishing a South Asian Air Quality Council to coordinate policies, share monitoring data, and manage joint funding mechanisms.
Punjab’s smog war room provides a model for crisis management protocols that can extend to bilateral cooperation through sister-province agreements between Pakistani and Indian Punjab. Joint technical working groups would coordinate crop burning alternatives, industrial emission standards, and emergency response during severe pollution episodes.
Regular bilateral summits between provincial governments would address shared challenges independent of broader political tensions. Regional mechanisms supported by UN agencies and multilateral development banks can facilitate knowledge exchange through the underutilised regional environmental cooperation frameworks.
A proposed South Asian Clean Air Fund, to be capitalised at $5 billion through member country contributions, international development banks, and carbon market revenues, could finance crossborder monitoring systems, technology transfer programmes and joint pollution control projects.
Implementation roadmap
Pakistan’s transformation requires a carefully sequenced three-phase approach across all four tracks simultaneously. Phase-I (2025-26) focuses on foundation building by designating dedicated carbon market authority, securing manufacturing partnerships, developing integrated transit master plans, initiating agricultural technology subsidies, structuring industrial modernisation incentives, and creating bilateral air quality dialogue mechanisms with India.
Phase-II (2027-30) emphasises scaling and consolidation by deploying 2.5 million EVs annually through carbon credit financing, construcwting integrated transit systems, achieving 30pc reduction in crop residue burning, and implementing mandatory industrial emission standards with comprehensive technology transfer support.
The metrics of interest should be to achieve 40pc reduction in PM2.5 levels compared to 2024, generate $20 billion in reduced health and productivity costs, create 500,000 green jobs, and to establish Pakistan as the recognised regional powerhouse in clean air innovation and crossborder environmental cooperation.
The path forward is unambiguous. No other developing nation has attempted carbon market financing at this scale, integrated with comprehensive sectoral transformation and regional diplomacy. The proposed framework positions Pakistan as the architect of South Asia’s environmental future. When Punjab’s children breathe clean air by 2030, when Pakistani EVs export to global markets, and when carbon credits fund the nation’s green transition, the world will study Pakistan’s blueprint. This is not environmental policy. This, instead, is an economic strategy disguised as climate action.
The next five years will determine whether Pakistan emerges as a new player in South Asia’s clean air landscape, or remains captive to the reform inertia that has squandered every previous opportunity for national renewal.

After a week-long constitutional and political crisis in the province over the chief minister’s election, Afridi was sworn in as the KP CM yesterday evening, with hundreds of PTI supporters present during the ceremony at the Governor House in Peshawar.
A two-member bench comprising PHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar took up Afridi’s bail application today, with the chief minister appearing before the court in person.
During the hearing, Justice Ijaz asked whether there were any first information reports (FIR) registered against the KP chief minister.
“We do not know how many FIRs there are. It is possible that there might be an FIR against me as well,” KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel told the court.
Subsequently, the court approved CM Afridi’s bail plea, barring his arrest in any case till November 18.
According to the court order, available with Dawn.com, the bench directed that details regarding criminal cases, if any, registered against Afridi be provided at the next hearing on November 18.
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Afridi said that the federal and “those individuals who are preventing the meeting [with Imran] should realise that a province’s chief minister is coming”.
Responding to a reporter’s query, Afridi said he has not met Imran since he was imprisoned. He also refuted a list of names for his new cabinet that has been circulating on social media as “fake”.
Asked whether the provincial cabinet will be finalised after his meeting with the PTI founder, CM Afridi replied in the affirmative. “No action will be taken without the approval of our lifelong [party] chairman sahib,” he asserted.
‘Peaceful protest always an option’
Yesterday, the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department had requested the secretary of its Punjab counterpart and the interior ministry secretary that “necessary arrangements” be made to facilitate Afridi’s meeting with Imran today, according to a letter shared by Niazi.
 






Shortly after today’s hearing, PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta said on social media platform X that Afridi had departed for Adiala Jail to meet party founder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases.
 






CM’s Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi also shared a video on X, saying that the chief minister was on his way to Adiala Jail.
 






Later in the afternoon, the PTI claimed that the authorities were “not letting” CM Afridi meet Imran, terming it the “real anti-Pakistan act”.
“They are isolating the very leadership that millions of Pakistanis trust. They fear the people standing together with Imran Khan,” the party said on its official X account.
 






Speaking at a checkpoint situated near Adiala jail, the chief minister assured the people gathered there that he would not disappoint them.
 






Later, he also spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, he said he had come there to meet Imran. “Yesterday, the KP government had informed the federal and Punjab government that the [KP] chief minister would be meeting Imran today, but they did not respond,” he said, adding that he also spoke to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“I thanked Shehbaz Sharif sahib, he called and congratulated me. I told him that […] our people should not [get affected] by our personal and political differences. I requested him to let me meet Imran, at which he said he would enquire [about the matter] and get back to me. But till now, there has been no response from him,” Afridi said.
The KP CM said they were trying to adopt all constitutional and legal means for his meeting with Imran. “Previously, too, we tried all means and will try them again,” he asserted. But, he continued, in that case the PTI was criticised for practicing the politics of protests.
“But if courts don’t serve justice, if we adopted all constitutional means and still are not served justice, then peaceful protest is the only solution. We have always protested peaceful and we always have that option,” Afridi added.

Malakand Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Shafiqa Gul said in a statement, “At least 15 members of the same family were killed and eight others sustained injuries when a truck overturned near tunnel No. 3 of the Swat Motorway on Thursday morning.”
The dead and injured include men, women and children, she said.
“The family was from the Gabral area of the Bahrain tehsil and were travelling to Punjab when the tragic incident occurred,” the statement said.
Rescue teams rushed to the site of the incident and carried out relief operations alongside the Motorway police, according to the spokesperson. She further said that the injured had been taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, Batkhela.
“Doctors at the hospital confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives,” she said, adding that four of the injured were in critical condition and had been referred to Swat.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi expressed his grief over the incident and expressed solidarity with the victims and their families.
 






KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, taking note of the incident, expressed “deep sorrow” at the loss of lives, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
He vowed to stand in solidarity with the victims’ families, saying that “loss of life is an irreparable tragedy.”
The governor also “wished a swift recovery for those injured in the accident,” APP reported.
 






Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Last month, at least 11 people were killed, and another three were injured after a truck crashed in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan due to brake failure.
On September 11, two women were killed, while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Mansehra. Two days before that, five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16175100beacc4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949331/ball-is-in-their-court-pm-shehbaz-says-ready-for-talks-if-afghanistan-agrees-to-pakistans-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>‘Ball is in their court’: PM Shehbaz says ready for talks if Afghanistan agrees to Pakistan’s conditions</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul agreed to fulfil Pakistan’s “justified” conditions following recent hostilities between the two countries.
Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours.
 
 

The announcement followed sustained hostilities between the two countries over the weekend.
Addressing the federal cabinet today after the latest round of conflict, the premier stated that the Afghan side had requested a ceasefire and made a formal request. “Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready. The ball is in their court.”
 


He added that if the Afghan side was sincere and serious, then it would initiate steps to hold talks, adding that Pakistan’s allied nations, particularly Qatar, were also making efforts to resolve the situation.
The premier expressed hope that the latest situation between the two countries would be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the Fitna al-Khawarij from Afghan soil so the neighbouring country’s territory would no longer be used by terrorists.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned.
He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity.
“Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response.”
The premier said the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions.
Shehbaz also commended the armed forces and Field Marshal Asim Munir for their response to the Afghan side during the conflict, saying it was “necessary” to do so due to the many martyrdoms suffered by the security forces in operations against terrorists.
Gaza ceasefire
The premier also addressed the ceasefire in Gaza, pointing out the high casualties in the besieged territory during the conflict and Pakistan’s efforts towards peace in the matter.
He also criticised the politicisation of the issue within the country, saying it was a “great achievement” if fighting and deaths had stopped in Gaza.
PM Shehbaz lauded the role of United States President Donald Trump and all Muslim countries for their role in achieving the ceasefire, singling out Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.
The prime minister said the Palestinians should get their own state, adding that Pakistan would continue to strive and make efforts towards this end.
Welcomes IMF agreement
PM Shehbaz also welcomed the recent staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and commended his team and the finance ministry for working day and night to pull it off.
“This should be the last programme that Pakistan enters with the IMF.”
He said the time had come to rid the country of loans, adding it would not be easy and would require continuous struggle and effort.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1617133672a562d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949330/new-york-mayoral-candidate-mamdani-apologises-to-police-for-2020-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>New York mayoral candidate Mamdani apologises to police for 2020 remarks</strong></a><br><p>New York’s Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday apologised to the New York Police Department (NYPD) for remarks he made in 2020 during the height of the George Floyd protests.
“I apologise for the language that I used, and I spoke to them about the fact that I want to work with them to deliver public safety because what we’re seeing in the city right now is we’re asking officers to do nearly everything we can think of,” Mamdani said in an interview on US media outlet Fox News.
“We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we’re asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness. In one year alone, the NYPD receives 200,000 mental health calls,” he added.
Fox host Martha MacCallum said officers she spoke with had requested a public apology from Mamdani. He responded: “I’ll apologise to police officers right here, because this is the apology that I’ve been sharing with many rank-and-file officers. I apologise because of the fact that I’m looking to working with these officers.“
Mamdani, who continues to hold a strong lead in the polls, said his views on policing have evolved over time during his tenure in the state Legislature.
“One of my focuses was, ‘How do we deliver that justice?’ And now what I know, having represented 100,000 people in western Queens, is that to deliver that justice, you have to also deliver that safety. And that means representing the men and women in the NYPD,” Mamdani said.
“It means representing the Black and brown New Yorkers who have been victims of police brutality. It means representing the Muslim New Yorkers in my district who were surveilled on the basis of their faith,” he added.
In June 2020, Mamdani wrote on the US social media company X, then known as Twitter: “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”
Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed on May 25, 2020, when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on his neck for nearly 10 minutes. His death sparked global protests against racism and police brutality, with demonstrations spreading far beyond the US.</p><small>2025-10-16 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16141832055f7af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949310/behind-generative-ai-curtain-is-gruelling-low-paid-human-work' target='_blank'><strong>Behind generative AI curtain is gruelling, low-paid human work</strong></a><br><p>For a generative artificial intelligence system to learn how to write an autopsy report, human workers must sort and annotate thousands of crime scene images.
The precarious work of training AI, which generally pays just a few dollars, has sparked a movement for better wages and conditions stretching from Kenya to Colombia.
“You have to spend your whole day looking at dead bodies and crime scenes… Mental health support was not provided,” Kenyan national Ephantus Kanyugi told AFP.
Labellers “need to spend time with these images, zoom into the wounds of dead people” to outline them so they can be fed into the AI, the 30-year-old added.
Kanyugi, who has worked on image labelling since 2018, is the vice-president of the Data Labelers Association (DLA), an 800-strong labour group based in Nairobi.
The DLA plans to unveil a code of conduct this month aimed at major labelling platforms, calling for improved conditions for workers.
Kenya has no law regulating data-annotation work — like many countries around the world where millions of people are feeding digital information into growing AI models.
“We’re like ghosts. No one knows that we exist, even though we are contributing to society’s technological progress,” said Oskarina Fuentes, half a world away.
The 35-year-old Venezuelan works for five different data-labelling platforms from her home in Colombian city Medellin, earning between five and 25 US cents per task.
Such behind-the-scenes data work has exploded as generative AI has soared to become tech’s next big thing.
Invisible labellers’ toil has allowed self-driving cars to recognise pedestrians and trees, chatbots like ChatGPT to speak in natural-sounding sentences, and automated content moderation systems to remove violent or pornographic content from social media.
The data-labelling sector amounted to a $3.8-billion market in 2024 and is expected to grow to more than $17bn within five years, according to consultancy Grand View Research.

‘Modern slavery’
Creating new generative AI models will need human-verified data “for as long as it’s based on automated learning”, said Antonio Casilli, a sociology professor at France’s Institut Polytechnique in Paris who interviewed so-called “click workers” from 30 countries for a book on the sector.
Humans are required both to shape the inputs for generative AI models and to give feedback on the relevance and accuracy of the trained systems’ outputs.
Tech giants contract out this work to a plethora of different companies.
One of the largest, US-based Scale AI, recently secured a $14-bn investment from Facebook parent company Meta — which also hired away co-founder Alexandr Wang to lead its own AI efforts.
Scale’s clients include OpenAI, Microsoft and the Defense Department in Washington.
In his investigation, Casilli found that data labellers are generally aged between 18 and 30 and earn a low wage in relation to their level of education.
Most live in low-wage countries — although the sector is making inroads into America and Europe, where much higher pay is the norm.
As generative AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or competitor Anthropic’s Claude gain in capability, more specialised knowledge is needed to inform and judge their responses in maths, chemistry or less-common languages.
Scale AI’s subsidiary Outlier lists work for experts in biology, the Malay language spoken in Malaysia or computer coding in Spanish, with pay ranging from $30 to $50 per hour.
Another Scale AI subsidiary, Remotasks, pays labellers around one US cent for tasks that can take multiple hours — wages Kanyugi likens to “modern slavery”.
“People develop eyesight problems, back problems, people go into anxiety and depression because you’re working 20 hours a day or six days a week,” he said.
“Then despite working so many hours, you only get poor pay, and you might also not get paid.”

‘How to murder someone?’
Several legal cases have been filed against Scale AI in the US, with workers accusing the company of failing to pay them, reporting them as contractors rather than employees or exposing them to traumatising content without adequate safeguards, according to court documents seen by AFP.
Plaintiffs gave examples like being required to converse with an AI chatbot about topics such as “How to commit suicide?”, “How to poison a person?” or “How to murder someone?”
Scale AI declined to comment on ongoing court cases, but acknowledged to AFP that some of its work includes sensitive content.
The company added that workers are always warned in advance of such topics and can break off a task whenever they choose.
Scale AI added that it offers workers mental-health resources and an anonymous support hotline.
And it said it makes its pay bands clear, offering equal or better hourly rates than the minimum wage in the countries where it operates.
Generative AI is not the first arm of the tech sector to face complaints over exposing low-paid contractors to disturbing content.
Moderators working for Meta in several countries, from Spain to Kenya and Ghana, have brought legal action against the company over working conditions and alleged psychological harm.

Cut off
Most of the people labouring to fine-tune data for AI are in precarious working relationships that can be severed from one day to the next.
Fuentes said one of her employers failed to pay her around $900 she was owed for three months’ work after an update to its payroll software.
“I wasted my time, my energy and my sleep,” she said.
Fuentes could not name her former employer because of a non-disclosure agreement she signed, a common practice in the industry that constrains many workers from speaking out.
Kenya’s DLA is weighing legal action against Remotasks, which data labellers say suddenly cut off their access to the platform in March 2024 without paying salaries that were due.
Remotasks’s parent company acknowledged it had reduced its footprint in Kenya, but said it closed labellers’ accounts for infringements of its internal rules.
Workers had been paid for all completed tasks, the company insisted.
Microsoft and Meta declined to comment to AFP on their relationships with Scale AI. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.
Anthropic, which collaborates with data labelling startup Surge AI — itself the target of legal action in the US — said it requires its subcontractors to follow rules on wellbeing for workers dealing with sensitive content.
It added that it requires pay rates for data labellers of $16 per hour or higher.
Meanwhile OpenAI said it has strict rules for its own subcontractors on workplace safety, fair compensation, non-discrimination and respect for workers’ rights.
The ChatGPT developer added that it takes appropriate action for breach of contract if those stipulations are not met.
Showdown
Working as freelancers or on short contracts, most data labellers nevertheless enjoy none of the protections of employees, sociologist Casilli said, calling them a “digital underclass”.
In Kenya, the DLA is pushing for a code of conduct that would include an employment contract guaranteeing “equitable pay”, free association, the right to take breaks and psychological support in case of exposure to harmful content.
Such demands can turn into a showdown between workers and tech companies.
In the United States, almost 250 people were fired in September from their jobs at GlobalLogic, a subcontractor helping train Google’s Gemini generative AI, after several complained about pay discrepancies and called for improved working conditions.
“They just want docile annotators” said 31-year-old Andrew Lauzon, who worked for GlobalLogic from March 2024 until he was fired on September 12.
Boston native Lauzon had joined the Alphabet Workers Union — named in reference to the Google parent company — to campaign for conditions such as sick leave, paid time off and affordable health care.
GlobalLogic declined to comment when contacted by AFP, while a Google spokesman said that “as the employer, GlobalLogic is responsible for the employment conditions of their workers”.
Google nevertheless says it expects subcontractors to treat workers fairly and respectfully, adding that it imposes a code of conduct and carries out regular audits.

‘Loopholes’
A study on AI’s hidden workforce published by UNI Global Union this month showed that “Big Tech cannot build the future on disposable labour,” its general secretary Christy Hoffman said in a statement.
“It’s time to hold Silicon Valley titans accountable for conditions in their AI supply chains,” Hoffman added.
Workers’ struggles for rights and recognition remain hobbled by a lack of legal avenues.
Even Europe’s imposition of new AI regulations has left “loopholes”, European Parliament member Leila Chaibi of French hard-left party LFI told AFP.
“There’s no mention of click workers in the AI regulation,” she said, nor in the Platform Work Directive Chaibi helped push through Brussels in October 2024.
A European directive requiring companies to monitor human-rights compliance throughout their supply chains could be deployed in support of data labellers, Chaibi said.
But in practice, European Union member states have been calling the rule into question.
As governments wrangle, millions of people are working every day in the sector, which remains essential to improving the quality of generative AI responses.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “From 13-15 October 2025, thirty-four khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij were killed in multiple engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The security forces, per the ISPR, conducted intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts of the province.
The first operation, it said, was carried out in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, eighteen khawarij were sent to hell,” it said.
According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in the South Waziristan district, during which eight more terrorists were neutralised following an intense exchange of fire with the security forces.
“In [the] third encounter, [which] took place in [the] Bannu district, own troops successfully neutralised eight more khawarij.”
The ISPR added that sanitisation operations were being carried out in the said areas “to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji”.
It further said that a “relentless counterterrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam — as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan (NAP) —  by security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of Pakistan, will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement, lauded the armed forces and security agencies for successfully carrying out the counterterrorism operations, saying that the “timely actions of the security forces have improved the peace and stability situation in the country.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces for “thwarting the nefarious plans of the terrorists with their professional expertise.” In a statement, he said that all possible measures will be taken for the safety of the Pakistani people and the country’s integrity.
“The counter-terrorism campaign will continue with full vigour until the complete eradication of the menace of terrorism from the country,” he said.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
Last week, ISPR Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as of September 15, a total of 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025. During these operations, 970 terrorists were killed, while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.
He added that in 2024, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP during which 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians lost their lives.
Lt Gen Chaudhry attributed the surge in terrorist incidents across the country to several factors, including the non-implementation of the NAP, the politicisation of counterterrorism efforts, India’s use of Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the supply of modern weapons to militants in Afghanistan, and a “terrorism-crime nexus” that he said enjoyed “complete local and political backing.”
On October 8, security forces neutralised 19 “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the ISPR. However, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred.

Its report comes after a US Coast Guard investigation in August outlined a litany of issues with operator OceanGate’s conduct, as well as design flaws in its Titan submersible, that led to a “preventable tragedy” in which all five passengers were killed.
“We found that OceanGate’s engineering process for the Titan was inadequate and resulted in the construction of a carbon fibre composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements,” NTSB’s report said.
“Because OceanGate did not adequately test the Titan, the company was unaware of the pressure vessel’s actual strength and durability, which was likely much lower than their target.
“Additionally, OceanGate’s analysis of Titan pressure vessel real-time monitoring data was flawed, so the company was unaware that the Titan was damaged and needed to be immediately removed from service”, after a previous dive, it added.
OceanGate chief executive Stockton Rush was joined on the doomed expedition by British explorer Hamish Harding, French deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Pakistani-British tycoon Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman.
Seats on the submersible cost $250,000 per person.
Communications were lost with the SUV-sized submersible about an hour and 45 minutes into its dive on June 18, 2023, kicking off a dramatic search that briefly captivated the world.
 
 

Debris was found a few days later on the ocean floor, about 500 meters from the bow of the Titanic, and human remains were recovered when the sub was brought to the surface.
Shortly after the tragedy, OceanGate halted all operations.
Last year, the family of Nargeolet sued OceanGate for $50 million, accusing the US-based company of gross negligence.
The wreckage of the Titanic sits 644 km off the coast of Newfoundland and has become a lure for nautical experts and underwater tourists since its discovery in 1985.
The ship hit an iceberg and sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage from England to New York, with 2,224 passengers and crew on board. More than 1,500 people died.</p><small>2025-10-16 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/161341108a3015f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949307/afghan-man-on-trial-in-germany-over-deadly-knife-attack-on-toddlers' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan man on trial in Germany over deadly knife attack on toddlers</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan man accused of a deadly knife attack on a group of toddlers in Germany went on trial on Thursday, nine months after an incident that inflamed a heated pre-election debate on immigration.
Germany was shocked by the stabbing spree that killed a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man who tried to protect the children and left three others wounded in the southern city of Aschaffenburg.
Five toddlers from a kindergarten class were in a public park, accompanied by two teachers, when the assailant attacked them with a kitchen knife.
The suspect arrested at the scene of the January 22 attack has been only partially named, in line with usual practice by the German judiciary, as 28-year-old Enamullah O.
He has a long history of mental illness, and prosecutors said an expert assessment concluded his psychiatric state meant he was not criminally responsible.
The public prosecutor’s office has previously said there was no indication the suspect acted out of extremist or terrorist motivation, and they were seeking to have him permanently confined to a psychiatric facility.
The trial is expected to stretch over several days of proceedings in October.
The suspected attacker injured a two-year-old Syrian girl, one of the teachers, as well as a 72-year-old man who had also tried to protect the children.
He was arrested shortly afterwards, and it soon emerged that the authorities had tried and failed in 2023 to deport him to Bulgaria — the first EU country he had arrived in.
In August 2024, he allegedly threatened a fellow resident at an accommodation for asylum seekers in the nearby town of Alzenau with a butcher’s knife and caused her minor injuries.
The Aschaffenburg stabbings, which followed a string of other bloody attacks in Germany, provoked intense political reactions.
Friedrich Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats who went on to become chancellor, promised a “fundamental” overhaul of asylum rules and strict border controls “from day one” if elected.
About a week later, Merz, then the opposition leader, relied on support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to pass a non-binding resolution through parliament demanding stricter immigration and refugee policies.
Merz’s decision to rely on far-right support broke a longstanding taboo in post-World War II German politics, prompting fierce criticism and mass street protests.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16114824aaaf0a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949295/punjab-govt-to-recommend-ban-on-tlp-following-violent-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt to recommend ban on TLP following violent protests</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government on Thursday said it will recommend to the federal government that a ban be imposed on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
The development came as Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz chaired an “extraordinary meeting” on the province’s law and order situation, during which “historic decisions were made to establish the state’s writ and supremacy of the law”, a statement issued by her office said.
Without taking any names, the handout itself referred to decisions taken against an “extremist party”. However, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari confirmed to Dawn.com that the decisions made pertained to the TLP.
One of the decisions taken was that the Punjab government will “recommend the federal government to impose a ban on an extremist party”.
“The extremist party’s leadership will be placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act,” the handout said. The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 ATA.
 






“Individuals involved in hate speech, incitement and violation of law will be arrested immediately in Punjab,” the provincial government decided.
It was also decided that cases against “leaders and workers involved in the martyrdoms of police officers and damage to state property” will be tried in anti-terrorism courts (ATCs).
“All properties and assets of the extremist party will be handed over to the Punjab Auqaf Department. There will be a complete ban on the extremist party’s posters, banners and advertisements,” the CM Office statement added.
It further said that “all bank accounts” of the party will be frozen, and that its social media accounts “spreading hatred will be taken down”. The Punjab government also vowed “strict action on the violation of the Loudspeaker Act”.
The meeting also agreed upon a number of steps pertaining to the Afghan community residing in the province. This included bringing “Afghan citizens into the tax net” and preparing a real-time database of “illegal Afghan residents”.
“A whistleblower system will be introduced for illegal immigrants. The name of the informant will be kept completely confidential,” the CM Office statement said.
It added that the Punjab government has also decided to initiate a “combing operation against illegal residents and their businesses”. “Illegal immigrants will be immediately deported according to the federal government’s policy.”
The high-level security meeting also agreed to urgently recover illegal arms, with a “one-month ultimatum” issued by the Home Department for the owners to surrender their illegal weapons.
“Citizens should register their legal arms from a [Police] Khidmat Markaz within a month,” the handout read. The government also ordered that the stocks of arms vendors and dealers be inspected, and the issuing of licences for new ones would be completely banned.
According to the statement, the Punjab government also “recommended the federal government to regularise arms factories and manufacturers”.
 
 

The provincial administration also bolstered the punishment for those holding illegal arms to 14 years in jail, with a fine of up to Rs2 million, and made the offence non-bailable.
Today’s development follows a large-scale pre-dawn operation by law enforcement agencies on Monday to dismantle TLP’s protest camp in Muridke, which sparked violent clashes, widespread chaos, and multiple arrests. The party had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
As per the official figures, as many as 2,716 people have been arrested after the Muridke operation. Out of these, some 251 were taken into custody by Lahore police and 178 by Sheikhpura police. The government has also barred around 2,800 people from travelling abroad, according to Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
Even as police intensify their crackdown on the group following the events that transpired in Muridke, the authorities have decided to take a series of measures to “neutralise” the threat the TLP has posed to the law enforcers and non-Muslim communities since its inception.
The decision to put the radical outfit on a leash is being linked to some crucial meetings, where the TLP’s tainted record of violent agitations, fatal attacks on the law enforcers, as well as ransacking of Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship came under discussion.
Chaudhry, the minister of state for interior, has said action against the TLP protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of those involved in the May 9, 2023 riots, which led to a country-wide crackdown on the PTI.
The federal government had previously imposed a ban on the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA.
 
 

The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march to Islamabad.
Restrictions were also briefly imposed on the TLP in June 2023, when the party was carrying out a long march from Lahore to Islamabad. Restrictions lifted under an agreement reached on June 17, 2023 included a ban on the party’s coverage on electronic and social media.
Special prosecutors for cases against TLP in Lahore, Sheikhupura
Separately, the Punjab government has appointed special public prosecutors to represent the state in terrorism cases registered against TLP in the districts of Lahore and Sheikhupura.
According to an order issued by the Punjab government’s public prosecution department yesterday, seen by Dawn.com, Advocate Supreme Court Rana Shakeel Ahmed Khan and Advocate High Court Chaudhry Khalid Rasheed have been appointed as special prosecutors for all cases registered against the TLP “within the jurisdiction of Lahore and Sheikhupura districts/region”.
 
 

The appointments — notified following a letter by the Lahore deputy inspector general (DIG) legal for Punjab police chief Dr Usman Awan — were made under Section 18 of the ATA, which allows the government to appoint public prosecutors or law officers to Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs), a high court or the Supreme Court.
The special public prosecutors will coordinate with investigation officers, joint investigation teams for “efficient investigation, proper preparation of case files and represent the state before trial courts in all matters including remands, bails and trials etc; and Honorable Lahore High Court, Lahore (Principle Seat) in all matters, including bails, appeals, revisions, petitions for suspension of sentence, writs and other miscellaneous applications”.
Terms and conditions will be issued separately, the order stated.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16115048222f1e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949301/pakistan-kazakhstan-engage-in-joint-counterterrorism-training-to-strengthen-military-ties-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Kazakhstan engage in joint counterterrorism training to strengthen military ties: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Kazakhstan have begun a joint counterterrorism training exercise lasting two weeks to improve military-to-military relations, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
Pakistan regularly holds joint military exercises with countries across Asia, the Middle East, and beyond to boost operational readiness, deepen defence cooperation, and improve interoperability. These engagements enable Pakistan to share counterterrorism expertise, reinforce alliances, and project itself as a balanced and responsible regional actor.
“Pakistan-Kazakhstan Joint Exercise Dostarym-V is being conducted between the armies of Pakistan and Kazakhstan in [the] counter terrorism domain from 13-24 October 2025 at the Special Operations School, Cherat, Pakistan,” a statement from the ISPR said.
“Special Services Group of [the] Pak Army and Special Forces of [the] Kazakhstan Army are participating in the exercise,” it added.
According to the statement, the opening ceremony of the exercise was conducted on Tuesday in Cherat.
The exercise is aimed at “refining professional skills through joint training and harnessing historic military-to-military relations among the friendly countries”, the statement said. “Participating troops are looking forward to [benefiting] from mutual expertise [and] experience.”
In April, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir made an official trip to Kazakhstan and held a meeting with the Defence Minister of Kazakhstan, Colonel General Ruslan.
The two leaders engaged in comprehensive discussions focusing on the dynamic regional security landscape, shared strategic objectives, and opportunities for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation.
They highlighted the significance of deepening military-to-military ties and reaffirmed their commitment to working together for the promotion of peace, stability, and security in the region.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16094008796e69c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949287/trump-authorises-cia-operations-in-venezuela-raising-pressure-on-maduro' target='_blank'><strong>Trump authorises CIA operations in Venezuela, raising pressure on Maduro</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump confirmed on Wednesday that he authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolas Maduro’s government.
The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision, saying the Trump administration’s Venezuela strategy aims to remove Maduro from power.
The administration has offered $50 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest and conviction on drug trafficking charges.
The new authority would allow the CIA to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean, the Times reported.
Asked why he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela, Trump told reporters his reasons were migration of Venezuelans to the United States and drug trafficking.
 






“I authorised for two reasons really,” Trump said.
“Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America…they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.
“And the other thing are drugs,” Trump said.
Trump has not provided evidence for his claim that Venezuela is sending former prisoners to the US.
He added that the US has made progress intercepting drug shipments at sea, and that additional efforts are now focused on overland routes.
“We are looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” Trump said.
 
 

Reuters could not independently determine what specific actions Trump has authorised and the White House declined to elaborate on the president’s comments.
Historically, the agency’s involvement in such operations has varied widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint.
The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, particularly during the Cold War, and helped topple South America’s cocaine trafficking empires at the end of the 20th century.
Reuters has reported that the CIA has been running covert operations in Mexico for years to track down the country’s most-wanted drug traffickers.
Venezuela’s government said Trump’s remarks constituted a violation of international law and said US actions were aimed at legitimising a “regime change” operation with the goal of seizing the country’s oil resources.
“Our Permanent Mission to the UN will raise this complaint with the Security Council and the secretary general tomorrow, demanding accountability from the United States government,” Venezuela said in a statement released by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on his Telegram account.
‘Venezuela feeling heat’
Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of being a hub for trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl, but US records have shown that Mexico is the main source of fentanyl.
Trump was asked by a reporter why he did not have the Coast Guard stop suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been US practice for decades.
Trump called such efforts “politically correct” and said they had not worked.
 
 

Trump declined to answer when asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, saying: “I think Venezuela is feeling heat.”
Trump has ordered a large US military buildup in the southern Caribbean, and the troops have conducted at least five strikes on vessels the Trump administration has described as involved in drug trafficking, without providing evidence.
The campaign is the most recent example of Trump’s efforts to use US military power in new, and often legally contentious, ways, from deploying active-duty US troops in Los Angeles to carrying out counterterrorism strikes against drug trafficking suspects.
The Pentagon recently disclosed to Congress that Trump has determined the United States is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels.
‘Venezuela also released prisoners into US’
Trump also accused Venezuela of releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, although he did not specify which border they were crossing.
Neither Maduro’s Information Ministry nor press representatives for opposition leader Maria Corina Machado immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s remarks.
The Trump administration has provided scant information about the strikes, frustrating members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans.
On Wednesday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration moved the US closer to outright conflict.
“The American people deserve to know if the Administration is leading the US into another conflict, putting service members at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation,” she said in a statement.</p><small>2025-10-16 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/160841255759b0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949215/competition-commission-of-pakistan-launches-crackdown-on-skin-whitening-creams' target='_blank'><strong>Co­­mpetition Commission of Pakistan launches crackdown on skin whitening creams</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Co­­mpetition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has laun­ched a nationwide investigation against companies involved in manufacturing, marketing and selling mercury-laden skin whitening creams. 
The move aims to protect consumers from serious health risks and ensure fair competition in the cosmetics market.  
The CCP’s Office of Fair Trade and Market Intel­li­gence Unit found that several popular whitening pro­ducts available in sto­res and online contain da­­ng­erously high levels of mercury. Many of these products falsely claim to be safe and effective while concealing mercury content from their ingredient lists.
Mercury is a toxic substance that can cause kidney damage, neurological disorders, and skin disea­ses. Its use in cosmetics is banned in most countries.
Despite this, many whitening creams in Pakistan continue to use mercury under misleading labels such as “fairness, glow, and lightening”.  
Under Section 10 of the Competition Act 2010, fal­se or deceptive marketing is prohibited and can res­u­­lt in penalties of up to Rs75 million or 10 per cent of a company’s annual turnover.
The commission has initiated action against all companies responsible for producing or promoting these harmful products. It warned that such practices not only endanger public health but also distort fair market competition.  
Consumers have been advised to stop using any whitening creams suspec­ted of containing high levels of mercury. 
The CCP also urged citizens to rep­ort deceptive advertising or unsafe cosmetic pro­du­cts through its Online Co­­mplaint Portal available on the commission’s website.

According to well-placed sources in the IHC, the judge has obtained a five-year visa on his official passport following the cancellation of his Green Card.
 
 

The decision came in the wake of recently introduced amendments to the Presidential Order and a General Standing Order which make it mandatory for judges to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from chief justices of their respective courts before leaving the country, even during holidays or vacations.
The new standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued under the policy state that the entire time of a judge, including leave, vacations and holidays, is at the disposal of the state. The chief justice has been empowered to regulate such leave and may cancel it even after a judge has departed abroad. Judges are also required to provide their contact details and addresses during any period of leave.

New rules require judges to get NOC from CJs before leaving country even during holidays

Sources said that these regulations have created complications for judges holding foreign permanent residencies, particularly US green cards.
Under American immigration laws, green-card holders must demonstrate intent to permanently reside in the United States, and prolonged absences — especially those exceeding six months — can lead to inquiries and potential revocation of residency rights.
In cases where a green card holder remains abroad for more than a year, they may lose their status unless a special Returning Resident Visa is obtained.
Judicial insiders told Dawn that the new policy effectively made it difficult for judges to retain foreign residencies while fulfilling their constitutional and administrative obligations in Pakistan. They said that the judge’s decision to rescind his green card was made to avoid any conflict with the newly imposed travel restrictions and to ensure full compliance with the court’s administrative framework.
The development has also dispelled speculation that some judges were considering resigning amid reports of internal differences and administrative grouping within the Islamabad High Court.
Instead, the move is being interpreted as an effort to align with the institutional policy and maintain transparency regarding foreign travel.
Earlier, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had raised objections to the NOC requirement in a letter addressed to the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court, terming it “a blatant impingement of the Fundamental Right of movement of a judge” and “tantamount to a de facto placement of judges on the Exit Control List”.
His letter argued that such adm­inistrative controls undermined the independence of the judiciary.
The IHC administration, however, maintains that the policy aims to bring uniformity, discipline and transparency in judicial conduct, in line with constitutional principles and public service standards.

The action was undertaken in Mohmand district, officials said, thwarting an attempt by dozens of militants to enter Pakistan, PTV News reported.
 






The operation was carried out on the basis of credible intelligence rep­orts, indicating that a large group of militants was mobilising near the mountainous Khor area of Baha­dar Kalay, officials said.
“Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area and launched an intensive operation,” sources said.
State media claimed that at least 30 terrorists had been eliminated, but local sources said the number may be higher.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press, but PTV News claimed the incident demonstrated how the Afghan government was now relying on militant groups to try and exact revenge after their attempts to attack Pakistani territory were effectively foiled.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time and would last for 48 hours.
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
The announcement from Islamabad came before the Taliban’s version appeared on social media. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a post on X that “at the request and insistence of the Pakistani side”, the ceasefire would begin after 5:30pm Kabul time and remain in force “unless there is a violation”.
The statements differed on key points, with each side claiming the ceasefire was requested by the other. Pakistan specified a 48-hour duration, while the Taliban described an open-ended truce. Only Pakistan mentioned a follow-up dialogue process.
A senior Pakistani military official, speaking on background, said the Taliban requested the ceasefire after facing what he described as a “powerful response” from Pakistani forces.
Although neither side disclosed whe­ther external mediation played a role, diplomatic sources suggested Qatar helped facilitate the understanding.
 
 

Soon after the announcement, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace. Mr Dar thanked Qatar for its “consistent support and positive role”, the statement added.
 






This was the second ceasefire between the two neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. Diplomatic insiders said that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
‘Ceasefire may not hold’
The ceasefire, while a pause in hostilities, highlights the diminishing leverage Pakistan wields over Kabul despite its historical role as the Taliban’s principal external supporter.
Observers warn that the ceasefire may prove temporary without a framework for structured dialogue or a third-party monitoring mechanism in place.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also expressed a lack of confidence in the ceasefire, stressing that the Afghan Taliban had become a “proxy of Delhi”, Dawn.com reported.
Speaking to Geo News on Wednesday night, the defence minister said that the Afghan Taliban are “fighting a proxy war” on behalf of India and stated that they have become a “stooge” for New Delhi.
 
 

“I have my doubts that the ceasefire will hold, because the [Afghan] Taliban are being sponsored by Delhi,” he added. “Right now, Kabul is fighting a proxy war for Delhi.”
Mr Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness and capability to defend itself in the face of further aggression from Kabul.
“We have the capability and we will attack them, God willing, if they escalate or widen the radius of this war,” he said. “There have been deep strikes in Afghanistan and a ceasefire was agreed on after the intervention of friendly countries, but it is fragile. I don’t believe this will last long.”
However, Mr Asif added that in this situation, Pakistan will respond positively to any constructive dialogue but will not tolerate ceasefire violations or attacks on its territory.
“If they bombard our border areas or attack our posts, then we have to respond in kind,” he said. “We do not want to fight, but if we are attacked, we have the right to respond.”
To a question about whether the mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia could come into play here, the minister said friendly countries will “effectively intervene” but noted that it is speculation at present.
Latest escalation
The latest escalation began late on Tuesday and continued into early Wednesday, when Taliban fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on Pakistani border positions in the Chaman sector of Balochistan.
According to officials, the fighting erupted around 2am after Taliban forces opened heavy fire on a Pakistani post in the Sui Karez area of the Kozak Pass using mortars and other heavy weapons.
Pakistani troops stationed in the area retaliated immediately, and intense exc­hanges continued for several hours. The clashes expanded when Taliban forces opened fire across multiple points along the border, including the border town of Chaman, damaging the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Friendship Gate on their side.
Officials said Taliban fighters also targeted nearby villages, injuring many civilians, including women and children.
“At least five civilians were brought to the district hospital with bullet and splinter injuries,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, medical superintendent of the Chaman government hospital.
Authorities declared an emergency in all Chaman hospitals and closed schools, while the anti-polio campaign in the area was suspended as residents began fleeing to safer areas.
“The attack started in the early hours and heavy fighting continued until around 8am,” said Habib Ullah Bangulzai, deputy commissioner of Chaman. He confirmed that additional troops had been deployed to the sector to reinforce the defences.
Pakistan’s military said its troops repulsed the Taliban attacks and launched retaliatory strikes targeting militant camps and installations in Kandahar and Spin Boldak, from where the attacks had been mounted.
“Pakistani jets targeted these important camps being used by Fitna al-Khawarij,” an official said, using a term referring to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Afghanistan-based terrorist group Islam­a­b­ad blames for recent cross-border attacks.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) later said that at least 20 Taliban fighters were killed and several of their installations destroyed.
Sources in Kandahar said the Taliban confirmed eight deaths in Spin Boldak, including a couple in Vesh Mandi, the first Afghan town across the border. A large number of Taliban fighters were reported wounded in Pakistani strikes.
By morning, heavy exchanges of fire were also reported from multiple points along the Kurram border region, with ISPR saying 25 to 30 Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij militants were killed in the Pakistani response that destroyed several posts and tanks.
Kabul explosions
Shortly before the ceasefire announcement, two explosions rocked Kabul’s Taimani neighbourhood around 4pm local time. The Taliban said the blasts were caused by an oil tanker fire, but residents reported two separate explosions roughly 20 minutes apart. Videos circulating on social media showed a multi-story building engulfed in flames.
Kabul Surgical Centre said it had received 40 casualties, including five fatalities.
 
 

While Pakistan’s military did not officially claim responsibility, state-run PTV reported that “precision strikes” had targeted the leadership of Fitna al-Khawarij.
Tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban regime have soared since Oct 9, when Kabul accused Islamabad of conducting airstrikes inside Afghanistan — an allegation Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied.
The Taliban launched coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11, in which 23 soldiers were martyred. Pakistan claimed its retaliatory operations killed about 200 Taliban fighters.
As both sides enter the temporary tru­ce, questions remain over the next steps. A Pakistani diplomat, speaking anonymously, said the focus will now be on “disengagement details and getting assurances about dismantling cross-border terrorist sanctuaries — the central issue behind this unprecedented escalation”.
The crisis underscores a sharp deterioration in Pakistan-Taliban relations that once appeared anchored in mutual dependence. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
For Pakistan’s military, the recent border clashes are not merely a border management issue but a reflection of Afgh­anistan’s unwillingness to curb cross-border militancy. For the Taliban, Pakistani airstrikes are seen as violations of sovereignty, reinforcing its domestic narrative of resistance to external interference.

Ashley Tellis, 64, who has worked in or advised the US government for more than two decades, was found to have kept more than 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, a criminal affidavit said on Tuesday. 
Late in the evening of Sept 25, Tellis entered the State Dept, where he served as an unpaid adviser, and appeared to print from a secret document on US Air Force techniques, the affidavit added. 
It said Tellis met multiple times with Chinese officials at a restaurant in Fairfax, Virginia. 
At one dinner, Tellis entered with a manila envelope but did not appear to leave with it, and on two occasions the Chinese officials presented him a gift bag, the affidavit said. 
Tellis faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on the charges of unlawfully holding documents, the Justice Department said. 
Lawyers for Tellis did not immediately respond to a request for comment “The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for Virginia’s eastern district who has become known for pursuing charges against critics of President Donald Trump. 
The State Department confirmed that Tellis was arrested Saturday but declined further comment due to the ongoing investigation. 
Tellis, a naturalised US citizen originally from India, is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and served in senior positions under former president George W. Bush.

According to a notification issued by the Finance Division, the petrol price now stands at Rs263.02 per litre from Rs268.68 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has dropped to Rs275.41 per litre from Rs276.81 per litre.
Meanwhile, superior kerosene oil (SKO) and light diesel oil (LDO) also experienced rate cuts, with SKO dropping in price from Rs184.97 per litre to Rs181.71 — a drop of Rs3.26. LDO price dropped by Rs2.74 from Rs165.50 per litre to Rs162.76.
The notification added that the new rates were decided on the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
 






Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs79.50 per liter on diesel and Rs80.52 per liter on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per liter climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs17-18 per liter custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per liter distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.</p><small>2025-10-15 19:00</small></div><hr>
