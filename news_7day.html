The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.
Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Earlier this week, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) predicted that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
 
 

According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions. Cloudy weather reported in the federal capital has further reduced the sighting probability.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.

Earlier today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned that the district administrations to take precautionary measures as more rain and gusty winds were expected in the upper and central parts of the country.
At least 19 people were killed over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains battered several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.
Many of the casualties were caused by the walls and roofs of the houses collapsing and trees falling on them, according to the PDMA.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) had forecasted most of South Asia to experience above-normal rainfall and above-average temperatures during this year’s southwest monsoon season from June to September.</p><small>2025-05-27 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2717442548e6498.jpg?r=175256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654/nab-to-auction-six-bahria-town-properties-in-rawalpindi-islamabad-on-june-12' target='_blank'><strong>NAB to auction six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi, Islamabad on June 12</strong></a><br><p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Tuesday announced a public auction of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on June 12.
The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against property tycoon Malik Riaz, who owns Bahria Town and is an absconder in the £190 million Al Qadir Trust Case.
In a notification today, NAB listed six properties of the project owned by tycoon Malik Riaz, including five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad.
The properties were being auctioned to recover the defaulted amount of a plea bargain under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance 1999, it added.
NAB media director Birj Lal Dosani confirmed the details to Dawn.com, stating that the amount was being recovered in connection with corruption charges under a plea bargain.
 
 

Earlier this year, the watchdog warned the public against investing in Bahria Town’s Dubai project and began extradition efforts for Riaz and his son.
In February, NAB [filed] a reference against Riaz, ex-Sindh chief minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Minister Sharjeel Memon, and others for land transfer to Bahria Town. The watchdog also filed two corruption references for unlawf­u­lly acquiring 4,500 kanals of state land in Rawalpindi’s New Murree for Bahria Golf City and Takht Pari forest area.
In March, NAB said it had sealed “numerous” commercial and residential properties of Bahria Town in Karachi, Lahore, Takht Pari, New Murree/Golf City, and Islamabad over corruption cases filed against Riaz. It had also frozen hundreds of bank accounts and vehicles of Bahria Town.
Separately, a Rawalpindi Accountability court had issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Riaz and his son, Ali Ahmed Malik, in the Takht Pari reference.
NAB has multiple times warned the public to “avoid any attractive inducements from Bahria Town and to protect their hard-earned savings”.
 
 

According to senior counsel Khawaja Haris, a plea bargain agreement was considered successful if an accused confesses to a crime and then agrees to return the money in return for “a lighter punishment”.
From 2000 to 2022, the accountability watchdog recovered Rs65 billion through plea bargain out of a total of Rs91.55bn, a NAB official told the Supreme Court in 2022.</p><small>2025-05-27 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271355148b61044.jpg?r=135856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913645/mir-ali-sit-in-over-alleged-drone-strike-comes-to-an-end-as-agreement-reached' target='_blank'><strong>Mir Ali sit-in over alleged drone strike comes to an end as agreement reached</strong></a><br><p>Locals staging a sit-in against a suspected drone strike in Mir Ali last week, claiming the lives of four children, announced on Tuesday that they have ended their protest after having reached an agreement with the local administration.
For the past seven days, the locals in Mir Ali had been staging a sit-in, demanding justice in the wake of a suspected strike that took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Allama Iqbal Dawar, one of the organisers, told Dawn.com that following a series of talks held between the protesters and officials, both sides reached an agreement on late Monday night.
The bodies of the deceased have been buried, and the roads previously blocked by the protesters are now open, while officials are set to meet the affected families and announce compensatory measures soon.
Additionally, Mufti Baitullah, spokesman for the Jirga, also announced the agreement while addressing the protesters in a video seen by Dawn.com. Baitullah was seen lauding the Jirga members for playing a positive role in the whole affair.
When approached by Dawn.com, District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed that the agreement had been signed but did not reveal any details about the pact.
Similarly, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar told Dawn.com that a four-point agreement had been reached. However, he too did not elaborate any further.
However, North Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Yousuf Karim told the local media that he had held thorough talks with the tribal leaders, assuring them that the government and the army would pay “serious attention” to the safety of the residents during operations against the militants.
Last week, the local elders had threatened to march to Islamabad to protest against the drone strike in case their demands were not met.</p><small>2025-05-27 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271556539d2f326.jpg?r=155833' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913585/gohar-sees-imrans-release-before-eid-aleema-disagrees' target='_blank'><strong>Gohar sees Imran’s release before Eid; Aleema disagrees</strong></a><br><p>• Jailed leader’s sister says rumours being spread to keep masses away from holding protest
• Claims ex-PM has cautioned PTI leaders against ‘playing from both sides’
• FIA court holds hearing in Bvlgari jewellery set case
ISLAMABAD: While PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Monday expressed the hope that Imran Khan will be released before Eidul Azha, the ex-PM’s sister said such rumours were being spread to cool down the nation aimed at keeping them from holding protests.
Aleema Khan, while quoting her brother, said that soon a countrywide movement will be launched and asked the party leaders to stop playing from both sides.
Barrister Gohar said the legal team was hopeful that cases against the incarcerated leader will be fixed soon and he will be released before Eid.
He urged the party workers to remain calm and assured them that all possible efforts were being made to get Imran Khan freed.
Aleema Khan while speaking to media outside Adiala Jail disagreed with Barrister Gohar’s optimism saying such rumours were being spread to calm down the PTI supporters.
She complained that ex-PM’s children were allowed to speak to him only once during the past eight months and his medical check-up directives were also not being implemented.
“Even books are not allowed into the cell. Imran Khan has said that he will not kneel down even if he would be kept in the jail for the rest of his life. Tens of Vloggers are claiming on a daily basis that some important personality has met Imran Khan. Others said some American had called on him. However, the fact is that all such claims are rumours and they are being spread to cool down the supporters,” she asserted.
Aleema Khan said that in a message to party leaders her brother had stated that even his family members had been kept in jail. “Hassan Niazi has been imprisoned for 10 years,” she said.
She quoted Imran Khan as saying that PTI has an ideology and he has been watching everyone. Those who have been playing a double game should decide about their future. She also quoted him as saying that even judges were not able to decide the cases. She said the former premier had directed the party workers to start preparations for the countrywide mass movement.
According to her, he said that PTI would stand by the judges. “I will not call anyone to Islamabad as there will be snipers but party should start preparations for the countrywide mass movement,” she said while sharing Imran Khan’s message.
Aleema Khan voiced concerns about the conditions of her brother’s imprisonment, claiming that even basic facilities meant for general prisoners were being denied to him.
She claimed that Bushra Bibi, who is accused of aiding and abetting in a corruption case, is being held in isolation to exert pressure on him. She expressed concerns that appeals were not being heard and alleged that judges had gone back on their word to take up the cases.
FIA court hears case
Meanwhile, the Special Court of Federal Investigation Agency completed the cross-examination of sixth prosecution witness in a case related to Toshakhana’s Bvlgari Jewellery set.
Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand presided over the hearing held inside the Adiala Jail.
Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were presented before the court where PTI lawyer Qusain Faisal Mufti completed the cross-examination of NAB Additional Director Qaiser Mahmood.
A total of six witnesses have been cross-examined so far. The court announced that the statements of other witnesses will be recorded in the next hearing scheduled for May 31.

Starting his expedition on May 25, the premier has already paid a visit to Turkiye and Iran, with Tajikistan his final stop of the trip ending on May 30.
Upon his arrival in Lachin, PM Shehbaz was received by Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and other diplomatic staff, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported, citing a PM Office press release.
The prime minister is set to attend the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. He is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with the Azerbaijani president.
 






Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi have been accompanying the prime minister on the four-nation tour.
In Istanbul, Shehbaz and Erdogan had “reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. In Tehran, the premier expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing issues, including Kashmir and water security.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, the Foreign Office had said earlier.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.
While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.
COAS Munir, Iran counterpart discuss strengthening defence ties
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, who also visited Istanbul and Tehran alongside PM Shehbaz, met with his Iranian counterpart Major General Mohammad Bagheri.
Gen Munir met with Bagheri at the General Staff Headquarters in Tehran, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release today.
The two military leaders engaged in discussions on the “evolving regional security landscape, with particular focus on strengthening bilateral defence ties”, the ISPR said.

“Key areas of mutual interest included enhancing military-to-military cooperation, improving security mechanisms along the shared border, and exploring avenues for transforming the border regions into zones of trade and economic connectivity, thereby contributing to regional stability and prosperity.”
COAS Munir was “accorded a warm welcome upon his arrival, including a ceremonial guard of honour presented by a well-turned-out contingent of the Iranian Armed Forces”, the statement added.
The ISPR stated that COAS Munir was on an official visit to Türkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan — three of the countries on Shehbaz’s itinerary.
The army chief, alongside PM Shehbaz, yesterday met with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was also present during the meeting, according to state-run PTV News.
Support from friendly countries
As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had conveyed his solidarity to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.
Following the tit-for-tat airbase attacks and a US-brokered ceasefire between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “warmly congratulated PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
Iran had also offered to mediate during the escalation and paid a visit to both Islamabad and New Delhi in peace efforts, which were appreciated by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.
 
 

The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people cancelled their holidays in popular resorts in the two countries.
The moves intensified as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.
Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p><small>2025-05-27 13:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2714571379a5545.jpg?r=145719' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913648/eu-approves-eur150bn-loan-scheme-to-rearm' target='_blank'><strong>EU approves €150bn loan scheme to rearm</strong></a><br><p>EU countries on Tuesday formally approved a new €150 billion loan programme to help rearm in the face of Russia and worries over US reliability, according to the Polish presidency of the bloc.
The SAFE borrowing scheme, backed by the EU’s central budget, was proposed by Brussels in March as the bloc rushes to boost its defences.
Finalised by member states earlier this month, the text received final approval at a meeting of European ministers in Brussels, with 26 countries voting for and one abstention, the presidency said.
EU countries had haggled at length over what the money could be spent on and how countries outside the bloc could access the funds.
In the end, the agreement stuck to the original proposal, allowing 35 per cent of the value of the weapons to come from manufacturers beyond the bloc and Ukraine.
France’s Europe minister Benjamin Haddad called SAFE “a major step forward” that asserts “a very clear principle of European preference to support our industries, reduce our dependencies, including from the US, and invest in Europe’s strategic autonomy.”
“But it is just one step — and we will need to go further,” Haddad told reporters in Brussels.
The borrowing programme is part of a package of measures, including loosening budget rules that Brussels says could potentially unlock 800bn euros of defence spending.
The approval of SAFE came after the EU and the UK agreed a new defence partnership as part of a post-Brexit “reset”.
London would still need to strike a separate deal with the EU if it wants to fully open the new scheme to the British defence industry.</p><small>2025-05-27 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2716395743d9390.jpg?r=164011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913663/punjab-schools-to-stay-open-tomorrow-for-youm-i-takbeer-celebrations' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab schools to stay open tomorrow for Youm-i-Takbeer celebrations</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has announced that schools will remain open across the province tomorrow as the nation observes Youm-e-Takbeer, and organise special programmes to celebrate the occasion.
Youm-i-Takbeer is observed on May 28, marking the historic day when Pakistan became an atomic power.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last year declared a public holiday throughout the country on account of Youm-i-Takbeer, the day when Pakistan’s defence became impregnable after conducting nuclear tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan in 1998.
The School Education Department has sent a letter to all district education authorities.
It stated that educational institutions will remain open and hold special programmes to celebrate the day with a “positive social message for peace and courage”.
The letter added that May 28 is a “significant day that marks a milestone in our nation’s history, symbolising strength, resilience, and technological advancement”.
It said all schools will conduct activities including morning assembly special programmes, national anthem and prayers, and pay tribute to the Pakistan Army.
All schools will hold speech competitions on the topic of “Significance of Youm-i-Takbeer”, “Pakistan’s Journey to Becoming a Nuclear Power”, and “National Security and Patriotism”. They will also organise arts and posters as well as national songs competitions.
The competitions will be held at the district level in all public schools across Punjab. The top winner of each category at the district level will be awarded a prize of Rs50,000.
The department has urged all schools to participate in these activities and competitions to celebrate the day.
“Students and staff will make a pledge to work for the betterment, peace, and scientific progress of Pakistan,” it added.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, summer vacations shall be declared.</p><small>2025-05-27 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271455241ba1b3a.jpg?r=145602' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913646/sadia-iqbal-reclaims-top-spot-in-icc-womens-t20i-bowling-ranking' target='_blank'><strong>Sadia Iqbal reclaims top spot in ICC women’s T20I bowling ranking</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan women’s left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal reclaimed her position at the top of the ICC Women’s Twenty-20 International (T20I) Bowler Rankings, Cricket’s governing body announced on Tuesday.
Sadia was also pivotal to Pakistan’s win in the recently concluded ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers in Lahore and was named in the team of the tournament for her nine scalps for an average of 16.
Her economy, like her spin twin Nashra Sandhu, was under four, and this meant that the duo provided the hosts the stranglehold during the middle overs and helped them maintain an unbeaten run throughout the tournament.
“[Sadia] was one of the leading performers at last year’s ICC Women’s T20 World Cup and rises one spot on the rankings for T20I bowlers to claim top billing”, the ICC statement said.
She replaces England spinner Sophie Ecclestone at the top spot who sat out her side’s recent T20I series at home against the West Indies. Her team-mate Lauren Bell however, rose 13 places to jump to sixth overall on the back of her seven wickets for the series against the West Indies.
For the batters, “the big winner on the rankings for T20I batters is Hayley Matthews, with the West Indies captain making some inroads on Australia’s dominance at the top of the rankings following her Player of the Series efforts against England,” the ICC added.
 
 

Last year in the T20 World Cup, Sadia Iqbal claimed three wickets for Pakistan as the Green Team beat Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka in their opening encounter of that tournament.
On the back of that match-winning performance, she subsequently became the first Pakistani woman bowler to top the ICC rankings.</p><small>2025-05-27 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271313216ac18b7.jpg?r=131816' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913620/india-approves-stealth-fighter-programme-amid-tensions-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India approves stealth fighter programme amid tensions with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India’s defence minister has approved a framework for building the country’s most advanced stealth fighter jet, the defence ministry said on Tuesday, amid a new arms race with Pakistan weeks after a military conflict between the neighbours.
Indian state-run Aeronautical Development Agency, which is executing the programme, will shortly invite initial interest from defence firms for developing a prototype of the warplane, envisaged as a twin-engine 5th generation fighter, the ministry said.
The project is crucial for the Indian Air Force, whose squadrons of French, Russian and ex-Soviet aircraft have fallen to 31 from an approved strength of 42 at a time when rival China is expanding its air force rapidly.
Pakistan has one of China’s advanced warplanes, the J-10, in its arsenal, which it claims to have used to shoot down India’s latest French Rafale jets in the recent fighting.
 






Militaries of nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan faced-off in four days of fighting this month, which saw use of fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery by both sides before a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.
 
 

It was the first time both sides utilised drones at scale and the South Asian powers are now locked in a drones arms race, according to Reuters’ interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.
India will partner with a domestic firm for the stealth fighter programme, and companies can bid independently or as a joint venture, the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that the bids would be open for both private and state-owned firms.
In March, an Indian defence committee had recommended including the private sector in military aircraft manufacturing to shore up the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and reduce the burden on state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which makes most of India’s military aircraft.
 
 

Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh has previously criticised Hindustan Aeronautics for slow delivery of light combat Tejas aircraft, a 4.5 generation fighter, which the firm blamed on slow delivery of engines from General Electric due to supply chain issues faced by the US firm.</p><small>2025-05-27 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27141811b7e0e8d.jpg?r=141822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913643/policeman-on-polio-duty-gunned-down-in-balochistans-noshki' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman on polio duty gunned down in Balochistan’s Noshki</strong></a><br><p>A policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was gunned down on Tuesday by unknown attackers in Balochistan’s Noshki district, according to an official.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio remains endemic, and vaccination teams are frequently targeted by militants waging a campaign against security forces.
Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Hussain Soomro confirmed the “unfortunate incident” to Dawn.com, in which Waheed Ahmed was gunned down in Noshki’s Killi Muhammad Hassni district.
He said that police have set up checkpoints at various places to search for the attackers, who will be arrested soon.
DC Soomro noted that security of the health department staff working on the anti-polio campaign has been further beefed up.
He added that the anti-polio campaign is continuing even after the terrorist incident and the targets given to the anti-polio teams in Noshki district for this national cause will be completed soon.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the martyred was a resident of Jalalabad, Noshki.
“The polio campaign is a national duty, and any attack on it is intolerable,” Rind said in a statement, paying tribute to the slain officer who “sacrificed himself while on duty”.
“This attack is a conspiracy to sabotage the national campaign and spread fear and panic,” Rind added.
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in Noshki and offered heartfelt condolences to the family of the bereaved.
He noted that the courage and sacrifice of polio officials “[inspires] us all to save our children from this crippling disease.”
The president reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to fully eradicating polio.
“We have the tools, the will, and the support of our global partners to make this vision a reality,” he said in a statement issued today. “I call on parents to open their doors to vaccinators, ensuring every child receives the life-saving polio drops.
“I urge teachers, religious leaders, and community elders to champion this noble cause, dispelling myths and building trust. I appeal to the media to amplify the truth: the polio vaccine is safe, effective, and our best weapon.”
He reiterated his support for his daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “whose tireless advocacy and efforts has galvanized our nation in this fight against polio”.
“Today, I also pay tribute to our brave polio workers, who risk their lives to reach every child, often in the face of grave danger.
“We also honour those polio workers and security officials who have made the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives to cowardly attacks aimed at derailing our efforts to make Pakistan polio-free,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident and affirmed that strict action will be taken against militant elements targeting the polio campaign, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and said that an attack on the team tasked with securing the safe future of children is intolerable.
Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a “cowardly and inhumane act.”
He emphasised that targeting the polio campaign is equivalent to attacking the future of innocent children. While paying tribute to the martyred official, the minister hailed him as a “hero of the nation.”
Kakar warned that any effort to derail the polio campaign would be seen as a direct challenge to the writ of the state, and affirmed that the government will deal with terrorists with an iron fist.
Yesterday, two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district while performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area as part of the ongoing vaccination drive which kicked off on Sunday.
 
 

The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.

The incident occurred in the Phulra area of Mansehra district where the woman and her minor daughter were killed inside their home. The woman had reportedly tied the knot against her family’s will through court marriage in 2021.
Mansehra District Police Officer (DPO) Shafiullah Gandapur confirmed the incident to Dawn.com and said efforts were underway to apprehend the suspects.
He said their bodies had been shifted to a nearby hospital where an autopsy was being conducted, while police teams have been dispatched to the area where the incident occurred to track down the suspects.
The DPO said that according to initial reports, the victim tied the knot with Roshan of Bagal tribe, which triggered a clash between the two families.
Police have lodged an FIR on the complaint of the victim’s mother.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Nasir Mahmood Sati said a “heartbreaking incident took place today in the backdrop of long-standing enmity in village Nallah under Phulra police station limits, in which a woman and her young daughter were brutally murdered,” according to a statement from the office of the Regional Police Officer (RPO).
Taking immediate notice of the incident, DIG Sati issued orders to DPO Gandapur for the immediate arrest of the suspects.
Special teams consisting of heavy police personnel have been formed which are conducting extensive search operations in the entire area, under the direct supervision of DPO Gandapur, along with Senior Superintendent of Police Oghi Nazir Khan, DSPs, SHOs and other officers.
Police officials said intelligence-based operations are underway to ensure the early arrest of the suspects.
“Honour” killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought dishonour upon the family.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab.
From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country. The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’. In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that up to 5,000 women are killed each year in the name of ‘honour’. Experts believe that many ‘honour’ killings are not reported at all or are classified as suicides or accidents.</p><small>2025-05-27 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271239139174d1f.jpg?r=123941' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913616/govt-extends-deadline-for-pia-expressions-of-interest-till-june-19' target='_blank'><strong>Govt extends deadline for PIA expressions of interest till June 19</strong></a><br><p>The government on Tuesday extended the deadline for expressions of interest in purchasing Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to June 13, the privatisation ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
The government’s failed first attempt to privatise PIA cost the national exchequer $4.3 million, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed on February 26.
In March, Privatisation and Investment Minister Abdul Aleem Khan said that the government would complete all the steps to privatise PIA by May, while the pri­vatisation commission approved a transaction structure for the second attempt to privatise the national carrier based on a divestment of 51 to 100 per cent of its shares of capital.
 
 

The earlier deadline was June 3, with the bidding process expected to take place between October and December.
According to a statement from the ministry, the deadline for submission on expressions of interest till 4pm on June 19.
Last month, a PIA spokesperson said that the carrier’s bo­­ard of directors approved its fin­ancial results for 2024, which showed the airline achieving a net profit after around 21 years.
According to the results for FY2024, PIA earned an operational profit of Rs3.9 billion and a net profit of Rs2.26bn. The airline’s operating margin was more than 12pc, which is on a par with the performance of any of the best airlines in the world, the spokesperson said.
PIA began to be unprofitable in 2011, requiring government subsidies. By the end of 2016, the national flag carrier was saddled with $3bn in debt. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3bn in debt, up from $2.97bn the year before. Government bailouts were required for the carrier’s continued operation.
Last year in June, the then-government had agreed to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises, including PIA, under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3bn bailout. But in February 2024 — right before the general elections — the election commission had asked the then-caretaker administration to “refrain” from finalising the deal.</p><small>2025-05-27 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271128342d653ec.jpg?r=112839' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913612/pakistan-condemns-modis-reckless-provocation-in-gujarat-speech' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan condemns Modi’s ‘reckless provocation’ in Gujarat speech</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Tuesday condemned the recent remarks towards Pakistan by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a speech in Gujarat, calling it a “reckless provocation”.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
In a video shared by Indian news outlet ANI, Modi says: “The people of Pakistan must come forward to rid their country of terrorism. Their youth will have to come forward.”
He went on to say: “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or [choose my] bullet,” to applause from the crowd, with many adorned in orange and white outfits.
 






A statement by the FO early on Tuesday said Pakistan has taken note of Modi’s remarks “delivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state.
“The hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in region already burdened by volatility,” the FO said.
“We regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft.”
 






The FO noted that such statement “blatantly violate” the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.
“Pakistan views these remarks as a reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir.
“Pakistan’s record as a leading contributor to UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite.
“If extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inward-toward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology,” the FO said.
It added that Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.
“However, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.
“The international community must take serious note of India’s escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace.”</p><small>2025-05-27 06:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27120517e77891c.gif?r=120539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907765/among-the-quaids-men-mahmud-husain-and-the-pakistan-that-could-have-been' target='_blank'><strong>Among the Quaid’s men — Mahmud Husain and the Pakistan that could have been</strong></a><br><p>In The Long Partition and the Making of Modern South Asia, Vazira Fazila-Yacoobali Zamindar dedicated her book on history’s most massive migration to ‘all our divided families’. For millions of people, that divide ran as much through the land as it did photo-frames and dinner tables.
With some separations in public view — touching on Dr Mahmud Husain of the Muslim League and elder brother Dr Zakir Husain of Congress, Zamindar writes, “Many well-known public figures in the subcontinent became members of divided families, although this is usually a less acknowledged fact of their lives.”
For good reason: depending on one’s politics, Partition meant freeing Pakistan or amputating India. “Suffer we have to,” Pakistan’s founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, would say, counting himself among the members of India’s Muslim minority provinces: either they could stay behind at the majority’s mercy, or move to the new country he’d created for them.
But fate was at its most ironic in the United Provinces, now Uttar Pradesh: the land that had most fired up Pakistan’s independence was still stuck in India.
It was also home to the Husain brothers; the original Husain Khan had migrated from Kohat to Qaimganj, a small town in UP, around 1715. Until independence, the Pathans of Qaimganj were best-known for revolting against the British Raj in 1857 — and getting hanged for it.
(One Adrian Hope, 4th Punjab Infantry, was sent “marching to the Qaimganj area for the purpose of rounding up and trying rebels and destroying their property,” writes a colleague. Brigadier Hope was shot dead in Awadh, by a rebel in a tree.)
 

Mahmud and Zakir Husain in Karachi, during a rare reunion post-independence

Born around the turn of the century, the Husain brothers grew up amid the Muslim qaum in crisis — all their decisions would bear the impress of this fact in one way or another.
For the longest time, empire had lent the Muslim mind security and status; Mughal, Safavid, Ottoman. But when the first was gunned down, the second overrun, and the third taken apart in favour of a western-style nation-state, India’s Muslims, as historian D. A. Low rightly put it, found themselves facing the sort of reckoning they’d never had to before.
Two major solutions arose, and they spelled a world of difference between nationalist Muslims like Zakir Husain, and Muslim nationalists like Mahmud Husain.
The nationalist Muslim threw in his lot with a united India. The Muslim nationalist thought separation the only way out. And when irreconcilable ideas grew into living, breathing countries, the brothers would take dramatically different paths.
For the older Husain, it was Gandhi that lit India’s way: the Mahatma would back Zakir in coming up with a response to Aligarh’s angry young men; the result was Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi, a university “almost precariously indebted to this one man’s personality and obvious excellence”, one observer wrote in 1946.
 

Gandhi with Zakir Husain

But Mahmud Husain, himself educated at Jamia, was moved instead by Aligarh’s anger in human form: Muhammad Ali Jauhar, whom Mahmud saw as both towering hero and cautionary tale. “It became clear to me,” he said after witnessing Jauhar’s agony, “that no movement premised on Hindu-Muslim unity could succeed.” Jinnah and the League were the only answer.
The kind that found the very idea of the Congress Muslim unhelpful, if not offensive. When Zakir’s name was put forward for the interim government in 1946, Jinnah told off the viceroy, Lord Wavell, “…The Muslim League would never accept the nomination of any Muslim by you, other than a Muslim Leaguer.”
Yet the same Jinnah, along with Liaquat Ali Khan, wanted brother Mahmud for Pakistan’s Constituent Assembly, and would sign off on him for their parliamentary committee on fundamental rights and minorities. The Quaid weighed belief before blood.
As did the other side: shocked by a report in Dawn that Zakir was leaning towards Pakistan, Gandhi wrote to him, “I can’t believe you could have said such a thing. Whatever it is, you had better make a statement about what you had said.”
Because revering or rejecting Pakistan had become a key seam of the Indian divide. For Mahmud Husain, the movement seemed “the ideal and ambition of a whole people”.
For Zakir, it spelled disaster. One biographer titles that chapter of his life ‘Approaching Catastrophe’. “Shall we lean upon this society in which brother is turned against brother?” Zakir asked at Wardha. “…this society which knows of no song that all may sing?” At Jamia’s silver jubilee in 1945, he made one last public plea to his guests of honour — Nehru, Jinnah, Liaquat, and Azad, “For God’s sake, put your heads together and extinguish this fire.”
But it was too late. On August 21, 1947, Zakir was stopped and nearly stabbed at the Jullundur train station by Sikh youths; he was rescued from near-certain death by a Hindu railway officer who had been quietly keeping an eye on him, and a Sikh soldier that escorted him to safety.
During the hellish ride back to Delhi, Zakir learned of the murder of his friend in Lahore, economics professor Brij Narain. He was consumed by guilt: why hadn’t his life been taken in return, “to settle the account”?
He wrote to his brother Mahmud on 28 August, anguished. “The situation in Delhi isn’t good either. The fear is that something can happen any time … in any case, people in Pakistan will likely be safe — we’re just in passing. We’ll simply come to an end like this.”
Zakir Husain died some two decades later, while serving as India’s first Muslim president. Asked around that time what Partition meant to him, Mahmud Husain, whose entire family had chosen to stay behind in India, said, “I have lived as a Pakistani, and I will die a Pakistani. But how are we to forget the earth we buried our elders in?”
Having lost both parents by early childhood, Mahmud’s elder was Zakir — the brother who had raised him.
‘The state of our dreams’
 

Dr Mahmud Husain in 1948, as a member of the first Constituent Assembly

A history professor late of Heidelberg, Mahmud Husain was elected to the first Constituent Assembly from East Bengal on July 6, 1947. Unlike the five other non-Bengali members — parachuted into their seats from outside — Mahmud had been living and lecturing at Dhaka University since the early 1930s, and had even been charged by the students with leading the pro-Pakistan rally on Direct Action Day.
Now the dream had been made real: he would say of Pakistan’s creation that “the miraculous had happened”, a belief that persisted to the end of his life. His faith in his party, however, would clash with his empathy for East Bengal, and mark the end of his politics.
But all that came later: the first five years of Pakistan’s independence were “years of emergency government … recurring crises of war, near-famine, and disorder,” writes American political scientist Wayne Ayres Wilcox, with the frenzied new state the ‘sole barrier between oblivion and existence’.
For reasons similar, 40-year-old Mahmud started out as a true believer in Liaquat’s Muslim League, and was appointed the party’s chief whip in the assembly. In those early days, his nationalism was stark; a gentler approach could have brought the opposition in from the cold.
Yet it was also in service of an idea at risk: as Wilcox put it, “No nationalist movement or party ever faced greater obstacles.”
Hence, Mahmud doubling down: when opposition leader Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya said Pakistan had given up on the two-nation theory, Mahmud called it “a preposterous claim” that undid Pakistan’s very basis, “We possess common nationality … but we are not the same nation.”
So too for Pakistanis with Indian citizenship. “Once they have made a decision, let them stick to it,” he said, “There is no point in being in more than one place, and thereby being nowhere.”
As for separate electorates, reviled by the Pakistan National Congress, Mahmud said they had lessened communal clashes. (“What has Dr Zakir Husain to say?” one Congress member asked. “I prefer to speak for myself and not for anybody else,” said his brother.)
It was again Mahmud, joined by Leaguers as different as Abdur Rab Nishtar and Zafrulla Khan, that defended the Objectives Resolution in 1949, a tract meant to set out what the Constitution would look like. Bashed by the left and mangled by the right, the resolution stopped midway — for a country that knew, deep down, it could become neither secular tent nor divine mission.
Yet its religious colouring dismayed the opposition all the same: though Liaquat’s League could have easily accommodated the less radical changes suggested from across the aisle, it dismissed them point by point — a sour note to start on for any fresh parliament.
Arguing its Islamic clauses only related to the Muslim majority, Mahmud saw the resolution as a wall against tyranny: “I can assure the Members of this House that if ever a dictatorship was established in Pakistan — let us hope that it never will — the dictator will not quote this Resolution in support of his authority”; that the words “through the people” were a sure guarantee of “the essence of modern democracy”.
As it turns out, lawyers would indeed press the resolution-turned-preamble against each dictatorship of the future: against Ayub and Yahya’s martial law in Asma Jilani (argument accepted); against Bhutto’s in Zia-ur-Rehman (argument accepted, overturned in appeal); against Zia’s in Nusrat Bhutto (argument abandoned); against Musharraf’s in Zafar Ali Shah (argument partly rejected); and against military trials of civilians in District Bar Association (argument accepted in dissent).
“The state of our dreams shall not be sovereign without any limits,” Mahmud Husain said on the floor of the house. “…This state will be based not upon the will of a single individual, autocratic and absolutist, but upon the will of the people themselves.”
Or so it was thought; to one foreign observer, Mahmud’s citing European thinkers on the floor of the house was a bit fancy. “How many of these learned gentlemen understood the much-abused term ‘sovereignty’ in the familiar classroom sense of deputy minister Mahmud Husain, PhD?” writes scholar Leonard Binder. “Erudite references to the sins of Bodin and the excesses of Machiavelli did not stir them at all.”
Though Binder’s smirk was aimed at parliament, it landed cleanly on the establishment waiting in the wings: the generals, judges, and bureaucrats that would wreck the assembly, and tip the state of our dreams into its long nightmare.
Nation-building, piece by piece
 

Princely states engaging with Pakistan in 1947. — Map published by George Philip and Son, Ltd, London

Though Pakistan had appeared on the world map, its cracks had yet to be filled in. If India counted over 500 princely states, what is now Pakistan, too, made up just half its present size in 1947 — with a string of former chiefdoms still undecided.
Unlike full provinces, however, these were ‘lands of hill and desert’ on the edges of empire, with Congress boss Patel moving fast to secure “a full basket of apples”. By August 15, most had acceded to India, not one to Pakistan.
“The Muslim League recognises the right of each state to choose its destiny,” Jinnah promised. But by the time Liaquat handed Mahmud Husain the portfolio of states and frontier regions in 1950, the Quaid was gone, the states were still rocky and Kashmir and Hyderabad, the two “troublesome giants”, seized by India amid blood and terror.
“One of the League’s few intellectuals,” Wilcox writes, Mahmud’s instructions “were to bring the developed states into the federation”. And “the new minister, a tactful but aggressive personality,” found himself with enough room to manoeuvre.
Per Mahmud’s estimate, the popular will was on Pakistan’s side. The princes most desired that appearances be kept up — and as long as actual powers were handed over to the federation, who cared? The centre’s babus bristled at Mahmud receiving the Amir of Bahawalpur at the railway station, yet the aim was to make their handshake final. In the spring of 1951, Mahmud announced that full provincial status had been decided for Bahawalpur.
“The changes carried out by the cabinet of Liaquat Ali Khan and Mahmud Husain led to the expansion of central power in the states,” writes Wilcox. “The rulers were edged out of power quietly … compulsive reaction to state crises gave way to reflective constitutional planning.”

A tall order in itself, given the wild patchwork the British had left behind: tribal areas, princely states, governor’s provinces, and a chief commissioner’s province widened to include almost half of West Pakistan’s territory — Balochistan.
Here too, Liaquat appointed Mahmud chair of Balochistan’s constitutional reforms committee; the eventual Mahmud Husain report minced few words. The Sardari system was a “legacy of the past”, wrote Mahmud, and provincial status for Balochistan was the remedy: with an elected assembly, adult franchise, local bodies, and proper policing in place of levies.
The report also took pains to rebut its conservative critics: illiteracy was no basis for denying popular representation to Balochistan, who were more than able “to choose the right type of people for the legislature”.
As for political education, it would grow through elections and public debate. Calling Balochistan’s lack of institutions “no fault of the people”, Mahmud was “happily impressed by the most widely spread political consciousness throughout the province … manifested by a vigorous demand for provincial autonomy”.
The report was presented to the Constituent Assembly at the close of 1951. Dubbed “a remarkable document” over half a century later in Martin Axmann’s history of Baloch nationalism, it has since remained frozen in time.
As has the question of the tribal areas. When Mahmud pointed out that security concerns had outweighed constitutional reforms there, one observer remarked that this came not from a man “interested in autocratic power, but from one of the true liberals of the Muslim League”.
Yet this missed his goal: “Wherever conditions exist where a part of the tribal belt is agreeable to come into the [frontier] province,” Mahmud said on the day several areas decided to join Hazara and Mardan, he was sure the people would welcome it; that being the “ultimate destiny of the tribal areas”.
In each corner of the country, Mahmud Husain stuck to the same principle: enfranchisement equalled integration. But with the murder of Liaquat Ali Khan, federalism — from Bengal to Balochistan — would be dealt a body blow.
Losing Liaquat
Years later, while giving the last interview of his life, Mahmud Husain implied it could all have gone differently — if one man had lived.
Shortly before he fell to an assassin’s bullet, “Liaquat confided in Mahmud Husain,” writes Lawrence Ziring, that a huge cabinet shuffle was in play, “and that his highest priority was removing Ghulam Muhammad”, the finance minister.
On learning of such plans, the minister said he’d sooner kill himself. A vulgar and ruthless bureaucrat, Ghulam is seen today as democracy’s first arch-villain.
And yet he was a symptom of two broader problems Liaquat hadn’t yet been able to fix: a federal solution between Punjab and East Bengal, and the imperial pull of the West versus the rest. (Mahmud Husain would end up on the wrong side in both cases.)
What is widely accepted, however, is that the prime minister had reached a turning point. British cables found him exceedingly “cagey” at committing himself to Western military alliances in the Middle East; the US ambassador doubted “that progress was likely at this stage”. Liaquat was shot four days later.
Amid even greater tumult at home: finding a magic formula that tied Punjab to Bengal, separated by a thousand miles of hostile Indian territory, had brought Liaquat to the brink. His answer had been forming a basic principles committee, for thrashing out a constitutional consensus.
It had been a thankless job: what was a concession to one seemed a betrayal to the other. The committee’s first report in 1950 had ended in uproar when the Bengalis found their majority whittled down in the Senate. Changes to the report in 1951 ended in uproar again, when the Punjabis felt reduced in both houses.
The uniqueness of the world’s only “double country” didn’t help. “We are attempting to evolve a new kind of constitution,” committee member Mahmud Husain told the house. “We have no definite models before us, and a task like this is bound to take time.”
With the temperature climbing, Mumtaz Daultana, Punjab’s grasping chief minister, demanded Liaquat come sell the report to his people. Per Ziring, Mahmud Husain “personally pleaded with Liaquat not to make this particular journey”, based on intelligence reports of a plot to kill him in Punjab. “But the prime minister chose to ignore the reports, as well as his minister’s plea … Liaquat believed in the matter so much that he decided to go anyway.”
When twin gunshots rang out in Company Bagh, Rawalpindi (from an Afghan spook formerly in the employ of Pakistan’s government), it would spell a new lease on life for the half-paralysed Ghulam Muhammad. The Bengalis dealt in dark whispers that their freshly anointed governor-general had backed the hit; even army chief Ayub Khan, the muscle behind Ghulam and the new gentry, found their indifference to the murder “disgusting and revolting”.
 

Dawn frontpage of October 21, 1951: the week of Liaquat’s assassination, Khwaja Nazimuddin takes oath as prime minister from governor-general Ghulam Muhammad, whom Liaquat had planned to remove. At far right Dr Mahmud Husain looks down. One order is dying; another is already in place

Over in India, the still-angry young men of Aligarh didn’t share the same apathy: they raged to their vice-chancellor, a bewildered Zakir Husain, that the university siren be sounded to mark the death of their alumnus. A student objector was beaten up, and the door to the bell room was broken open. The siren sounded loud.
Four years in, both brothers still stood at Partition’s long edge.
Unmade by the unelected
The new order moved fast. Mahmud Husain’s proposals for Balochistan, tabled just weeks after Liaquat’s murder, were stillborn; the state ministry handed over to Mushtaq Gurmani. “The era of Liaquat’s forgetful tolerance and Mahmud Husain’s tact gave way to one of Gurmani’s dictations,” writes Wilcox.
Abroad, Ayub rushed to grasp America’s brass ring, as well as its armaments. At home, Liaquat’s balancing act was done away with, and the Bengalis — despite Dhaka’s own Khwaja Nazimuddin as premier — cut adrift. Pakistan’s original sin was not military ingress. It was denying the majority its agency. The two would merge soon enough — when the jackboot replaced the vote altogether.
Language proved an early provocation, as police opened fire on student rioters in Dhaka in 1952, killing four. How much this one act of brutality would sear itself into the Bengali memory was clear a decade later, when Mahmud Husain — as Dhaka University’s vice chancellor — approved the design for a monument to the students, known today as Shaheed Minar.

Mahmud’s view was informed by experience: he had been an unceasing advocate for Urdu; not to surpass Bengali, but as a shield against English, the land’s old imperial tongue. When the opposition tried fast-tracking Bengali as a national language on April 10, 1952, Mahmud voted for Sattar Pirzada’s suggestion that the House take it up in due time.
When it did, from March 7, 1954 and onwards, both Mahmud and Pirzada voted for Bengali being raised to a national language alongside Urdu. Such steps were welcome: ideologues in favour of a federal accord.
But the core clash of the 1950s — held at bay while Liaquat lived — now boiled over. Some colour it in ethnic terms: of a Bengal group versus a Punjab group. To be sure, the rights of the Bengali majority lay at the bleeding heart of the crisis. But the coming strongmen, Ayub and Iskander Mirza, weren’t Punjabi, just as the Bengal group was a misnomer for many of its most vocal members — Nishtar, Sattar Pirzada, and Mahmud Husain.
It must also be said that the Bengal group, made up entirely of Muslim Leaguers, could hardly claim to speak for all Bengalis, given the fast-rising Awami League and Chattopadhyaya’s depressed Congressites. If anything, the Bengali opposition was as fed up of the cabinet as the establishment.
Put simply, the clash was between the elected and the unelected: one sought its strength from a parliamentary majority, the other from generals and bureaucrats. In one sense, however, geography cannot be denied: most of the population was in the east; much of the army in the west.
And to read the chatter of British and American officials, only one could rescue a poor and excitable country from itself. With the imperial project’s favoured lieutenants — Ghulam, Ayub, and Mirza — constantly in their ears, Western envoys saw Nazimuddin’s cabinet only in terms of members that required picking off. Descriptions were rehashed from Mirza’s regular rant sessions: Fazlur Rehman (“obstinate”); Sattar Pirzada (“unsatisfactory”); and Mahmud Husain and Nishtar (“strongest supports for the mullahs”).
 

The Nazimuddin cabinet prior to the coup. Nishtar, Nazimuddin (fourth and fifth from left), Fazlur Rehman, Sattar Pirzada (fourth and fifth from right), Mahmud Husain (second from right) were purged. All others, including Zafrulla, retook oath from Ghulam Muhammad (sixth and seventh from right)

Left out of this analysis was that Fazl was against joining any one Cold War bloc, appalling London and DC; that Pirzada was deathly opposed to One Unit, to gasps in Lahore; and that Mahmud was cast as a mullah supporter only after expressing his derision for the governor-general. “Real republics,” he would say, “aren’t run by bureaucrats.”
His views of the Jamaat and Ahrar — whose mobs were lynching Ahmadis and setting fire to Lahore — were as severe. The country would groan “under the most wild and pernicious tyranny”, Dawn reports him saying on December 4, 1952, if a set of “arrow-minded” religious persons were able to capture power. This should never happen and “we will not allow it to happen”.
For the establishment to then flail around to its foreign patrons — alleging everything from incompetence to extremism — was to miss the point. Author Allen McGrath summed up the real reason best: these were the ministers “most difficult for Ghulam Muhammad to control”, and each one was purged on April 17, 1953 — that all were from non-Punjab provinces was hard to miss. Nazimuddin became Pakistan’s first prime minister to fall by coup; he would call it the “rape of democracy”.
 

Right column: Dawn of April 18, 1953, reports on the ministers purged, along with Ghulam Muhammad’s statement in bold

But the intrigue against Nazimuddin came with a price for the bureaucrats: their junior partner, impressed by his own strength, now nudged past them. Ghulam “could never have dared to dismiss a ministry which had appointed him,” Bengali leader Suhrawardy wrote that week, “had he not have had the support of the army.” And the army was Ayub’s.
As Suhrawardy would learn for himself: when his Awami League-led coalition swept the polls in East Bengal in 1954, and ally Fazlul Huq’s bizarre statements began ringing out in the press, their weeks-old ministry was sacked in favour of the emergency under Iskander Mirza. Dhaka stood demeaned again.
Slowly but surely, the old lines were crumbling. On July 17, the Constituent Assembly saw extraordinary scenes when Mahmud Husain went against the screams of his own party in slamming emergency rule in East Bengal, while his most strident Congress critics — Chattopadhyaya and Bhupendra Kumar Datta — rose in his defence.
“We call ourselves a democratic state,” Mahmud said, “but a province which consists of the majority of its population has been denied the democratic right to govern itself.” Even in East Bengal’s secretariat, he added, “not a single Bengali secretary” could be found, that hatred had begun seeping in as soon as Partition.
As the deputy speaker tried cutting him short, and new prime minister Bogra blamed the whole thing on communism, the assembly was up in arms.
“He has exposed you thoroughly by the naked truth,” Chattopadhyaya said. “…I tell my friend Dr Mahmud Husain that of all the Muslim members of the Muslim League party who spoke here, he has said the truth and reality which others had not the courage of doing.”
The centre’s growing panic was no coincidence: with the League having been thrashed in East Bengal on the altar of autonomy, the Bengali bloc could now ally with the smaller provinces and outvote Punjab. Even the ingenious Bogra formula, which provided for a minimum of 30 per cent votes from each wing on important matters, wasn’t good enough for Lahore.
 

In 1954, Mahmud Husain would oppose emergency rule, One Unit, and — fatally for the assembly — the governor-general’s powers to sack the centre

Given this was their third try after the first two reports, Mahmud Husain’s patience had worn thin. “In a nutshell, sir,” he had said in an earlier session, “all this jugglery has led to this: that one single unit of Western Pakistan has been able to secure as many seats in the Upper House as Bengal.”
Mahmud called it “a camouflage”: “simply to give the Punjab its 10 seats, even the ultimate interests of Pakistan have been overlooked.”
On September 21, the assembly’s anger reached its climax: the late cabinet, helmed by Nazimuddin, Fazl, and Mahmud Husain, tried taking the Constitution back. Per one scholar, “The arbitrary action of the governor-general in dismissing the Nazimuddin ministry had been neither forgiven nor forgotten.”
In a lightning raft of bills tabled by Sindh’s M. H. Gazdar and hurried along by speaker Tamizuddin, the governor-general was stripped of his powers to sack the assembly, while the executive was made responsible to parliament. The Constitution of 1954 was sent for printing.
At long last, the Long Parliament had reason to celebrate. “Democracy in Pakistan has come alive,” Dawn said, hailing the “zeal, speed, and determination” of the assembly.
Thirteen years later, the memory of September 21, 1954, would still upset Pakistan’s first strongman. “A resolution was printed in the middle of the night,” Ayub Khan said, “placed in the pigeonholes” of the rebel lawmakers, “and passed within 10 minutes”. He compared it to a murder in the dark.
If so, it was a murder that may well have put in place a democratic settlement in Pakistan: the draft Constitution of 1954 raised Bengali to a national language; afforded the east its majority in the House; created a Senate to soothe the federation; used the Bogra formula to pull along both wings in federal fashion; allowed for a prime minister from a minority faith; dismissed the idea of One Unit out of hand; and defanged the governor-general in favour of the prime minister and parliament.
“We have no doubt that the people’s joy will be shared by that sagacious statesman who is our Governor-General,” cheered Dawn, “who is averse to autocracy and dictatorship”, and for whom the amendments would mean lessening “the burdens of high office”.
If there was joy, it showed up as a second coup. The soldiers were moved, the assembly was padlocked, and the Constitution gutted by the dying Ghulam Muhammad on October 24 — 72 hours before it was to be passed.
Exile at home
With the Long Parliament killed off, Mahmud Husain quit politics forever. Four years later, his lead critic, Iskander Mirza, announced Ayub’s martial law; a dictatorship of the army was declared; and the Jinnah-era Muslim League buried without ceremony.
Mahmud returned to teaching: first as head of the history department at Karachi University, and then settling into the University of Dhaka as vice chancellor — the same place where, as a young man of 25, he had begun his career as an academic.

In the three decades since, he’d had time to reflect: on age, on change, on history. Addressing Dhaka’s students at their convocation in 1961, Mahmud said, “We have lived through experiences that you have not had; you can look forward towards a future that we will not share … what can bridge the gap between them is the historical sense which education tries to impart in you. A man without a sense of history is not truly civilised.”
But his real message was about renewal. “You as young men must understand the legacy you have inherited from the past,” he said. “It is quite possible that you will not like certain parts of it, and will want to remould it or refashion it. But history will tell you that the best kind of remoulding, and the most effective, is that which is inspired by a full understanding of all that your traditions imply.”
Not that history was done yet: Dhaka’s students — who had embraced Mahmud’s call to Pakistan a generation ago — had found their next battle: the grotesque 1962 Constitution (dreamed up by Ayub and drafted by his lawyer), along with the arrest of Suhrawardy the same year, were reason enough. Waves of protests started spilling out on campus.
Ayub’s governor, the widely despised Monem Khan, thought violence the right response. But when students protested in front of the Dacca College compound, said Dawn, Mahmud “did not agree with the authorities that disciplinary action should be taken against these students. Matters came to a climax … when “the authorities” demanded his resignation immediately.”
Put in explicit terms, Mahmud refused to allow the security forces to enter the campus. Repeating what he had done when Pakistan’s first coup unfolded, the vice chancellor “declined to resign and preferred dismissal”.
Ousted yet again, Mahmud headed to Dhaka airport, where the students had rushed to protest his departure. After he landed in Karachi, he told the reporters gathered there, “Main mu’alim hoon, police afsar nahin. (I am a teacher, not a police officer.)”

It only followed that Mahmud’s choice for the 1965 presidential election was Fatima Jinnah, who gave it her all against Ayub; but for the rigging, it would have been Fatima in the presidency. Upon news of her sudden passing, Dawn places Mahmud, with fellow mourners, at her house that day.
Two years later, news of another actual president’s departure came through: his brother Zakir Husain’s.
Choices
In his thoughtful meditation At Home in India: The Muslim Saga, Indian foreign minister Salman Khurshid writes about his grandfather, Zakir Husain, and about the India “for which two decades earlier, during Partition, he had chosen to give up his brother, nephews, and nieces”. True, Zakir did give up his brother. But Mahmud gave up his entire family.
“Mahmud Husain Khan had met his two brothers, Zakir and Yusuf Husain, in India only once after Partition,” Khurshid writes. “…The three educationists met in New Delhi during the 1956 UNESCO conference. The only other time that Mahmud Husain Khan travelled to India was to attend the funeral of President Zakir Husain on May 3, 1969.”
In fact, the record reflects two-way travel. Weeks after the conference, Zakir Husain visited Pakistan to attend Mahmud Husain’s daughter’s wedding in Karachi, where the brothers are photographed alongside Fatima Jinnah.

“Mahmud Husain Khan did not make a special choice to live in Pakistan,” Salman Khurshid goes on. “As head of the political science department of Dacca University, destiny placed him in Pakistan. India lost an eminent educationist and Dr Zakir Husain his favourite brother.”
But just as it would be a disservice to Zakir Husain to say Pakistan lost a visionary because he happened to be heading Jamia in Delhi, it would be unfair to say the same of Mahmud Husain in Dhaka.
After all, Mahmud did not become a Pakistani by default — as if he’d forgotten to board the Delhi train. Believing in the Pakistan project was a choice. Making it the purpose of his life was a choice. Referring to Muhammad Ali Jinnah as a ‘nijat dahinda’ was a choice.
And leaving the brother he loved was a choice: the author is correct to say Mahmud was Zakir’s favourite brother, just as Zakir was Mahmud’s north star. When that star faded out in 1969, the younger Husain had his first heart attack — one he never fully recovered from, and which abbreviated the rest of his days.

The second devastation was the land he had fought for all his life: East Pakistan, as it descended into a living nightmare.
Back in the old days, Mahmud had shaken his head at the Congressites wanting a secession button in the Constitution; only tyrannies did that, relying on brute force to crush such urges. In free states, however, he sighed on the floor, “to provide for secession would be tantamount to committing suicide”.
“Then you can leave it out,” said Bhupendra, “and see what happens.”
No one had paid much attention then: 1953 was another country, before parliamentary solutions were done away with; before emergency fell over Dhaka; before One Unit extinguished majority rule; before the capital was shifted from Karachi to Islamabad; before the humiliations of Ayub’s long dictatorship.
But now it was 1970, and Mahmud Husain had already exited the cabinet, the assembly, and the university over East Bengal — over the quest for a federal republic. The solution he arrived at was sobering: if Pakistan’s two halves were to part, he said, he hoped it would be with the quiet closure of two brothers at their father’s funeral; words of greater subconscious significance than may have appeared to him.
There would be no such parting: the popular will was denied. Gruesome civil war ensued.
Dhaka University was the first target, as Yahya’s men rained fire on the same halls where Mahmud had laughed and cried with his students (the brigadier there would shrug that using tanks, mortar shells, and machine guns on a college campus may have been ‘overkill’).
In the rest of the city, too, history tore itself apart: the Shaheed Minar was torn down by the military, while ex-governor Monem Khan was executed by Mukti Bahini militants.
In his book Doctor Mahmud Husain: Ek Tarikh Ek Idara, professor Syed Ghulam Abbas writes that Mahmud inveighed against using military force to the end. But when the fall of Dhaka was announced, “his composure broke. He wept and wept inconsolably.”
Mahmud Husain died three years later, while serving as vice chancellor of Karachi University. One observer quoted on the occasion, “Dil hee toh hai na sang o khisht/dard se bhar na aaye kyun.”
Parveen Shakir, M.A. student at Karachi University, on Mahmud’s passing, 1975:


اترا تھا لہو جس کا رنگ شاخِ شہر میں
پھیلا تھا نمو پھول نے جس دستِ ہنر میں
روٹھا ہے گلستان سے بہاروں کی طلب میں
بکھرا ہے ہواؤں سے وہ خوشبو کے سفر میں
The one whose blood brought color to the branches of the city,
Whose artistry made the flowers bloom with such vitality,
Has turned away from the garden in search of spring,
Scattered by the winds on a journey of fragrance


In death, the institutions Mahmud had honoured — Karachi, Balochistan, and Sindh Universities — closed that day; the national assembly passed a unanimous resolution (“He continued to serve the cause of education in Pakistan till his end,” said speaker Miraj Khalid); and Jamia Millia Islamia, Malir — which he had founded and named for his brother’s in Delhi — housed his burial as he had wished.
With a handful of exceptions, writes Sharif ul Mujahid, “no educationist, no literary figure, and no political leader … induced such widespread profound and unmitigated sorrow by almost all sections of the Pakistani society since the 1950s”.
 


Exactly half a century since his death, however, Pakistan remains as contested as ever. As one great novelist put it, “I do not expect history to be anything but a long defeat.”
Parliament has never been weaker and the establishment never stronger; students in the so-called peripheries have no protections; and the federal impulse lies shattered by the deep state.
Bahawalpur is not yet a province; Balochistan is not yet trusted with popular representation. In merging with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the tribal areas may have taken a significant step toward their “ultimate destiny”; their actual progress on the ground remains arrested.
Other struggles continue: when Mahmud Husain tabled the original Pakistan Army Act in the assembly, as deputy defence minister in 1952, it made no mention of trying civilians. It would take Ayub Khan (a recurring antagonist in Mahmud’s life) to amend the law; the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench has now reversed its own landmark verdict from 2023, restoring Ayub’s change. Military trials of civilians remain on the books.
As for free thought, both Jamias — in Pakistan and India — have become metaphors for their respective founder-brother’s dreams. Of the original, Zakir Husain’s Jamia in Delhi, Salman Khurshid writes of how it was reduced to “an unwanted child after independence”, the cause of which lay “in the predicament of nationalism and minority character”.

If so, Pakistan can hardly claim the same excuse: the minority question is far from the scene for Malir’s Jamia, which has Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s nationalisation to thank for its disrepair. (“A mature and affectionate teacher,” Bhutto said to the press upon Mahmud’s passing.)

And yet, even if history were a long defeat, per the same novelist, it did carry “glimpses of final victory”.
So, too, did Mahmud Husain’s journey from a young nationalist man in Jamia, amid grief and fracture, to a beloved teacher in Karachi. If any one theme stands out, it’s that countries are not created once: what was wrested from empire now requires wresting from itself. If Pakistan was impossible until it wasn’t, so will be federalism, democracy, and dignity.
But to be able to get there, we must first remember. Or, as Mahmud Husain put it, “Let history be an actual record of what we were, not what we ought to have been.”
As both brothers’ lands went to war this past week — with television anchors invading Karachi, and Indian fighter jets getting blasted out of the sky — history’s hopes remain unfinished: in ways more than one, Pakistan’s beginning has not yet ended.</p><small>2025-05-27 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27102204d087692.jpg?r=103625' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913611/nepali-sherpa-scales-mount-everest-for-a-record-31st-time' target='_blank'><strong>Nepali Sherpa scales Mount Everest for a record 31st time</strong></a><br><p>Nepali Sherpa guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for the 31st time on Tuesday, breaking the record he set last year.
The 55-year-old reached the 8,849-metre (29,032 foot) peak — the highest in the world — by the traditional southeast ridge route while guiding a 22-member Indian army team, officials said, adding that 27 other Sherpas also accompanied the group.
“He is a very passionate climber,” said Pasang Phurba, director of the Seven Summit Treks company for which Kami Rita works, adding that Kami Rita was currently descending to lower camps.
Kami Rita, who uses only his first name, first climbed Everest in 1994 and has done so every year except for three years when authorities closed the mountain to climbers for various reasons.
More than 8,000 people have climbed Mount Everest since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953.
After Kami Rita, another Sherpa, Pasang Dawa, has ascended Everest the most with 29 climbs. Among non-Sherpa climbers, the record is held by British guide Kenton Cool who has accomplished the feat 19 times, followed by American climbers Dave Hahn and Garrett Madison with 15 times each.
One of the poorest countries in the world, Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks and is heavily reliant on climbing, trekking, and tourism for foreign exchange. Guiding foreign climbers to Everest and other peaks provides crucial family income to many Sherpas.
Authorities have issued 468 permits to climbers for Everest this March-May climbing season, and more than 300 climbers and Sherpas have already scaled the peak, officials said.
Two climbers are known to have died on the mountain this month and there have also been unconfirmed reports of other deaths.</p><small>2025-05-27 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271012539df7ecd.jpg?r=101307' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913582/two-polio-workers-abducted-in-tank-as-nationwide-polio-drive-begins' target='_blank'><strong>Two polio workers abducted in Tank as nationwide polio drive begins</strong></a><br><p>

DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district here on Monday as a five-day polio campaign kicked off across the country.
The workers were performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area of Tank as part of the ongoing vaccination drive.
The abducted workers identified as a Union Council official, Sifat Khan, and his colleague Hizbullah.
According to police sources, both health workers were on duty when unidentified armed men abducted them and took them to an undisclosed location.

Minister calls upon nation to stand united against polio as it did against India

Soon after the incident, police launched a search operation in the surrounding areas to trace the abductors and recover the kidnapped workers.
According  to the KP he­­­­a­lth department spo­k­e­sperson, during this five-day  campaign, nearly 7.3 million children under the age of five will be  administered polio drops across the province.
While addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal has suggested the nation to get united against the polio just like it did during the tension and war with India earlier this month.
He visited the National Emergency Opera­tions Centre (NEOC) on the first day of the nationwide polio campaign, targeting approximately 45.4 million children under the age
of five. This year, Pakistan and Afghanistan are conducting simultaneous polio cam-paigns — an unprecedented joint effort — while the rest of the world has already eliminated the disease.
Mr Kamal administered polio drops and provided additional vitamin A supplements to children, paying tribute to the frontline polio workers. He acknowledged their dedicated services and called upon parents across the country to fully cooperate by ensuring their children receive the vaccine.
The minister urged all parents with folded hands to understand that vaccination was essential for their children’s health and future.
He said every person has to play role for the eradication of virus of crippling disease.
“Polio remains an incurable disease, unlike cancer, which can be treated, and that only through vaccination children can be protected from lifelong disability. Out of Pakistan’s 89 districts, 50 have reported the presence of poliovirus in environmental samp­l­­es.
This enemy virus is pre­­sent everywhere arou­­nd children so communities should dispel misinformation and negative notions that hinder immunisation efforts,“ he said.
“Polio eradication is one of the foremost priorities of the government of Pakistan,” Mr Kamal aff­irmed.
“If a child becomes disabled due to polio, parents will bear responsibility before God. We must unite as a nation, just as we stood firm against India, to defeat polio.”
Encouraging community participation, the minister noted positive outcomes from recent campaigns in Karachi, where a significant reduction is witnessed in refusal cases. He called upon people to join hands in the mission to secure a safe and healthy future for the children of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

“Article 187 is a provision which allows the Sup­r­eme Court to decide a mat­ter in a complete sense, but not to settle a dispute or grant relief to a party which is not before the court,” argued the counsel representing the candidates who were denied res­erved seats after the Ele­ction Commission of Pak­is­tan (ECP) quashed a not­ification that had allocated special seats for women to them.
“At times, in a dispute, the court can mould relief for one of the contesting parties, since there can be a situation where a party is entitled to more relief,” the counsel added.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, a member of the 11-judge CB hearing a set of review petitions against the July 12 majority judgement, questioned, “If a matter relates to public importance, should the Supreme Court not exercise this provision in exceptional circumstances or remain restricted like a civil court from exercising its jurisdiction?”
 


He further asked whether the Supreme Court could “shut its eyes” when presiding officers failed to perform their duties according to law. He noted that, irrespective of whether someone was a party or not, people should not be disenfranchised merely because they failed to approach the court.
The counsel cited Justice Yahya Afridi — now Chief Justice of Pakistan — who in his note stated that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution, it does not have the authority to rewrite it.
Justice Afridi had cautioned that relying on Article 187 to grant relief to a party not before the court could create a dangerous and far-reaching precedent. It risked undermining due process and potentially led to judicial overreach. Therefore, such powers must be exercised only in compelling and exceptional cases to bolster the rights of an aggrieved party, while remaining within constitutional bounds, he emphasised.
The counsel further argued that no party can directly file a petition under Article 187 of the Constitution before the Supreme Court, and reminded that the jurisdictional requirements of Articles 184, 185, 186, 186A or 188 must be satisfied for the Supreme Court to act.
He pointed out that the Supreme Court has consistently held that election disputes should be treated like civil disputes, where the burden of proof lies on the challenger.
Justice Musarrat Hilali observed that the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) likely had only one member in the National Assembly and questioned on what grounds the PTI was granted reserved seats through the July 12 judgement. She asked whether the court acted on some kind of suo motu basis.
Justice Hilali also recalled that the majority judgement had taken an independent stance to provide relief to a party — PTI — that was not before the Peshawar High Court, and which had only moved an application before the Supreme Court to act as an intervener for assistance.
The counsel argued that Article 187 was referenced 10 times in the majority verdict as the basis for invoking the doctrine of constitutional fidelity and for doing complete justice.
However, he emphasised that Article 187 is not a jurisdictional provision, but rather a procedural one that enables the court to do complete justice in matters already pending before it. Accordingly, the case must first be brought before the Supreme Court under Articles 184 to 185, 186, 186A or 188. Article 187, he said, merely allows the court to overcome procedural hurdles and technicalities in such matters.
Justice Hilali also questioned the status of the PTI, which was not permitted to contest the general elections under a common election symbol, asking whether it remained a political party despite the restrictions it faced.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, who is heading the 11-judge CB, reminded that the dispute over reserved seats was based on the number of seats procured.
The counsel argued that none of the 80 candidates in question had approached the Supreme Court, yet the majority judgement granted reserved seats to all 80 PTI candidates — after the legal and constitutional deadline had passed — even though PTI was not a petitioner before any legal forum.
He pointed out that those candidates could have joined the PTI or approached the court, but instead they chose to affiliate with the SIC. Therefore, they were not petitioners, and allocating seats to them was clearly against constitutional provisions.
He also noted that all 13 judges of the July 12 judgement had unanimously held that a political party which did not contest the general elections or secure any seat was not entitled to reserved seats.
The SIC, the counsel argued, did not contest the general elections for any seat. Its chairman ran as an independent candidate. The 80 candidates in question joined the SIC, which although a registered political party, did not contest or win any seats in the general elections.
The counsel also reminded that under Article 225 of the Constitution, election disputes must be raised only through an election petition — yet the ECP’s notification allocating reserved seats to the petitioners was quashed.
Faisal Siddiqi, the counsel for the SIC, will begin his arguments on Tuesday.

“Were the real facts regarding seniority kept hidden from the chief justices during the process of consultation?” Justice Ahmed asked, expressing concern that such anomalies had led to doubts and raised questions about mala fide intent.
The five-judge CB, headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, had taken up a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz. The petition argues that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
Senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, representing former presidents of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, argued that the establishment of the IHC was implemented under Article 175 of the Constitution and that the appointment of its judges under the IHC Act pertained only to the provinces. Even in cases of transfer, he contended, the transfer is not permanent and there is no need for a new oath when a judge returns to his original court.
 
 


Justice Ahmed asks if chief justices were kept in dark on seniority

The counsel also asserted that the powers of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) had been undermined in the current system of transfers, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.
Justice Ahmed observed that a unified seniority list of judges across the country could help resolve such disputes. Mr Siddiqi agreed, saying the effects of judicial transfers would become clearer and more transparent with such a list.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan argued that the Third Schedule of the Constitution does not require a separate oath for IHC judges. He explained that the Constitution only refers to “high courts” for the oath, and the IHC judges had taken the same oath as those transferred from other courts.
When Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan asked whether a new oath was needed under Article 200 in case of transfer, the AGP replied that there was no such requirement under this article.
Justice Afghan also inquired why the final summary of the judge transfers made no mention of an oath.
The AGP replied that there was an SC verdict on judges’ seniority, and the summary sent to the prime minister was administrative in nature. He explained that under Article 200, the transfer of judges can be either permanent or temporary. In cases of temporary transfer, judges receive additional benefits. In permanent transfers, they are provided with government accommodation. If the transfer is for a limited period, the judge eventually returns to their original high court.
The AGP clarified that if a judge is permanently transferred, their seat in the original high court becomes vacant. While government accommodation was provided to judges transferred to the IHC, they did not receive any additional allowances. Moreover, judges who are transferred are not required to take a new oath, he added.

The committee was informed that the security agencies had responded to a letter from the Ministry of Interior stating that, due to the prevailing security and law and order situation, internet services in Panjgur district would remain suspended for the next six months.
The NA Standing Committee on Information Technology, held with Aminul Haq in the chair was told that this has been communicated to the interior ministry by security agencies in response to a letter, citing prevailing law and order situation as the reason.
 
 

Expressing concern over this situation, the committee noted that internet services in Panjgur have remained suspended for the past three years, causing severe difficulties for the local population, particularly the business community and students. Consequently, the committee decided to convene an in-camera meeting wherein the Secretary Interior would brief the committee in detail about the specific law and order situation that necessitates the continued suspension of internet services.
National Party lawmaker Pullain Baloch informed the committee that the people of his constituency (NA-258) have to travel from 15kms to 20kms only to access internet services. He said PTCL’s internet coverage in the area was nearly non-existent. Subsequently, the committee directed the PTA chairman to conduct a survey of the internet coverage in the mentioned region and submit a detailed report to the committee.

Decision taken due to security concerns, NA panel told

Meanwhile, the NA committee was briefed that a total of 4.6 million students had been provided training through 19 batches under 15 most in-demand freelancing courses. Among the trained individuals, 28pc were female. The committee was further informed that according to a survey conducted in October 2024, freelancers and trainees who received training through Ignite’s programmes collectively generated revenue amounting to US$1.65 billion. Ignite informed the committee that it had introduced 10 additional courses, bringing the total number of courses to 25. These include programmes and projects related to artificial intelligence. The committee directed Ignite to submit a district-wise list of student enrollments from Balochistan.
Regarding female enrollment, the committee directed Ignite to make efforts to increase the current 28pc female participation across various courses to at least 50pc, in order to ensure greater inclusion and empowerment of women in the national workforce.
The committee expressed concern over the absence of the CEO of PTCL and issued instructions to ensure he appears before the lawmakers in next meeting of the committee. It was brought to the panel’s attention that PTCL was allegedly planning to sell certain properties, including some high-value assets. The committee directed PTCL to present the specific clauses of its sales and purchase agreements that authorise the company to proceed with the sale of these properties.
Besides ministry officials and MNA Adil Khan Bazai, lawmakers Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti, Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani, Sadiq Ali Memon, Sharmila Sahiba Farooqui Hashaam, Ahmad Saleem Siddiqui, Pullain Baloch, Awais Haider Jakhar, and Umair Khan Niazi attended the meeting.

• PDMA calls for standardised fitting of solar panels to withstand inclement weather
• Official says 70pc deaths resulted from falling solar panels
LAHORE: Heavy rain and thunderstorms are set to batter Punjab, days after similar weather killed around 20 people across the province.
The Provincial Disaster Man­agement Authority (PDMA) Punjab has issued a province-wide alert of severe weather from today (Tuesday).
A westerly wave combined with moist currents is likely to bring intense windstorms, thu­nderstorms, and heavy rainfall across the region from May 27 to 31, said the Met department forecast.
Upper and central Punjab districts, including Rawal­pi­ndi, Murree, Galliyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Gujranwala, Gujrat and Sheikhupura will experience heavy rains with hailstorms and lightning from the evening of May 27 through May 31.
Southern districts of DG Khan, Rajanpur, Multan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Pakpattan and Vehari are expected to receive light to moderate rain and thunderstorms during the same period.
The authorities warned people to stay away from loose stru­ctures, including electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels during thunderstorms and stay indoors as much as possible.
The warning was issued as a PDMA assessment showed 70pc of casualties during the thunderstorm three days ago were caused by falling solar panels which were not installed properly.
Emergency protocols
In light of the fresh forecast, the Punjab government has activated emergency protocols across all districts.
The district administrations and all relevant departments, including health, education, irrigation, local government and Rescue 1122, have been put on alert to maintain round-the-clock staffing at emergency operation centres.
The provincial cabinet committee on disaster management also convened an emergency meeting on Monday.
Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafiq chaired the mee­ting attended by senior officials and divisional commissioners.
The meeting focused on a comprehensive five-point age­nda to strengthen the province’s response to the upcoming monsoon season.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia briefed the committee on the relief body’s preparations. The commissioners and deputy commissioners shared progress reports on ongoing desilting of waterways and mock emergency exercises.
Mr Rafiq issued directives for enhanced measures in Gujranwala and Lahore, where above-average monsoon rains are predicted.
The meeting approved a special grant for desilting operations in Waha (Rajanpur) and urgent measures to address potential hill torrents in vulnerable areas.
The minister stressed the importance of field visits by officers to ensure proper arrangements before monsoon rains.
Rawalpindi’s Leh Nullah was specifically identified for priority desilting operations.
The meeting also reviewed the Flood Risk Management Survey. Officials revealed plans to survey over 100,000 structures in Dera Ghazi Khan division, with all hill torrent area surveys scheduled for completion by June 22.
The committee also approved a crucial model study on river erosion patterns.
PDMA helpline
The PDMA has also established a communication system to disseminate weather updates and warnings through SMS alerts, mosque announcements and through local representatives.
PDMA DG Kathia urged citizens to contact the PDMA helpline at 1129 in case of any emergency. The authority can also be reached on WhatsApp +923178371900 and landline 042-9922135/6 for assistance.
PDMA has also directed local authorities to submit daily situation reports.
Solar panel regulations
The PDMA has taken action against substandard fitting of solar panels after falling plates resulted in the deaths of most of the 19 people who were killed during the windstorm in central and southern Punjab on Saturday.
The authority has issued directives to the energy and local government departments and divisional and district administrations for comprehensive guidelines for the installation of solar panels so that they could withstand inclement weather.
According to PDMA’s findings, poorly installed solar panels and mounting structures were uprooted during the recent storm, causing fatal accidents across Punjab.
Poorly fitted panels and mounts fell from rooftops, resulting in significant loss of life and property.
PDMA DG Kathia confirmed that 70pc of the accidents that occurred due to windstorms in the past few days were caused by fallen solar panels or their mounts.
He said solar panels installed on rooftops or in open areas should follow proper installation guidelines.
He stressed the installation of solar panels should be standardised and certified in the future.
The PDMA has instructed district administrations to conduct thorough surveys of existing solar installations to identify and repair dangerous fittings.
The installation of all existing and future solar panels must meet strict engineering standards, including the key requirements like use of certified material and mounting equipment, structural approval by relevant authorities and implementation of regular maintenance and inspection protocols, the relief body directed.
It also stressed the need to devise standard operating procedures (SOPs) for repairs and periodic safety checks.
The energy and local government departments were directed to create a regulatory framework for solar panel installations.
The framework would enforce mandatory safety standards and certification processes for all solar energy systems, especially those installed on rooftops and open structures.
The PDMA warned that failure to comply with the new guidelines could result in similar tragedies during future extreme weather events.
All deputy commissioners have been directed to immediately launch awareness campaigns to educate the public about safe solar panel installation practices while the formal regulations were being developed.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Monday rene­wed their commitment to permanent peace in South Asia, underlining that frie­ndly relations with neighbouring countries formed a core part of both nations’ foreign policy.
The reaffirmation came during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian at a reception hosted at the Sa’dabad Palace in Tehran.
The meeting took place during the prime minist­er’s official visit to Tur­k­iye, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, aimed at expre­ssing gratitude to fri­endly Muslim nations for their support during the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
Both leaders resolved to enhance cooperation to boost bilateral trade and investment and work together to maintain peace and security in the region.

Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan came out of the crisis with India as victorious because of the “brave actions of our outstanding armed forces, strongly supported by the people of Pakistan”.
He added, “We want peace and will work for peace in the region thro­ugh talks on the table and resolve our outstanding iss­ues, including the Kash­mir dispute, according to the United Nations Secu­rity Council resolutions, which were acknowledged even by the Indian Lok Sabha when Nehru was the prime minister of India.”
He said Pakistan is ready to talk for the sake of peace on different issues, including water, trade and counterterrorism, “if India is serious”. However, he reaffirmed that if India remained aggressive, Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The prime minister said he had a productive and useful meeting with the Iranian president, covering all areas of mutual interest and cooperation.
 


“There was total agreement that the two brotherly neighbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields, including trade, investment and economy,” he added.
Stressing that Pakistan and Iran had deep-rooted cultural and historical relations, he said, “We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation in various fields of life.”
PM Shehbaz also thanked the Iranian president for calling him and showing his concern on the evolving situation in the subcontinent a few weeks ago.
“I deeply appreciate your concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt instead of escalating further,” he told the president.
Israeli actions condemned
Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned Israeli actions causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where Israel murdered more than 50,000 Palestinians, and the bloodshed continues.
“It is high time that the international community used its influence to bring a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. Pakistan stands by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.
He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s right to have a civilian nuclear programme. He assured that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.
The Iranian president stressed that Pakistan and Iran shared a common stance on important regional and international issues on different platforms, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
President Pezeshkian said the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups.
“Peace and stability in Pakistan are in the interest of Iran. We believe that sustaining security and maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with neighbouring countries is in the interest of the two countries,” he added.
He said Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, adding that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region.
“We believe that to ensure security and stability in the region, neighbouring countries should hold dialogue and have positive consultations with each other and the international partners,” he added.
He said the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine.
“As always, we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,” he added.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatimi accompanied the prime minister.
PM meets Khamenei
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz made a courtesy call to Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran.
 






According to the PM Office, the prime minister briefed the supreme leader about the recent conflict with India and its hegemonistic and revisionist designs. He thanked the Iranian leadership for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression.
The premier underlined that Pakistan always desired peace to prevail in the region leading to economic development and prosperity.
Prime Minister Shehbaz briefed the supreme leader about the steps taken to elevate Pakistan-Iran ties to highest levels and maintained that his government was committed to further deepening strategic cooperation with Iran in the complex geopolitical times.
He praised the farsightedness of the Iranian leadership in pursuing the nuclear negotiations with the United States and hoped that a constructive deal would be reached between the two countries.
The supreme leader appreciated PM Shehbaz’s efforts in promoting regional peace and stability and praised his commitment to further strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties. The supreme leader also prayed for greater prosperity, growth and development of Pakistan and its people.

• Head of  US-backed aid group quits
• Only 4.6pc of Gaza land now ‘arable’
• German chancellor says he no longer understands Israeli army’s goal
GENEVA: The Palestinian delegation won the right to fly their flag at the World Health Organisation (WHO) after a symbolic victory in a vote on Monday that its envoy hopes will lead to greater recognition within the UN and beyond.
The proposal, brought by China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and others, at the global agency’s annual assembly in Geneva passed with 95 in favour and four against — Israel, Hungary, Czech Republic and Germany — and 27 abstentions.
In apparent reference to the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Lebanon’s delegate Rana el-Khoury said the vote’s outcome provided “a small ray of hope for the brave Palestinian people whose suffering has reached unbearable levels”.
Israel argued against the WHO resolution and called for a vote. Its main ally, the US, did not participate.
Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out strikes across Gaza Strip, killing at least 52 people on Monday, 33 of them in a school-turned-shelter.
In Gaza City, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that an early-morning Israeli strike on the Fahmi Al-Jarjawi school, where displaced people were sheltering, killed “at least 33, with dozens injured, mostly children”.
Images shared widely on social media showed what appeared to be badly burned bodies being pulled from the rubble.
Israel’s military claimed the building was being used as a centre by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to plan and organise attacks.
Farah Nussair said the school was sheltering “civilians, children, elderly, women, and men — just the tired ones who needed food and water”.
“We fled to the south, they bombed us in the south. We returned to the north, they bombed us in the north. We came to schools …. There is no security or safety, neither at schools, nor hospitals — not anywhere,” she said, a child in her lap.
Another strike killed at least 19 people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, Bassal said.
Aid group’s chief quits
The development came as the head of a US-backed foundation set to supply aid in Gaza quit unexpectedly on Sunday, a day before the group was due to begin operations.
Jake Wood, executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation for the past two months, said he resigned because it could not adhere “to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”. The foundation has been boycotted by the UN and the groups supplying aid to Gaza before Israel imposed a total blockade on the enclave in March.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which would use private contractors working under Israeli security, said it would begin deliveries on Monday, with the aim of reaching one million Palestinians by the end of the week.
The Switzerland-registered foundation will screen families for involvement with Hamas, potentially using facial recognition technology, according to aid officials.
While the aid system is being worked out, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Monday under five per cent of Gaza’s farmland is usable due to war, further exacerbating the risk of famine.
By the end of April, more than 80 per cent of the farmland was damaged and 77.8pc was no longer accessible, leaving barely 4.6pc of potentially arable land, according to a new satellite assessment released by FAO. Some 688 hectares (1,700 acres) is all that remains for cultivation, according to the assessment.
Israeli official dismisses truce proposal
As Israel continues its atrocities, Hamas has agreed to a proposal by US special envoy Steve Witkoff for a Gaza ceasefire, a Palestinian official close to the group told Reuters on Monday.
The new proposal, which sees the release of ten hostages and 70 days of truce, was received by Hamas through mediators. “The proposal includes the release of ten living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,” the source said.
The proposal also sees the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, including hundreds of those serving lengthy prison terms.
However, an Israeli official dismissed the latest ceasefire proposal from Hamas on Monday, saying no responsible government could accept such an agreement and rejecting the assertion by Hamas that the deal matched one proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claimed that Hamas was not interested in a deal.
European nations continue to pressure Israel to end the war with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Monday, saying he now “no longer understands” Israel’s objective in war-ravaged Gaza. “Honestly speaking, I no longer understand what the Israeli army is now doing in the Gaza Strip, with what goal,” Merz told public broadcaster WDR.

• Claims every possible support to be made available for armed forces
• Privatisation drive to be ‘accelerated’ in next fiscal year; PIA, three Discos to be privatised by year end
• Flags population growth, climate change as existential threats
ISLAMABAD: Promising simplified tax returns for the salaried class, Finance Minister Muhammad Aura­ng­zeb on Monday pledged that the up­co­ming federal budget would int­ro­duce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction and make available whatever support is required by the armed forces.
Talking to journalists after an event organised by the Pakistan Banks Association and Karandaaz Pakistan, the finance minister said that every possible support would be provided to the armed forces, stressing that it was a national need in light of recent cross-border aggression, not just a military requirement.
Responding to a question, he said the IMF mission and its regional dir­e­ctor, Jihad Azour, and executive dir­ector, Bahador Bijani, had retur­ned after concluding the mission in Islam­abad and completing discussions on the broad contours of the budget.
The discussions would continue virtually this week on a few new things that might crop up from Pakistan’s side or from their side, but a lot of support was available from the IMF, he said.
Mr Aurangzeb said the IMF app­roved Pakistan’s first biannual rev­iew and additional financing strictly on merit because all structural and qualitative benchmarks had been completed. He noted that Pakistan’s resolve to stay the course played a key role in overcoming challenges, including attempts to derail the IMF board meeting and create problems.
Responding to a question on budget delay, the minister said the country’s leadership had prioritised expressing gratitude to friendly nations who stood by Pakistan amid heightened tensions with India. Budget finalisation would resume upon the leadership’s return.
Earlier, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakis­tan’s turnaround story for macroeconomic stabilisation had received glo­bal appreciation. He said an equally strong message from friends and development partners was to stay the course and that was also the government’s commitment to move ahead with structural reforms in taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public finance.
He said it was easy to go for a sugar rush and pump liquidity in the system, but that was a well-known route the country had treaded multiple times before and landed in a balance of payments crisis as Pakistan is an import-dependent economy. He promised to resist that temptation to break the boom-and-bust cycle.
Simpler tax returns
The minister said the taxation reform was now led by the private sector and the purpose was to minimise human interaction through people, process and technology and address theft, leakage and corruption through transparency.
He said the government would ensure simplified tax returns and forms for the salaried class. He said that around 70 to 80 per cent of salaried people did not hold equity and fixed-income portfolios.
“They receive salaries through bank accounts with tax deducted at source. They should not have to fill in 140-150 data points,” he said, adding that the government aimed to reduce that number to just nine — five for wealth tax and four for income tax.
The minister conceded that 24 state-owned enterprises transferred to the Privatisation Commission last year did not go well. However, he said the process would now be accelerated, with transactions involving Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), three power distribution companies and some financial institutions expected to reach completion by the end of this year.
Mr Aurangzeb said debt servicing was the single-largest expenditure on the public finance side, and therefore, the government would have to ensure fiscal discipline to reduce borrowing and thus curtail debt servicing costs.
While the Debt Management Office is being restructured, he emphasised that its goal should go beyond reducing interest payments and instead help create economic value — or “alpha” — to put the economy on a sustainable growth path.
“That is where we are going to bring very bold measures in the coming budget to give strategic direction where the economy is headed” and change the DNA of the economy and not to just give an account of expenditure and revenue, Mr Aurangzeb said.
However, he warned that population growth and climate change were existential threats already impacting the country. Therefore, the government was also engaged with development partners and the IMF to support adaptation policies, he added.

Clashes broke out in Moro last Tuesday when police attempted to disperse demonstrators protesting the controversial construction of new canals on the River Indus. Protesters, organised by the Sindh Saba and armed with sticks and rods, blocked the Moro bypass road and clashed with police.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar’s house was also attacked, along with two trailers on Moro bypass road. A deputy duperintendent of police (DSP) was among the wounded.
According to a notification, the committee, chaired by Sindh West Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Irfan Ali Baloch, will comprise Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh of the Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell, Benazirabad SSP Shabbir Sethar, DSP CIA Hyderabad Iftikhar Buriro and sub-inspector Naik Mohammad.
“The investigation of FIRs lodged will run parallel as a criminal case investigation”, the Sindh IG told Dawn.com when contacted for confirmation.
“The facts in this case are scattered, therefore, this committee is [being] formed,” he added. “Besides ascertaining the facts leading to [the] May 20 incident, it will evaluate [the] police response to the situation and fix responsibility, suggesting and recommening remedial measures to prevent such untoward incidents in [the] future.”
HRCP ‘deeply alarmed’ by Moro situation
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “deep alarm” about the situation in Moro and the casualties and injuries among demonstrators and the police.
“The burial of a deceased political activist under police supervision, as well as subsequent arrests and charges of sedition against protesters and their families, are gravely concerning,” the commission wrote on X.
“While HRCP does not condone violence by any actor, the disproportionate use of force by the police and criminalisation of dissent is unlawful. We demand an immediate, impartial inquiry into these incidents.”
 






On Sunday, the body of Irfan Leghari, who was killed in the violence in Moro, was buried in Mohammad Shah graveyard instead of his ancestral graveyard under a judicial order.
Leghari’s funeral was performed by police in the absence and without the consent of his family members and close relatives. Leghari had been shot during the police action and ensuing clashes.
Family members and relatives reacted angrily when police escorting the coffin-carrying ambulance arrived in the Leghari Bijarani village, in Sanghar district, late on Friday evening.
They said they would not accept the body from the police, who they said killed their loved one and also tortured and rounded up many of their community members at the demonstration.
Leghari’s heirs insisted that all those detained during and after the protest be released and cases against them withdrawn. Additionally, they demanded the resignation of the Sindh IG and DIG, as well as the registration of an FIR to investigate the incident.</p><small>2025-05-26 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26204146b745160.jpg?r=224949' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913461/pti-announces-countrywide-movement-party-told-to-prepare-itself' target='_blank'><strong>PTI announces countrywide movement, party told to prepare itself</strong></a><br><p>PTI officials on Monday announced that the party will launch a “countrywide movement” and urged party members and supporters to get ready, though no date was announced.
Party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan has been imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for over two years upon his conviction in four cases — two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.
The party has since launched several mass protests demanding his release, notably a march to Islamabad on November 26, 2024, where a day of pitched battles between security forces and PTI protesters ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone.
In a post on X, PTI Senator Ali Zafar wrote that the party would be mobilising nationwide after having a six-hour discussion with the ex-premier today.
“Some very important matters were discussed. Amongst them was a countrywide movement for which the party should prepare and be well-organised,” the senator wrote.
Zafar warned that according to Imran, “there is no room for anyone in PTI to play both sides, and everyone must stand united for the cause of truth and justice.”
Quoting Imran, Zafar wrote, “I am bearing all the hardship in jail for the sake of the nation, and PTI leadership should not be scared of sacrifice.”
He did not give a date for when this movement is set to take place.
 






Meanwhile, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also spoke to reporters outside the Adiala Jail about the mass mobilisation, though she too did not give a date for when the movement would take place.
“Imran Khan issued instructions to get the party ready,” Aleema said. “He said ‘I will not call anybody to Islamabad, since they (authorities) sit with sniper rifles and people get shot … it brings me great pain, I will not do this.’
“Imran Khan has said that the party should get ready, as he will announce a mass movement across Pakistan soon,” she added.
