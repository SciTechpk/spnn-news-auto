• HRW says Israel using starvation as a weapon of war
• Author David Grossman calls Israel’s Gaza campaign ‘genocide’
GAZA CITY: President Donald Trump’s special envoy inspected a US-backed food distribution centre in war-torn Gaza on Friday, as the UN rights office reported that Israeli forces had killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians waiting for aid.
Meanwhile, award-winning Israeli author David Grossman called his country’s campaign in Gaza “genocide” and said he was using the term with a “broken heart”.
The visit by Steve Witkoff came as a report from global advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) also accused Israeli forces of presiding over “regular bloodbaths” close to the US-backed aid points.
The UN’s rights office in the Palestinian territories said at least 1,373 people had been killed seeking aid in Gaza since May 27 – 105 of them in the last two days of July.
“Most of these killings were committed by the Israeli military,” the UN office said, breaking down the death toll into 859 killed near the US-backed food sites and 514 along routes used by UN and aid agency convoys.
The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, posted on X that he and Witkoff had visited Gaza “to learn the truth” about the private aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by the United States.
“We received briefings from IDF (the Israeli military) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!” Huckabee said.
The foundation, on its own X account, posted that it had been a “privilege and honor” to host Witkoff and Huckabee as the group delivered its 100-millionth meal in Gaza, fulfilling Trump’s “call to lead with strength, compassion and action”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said 11 people were killed by Israeli fire and air strikes on Friday, including two who were waiting near an aid distribution site run by GHF.
‘Beyond imagination’
In its report on the GHF centres on Friday, Human Rights Watch accused the Israeli military of illegally using starvation as a weapon of war.
“Israeli forces are not only deliberately starving Palestinian civilians, but they are now gunning them down almost every day as they desperately seek food for their families,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch.
Witkoff meets Netanyahu
After arriving in Israel, Witkoff held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to resolve the ongoing war, feed desperate civilians and free the remaining Israeli prisoners.
In a recent video, German-Israeli prisoner Rom Braslavski, 21, while watching recent news footage of the crisis in Gaza pleaded with the Israeli authorities to secure his release.
‘Genocide’
In the meantime, award-winning Israeli author David Grossman called his country’s campaign in Gaza “genocide” and said he was using the term with a “broken heart”.
 
 

“For many years, I refused to use that term: ‘genocide’,” the prominent writer and peace activist told Italian daily La Repubblica in an interview published on Friday.
“But now, after the images I have seen and after talking to people who were there, I can’t help using it.” Grossman told the paper he was using the word “with immense pain and with a broken heart.”
He also won Israel’s top literary prize in 2018, the Israel Prize for Literature, for his work spanning more than three decades.

“The decisions by France, the United Kingdom and Canada reinforce the trend towards recognising Palestine as part of efforts to breathe new life into the peace process,” Stubb said in a post to X.
“If I receive a proposal to recognise the Palestinian state, I am prepared to approve it,” Stubb said, deploring an “inhumane” situation in Gaza.
Finland’s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Friday reiterated Helsinki’s support for a two-state solution, without specifying whether the government was ready to recognise a Palestinian state.

Addressing Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) delegates from across the country, gathered here for the three-day platinum jubilee celebrations, the PPP chairman acknowledged the persistent challenges facing Balochistan “are often not fully understood at the federal level”, stressing that resolving them required consistent hard work, meaningful engagement and sustained investment.
“While there may be a need for kinetic action in certain situations, such measures alone cannot resolve Balochistan’s problems,” he said.
“The provincial government is striving to introduce initiatives that go beyond that. We are bringing projects aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the people of Balochistan. That’s the real battle we are trying to fight and win in Balochistan.”
Earlier, he recalled how the Pakistani Air Force defeated Indian aggression, while Pakistani journalism countered Indian media’s disinformation campaigns. “Our journalists prioritised credibility, truth, and verified news over sensationalism. This commitment is commendable,” he said.

PPP chief praises role of media during recent escalation with India

“The recent conflict made it clear how essential digital platforms are as national assets,” he said.
“Digital media played a critical role, and its freedom proved beneficial. We must now safeguard and empower it. I am grateful that the government lifted the ban on digital media during the war — and that it has not been reinstated since. I sincerely hope it remains that way.”
 
 

Addressing the spread of disinformation by hostile elements, including India, the PPP chairman stressed that misinformation targeting regions like Balochistan, Sindh, and Kashmir was part of a larger campaign.
He vowed to collaborate with PFUJ to introduce legislation to combat disinformation and protect journalism. He expressed hope that the federal government would reconsider some policies towards the media.
“We will do everything we can to implement laws designed to protect journalists. We also ask journalists to work with us in this effort,” he said.

• Four jump into river to rescue family member, three missing
• 295 dead, over 700 injured nationwide in monsoon-related disasters
• Corruption alleged in GB early warning, protection projects
ISLAMABAD / GILGIT: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in flood-hit Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Chairing a high-level meeting to review the monsoon damage, the prime minister ordered an urgent overhaul of the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s early warning infrastructure to make it more proactive and effective.
He also directed authorities to restore and repair road and communication networks on an emergency basis to ensure timely aid delivery and mobility in affected areas.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the meeting focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.
Expressing sorrow over the loss of lives and widespread destruction caused by torrential rains, PM Shehbaz reiterated his government’s solidarity with the people of GB and AJK.
“The federal government stands shoulder to shoulder with the administrations and citizens of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir in this hour of grief,” he said. “I will soon visit Gilgit-Baltistan to express solidarity with the victims and a comprehensive federal relief package will be announced to support recovery and rehabilitation efforts.”
The prime minister directed all federal departments to coordinate with regional authorities to conduct swift damage assessments and prioritise life-saving interventions. He stressed the need for a coordinated and rapid response to minimise further losses and ensure timely assistance to those affected.
During the briefing, National Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik informed the premier that monsoon-related disasters had caused 295 deaths and over 700 injuries nationwide. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed and 376 livestock lost.
He also warned of continued flood threats in rivers and streams, noting potential minor flooding at Tarbela, Chashma, Taunsa and Kalabagh, and moderate flood levels at Head Marala and Guddu on the Chenab River. He cautioned that monsoon activity is expected to intensify towards the end of August.
The meeting was attended by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, among others.
Separately, Minister for National Health Services Syed Mustafa Kamal called on PM Shehbaz on Friday to brief him on ongoing projects and reform efforts in the health sector. The meeting also covered other matters related to the Ministry of Health, according to a statement from the PM’s Office.
Tragedies mount in GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan’s Haron area, four members of a family drowned in the Ghizer River while trying to rescue a man reported to be mentally unwell, who had jumped into the water. Rescue 1122 officials said that one family member was rescued, while two women and a man remain missing.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all available resources to be deployed in the search and rescue operation.
 
 

In a separate incident, a glacier burst in Bagrot Valley on Friday led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The pair had been crossing the glacier in Barchi village on foot when it collapsed.
The GB spokesperson confirmed they fell into a ravine and were buried under debris. The father was rescued after several hours by locals and Rescue 1122.
While a billion-rupee early warning system had been installed in the area under the UNDP-funded Glof-II Project, it failed to function during the incident.
Opposition leader from the constituency, Syed Sohail Abbas Shah, alle­ged large-scale corruption in the implementation of early warning and protection projects, accusing both the government and international organisations.
Emergency declared
Spokesperson Fai­zullah Faraq announced that an eme­rgency has been imp­osed across GB. He urged the federal government to step in and assist with flood relief and the rehabilitation of affected people.
Fresh flash floods have struck the Khanbari area of Diamer district, dest­roying standing crops, farmland and irrigation infrastructure. The search continues for the 11th day for missing tourists along the Babusar Highway.
PM Shehbaz is expected to visit GB soon.

However, the detailed road map for the service is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.
On Friday, Minister for Mari­time Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry called for the swift launch of Pakistan’s first ferry service, stressing the need for immediate reforms to licensing procedures and financial facilitation for operators.
 
 

These reforms aim to ensure affordable sea travel, support pilgrims and boost maritime connectivity.
In a meeting with Shipping and Ports Director General Alia Shahid, the minister highlighted the benefits of sea travel, pointing out that ferry services could offer a reliable and cost-efficient travel option for Zaireen heading to Iran and Iraq.
“Beyond tourism and business, this service can greatly facilitate religious travel. We can offer pilgrims a secure, affordable and efficient option for their journeys,” said Mr Chaudhry.
He also emphasised the potential economic benefits of the service, noting that every year, between 700,000 and one million Pakistani Zaireen travel to Iran and Iraq. If 20 per cent of these pilgrims opt for ferry services in the first three years, it could result in 140,000 to 200,000 passengers annually, representing significant economic potential.
The meeting also revealed that stakeholder consultations, including with private operators and regional maritime authorities, are underway. Feasibility studies and regulatory frameworks are being finalised, with a pilot lau­nch expected in the coming weeks.
“If implemented effectively, this service could become a vital new transport link across the region,” the minister said.
To streamline the process, the minister instructed that the ferry licensing process be fully digitalised and integrated into the Pakistan Single Window platform, similar to the existing ship registration process. He specifically ordered that the current six-month licensing period be reduced to just one month.
“There’s no justification for a half-year delay,” he said. “We must eliminate red tape and act decisively.”
In an effort to attract private sector participation, the minister also called for exploring flexible financial models for ferry operators.
“Our aim is to support, not hinder, entrepreneurs who wish to invest in this sector,” he added.
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs has proposed a hybrid financial model, where the country’s financial management system relies on bank and insurance guarantees to support the venture.
Deadlock over land travel ban
Meanwhile, the deadlock continues between the federal government and political groups representing the Shia community over the ban on land travel for pilgrims.
The negotiation team, which included Nasir Shirazi, Allama Ahmed Iqbal Rizvi and Asad Naqvi from Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), and Allama Shabbir Meesami, Allama Arif Wahidi and Zahid Akhunzada from the Shia Ulema Council (SUC), submitted a written proposal to the Ministry of Interior on Thursday.
 
 

The proposal called for the immediate reversal of the government’s decision to ban land travel to Iran for the pilgrims.
The government has been urged to facilitate the movement of around 80 buses stranded in Quetta to reach the Gabd-Rimdan border crossing. However, the government’s response was delayed, as key officials were occupied with security meetings ahead of the Iranian president’s arrival on Saturday (today).
As a result, neither the Minister of State for Interior nor any senior official from the Ministry of Interior could meet with the joint delegation from MWM and SUC.
One member of the negotiating team said they were awaiting the government’s response and would announce their future strategy after the government’s decision.
“The government must take this matter seriously. We want the issue to be resolved through dialogue, so that the pilgrims may travel to Karbala,” said Nasir Shirazi, secretary general of MWM.
“But it seems the authorities are not understanding the pressure we are under, with many pilgrims also belonging to the Ahle Sunnah school of thought.”

• Elders assure army, FC of full support for anti-militancy efforts
BAJAUR / NORTH WAZIRISTAN: A complete curfew was imposed across North Waziristan in view of the security situation, while a peace jirga tried to prevail upon local militant leaders to leave Bajaur.
The moves were part of efforts to restore peace to these merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which have witnessed a spike in militant activity of late, especially along the border with Afghanistan.
On Friday, a peace march was held in the Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district against the deteriorating law and order situation in the area.
Tribal elders, representatives of all political parties, the Utmanzai Jirga, Youth of Kabul Khel, and activists of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) attended the gathering.
Addressing the participants, Utmanzai jirga spok­esman Mufti Baitullah and other speakers expressed concern over rising lawlessness across the district.
 
 

The speakers emphasised that people were living in constant fear, primarily due to the re-emergence of militant elements and poor government strategies, and called upon state institutions to ensure immediate and sustainable peace in the region.
Following the imposition of curfew in the area, the district administration has advised people to stay indoors and avoid traveling on roads.
Jirga efforts
In Bajaur, where ‘Opera­tion Sarbakaf’ was laun­c­hed earlier this week to clear the area of militants, a peace Jirga met local militant leaders to convince them to return to Afghanistan.
But sources said that the local leadership of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have sought another day’s time to consult with their leaders in Afghanistan.
 
 

The meeting, held at a mosque in the Lar Kalan area of Lowi Mamund teh­sil, was attended by a 50-member delegation of the Bajaur Peace Commi­ttee and a group of TTP leaders.
Sources said that Jirga members, led by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and consisting of local PTI MPAs Dr. Hamidur Rehman, Anwar Zeb Khan, and former PTI MNA Gul Zafar Khan — among others — presented a two-point agenda to the TTP leaders.
The delegation asked the militants to either return to Afghanistan, or go into the mountains rather than staying among the local population, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals, Dr Khailur Rehman, a PTI senior leader who also a part of the delegation, told Dawn.
He said that the TTP leaders had sought time until noon on Saturday to respond to the Jirga’s demands.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid also confirmed this, telling reporters after the meeting that the next round of talks would be held today (Saturday).
The meeting with militant leaders followed a similar engagement in Khyber’s Tirah valley, where a Jirga from the Bar Qambarkhel tribe had called upon TTP commanders to quit the area.
That meeting had also had a similar outcome — with the militants seeking time to consult their leadership in Afghanistan.
Bajaur scouts
A separate Jirga held at the Bajaur Scouts headquarters in Khar, said the peace-loving people of Bajaur stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps to restore peace in the region.
According to the statement issued by the Bajaur Scouts, local lawmakers and senior officials of the security forces, district administration, and police were also in attendance in the jirga, which aimed to finalise a result-oriented strategy to establish durable peace and stability in the district.
Addressing the participants, Frontier Corps (North) Inspector General Major General Rao Imran Sirtaj said that anti-terrorism operations are aimed at establishing long-lasting peace and normalcy in the district, with the goal of enabling the people of the region to live in a peaceful environment conducive to progress and prosperity.

“We have received directives from the home department to launch a fresh drive to repatriate all Afghans… in a respectful and orderly manner,” Meharullah, a senior government official in Quetta, the capital of Balo­chistan province, told AFP.
On Friday, there were “around 4,000 to 5,000 people at the Chaman border” waiting to return, said Habib Bingalzai, a senior government official in Chaman.
Abdul Latif Hakimi, the head of Refugee Registration in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province across the border, said they were aware of an increase in returning Afghans on Friday.

Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Tali­ban government in 2021.
A deportation drive first launched in 2023 was renewed in April when the government rescinded hun­dreds of thousands of residence permits for Afghans, warning them of arrests if they did not leave.
Analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to control militancy in the border regions.
In total, more than a million Afghans have left Paki­stan since 2023, incl­uding more than 200,000 since April this year.
The campaign targeted the more than 800,000 Afghans with temporary residence permits, some of whom were born in Pakistan or have lived here for decades.
However, many Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, with the result that the deportation drive has widespread support.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afgh­anistan, battling a growing insurgency in parts of Khy­ber Pakh­tunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade and the government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks.
Iran has launched a similar large-scale deportation campaign of Afghans, which has seen more than 1.5 million sent back across the border.

The incident occurred within the limits of Haripur’s City Police Station on Wednesday, and a first information report (FIR) was lodged upon the victim’s complaint under Sections 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) and 375A (gang rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Shaukat Ali, a muharrar at the police station, told Dawn.com: “One suspect has been arrested and raids are underway to apprehend the other two.
“The victim said in his statement that he had struck up a friendship with a girl, who called him from Abbottabad to meet her in Haripur.”
The FIR said that when the young man reached the location where he was called, “three men caught me and beat me up. They took me to one side of the orchard by gunpoint and then forcibly took off my clothes, forcing themselves upon me turn by turn while the third person was recording videos of the ordeal.”
The complainant said the culprits also took away his mobile phone, gifts he brought for the girl and Rs35,000 in cash.
Earlier this week, Bahawalnagar police claimed to have busted a honey-trap gang allegedly involved in the kidnapping, torture, extortion and murder of teenagers by misusing TikTok profiles of female university students and arrested three of its members.
The investigation team told Dawn.com that a 19-year-old boy was lured and later killed by the gang. The investigation led to the arrest of the gang’s suspected ringleader.
The gang reportedly used the TikTok IDs of various university girls to lure young victims. Investigators said the suspects first gained the trust of these students and then misused their social media identities.</p><small>2025-08-01 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/012328203ba953c.jpg?r=232831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928066/kasim-says-trump-can-make-a-difference-on-imrans-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Kasim says Trump ‘can make a difference’ on Imran’s situation</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons on Friday said that United States President Donald Trump was a figure who “can make a difference” in their incarcerated father’s situation.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Last month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said they would go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.
In an interview on ‘Piers Morgan Uncensored’ aired today, Kasim was questioned on whether he had any message for Trump, to which he said: “If anyone can make a difference, he (Trump) can.”
Kasim said the two had met Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release on X.
“We know that Trump has a great relationship with our father and vice versa.  They had great conversations when they were both in office and they seem to have mutual respect for one another.
“If Trump was able to make a statement or in any way speak to the establishment over there [in Pakistan] to get our father released, I know he’s one of the few people who can, so of course we would love to kind of have a conversation with him or hope for some help from him or support.”
 


Sulaiman said it had been three years since he last met his father and four months since he spoke to him. Kasim said the experience had been “brutal” for the two since they used to regularly speak to him.
Kasim said the two were not ones to publicly speak out, but were now getting “desperate” after having gone so long without any contact with their father.
“When we floated the idea of going, we were told by people in the Pakistani government that we would be arrested and from other people, we heard, you know, we had warnings from family members, inside sources, all sorts of people saying similar [things]. So we’ve still tried to get our visas. We are still looking to go at some point. We’ve applied for our visas but we haven’t had our responses yet. We’ll see what happens.”
Sulaiman said the two were “doing everything we can” to help their father from abroad if they could not go to Pakistan. He added that the two had not yet spoken to anyone in the UK government on the matter.
In their message to state authorities, Sulaiman said: “ Respect democracy, first of all. Respect the will of the Pakistani people which was clear despite huge rigging in the general election in February last year and respect the rule of law and give him a proper, fair trial.“
Kasim said the two were prepared for being arrested upon going to Pakistan. “We’ve been attempting to go for a little while. We’re looking through whatever we can. So what will be, will be. We’ll see what happens. But we 100 per cent will be going at some point, whether he likes it or not,” he added.
Aleema had previously said that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”. “If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she had told reporters.
Earlier this week, the PTI swiftly rubbished media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s sons, Chaudhry previously questioned what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them. He continued that visas would be issued to them “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.
Visa applications awaiting interior ministry’s approval
Earlier, Aleema said the two had applied for their Pakistani visas and were awaiting approval from the interior ministry ahead of their visit to the country.
In a post on X, she said: “A few days ago, Suleiman and Kasim applied for their visas with the Pakistan High Commission in London. The ambassador has intimated that he is awaiting approval from the Ministry of Interior in Islamabad.”
 






Responding to Aleema’s post, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry called her out for her previous assertion that the siblings had a  Nicop, questioning why they would need visas if that was the case.
“If they do need visas, that means they are not ‘Pakistani nationals’. What is the real truth behind it all?”

“As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG said. “Both father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.”
The DIG added that during the preliminary investigation, it transpired that a complainant nominated the slain advocate in a murder case, while in a later incident, Islam sustained injuries in Clifton.
Elaborating on the cases, DIG Raza recalled that in 2021, the complainant filed a first information report (FIR) with Boat Basin police against six to seven unidentified suspects for allegedly killing his father.
“The complainant also attempted to nominate Khawaja Shamsul Islam, but he failed to provide evidence. Thus, the case was disposed of as ‘A’ Class (untraced) by Investigation DSP Clifton division Jahanzaib Khan,” the DIG told Dawn.com.
Regarding the second incident, which occurred in 2024, the DIG said that the complainant, another advocate, filed an FIR alleging that while heading for Isha prayers with Khawaja Shamsul Islam in Zamzama neighbourhood of Karachi, they were “ambushed by the complainant in the first case along with 15-20 armed accomplices”.
“The attackers used firearms, iron rods and sticks, injuring Khawaja Shamsul Islam,” he alleged, adding that the attackers had gathered outside the mosque.
DIG Raza pointed out that a preliminary investigation of last year’s attack was conducted by Inspector Maqbool Meher and some suspects were also arrested by the police. However, the case was later transferred to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU)/Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Karachi as an “extortion matter”.
The official elaborated that one police security guard had been provided to Islam.
“Incidentally, the poilce guard was outside the mosque at the time of the attack. The lawyer and his son were targeted inside the mosque.”
The DIG added that the private security guards of the mosque have been detained for questioning.
The body of the slain lawyer was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities. Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the advocate sustained “firearm injury to his chest, damaging vital organs and leading to irreversible hemorrhagic shock”.
The DIG has constituted a special team under the supervision of the South SSP to arrest the people, who murdered the advocate and injured his son.
The official said the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.
In a statement issued today, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members will not appear before any court on August 2 (Saturday) to express their solidarity with the slain senior laywer.
In April this year, a judge and a lawyer were shot dead in an armed attack on the motorway in Nowshera district.
Nowshera Deputy Commissioner Irfanullah Mehsud told Dawn.com that one of the slain, Mohammad Hayat, was working as a civil judge in Mardan and belonged to the Swat district.
“The other person was identified as Khalid Khan, a lawyer, belonging to Rustam area of Mardan, who was accompanying the judge.”
Mehsud said that they died on the spot and the bodies were moved to Qazi Hussain Ahmed Medical Complex.</p><small>2025-08-01 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0121473840daac7.png?r=214914' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928087/at-least-29-hurt-as-islamabad-express-derails-near-kala-shah-kaku-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>At least 29 hurt as Islamabad Express derails near Kala Shah Kaku: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least 29 people were injured as the Islamabad Express passenger train derailed near Kala Shah Kaku in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district on Friday, with rescue services completing their search operation.
According to Punjab Rescue 1122, five bogies of the train were derailed near a chemical plant in the Kala Shah Kaku area, with the control room receiving reports around 7:32pm.
The rescue service later said that 22 people were administered first aid at the scene of the incident, while seven were transported to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Muridke for treatment.
“Two people were trapped in the bogies, but they have been rescued and moved to the hospital,” the statement read. “One of them sustained hip injuries.
“The initial rescue operation has been completed and there is no information about anyone being killed in the accident yet,” it added.
An earlier statement quoting Punjab Rescue Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed read: “Six emergency vehicles and 25 rescuers were immediately dispatched to start the rescue operation. Most of the passengers suffered scratches, bruises and skin injuries.”
 






On July 28, three coaches of the Jaffar Express train were derailed near Shikarpur following an explosion on the tracks, leaving one person injured.
Sukkur Railways Divisional Superintendent Jamshaid Alam said that the Jaffar Express was travelling from Peshawar to Quetta when it was caught in the explosion near Sultanpur.
“Following the blast, train operations have been suspended,” Alam said, adding that passengers “faced serious difficulties due to the train’s derailment”.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that Railways Minister Muhammad Hanif Abbasi took notice of the derailment and directed the Railways CEO and the divisional superintendent to reach the scene and oversee the situation.
The minister also ordered a detailed inquiry into the accident and instructed that a report be submitted within seven days.
On July 29, the Ministry of Railways said that the train was derailed due to a technical fault and not an explosion, adding that local residents thought the sound of the derailed train was an explosion.
It said an unfamiliar terrorist outfit “took advantage of the incident” and falsely labelled it as an “armed attack” and claimed responsibility. “This claim is not only baseless, but also tantamount to an example of opportunism and irrelevance.”</p><small>2025-08-01 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01204751df181e4.png?r=211144' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928075/opposition-alliance-calls-for-grand-national-dialogue-between-political-parties-new-charter-of-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance calls for grand national dialogue between political parties, new charter of democracy</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday called for a grand dialogue between all political parties of the country and a new charter of democracy between them.
The TTAP had held its multi-party conference on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue in Islamabad, forcing them to relocate. The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall.
The coalition of six opposition parties formed last year, had formalised its organisational structure last month and declared blanket support for all anti-government protests.
Addressing a press conference today on the second day of the conference held at his farmhouse, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar presented the alliance’s resolution.
“The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” the resolution read, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
 


“As a result of the constant attacks of the hybrid system, the Constitution of Pakistan, the human rights given in it from Articles 8 to 11, and the parliamentary democratic system have become meaningless and today the social contract between the people and the state has been shattered.
“Therefore, for the new charter, a complete consensus should be reached among all the political forces in the country after a national dialogue.”
The TTAP said that political consensus was needed on the following aspects: supremacy of the Constitution and Parliament, rule of law, independence of the judiciary, appointment of a free and independent Election Commission and fair elections, the situation in Balochistan, the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, inter-provincial relations and water distribution, inter-relations of political parties and investigation of all illegal administrative actions, freedom of the media, rights of women and minorities and international relations.
 






Criticising yesterday’s events, the TTAP strongly condemned the conference’s cancellation at the Islamabad hotel by the administration and declared that this action was a blow to the constitutional and legal rights of citizens.
“The APC expressed deep concern over the current constitutional, political and economic situation of the country. Today, no class or nationality living in the country is satisfied, the farmers are devastated, the salaried class is under the burden of taxes and the business class is leaving the country and transferring its capital abroad.
“The poverty rate in the country has increased to an alarming level and currently about 45 per cent of Pakistan is forced to live below the poverty line and the purchasing power of the middle class has decreased by 58pc. The unemployment rate has reached an alarming level of 22pc, while the same rate among the youth is more than 30pc.
“This has never been the case in the history of Pakistan. All the participating parties of the conference decided that a comprehensive and common strategy is needed to bring the country out of the current channels,” the resolution stated.
The alliance demanded an end to the “wave of fascism and political manipulation” in the country.
It also condemned the “unjust imprisonment” of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, demanding their early release and immediate appointment of their pending cases in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Court for immediate hearing.
The opposition moot also lashed out at the recent sentencing against scores of PTI leaders and workers, including the National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, saying yesterday was a “dark day in the political and democratic history of Pakistan in this regard and it once again shows that this hybrid system wants the complete elimination of the opposition in the country”.
On constitutional supremacy, the alliance criticised the recent amendments made to the Constitution and called for their removal. The moot also called for the dismantling of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, alleging that the rights and resources of the provinces were usurped through it.
Regarding the rule of law, the TTAP said that corruption in civil institutions and “undue and illegal interference by political and defence institutions” had led to a loss of public trust and undermining of professional capabilities, which was causing a deterioration in the situation of law and order in the country.
“While the justice system needs reforms, the concept of the rule of law has been severely shaken as a result of interference in the justice system, which needs to be corrected and the public’s trust restored.”
In particular, the moot said that the independence of the judiciary was reduced to a mere slogan after the 26th amendment and “kangaroo courts are now busy only in the work of cleaning up the houses of the powerful”.
The TTAP said there was an urgent need to completely abolish the 26th amendment, take direct steps to prevent all interference in the judiciary and devise an uncontroversial system of appointment of judges to purify the judiciary and restore the reputation of the institution.
“The letter of six judges of the Islamabad High Court has opened the floodgates for the demands of judicial independence in Pakistan. These judges are the heroes of the Pakistani people and we strongly condemn the actions taken against them and fully support their stand,” the alliance said, referring to the letter written by six IHC judges alleging institutional interference and pressure in judicial work.
On the security situation in Balochistan and KP, the moot said the prevailing conditions in the former were a wound for the country that needed to be urgently addressed.
“The first right to the province of Balochistan and its resources belongs to its residents … We demand that the illegally missing persons across Pakistan and especially in Balochistan be immediately brought to justice. The illegal private militias present across Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and KP, who are backed by the authorities, should be immediately dismantled and the policy of extrajudicial killings should be immediately stopped and the right to a fair trial given in the Constitution should not be deviated from in any way.
“Political prisoners, including Dr Mahrang Baloch, should be released in full. Only civil law enforcement agencies should be given responsibility for maintaining law and order. Also, immediate steps should be taken to eliminate the harassment of Baloch students studying in educational institutions across Pakistan in the name of law and order and to eliminate the hateful prejudice against them,” the resolution said.
Responding to the conference, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed it as a rote development to sabotage the economy whenever important diplomatic events were due, such as the upcoming visit of the Iranian president.

“I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
“Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.”
 


Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.
The United States and Russia control the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weaponry, and Washington keeps nuclear-armed submarines on patrol as part of its so-called nuclear triad of land, sea and air-launched weapons.
Trump and Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, traded taunts in recent days after Trump on Tuesday said Russia had “10 days from today” to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit, along with its oil buyers, with tariffs.
Moscow, which has set out its own terms for peace in Ukraine, has shown no sign that it will comply with Trump’s deadline.
Medvedev on Monday accused Trump of engaging in a “game of ultimatums” and reminded him that Russia possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump told Medvedev to “watch his words”.
 






In response to a post by US Senator Lindsey Graham reiterating America’s seriousness to reach a peace deal, the former Russian president wrote: “It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’. Negotiations will end when all the objectives of our military operation have been achieved.
“Work on America first, gramps!”
 






Medvedev has emerged as one of the Kremlin’s most outspoken anti-Western hawks since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022. Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, though some Western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin policy-making circles.
Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow hoped for more peace talks with Ukraine but that the momentum of the war was in its favour, signalling no shift in his stance despite a looming sanctions deadline from Washington.
Trump has said he will impose new sanctions on Moscow and countries that buy its energy exports — of which the biggest are China and India — unless Russia moves by August 8 to end the three-and-a-half-year war.
Trump has expressed mounting frustration with Putin, accusing him of “bullshit” and describing Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine as “disgusting”.
Putin, without referring to the Trump deadline, said three sessions of peace talks with Ukraine had yielded some positive results, and Russia was expecting negotiations to continue.

“As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule,” he said.
“But in order to approach the issue peacefully, it is necessary to conduct detailed conversations. And not in public, but this must be done calmly, in the quiet of the negotiation process.”
He said Russian troops were attacking Ukraine along the entire front line and that the momentum was in their favour, citing the announcement by his defence ministry on Thursday that Moscow’s forces had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar after a 16-month battle.
Ukraine denied that Chasiv Yar was under full Russian control.
Kyiv has, for months, been urging an immediate ceasefire, but Russia says it wants a final and durable settlement, not a pause. Since the peace talks began in Istanbul in May, it has conducted some of its heaviest air strikes of the war, especially on the capital Kyiv.
The Ukrainian government has said the Russian negotiators do not have the mandate to make significant decisions and that President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Putin to meet him for talks.
“We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,” Zelensky said on Friday on X, reiterating his call for direct talks between him and Putin.
“The United States has proposed this. Ukraine has supported it. What is needed is Russia’s readiness.” Russia says a leaders’ meeting could only take place to set the seal on agreements reached by negotiators.
 






Ukraine and its European allies have frequently said they do not believe Putin is really interested in peace and have accused him of stalling, which the Kremlin denies.
“I will repeat once again, we need a long and lasting peace on good foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and ensure the security of both countries,” Putin said, adding that this was also a question of European security.
Putin was speaking alongside his ally Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, at talks on an island in Lake Ladoga that is the site of a famous Russian monastery.
Russian TV earlier showed the two men greeting monks at the Valaam Monastery, where they have met several times before, and holding candles during the chanting of prayers.
Ukrainians mourn 31 killed in Russian strike on Kyiv
Meanwhile, Ukrainian rescuers recovered more than a dozen more bodies from the rubble of a collapsed apartment block in Kyiv overnight, bringing the death toll from Russia’s worst air strike of the year on Ukraine’s capital to 31.
A two-year-old was among the five children found dead after Thursday’s sweeping Russian drone and missile attack, Zelensky said on Friday, announcing the end of a more than 24-hour-long rescue operation.
A total of 159 people were wounded in the multi-wave strike, in which Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles early on Thursday, the latest in a campaign of fierce strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities.

The worst damage was to an apartment building that partially collapsed in the Sviatoshyn district in western Kyiv. Damage was also reported in at least three other districts of the capital.
Natalia Matviyenko, 65, sitting near the damaged apartment building, said she did not place much faith in Trump’s tough rhetoric.
“Trump just says, ‘I’m upset with President Putin’s behaviour.’ And what? No results,” she said.
The US leader, who returned to power on a pledge to swiftly end the war, has in recent weeks rolled back his earlier conciliatory approach toward Moscow and signalled openness to arming Ukraine.
But a diplomatic effort to end the war has stalled, with Moscow not backing down from what Kyiv and its allies describe as maximalist demands.
‘Will Putin listen?’
On Friday, mourners laid flowers and lit candles at the wrecked apartment block, where rumbling excavators hoisted heavy pieces of rubble. The makeshift shrine included brightly coloured stuffed animals.
Oksana Kinal, 43, who was placing flowers to honour a co-worker who had been killed alongside a son, said she hoped Trump would follow up on his threat but also expressed doubt.
“I think America has a lot of points of leverage that can be used against Russia,” she said. “But will Putin listen to this? I don’t know.”
Kyiv’s air force said on Friday that Ukrainian air defences had destroyed more than 6,000 drones and missiles across the country in July alone.
“The world possesses every instrument required to ensure Russia is brought to justice,” Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on X on Friday. “What is lacking is not power but will.”

However, the image is fake and no such post was shared.
On Wednesday, Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India from August 1, along with an unspecified penalty for buying Russian weapons and oil, potentially straining relations with the world’s most populous democracy. He also declared the Indian economy dead in the water.
The US decision singled out India more severely than other major trading partners, and threatened to unravel months of talks between the two countries, undermining a key strategic partner of Washington and a counterbalance to China.
Today, an X user, who seems to be Indian from previous posts, shared an image allegedly showing a post by Trump on Truth Social with the caption: “Disgruntled lover.”
The post in the image stated: “So hard to believe that Prime Minister Modi still hasn’t responded to my tweets, statements, or tariff concerns. We gave India so much — great deals, defence support, big crowds — and yet, total silence. Not even a thank you!
“Don’t forget — I’m the one who got India and Pakistan to declare a ceasefire. Nobody else could do that. Many people said I should’ve gotten the Nobel Prize for it!! India continues to benefit while American workers suffer. I’ve always liked Modi, but this kind of disrespect will NOT be forgotten. Bad for business. Bad for friendship.”
The image, shared at 9:47am, also claimed that Trump’s post was shared and liked by several users on Truth Social.
The post on X gained 68,800 views.
The same image was also shared by other Indian accounts on X, as can be seen here, here, here and here, gathering 295,400, 21,300, 144,600 and 293,700 views, respectively.
The image was also widely shared across WhatsApp groups.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in new trade measures taken by the US and how they impact bilateral relations with India.
Reviewing the image via fake image detection tools, such as Fake Image Detector, showed that it flagged it as being “computer-generated or modified”, while another version of the tool said the authenticity of the image was 32 per cent.
 


 


Checking Trump’s account on Truth Social — which is used by the US president for various announcements — yielded no such posts.
Similarly, no such posts were shared on his X handle as well.
Going through the archives of Trump’s X handle also showed that no such posts were deleted.
A reverse image and keyword search yielded no credible news reports from international, American or Indian media outlets regarding the alleged post on Truth Social.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral image shows US President Donald Trump’s angry rant against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a post on Truth Social is false. The image is fake and doctored.

In June, there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.
These attacks injured 189 people, comprising 126 security personnel and 63 civilians — marking an eight per cent decrease in attacks, a 12pc drop in fatalities, and 4pc increase in injuries compared to May 2025.
Friday’s report documented 82 militant attacks across the country during July, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries. According to a Picss statement, those killed in militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.
“Security forces intensified their counter-militancy operations, killing 106 militants and arresting 69 suspected operatives during the same period,” the statement read, noting that these operations also claimed the lives of seven civilians.
Picss noted that the country saw the lowest monthly toll in actions initiated by security forces, with only one of them losing their life. However, 36 security personnel were killed in militant attacks in July.
“In total, militant attacks and subsequent security operations accounted for 215 deaths in July, comprising 124 militants, 54 civilians, and 37 security personnel, while 199 people were injured, including 107 civilians, 56 security personnel, 35 militants, and one peace committee member,” the think tank said.
“The militants also kidnapped at least 14 individuals during the month.”
A comparative analysis by Picss showed a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June 2025. However, fatalities among security forces dropped by 32pc, while civilian deaths increased by 21pc. Militant casualties surged by 49pc.
The report highlighted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.
Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, while no militant incidents were reported from Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir or the Islamabad Capital Territory. However, one attack was recorded in the Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
The government labelled the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the menace posed by the proscribed Fitna-al-Hindustan, Fitna-al-Khawarij and other terrorist outfits to the country.
According to a statement from his office, the prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” in the war against terrorism and made “full and effective use” of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.
He directed the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement their recommendations.
In March, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc from 2024 to 1,081.</p><small>2025-08-01 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0120014396c5692.jpg?r=200208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928071/pakistan-afghanistan-uae-to-play-t20i-tri-series-in-sharjah' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan, UAE to play T20I tri-series in Sharjah</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will participate in a tri-series of Twenty20 international matches to tune up for next month’s Asia Cup, followed by the Twenty20 World Cup next year, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.
A press release by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme confirmed that a 10-month-old boy from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district was confirmed as the 11th polio case from KP this year, bringing the country’s total number of cases in 2025 to 18. Last year, 74 cases were reported nationwide.
“The continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent threat to children, particularly in areas with low vaccine acceptance,” the press release said. “It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can re-emerge wherever immunity gaps persist.”
It added that every unvaccinated child remained vulnerable and could also contribute to the spread of the virus.
The press release pointed out that the only effective protection for polio — a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis — was through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
Despite “significant improvements” in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the laboratory said that southern districts of KP remained a key area of concern due to restricted access and operational challenges in house-to-house vaccination, leaving “thousands of children unvaccinated”.
According to the press release, six campaigns, including four nationwide, have each reached over 45 million children since September 2024.
It added that the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) plans to conduct two nationwide and one sub-national campaign between August and December this year, as well as targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts, to help stop transmission and protect children from the virus.
 
 

As part of intensified efforts to eradicate polio in South KP, the prime minister’s Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and NEOC Coordinator retired Captain Anwarul Haq held a meeting with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah in Peshawar on Tuesday to review ongoing initiatives in the province.
The meeting focused on “campaign performance, current challenges, and targeted strategies to interrupt poliovirus transmission”, particularly in high-risk southern districts of KP, including Tank.
Farooq emphasised the need to “resolve persistent access barriers and ensure the uninterrupted presence and performance of frontline vaccinators in high-risk union councils”.
Meanwhile, Anwarul Haq presented a targeted strategy to improve the quality of campaigns and strengthen routine immunisation, particularly in southern KP.
 






The press release added, “A special planning meeting focused on South KP is scheduled to be held at the chief secretary’s office on August 2-3.”
The programme called polio eradication “a collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels”.
“While dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine,” it said.
“Communities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.”
It directed citizens to the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline at 1166 for information, as well as the Polio Helpline on WhatsApp at 0346-7776546.
Last Saturday, the NIH had confirmed three new polio cases in the country in KP and Sindh.
In June, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal claimed that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p><small>2025-08-01 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011749057fc5404.jpg?r=174940' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928046/sindh-high-court-suspends-order-removing-ke-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh High Court suspends order removing KE CEO</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday suspended an order by the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women removing K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi from his position over allegations of sexual harassment.
A day prior, the ombudsman ordered the removal of KE CEO Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.
Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, read the order issued by provincial ombudsman retired Justice Shahnawaz Tariq.
According to a petition Alvi filed with the SHC today — available with Dawn.com — his lawyers argued that Khan has neither levelled any allegations of “harassment of a sexual or physical nature” before the ombudsman, nor presented any evidence of gender discrimination within KE.
“There was no allegation that the petitioner, being in a position of authority, sought out any sexual favour, nor any gender based discrimination was alleged or could be made out as several women are holding high-level positions within the organisation,” the petition read.
“In the circumstances, the findings in the impugned order are flimsy, not sustainable and completely disproportionate. No hostile work environment was alleged or proved as a result of gender based discrimination nor as a result of harassment.”
The plea also noted: “The learned provincial ombudsman did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a trans-provincial organisation such as KE and so also did not have jurisdiction to take cognisance on a complaint filed by an ex-employee.”
In a court order issued today and seen by Dawn.com, the SHC said that as per the petitioner, KE was a “trans-provincial entity/establishment” and the provincial ombudsman had no jurisdiction to act upon the complaints, which should instead be addressed by the federal ombudsman.
The order said the “contention raised requires consideration” and said that notices be issued to the respondents, as well as the Sindh advocate general and deputy advocate general for August 8.
“Till the next date of hearing, [the] operation of the impugned decision will remain suspended,” the order read. It, however, ordered Alvi to deposit the Rs2.5 million penalty with the court’s nazir.
In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, KE Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security retired Colonel Wahid Asghar and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.
The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.
Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which would be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p><small>2025-08-01 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011750311d84ba4.jpg?r=175130' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928054/psx-crosses-141000-barrier-in-wake-of-us-trade-deal' target='_blank'><strong>PSX crosses 141,000 barrier in wake of US trade deal</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) crossed the 141,000 barrier on Friday on the back of a new trade deal with the United States and securing a lower tariff rate.

Having witnessed heavy selling pressure on Tuesday due to corporate earnings and political noise, the PSX had bounced back above the 139,000-mark yesterday, driven by the trade agreement with the US.

The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.

According to an executive order detailing the tariffs, it was announced that Pakistan is set to face a 19pc tariff rate as Trump’s tariff deadline comes to an end on August 1 (today).
The order listed higher import duty rates of 10 to 41pc starting in seven days for 69 trading partners as the 12:01am EDT (9:01am PKT) deadline approached.

What we know so far:

Pakistani goods exported to US to now be taxed 19pc as part of Trump’s global tariffs
The rate is lower than the proposed 29pc after trade talks with US
Finance ministry sees major opportunity to expand Pakistan’s footprint in US market
Official notes Pakistan ‘possibly only country’ offered investments alongside

Late on Wednesday night, a Pakistani delegation led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Washington, DC, finalised a trade agreement with the US, expected to lower tariffs, although no figure was announced. Trump also said Washington would help Islamabad develop “massive oil deposits”.
In its statement issued today, the finance ministry said the government was “pleased to announce the successful conclusion of tariff-related discussions” with the US.
 






“As per the outcome of these talks, a tariff of 19pc will be applicable for Pakistani exports to the US market,” it said.
The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.
“In particular, this tariff level is expected to support Pakistan’s export potential, especially in key sectors such as textiles, which remain the backbone of the country’s export economy,” the ministry highlighted.
 
 

In the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year (FY), exports to the US rose by 11.06pc to $5.552 billion from $4.999bn a year earlier. In FY24, Pakistan’s textiles exports to the US reached $5bn representing 92pc of its overall exports to that country.
The ministry said it belived that the current tariff arrangement presented a “significant opportunity to expand Pakistan’s footprint in the US market”. “It is now essential for Pakistani exporters and trade bodies to adopt an aggressive and focused marketing strategy to capitalise on this development,” it stressed.
The ministry also pointed out a “substantial potential for growth in other sectors”, affirming that the government was committed to facilitating exporters through policy support, market intelligence and trade promotion initiatives.
“The Government of Pakistan looks forward to further positive engagements and close cooperation with the United States in the areas of investment, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, mines & minerals, energy, and other emerging sectors.
“Pakistan will continue to engage closely with President Trump and the US administration to promote the shared goals of economic development and mutual prosperity,” the statement asserted.
 
 

It appreciated the “constructive engagement” of the US authorities and acknowledged the valuable role played by its team, including the commerce ministry and the Pakistan Mission in Washington DC, and other public and private sectors stakeholders.
In a recorded video statement, Aurangzeb said he and his team had a “very constructive final round of discussions” with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, which the “led to finalising the trade deal”.
“Trade and investment have to go hand in hand,” the finance czar stressed, adding that the “bilateral and strategic partnership has come up prominently”.
Giving insights on the process, the minister pointed out the private sector’s role as it was the “first constituent” to volunteer in helping to reduce the trade imbalance.
Terming it a “win-win situation” again for the future, Aurangzeb said: “I think we are in a good place today […] in terms of where we have arrived before August 1.”
 






Pakistan has emerged with the second-lowest tariff rate of any South Asian country. Afghanistan got hit with a 15pc levy, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam with 20pc, and India with 25pc.
CNN noted: “There is also satisfaction locally that Pakistan’s tariff rate is much lower than neighbour and arch-rival India’s. Fears in Islamabad that India was trying to isolate Pakistan financially have been somewhat tempered by the 25pc tariff rate that the Trump administration hit New Delhi with.”
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained its bullish momentum and crossed the 141,000-point barrier, despite dipping by as many as 433 points in the morning.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,644.56 points (1.18pc) to reach a intraday high of 141,160.93 points at 4:11pm, from the previous close of 139,390.42 points. It finally closed at 141,034.98 points.
Having witnessed heavy selling pressure on Tuesday due to corporate earnings and political noise, the PSX had bounced back above the 139,000-mark yesterday, driven by the trade agreement with the US.

Pakistan ‘possibly only country’ offered investments as well
Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted on X: “Pakistan is possibly the only country which the US has offered its investments as well, besides a competitive trade deal.”
He noted the “deal signals a strategic deepening of economic ties and shared growth”.
Speaking to Geo News, Schehzad expanded upon possible US investment in Pakistan’s energy sector, which he termed the “biggest area” in the economy.
“We need global partnerships in energy. We import 80-90pc of all our energy needs,” the finance minister’s adviser observed.
 


“If such an economy — a giant which has expertise in oil and gas — if they’re coming and talking about massively building oil and gas reserves, so we can export to the entire region, not just fulfil our own needs, this is a big development,” the adviser emphasised.
“If Pakistan make a deal with the US to set up big plants for exploration or machinery, we’ll get benefits in tariffs through that as well,” he added.
“The way Pakistan has been treated compared to different countries in this region, very encouraging and important,” Schehzad said, referring to the higher 25pc levy imposed on India.
While noting that the government’s role was to negotiate and secure a good deal, he called on the private sector to execute it through business-to-business, export contracts, and export engagement.
“The import bill can be reduced, the dollar can be impacted, overall employment generation, and GDP can be improved,” Schehzad highlighted.
He pointed out that the Pakistani companies, such as Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), were stakeholders in Balochistan’s Reko Diq mining project.
‘Failed to align sufficiently’
Trump set rates including a 35pc duty on many goods from Canada, 50pc for Brazil, 25pc for India, 20pc for Taiwan and 39pc for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Some of them had reached tariff-reducing deals; others had no opportunity to negotiate with his administration. Trump included an exception for some goods shipped within the coming week.
Goods from all other countries not listed would be subject to a 10pc US import tax. Trump had previously said that the rate might be higher.
The administration also teased that more trade deals were in the pipeline as it seeks to close trade deficits and boost domestic factories.
According to the executive order, if a trading partner fails to take “adequate steps” to address the tariffs or retaliates against the US, the commerce secretary and trade representative, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials, shall recommend additional action.
Facing a Friday deadline of his making, the Republican president has tapped emergency powers, pressured foreign leaders, and pressed ahead with trade policies that sparked a market sell-off when they were first announced in April.
 
 

This time, markets had a more muted reaction. Stocks and equity futures fell modestly in Friday morning trading in Asia.
Trump’s order said that some trading partners, “despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters”.
Other details are still to come, including on the “rules of origin” that will determine what products might face even higher tariffs.
Trump also said “we have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country”, and a US official later told reporters that they were still to be announced.
Canada, Mexico
Trump issued a separate order for Canada that raises the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35pc, from 25pc previously, saying Canada had “failed to cooperate” in curbing illicit narcotics flows into the US.
The higher tariffs on Canadian goods contrasted sharply with Trump’s decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30pc on many goods to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.
Trump complained to reporters earlier that Canada had “been very poorly led”.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was disappointed by Trump’s decision.
“While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong,” Carney said in a post on X.
 






US duties and tariffs will heavily affect lumber, steel, aluminium, and automobiles, he added, vowing action to protect Canadian jobs, buy Canadian goods, invest in industrial competitiveness and diversify export markets.
The extension for Mexico avoids a 30pc tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.
“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,” Sheinbaum wrote on X, adding that the Trump call was “very good”.
About 85pc of US imports from Mexico comply with the rules of origin outlined in the USMCA, shielding them from 25pc tariffs related to fentanyl, according to Mexico’s economy ministry.
 






Trump said the US would continue to levy a 50pc tariff on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper and a 25pc tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the US fentanyl crisis.
“Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non-Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, without providing details.
India discord
Goods from India appeared to be headed for a 25pc tariff after talks bogged down over access to India’s agriculture sector, drawing a higher-rate threat from Trump that also included an unspecified penalty for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Although negotiations with India were continuing, New Delhi vowed to protect the country’s labour-intensive farm sector, and the threat of higher rates from Trump triggered outrage from the opposition party and a slump in the rupee.
Without a deal, the rate will go into effect from Friday and single out India for harsher trade conditions than its major peers, potentially damaging the economy of a strategic US partner in Asia seen as a counterbalance to Chinese influence.

Trump’s rollout of higher import taxes comes amid more evidence they have begun driving up consumer goods prices.
Commerce Department data released on Thursday showed prices for home furnishings and durable household equipment jumped 1.3pc in June, the biggest gain since March 2022. Recreational goods and vehicles prices shot up 0.9pc, the most since February 2024. Prices for clothing and footwear rose 0.4pc.

Brazil slapped with 50pc tariff; China facing Aug 12 deadline
Trump hit Brazil’s exports on Wednesday with a steep 50pc tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America’s largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former president Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.
The run-up to Trump’s tariff deadline was unfolding as federal appeals court judges sharply questioned Trump’s use of a sweeping emergency powers law to justify his sweeping tariffs of up to 50pc on nearly all trading partners.
 
 

Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare an emergency over the growing US trade deficit and impose his “reciprocal” tariffs and a separate fentanyl emergency.
The Court of International Trade ruled in May that the actions exceeded his executive authority, and questions from judges during oral arguments before the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit in Washington indicated further scepticism.
Meanwhile, China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Trump’s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.

The car, a grey Honda City vehicle, was recovered from the Kak Bridge. Search teams found Qazi’s body last Friday, who was aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase 5.
The body of the colonel’s daughter, Muneba, however, has not been found yet. “The body of the girl who drowned in the floodwater will also be found soon,” District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah told Dawn.com.
The retired colonel and his daughter headed to the gate in their car, despite heavy rains and waterlogged streets.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station, “Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain.”

Iran’s IRNA news agency had reported on Wednesday that the Iranian president’s political adviser, Mehdi Sanai, had said Pezeshkian was due to visit Pakistan on Saturday for a two-day trip with discussions with “cultural and commercial elites” on the agenda.
In a statement today, the FO confirmed the development, saying the Iranian president “will pay a state visit to Pakistan on August 2-3, 2025” at Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s invitation.
Dr Pezeshkian will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, senior ministers and other high-ranking officials.
The FO said Dr Pezeshkian will meet President Zardari and also hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz.
“This marks Dr Pezeshkian’s first official visit to Pakistan as president of Iran. It may be recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last visited Iran on May 26, 2025. The visit is expected to further strengthen the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iran,” the FO said.
 






Pakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.
Pezeshkian will be the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. The visit was initially planned for the last week of July.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar previously said that President Pezeshkian would “soon” make an official visit to Islamabad, according to IRNA.
Speaking in an interview on the sidelines of his visit to New York, FM Dar had said Pezeshkian was scheduled to visit Pakistan and expressed hope the trip would take place in early August. “Pakistan supports diplomacy and a wise approach in the region and welcomes all efforts toward de-escalation and dialogue with Iran,” he was quoted as saying.
PM Shehbaz visited Iran on May 26 as part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India. He met Iranian leaders, including Pezeshkian, to strengthen ties and deepen regional cooperation.
He had previously visited Iran in May 2024 to attend the memorial ceremony of former president Raisi and met Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01163714f0b9872.png?r=164654' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928039/enduring-pak-china-partnership-to-keep-playing-pivotal-role-in-regional-stability-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Enduring Pak-China partnership to keep playing pivotal role in regional stability: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a press release by the military’s media affairs wing.
“He emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,” said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attaché Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.
COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army’s “pivotal role in China’s defence, security and nation-building”, the ISPR said.
 


The army chief emphasised that “despite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable”, according to the press release.
“The COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.
“The Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,” the statement added.
Concluding his address, COAS Munir “reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms”, the ISPR stated.
Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA’s 98th anniversary.
He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the “fight against terrorism and reaffirmed China’s unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan”, according to the ISPR.
 
 

Today’s renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir paid an official visit to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.
Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.
In recent weeks, both countries have strengthened their cooperation in maritime, agriculture, media, disaster management and various other fields.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01164349b9ca8ce.jpg?r=164831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928045/annual-inflation-accelerates-to-41pc-in-july-on-back-of-rising-food-fuel-costs' target='_blank'><strong>Annual inflation accelerates to 4.1pc in July on back of rising food, fuel costs</strong></a><br><p>Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday showed that consumer inflation accelerated to 4.1 per cent year-on-year in July, up from 3.2pc in June, driven by rising prices for food items, fuels and medicines.
July’s consumer price inflation month-on-month was 2.9pc, the bureau said.
The finance ministry on Monday had projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5pc, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.
The higher inflation reading follows the State Bank of Pakistan’s assessment of a deteriorating inflation outlook, leading it to leave the key interest rate unchanged at 11pc.
The bank’s monetary policy committee said on Wednesday that energy prices, particularly for gas, had risen more than expected, and it considered the real policy rate should be adequately positive to keep inflation in the 5-7pc target range.
Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index, had risen by 4.07pc week-on-week ending July 24, driven primarily by a sharp uptick in the retail prices of vegetables and petroleum products.
It marked the steepest weekly increase in recent times, primarily attributed to the surge in petroleum prices and their cascading impact on domestic costs. The government has significantly increased petroleum rates over the past month, which, alongside elevated transport fares, has escalated the cost of transporting perishable goods.
Pakistan is pushing through a series of economic reforms under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme, including a contractionary government budget passed in June that slashed spending to curb the fiscal deficit.</p><small>2025-08-01 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011049548eb6e7d.jpg?r=122159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927993/5-cops-martyred-after-katcha-bandits-attack-police-checkpoint-in-punjabs-rahim-yar-khan' target='_blank'><strong>5 cops martyred after Katcha bandits attack police checkpoint in Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan</strong></a><br><p>Five cops were martyred after bandits of the Katcha area attacked a police checkpoint in Rahim Yar Khan, a statement from the Punjab police said on Friday.
For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets that cripple local businesses, brutal killings and looting people on the major highways have become a daily reality.
According to a statement from the office of the Inspector General of Punjab, almost 40 bandits, using rocket launchers and grenades, attacked the Sheikhani police picket in the Katcha area, situated between Chowk Sewetra and Chowk Mahi near the Guddu-Kashmore Road on Thursday night.
“During the attack, policemen of Elite Force, including Muhammad Irfan, Muhammad Saleem and Nukhail of Bahawalnagar, together with Khalil and Ghazanfar of Rahim Yar Khan, were martyred,” the statement said, adding that a bandit was also killed when the police retaliated.
Following the sudden attack, police started a search operation against the bandits in the area, it added.
Inspector General (IG) Punjab Police Dr Usman Anwar took notice of the incident and sought a report from the regional police officer, Bahawalpur.
“IG Usman also instructed the Rahim Yar Khan District Police Officer, Irfan Ali Sammon, to immediately arrest the bandits involved in the attack,” the statement added.
The funeral prayers of martyred policemen were to be offered at Rahim Yar Khan police lines at 2:30pm today, it added.
Last month, different dacoit gangs of the Katcha area, through their social media posts and videos, had directly challenged the writ of the police and claimed that they would target them. As seen in the videos, the dacoits were equipped with the latest, sophisticated weapons, per the statement.
Per the statement, the bandits had recently attacked stone-carrying trucks near the Hajipur area to extort money from the owner of the trucks. Similarly, area locals complained that several bandit gangs still had complete control over different islands of the Indus River.
In March, three people were shot at and killed by dacoits in the Jamaldin Wali area of tehsil Sadiqabad near the Indus River to avenge the murder of a YouTuber dacoit.
In January, three members of the Hindu community from Chowk Sawetra area near Bhong were allegedly kidnapped by dacoits of Katcha area.</p><small>2025-08-01 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011351331da54f7.jpg?r=135154' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021/glacier-burst-kills-one-in-gbs-bagrot-govt-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>Glacier burst kills one in GB’s Bagrot: govt spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>A glacier burst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person on Friday, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.
A glacial burst, or glacial lake outburst flood (Glof), refers to an outburst of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream. Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
GB’s government spokesperson, Faizullah Faraq, said that the father and son had fallen into a ravine and been buried under the debris of the Bagrot glacier as it burst, injuring both.
“Locals and Rescue 1122 saved the father while the son was killed,” he said.
Former member of the Bagrot Valley Assembly, Captain (retd) Muhammad Shafi, said that the father and son had been travelling on foot on the glacier in Barchi village when it collapsed.
“The father was rescued after several hours of efforts by the rescue team, but the son could not be rescued alive,” he said, adding that the father was transported to the hospital.
According to local journalist Imtiaz Gulab Bagoro, the father and son were from Balchi village. They were heading from Gargo village to Barchi village when the glacier collapsed.
He said that the father and son were rescued after 10 hours, while Gilgit Rescue 1122 reported that the rescue took eight hours.
The rescue team added that the son’s body had been moved to his native village of Balchi.
According to Faraq, new flash floods had “wreaked havoc in every direction” in the Khanbari area of Diamer district.
 
 

“Floods in Khanbari have destroyed people’s standing crops, lands and water channels,” he said, adding that floods were continuing across the province.
The Bagrot Valley has been a victim of climate change for the past several years, with many Glofs affecting the population.
According to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), several glacial lakes have formed in the valley.
To reduce the risks of these glacial lakes, NGOs have planted hundreds of trees in the Bagrot Valley and built protective walls with foreign aid. Early warning systems have been installed at several places in GB to inform the population about the flood situation due to climate change.
Safdar Ali, who is in charge of the information department of the Glof project, said that 200 early warning stations had been established in 16 valleys to protect the human population from flood waves due to climate change, of which 147 stations were active.
According to him, the early warning system had reported the danger in the Hassanabad nullah, but “since there was no major threat to the population, the practice of repeatedly sounding the siren did not continue”.
Ali said that the data of the early warning system was being transferred to the meteorological department, based on which weather alerts were being issued.
In June, the National Disaster Management Authority’s Nat­ional Emergencies Ope­ration Centre issued a Glof alert for northern areas, including GB, citing a dangerous combination of persistent high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents and a prevailing westerly wave.
The same month, three members of a family, including a man and his teenage son, were buried alive in a glacial slide while taking pictures at Sohni Waterfall near Naran.
Last year in August, a glacial lake outburst hit a village in Upper Chitral district, displacing 30 families.</p><small>2025-08-01 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011324402248097.jpg?r=133537' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928031/israel-sharpens-travel-warning-for-israelis-in-uae-cites-terror-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Israel sharpens travel warning for Israelis in UAE, cites terror threat</strong></a><br><p>Israel is evacuating most of its diplomatic mission staff in the United Arab Emirates after Israel’s National Security Council sharpened its travel warning for Israelis staying in the Gulf country.
The UAE’s Israeli and Jewish community has grown more visible since 2020, when the UAE became the most prominent Arab state in 30 years to establish formal ties with Israel under a US-brokered agreement dubbed the Abraham Accords.
“We are emphasising this travel warning given our understanding that terrorist organisations (the Iranians, Hamas, Hezbollah and Global Jihad) are increasing their efforts to harm Israel”, the NSC said in a statement.
“They are driven by heightened motivation to exact revenge following Operation Rising Lion, in addition to the anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian incitement which has intensified since the start of Operation Iron Swords, and even more so in response to Hamas’ starvation campaign,” it said, using the names for its military assaults on Iran and Gaza.
The NSC statement said “past experience” has taught Israel that “terrorist organisations often focus their efforts in neighbouring countries” and warned of possible attempts to target Israeli and Jewish individuals in the UAE, especially around Jewish holidays and Shabbat.
The NSC’s travel alert for the UAE — which remains unchanged at level III — strongly advises against non-essential travel and urges Israeli citizens to “seriously reconsider” visiting the Gulf state.
The Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There was no immediate comment from the UAE’s foreign ministry.
Israel is concerned about retaliatory attacks following its recent military operation against Iran and as it faces mounting international pressure over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
In March, the UAE sentenced three people to death for the murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who was killed in November in the Gulf country. Such crimes are rare in the UAE, which is largely viewed as one of the safest places in the Middle East.</p><small>2025-08-01 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01110256ef4b188.png?r=110320' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928002/pakistan-to-get-first-us-oil-shipment-as-cnergyico-seals-import-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to get first US oil shipment as Cnergyico seals import deal</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s largest refiner Cnergyico will import 1 million barrels of oil from Vitol in October, its Vice Chairman Usama Qureshi told Reuters on Friday, marking the country’s first-ever purchase of US crude following a landmark trade deal.
The West Texas Intermediate light crude cargo will be loaded from Houston this month and is expected to arrive in Karachi in the second half of October, Qureshi said.
“This is a test spot cargo under our umbrella term agreement with Vitol. If it is commercially viable and available, we could import at least one cargo per month,” he said, adding that the shipment was not meant for resale.
The deal follows months of multiple negotiations, which first began in April, he said, after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 29pc tariffs on imports from Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan hailed a trade deal struck with the US, its top export market, and said the agreement would increase investments. The White House said on Thursday the US will charge a 19pc tariff on imports from Pakistan.
Qureshi said Pakistan’s finance and petroleum ministries encouraged local refineries to explore US crude imports after the April tariff announcement.
Vitol did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of office hours.
A key China ally, Pakistan has been warming up to Trump after he threatened tariffs. It has credited US diplomatic intervention for ending recent hostilities with neighbouring India and nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Oil is Pakistan’s biggest import item, and its shipments were valued at $11.3 billion in the year ended June 30, 2025, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s total import bill.
The import deal will help Pakistan diversify its crude sourcing and reduce reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, who account for nearly all of its oil imports.
“Gross refining margin is on par with Gulf grades, and no blending or refinery tweaks are required,” Qureshi said.
Cnergyico can process 156,000 barrels of crude per day and operates the country’s only single-point mooring terminal near Karachi, enabling it to handle large tankers, unlike other refiners in Pakistan.
The company plans to install a second offshore terminal to allow larger or more frequent shipments, and to upgrade its refinery over the next five to six years, Qureshi said.
The refiner, which has been operating at an average refinery run rate of 30 to 35pc due to tepid local demand, is betting on growth in demand for oil products.
“We expect run rates to rise as domestic demand strengthens and local production is prioritised over imported fuels,” Qureshi said.
Trump said on Wednesday the US would also cooperate with Pakistan to develop the South Asian country’s “massive oil reserves”, without providing further details.</p><small>2025-08-01 06:35</small></div><hr>
