He expressed these views during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change, which was chaired by PPP Senator Sherry Rehman and focused on the management of paper mulberry trees and ecological restoration in Islamabad.
Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in Islamabad, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. Islamabad’s CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed as they had been causing pollen allergies. WWF-Pakistan had also disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development.
During the briefing on Thursday, the state minister shared the National Institute of Health’s data in connection with mitigating Islamabad’s severe seasonal pollen crisis.
According to Malik, cases of pollen allergy declined from over 2,300 in 2023 to 1,031 in 2025, while overall allergy prevalence in Islamabad fell from 45.8 per cent in 2023 to 33.3pc in 2025.
This, he said, indicated a reduced per capita risk of pollen allergy despite population growth.
Malik said that the invasive paper mulberry, the scientific name for which is broussonetia papyrifera, was a non-native species and was introduced in Islamabad between the 1960s and 1980s.
“It now accounts for approximately 94pc of Islamabad’s total pollen burden,” the minister added.
He further said that the federal capital faced a “critical pollen crisis” for more than two decades, with total pollen count reaching an unprecedented 82,000 grains per cubic meter of air in 2022.
Pollen from paper mulberry, he said, posed “exceptional health risks due to its lightweight particles, which penetrate deep into the lungs and trigger severe allergic rhinitis, acute asthma exacerbations, and life-threatening status asthmaticus (acute asthma)”.
In this connection, the minister highlighted the importance of the ecological restoration programme for re-planting native species of trees in Islamabad.
He termed the initiative a vital public health intervention and said it was projected to reduce respiratory allergies in the capital by over 40pc, significantly easing seasonal burden on hospitals and emergency departments.
Meanwhile, he continued, to prevent the “aggressive re-sprouting [of paper mulberry trees], the ministry, in coordination with the Capital Development Authorty (CDA), is implementing a strict three-step eradication protocol involving cutting, complete uprooting of the root system, and soil compaction”.
“Of the approximately 80,000 paper mulberry trees identified for removal across Islamabad, 29,115 have been cleared to date, with priority given to high-density areas including F-9 Park and Shakarparian,” he said.
Moreover, the committee was informed that ecological restoration remained central to the initiative.
The minister further said that under the restoration policy, three indigenous trees were being planted for every paper mulberry removed.
By April, approximately 90,000 native trees, including Kachnar, Amaltas, Desi Toot, and drought-resilient Pilkan, would be planted to restore the capital’s natural ecosystem, he said, adding that the initiative is supported through public-private partnerships with contributions from Oil and Gas Development Company Limited, Mira Power and Beaconhouse.
The minister concluded his briefing, noting that the initiative aligned with international best practices in urban environmental health governance, as adopted in countries such as the United States and Australia.
He expressed hope that, by April, the project would be completed in accordance with approved technical protocols, including full ecological restoration through the plantation of indigenous species.
Meanwhile, Senator Sherry Rehman, the chairperson of the committee, urged the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination to establish expert committees — including wildlife specialists, ecologists, environmentalists, and civil society representatives — on parks and tree management.
According to a handout, she said, “Tree plantation and tree removal are highly technical processes. We need proper committees, sub-committees, experts on board, and credible public hearings”.
She said that the public’s concerns must be addressed through credible, transparent processes.
“It is the capital city of Pakistan; its green spaces are essential to conserve and preserve. We must add to Islamabad’s natural green cover, not diminish it,” she said.
She concluded by urging the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and the CDA to establish a proper consultation and coordination matrix, and expert-led committee structure, ensuring that environmental protection remains central to development planning.</p><small>2026-01-22 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/222036520bb5664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968450/no-legislation-under-consideration-ahsan-iqbal-terms-reports-of-increasing-voting-age-from-18-to-25-baseless' target='_blank'><strong>‘No legislation under consideration’: Ahsan Iqbal terms reports of increasing voting age from 18 to 25 ‘baseless’</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday termed reports regarding raising the voting age in Pakistan from 18 to 25 as “baseless”, saying there was “no such legislation under consideration”.
There is an emerging political discussion in the country about raising the voting age from 18 to 25. While no formal bill has been tabled yet, the idea is being floated through media commentary, social media narratives, and informal political signalling.
On Wednesday, five senior PTI leaders incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat opposed any change in the voting age, asking whether those “operating in the dark” were afraid of the youth’s power.
In a post on the social media platform X, Iqbal said, “Reports of increasing voters’ age from 18 years to 25 years are baseless. There is no such legislation under consideration.”
In the video accompanying the post, the minister said, “We have confidence in our youth and we can’t even think of depriving them of the right to vote.”







“These [reports] are part of [our] opponents’ disinformation campaign,” the minister added.
Iqbal further reiterated that there were no such plans to increase the voting age, nor was the government intending to table any legislation in the upcoming joint session, which is scheduled for Friday.
“Pakistan’s youth are our asset and they are capable of deciding what is best for the country’s future,” he said.
“Therefore, I strongly refute this as all the circulations are mere rumours,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-22 16:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2220545941f86e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968444/govt-defends-decision-to-join-trumps-board-of-peace-amid-opposition-outcry-in-na' target='_blank'><strong>Govt defends decision to join Trump’s Board of Peace amid opposition outcry in NA</strong></a><br><p>Amid an outcry by the opposition in the National Assembly, the government on Thursday defended its decision to join the Board of Peace led by US President Donald Trump, saying it was taken in the interest of the Palestinian people.
Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the Board of Peace’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage on Thursday with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said Pakistan had a principled position on the Palestine issue and always raised it at international forums.
He said Pakistan’s decision to join the board was guided by national interest and the collective priorities of the Muslim Ummah, not political considerations.
He noted that UN Security Council resolutions called for a permanent ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, adding that Pakistan’s participation in the board aimed to support these efforts while safeguarding both Palestinian and national interests.
He stressed that the matter should not be reduced to political point-scoring, urging unity and consensus in the House.
Meanwhile, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned Pakistan against becoming part of any campaign to disarm Hamas. He said that those responsible for the Palestinians’ plight were part of the board.
“Expecting peace from Trump tantamounts to living in [a] fool’s paradise,” he said on the floor of the house.
He highlighted that Trump was the board’s chairman and appointed members at his own discretion, while also noting that he had abducted the Venezuelan president and his spouse.
Fazl also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should have refused to sit on the board.







“We must not accept the Board of Peace under any circumstances. No so-called peace board in the form of Trump and Netanyahu is acceptable at all”, he stressed.
He said that Gaza was continuing to be bombed and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu would sit “shoulder to shoulder” on this board.
Fazl highlighted that more than 70,000 civilians were killed by Israel during its two-year onslaught in the Gaza Strip, adding, “If anyone has seen so many corpses in a single year, it is the Palestinians”.
The JUI-F chief said that over 100,000 Palestinians had died of hunger and over 150,000 had been rendered homeless. He regretted that Pakistan’s policies were “formed under international pressure”.
“We have never formulated our foreign policy purely for our own national interest,” he remarked.
He also questioned why parliament was not consulted on the decision to join the board.
“It is the government’s duty to inform [parliament] about the decisions it is making,” he emphasised. “If you do not take the house into confidence, fine; but did you at least take the cabinet into confidence?”
Fazl continued, noting that the board was formed despite the existence of the United Nations and its Security Council, questioning whether it amounted to a parallel authority.
“Wherever they [US] go in the name of peace, they leave destruction behind,” Fazl said. “They turned Afghanistan into ruins, Iraq into ruins. They came to Libya and devastated it; to this day, it has not recovered.”
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also regretted that PM Shehbaz had joined the Board of Peace without any consultation.
“Yesterday, the Foreign Office stated that it had joined the Board of Peace. The government ignored the house,” Gohar said, stressing that Parliament must be informed about the conditions of joining the board.
“Will you play any role in disarming Hamas?” he asked. “If it were a United Nations body, the government could have acted on its own. The Board of Peace is not a United Nations body.”
PTI urges govt to withdraw paticipation, hold consultative process
Speaking to Dawn, PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that it was unfortunate that the government did not bother to take such a sensitive decision with consensus.
“They should have at least discussed it in parliament to give a false impression to the global community that we have democracy in Pakistan,” he said.
Qaiser said that there could be severe repercussions of joining the board as it would compromise Pakistan’s ties with other Muslim countries and the people of Palestine.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram told Dawn that the hearts of Pakistani people beat with the hearts of the Palestinian people.
“There is not a single Palestinian representative on the Board of Peace. Any decision that will not be acceptable to the Palestinians will not be acceptable to the PTI,” he said.
“It seems that Trump has ambitions which go beyond Gaza,” he said. He said the US president wanted to bypass the United Nations and use the board for “his own plans”.
Meanwhile, the PTI also issued a statement, which stated that it did not accept the government’s decision to join the Board of Peace.
The party emphasised that decisions of international significance should always be made following consultations with all major political stakeholders and with full transparency.
“The government should at least have discussed such a major decision openly within the available parliamentary structures before moving forward,” the statement, posted on X, said.
The party added that Pakistan’s participation in any international peace initiative should “complement and reinforce the United Nations’ multilateral system”, rather than creating parallel power structures that could adversely affect global governance.
“Under former prime minister Imran Khan’s leadership, [the] PTI has consistently emphasised that Pakistan’s foreign policy must safeguard national sovereignty, uphold constitutional norms, and reflect a broad national consensus,” the party said.







It added that the PTI stood with Palestinians and, as such, “will not accept any plans against the wishes of the people of Palestine”.
“We are deeply saddened and concerned by the atrocities and oppression they continue to face, and we strongly desire that the Palestinian people achieve their freedom and secure their legitimate rights,” the PTI added, reiterating their stance on the creation of an independent Palestinian state with Al-Quds Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital.
It added that this position was articulated by party founder Imran during his tenure as prime minister and reflected Pakistan’s commitment to human rights and international law.
“[The] PTI calls upon the government of Pakistan to withdraw any formal participation in the Board of Peace until a complete consultative process has been conducted,” the PTI said, outlining the various steps of the process.
These included thorough parliamentary scrutiny and debate, consultation with all major political leadership — including Imran — and conducting a referendum on the board’s membership “to ensure public confidence”.
“[The] PTI reiterates that Pakistan must continue to act as a responsible, principled, and peace-oriented nation, whose global engagements reflect dignity and legality, consistent with the charter of the United Nations and are based on national consensus,” the party concluded.
PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, in his own post on X, slammed Pakistan’s decision, calling its haste “not only inappropriate but also beyond comprehension”.
“It was the government’s responsibility to take parliament into confidence on this important matter and inform it of all details, which has not been done,” he said.
He reiterated Imran and the party’s “absolutely clear and unequivocal” position that the PTI would not support any agreement that violated the rights of the Palestinian people, or which the Palestinian people reject.








Additional input from APP</p><small>2026-01-22 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221628191efb3f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968433/pm-shehbaz-other-world-leaders-sign-charter-for-trump-led-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, other world leaders sign charter for Trump-led Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders on Thursday signed the charter for the “Board of Peace” headed by United States President Donald Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts.
Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Trump — who is the chairman of the Board of Peace — said they were “in most cases very popular leaders, some cases not so popular”.
“That’s the way it goes in life,” he said.
“Congratulations, President Trump. The charter is now in full force, and the Board of Peace is now an official international organisation,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

 


“Every one of them are friends of mine. I like every single one of them,” Trump said about the signatories.
“Just about every country wants to be a part of it. We sent out the letters a couple of days ago and countries that are here just happened to be in Davos,” he said.
The US president declared, “Everybody in this room is a star […] There’s a reason that you’re here. When you use that inspired genius for peace, the opposite of peace has no chance.”
Trump officials also unveiled ambitious plans for a “New Gaza” during the ceremony, with the US leader describing the devastated Palestinian territory as “great real estate.”
Referring to the signatories at the outset of his speech, Trump said, “Each and every one of you, we are truly honoured by your presence today. Leaders of countries, in most cases, very popular leaders; in some cases, not so popular.”
Among those seated in the audience was PM Shehbaz. Pakistan on Wednesday had accepted Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace.
After Trump’s address, the heads of various countries took turns to sign the board’s charter. Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council.
While Trump’s plan had sparked concerns that he wants the board to rival the United Nations (UN), the US president said the body will work “in conjunction” with the UN.
Officials from Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan also signed the document with Trump.
Apart from the US, no other permanent member of the UNSC — the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two — has so far committed to join.
France has declined to join. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will do so.
However, the Board of Peace’s potential membership has been controversial, with Trump inviting Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Gaza.
Netanyahu has said Israel will join the board, but he was not at the ceremony.
Trump had also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago. While the US president said Putin had agreed to join, the Russian leader said he was still studying the invitation.
Reuters could not immediately spot any representatives from governments of top global powers or from Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the signing ceremony.
‘End’ of Hamas if it doesn’t disarm: Trump
During his speech, the US president also said that Hamas must disarm under the Gaza ceasefire deal or it will be the “end” of the Palestinian movement.
“They have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them,” Trump said.
“We’re committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,” he affirmed, adding that “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”.
“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” the US president said, adding that the combination of the Board of Peace and the UN could be “very, very unique for the world”.

 

Trump recalled that under Phase 1 of the ceasefire plan, “we have painstakingly […] maintained the Gaza ceasefire, delivered record levels of humanitarian aid”.
“We’ve given aid, you know, you used to hear that all the people were starving and it was terrible. You don’t hear that anymore,” he insisted, highlighting the release of 20 Israeli captives and the bodies of most of the deceased ones.
The US president asserted: “The first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much safer future for the world are unfolding before your very eyes.
“Together we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don’t even call it a chance, it’s gonna happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region, and for the whole region of the world, because I’m calling the world a region.”
Trump also claimed that Iran wants to hold talks with the US, and that Washington was willing to do so. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
He also recalled the US strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites in June 2025.“Can’t let that happen,” he said, referring to the US’s stance that Tehran plans to build nuclear weapons.



‘New Gaza’ plans
A large part of the ceremony was devoted to talking about its plans for shattered Gaza.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a former property developer like the president, showed slides of what he billed as a “master plan” for Gaza’s reconstruction.
The slides included maps of new settlements in the Gaza Strip and artist renderings of gleaming seafront hotels and apartments under the caption “New Gaza”.
“It could be a hope. It could be a destination,” Kushner said.
Kushner said the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal would address funding for reconstruction in the territory, which lies mostly in ruins, as well as disarmament by Hamas, one of the most intractable unresolved issues.
“If Hamas doesn’t demilitarise, that would be what holds this plan back,” Kushner said.
“The next 100 days, we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented. We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.”
Focus right now on Gaza: Rubio
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff also spoke on the occasion.
In his speech, Rubio highlighted that Trump was “willing to talk to or engage with anyone in the interest of peace”.
He stressed, “Now we have this Board of Peace … [its] possibilities are endless. Obviously, with a focus first and foremost on making sure this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring.
“I know this president has it as his highest priority and will give everything that he has to make sure that this is successful.”
The US secretary of state asserted: “This is not just a Board of Peace but a board of action, just like President Trump is a president of action.”
Rubio emphasised that the “focus is right now on Gaza and making sure that the […] vision for the future of Gaza […] of the region, is not just possible and promising, but it is our destiny”.
He further said it would serve as an example of “what’s possible for other places and other conflicts that seem impossible to solve right now”.
“Many others who are going to join … are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own country because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,” Rubio added.
Brazen disregard for int’l law, human rights: Amnesty
Meanwhile, Amnesty International termed the ceremony marking the Board of Peace’s establishment a “brazen disregard for international law and human rights”.
“It also represents a stark new manifestation of the escalating assault on United Nations mechanisms, international justice institutions and universal norms,” the rights body said in a statement on X.
Amnesty further noted: “At the direction of its to-be chairman, President Trump, with its membership comprised of US allies including a few heads of state he has personally invited, the putative mechanism is fundamentally at odds with the international legal system that underpins the global order.







“It is a slap in the face of decades of efforts to strengthen global governance through adherence to universal values and greater equality between member states and derails legitimate efforts to address the current system’s limitations and gaps.”
Amnesty emphasised that now was “precisely the moment that international law must be upheld, defended and enforced; not abandoned in favour of ad hoc arrangements shaped and distorted by political and economic interests, personal ambition or vanity”.







Rafah crossing to open ‘in both directions’: Palestinian official
The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will reopen in both directions next week, said Ali Shaath, the newly-appointed administrator of the Palestinian territory under the US-backed plan.
The reopening of the crossing is part of the Gaza truce plan announced by Trump in October, but it has remained closed so far.







“I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions,” Shaath, a former PA deputy minister, said at the Board of Peace launch ceremony.

 

“For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate; it is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity. Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and the world,” Shaath said.
As part of the truce plan, Shaath was named to head a committee of 15 Palestinian technocrats to oversee the day-to-day administration of Gaza.

After facing a 37-run defeat by England in their tournament opener, the Green Shirts made a comeback, beating Scotland and Zimbabwe in back-to-back matches.







With the win, Pakistan has secured second place in the group rankings, with England on top.
As per the tournament’s format, the top three teams from the four groups will qualify for the Super Six round, where they will be divided into two groups of six teams, each playing two matches.
This means that despite the loss, Zimbabwe will also advance into the Super Six stage.
Pakistan U19 captain Farhan Yousaf had won the toss and elected to field first at Takashinga Sports Club.
Pakistan’s bowlers maintained a strong grip over the Zimbabwean batters, with a dominating performance by Ali Raza, who took three wickets and bowled four maiden overs.
Mohammad Sayyam, Abdul Subhan, and Momin Qamar also grabbed a couple of wickets each for Pakistan.
For Zimbabwe, Nathaniel Hlabangana could only score 59 runs; no other batter could assist him in keeping the momentum and building the partnerships. Eight Zimbabwean batters could not even reach double figures.
Pakistan bowled out Zimbabwe on a score of just 128 runs in 35.5 overs.
While chasing the target, Pakistan’s batters outshone the Zimbabwean bowlers by achieving the total in the 27th over, with the fall of two wickets.

Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza had said that the death toll was estimated to have risen from 31 to 60 following the development, but he had also cautioned that a definite number could only be reached after DNA reports.
The list shared by Dr Syed on Thursday showed that the death of 50 individuals had been confirmed so far.
Meanwhile, a search operation at Gul Plaza continued. It was initiated on Sunday night after around 24-hour-long efforts to extinguish the fire that erupted on Saturday night.
The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Relatives of those still missing have criticised the slow operation at the three-storey plaza, where rescuers are scouring the wreckage for human remains.
Faraz Ali, whose father and 26-year-old brother were inside the mall, told AFP he wants “the bodies to be recovered and handed over to their rightful families”.
“That is all so that the families may receive something, some comfort, some peace. At least let us see them one last time, in whatever condition they are, so that we may say our final goodbye,” the 28-year-old said.
Some families also staged a protest outside Gul Plaza on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Edhi Foundation said in a statement that three more bodies, which were kept in its morgue after they were pulled from the rubble, had been identified through DNA tests.
One of the three identified deceased men ran a gift shop in Gul Plaza while the other two were employed at different shops in the shopping mall, the statement said.
It added that the bodies had been handed over to the heirs.
SBCA begins fire safety assessments
The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), meanwhile, said it had initiated fire safety assessments in Karachi on the directives of Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah.
A statement issued by SBCA Director General (DG) Muzammil Halepoto’s office said fire safety arrangements in 35 of the city’s buildings, including both residential and commercial ones, had been carried out.
It quoted Halepoto as saying that the “functionality of firefighting and emergency systems” was being assessed in the exercise and notices for corrective measures would be issued to the owners of buildings with faulty fire safety systems.
Halepoto further stated that fire safety notices had been issued for 266 buildings in Karachi, which also included those covered in a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) survey. He recalled that the KMC had also issued directives to builders, building owners and unions in January 2024 to ensure fire safety.
The official warned that buildings lacking firefighting tools and safety measures within the given time would be sealed.
The SBCA DG asserted that fire safety assessments would continue in the city to ensure emergency preparedness.
Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza yesterday. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner.
Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous.
Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards.
The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far.
“We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared.
KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots.
He said one portion of the building had been cleared, while two other portions were in the process of being cleared.
“We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable.
He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was received about the fire on Saturday night.
Khan further added that shopkeepers had created a chaotic situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops.
He said that the door leading to the building’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted, which was why all the exits were closed.

The journalist’s arrest came after a first information report (FIR) was registered against him under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 324 (attempted murder) and 337A(i) (causing a head injury) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant, who operates a “cable network”, alleged that he and his friends had met for tea at a restaurant on Wednesday night, when Salman and three others drew a pistol and started firing, resulting in a bullet injury to his thigh.
He further alleged that the suspect was spreading fake news against him on social media for “blackmailing purposes”.
Subsequently, the Sindh home minister took notice of the arrest and sought details from the Korangi senior superintendent of police (SSP), according to a statement.
“Merit, transparency and impartiality should be given focus,” Lanjar said in the statement, adding that all media organisations should be taken into confidence and that a thorough inquiry be conducted.
“I assure my journalist brethren that merit and transparency will be ensured during police investigation,” he added.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the police said the Shah Faisal Colony superintendent of police (SP) and SP Investigation had been appointed as investigating officers for the inquiry.
The statement quoted the Korangi SSP as saying that the two officials  should ensure merit and transparency in the inquiry and that a complaint by the journalist’s wife should also be made a part of the probe.
Salman’s wife had filed an application with the Model Colony police alleging that certain elements wanted to occupy the land of a bus terminal in Model Colony. She said her husband had exposed the land grabbing “while performing his professional duties”, leading the complainant to “threaten him”.
“Suspects riding four motorcycles on Wednesday night arrived at the restaurant and threatened my husband,” she alleged in her application. “He (Salman) took out a licensed pistol and resorted to firing in self-defence,” she said.
She further stated that they had sought protection from the police, which was not provided and accused the suspects of “being supported by political elements”. She further alleged that the suspects beat her husband while he was in police custody.
Meanwhile, separate statements issued by the Karachi Press Club (KPC) and Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the arrest.
“Arresting a person who opened fire in self-defence instead of the attacker is worrying,” the KUJ’s president and secretary said in a joint statement.
It added that some elements had been threatening Salman for reporting the news over several days and that after opening fire in self-defence, Salman himself had approached the police for help but was refused.
“Not only did they file a case against him, aiding the criminals, but they refused to accept his wife’s application,” the statement added.
“High-ranking police officials should take notice of this matter and bring justice to the journalist [and] the authorities should ensure a transparent investigation,” the statement said.
The KPC also demanded that Salman be released immediately and that an impartial investigation be conducted into the incident.
“KPC President Fazil Jamili, Secretary Aslam Khan and the executive council have expressed deep concern over the attempted attack on Salman, a senior member of the press club, and his subsequent arrest,” the statement said.
It noted that Salman was a “responsible and professional journalist” and that if he were threatened or attacked, law enforcement agencies’ first responsibility should be to provide protection to him and take action against the real suspects.
“Arresting a senior journalist on the basis of self-defence is upsetting and concerning, while the impression that the victim should be blamed instead of the complainant is also extremely dangerous,” the statement added.
The KPC, alongside demanding Salman’s release and a transparent probe, demanded the assurance that journalists would not face harassment or retaliation while carrying out their duties.</p><small>2026-01-22 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221826409f2f757.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417/bangladesh-parties-launch-campaigns-for-first-post-hasina-elections' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh parties launch campaigns for first post-Hasina elections</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh began official campaigning on Thursday for the hugely anticipated general elections next month, the first since the 2024 uprising ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name.
“We have liberated the country from autocratic rule,” prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile, told crowds of BNP loyalists.
“Now we must establish the rights of the people.”
Rahman vowed to create jobs for “millions of unemployed youth” and support women’s economic independence. “Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of Rahman.

Key rival Jamaat-i-Islami began its campaign in the capital Dhaka, after being crushed during Hasina’s 15 years in power.
Jamaat’s leader Shafiqur Rahman said he wanted to clamp down on corruption and build a nation where “people from all races, religions and communities will be treated equally”.
Among the sea of Jamaat supporters was 36-year-old Kakoli Akter, who said it was the first election rally she had ever attended.
Although eligible to vote since 2008, she said this would be the first time she would cast a ballot, as she could finally support the party of her choice.
The South Asian nation votes on February 12 to elect 350 lawmakers — polls that will bring in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.
It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a student leader of the anti-Hasina protests — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.
European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.
‘Progress of reform’
Tarique Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.

Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and Tarique Zia followed tradition to launch his campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.
“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harunur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.
Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, began its campaign in the capital Dhaka.
Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of bans and crackdowns.
Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising — now allied with Jamaat — launched their campaign with its chief Nahid Islam urging voters to “carry forward the progress of reform”.

 

Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.
“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”
‘New Bangladesh’
Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who returned from exile in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.
Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.
“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.

 

Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.
“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.
Relations with neighbouring India have soured, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.

Last year it collapsed. This has stalled the birth of an agreement that could begin to rein in production of a fossil-fuel-based material that is harming ecosystems on every part of Earth.
The treaty seemed to be the latest victim of a struggling multilateral system. Shifting geopolitics, changing national positions and the global influence of fossil fuels are frustrating the broader work of curbing climate change – humanity’s common interest.
I reported on the plastics negotiations over this period, watching as 184 countries seemed increasingly unable to find common ground. With so much at stake, one absence in particular seemed to weaken the process: the ability, when countries could not reach full consensus, to make a decision anyway based on a two-thirds majority vote.
Arcane as it sounds, this omission lurked behind some of the most dramatic negotiation scenes, and still haunts other environmental processes today, including the UN’s climate negotiations.
This is the story of how voting is an ever-present obstacle to the global plastics treaty, what it reveals about political will, and why, despite the process fizzling out, I believe there is still a desire in many quarters to reach an ambitious deal.
Resistance mounts against a vote
Paris, France, May 2024:
When countries gathered to begin textual negotiations on the plastics treaty, a small group soon began to question the rules of procedure. Though hard to detect behind the practised calm of negotiators, a mighty conflict was brewing.
Saudi Arabia, backed by Iran, India, Brazil and China, took the floor. They challenged a standard rule in UN negotiations that allows a decision to be passed by a two-thirds majority when consensus cannot been reached. After hours of plenary statements and rebuttals, Saudi Arabia delivered the clincher. It would “not be moving forward [with negotiations] until the rule is bracketed”.
Words are bracketed in international negotiations to indicate disagreement over their inclusion in the final text. Requesting brackets at this stage was an attempt to kick voting into the long grass.
Negotiators ultimately spent two of their five days wrangling over this point, until – anxiously watching the clock – they effectively agreed to bracket the voting rule. The decision was accompanied by a statement noting the issue still hadn’t been resolved, in case it came up in a future discussion. But that discussion never came, and the voting rule was never applied.
To the treaty novice I was at the time, it wasn’t immediately clear why this mattered. But treaty die-hards saw eerie echoes of what had happened at the start of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to negotiate curbs on greenhouse gas emissions.
Back in 1991, a group of petrochemical-rich countries wrestled the voting rules for UNFCCC negotiations into brackets, where they have now been gathering dust for 35 years. Many people told me this move has been responsible for slow action on climate change today.
Voting is standard in other multilateral environmental agreements. The High Seas Treaty, the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions on dangerous chemicals, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, for example, all allow decisions by a majority vote.
That being said, those UN environmental agreements that allow voting still prefer consensus, reserving voting for decision deadlocks. The desire to avoid a vote pushes countries “to find common ground” instead of overriding a minority, says David Azoulay, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law:
“Knowing a vote is possible is all you need to create the incentive to actually negotiate in good faith. Because nobody wants to find themselves on the losing end of a vote.”
Without that pressure, a country may simply veto a decision it dislikes, potentially due to vested interests. Where environmental issues intersect with economic interests, that is a particular risk.
In the UNFCCC process, “petrostates succeeded in arranging consensus as the rule of procedure” and have thereby stalled progress since 1991. That’s according to Nona Chai, programme coordinator for the Just Transition Alliance, a coalition of environmental justice groups and labour unions.

Last year, Chai attended the COP30 climate conference in Brazil. She says the no-voting norm has made it easier to block key proposals, such as language previously agreed at COP28 on “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. This was opposed by Saudi Arabia and a handful of others, and ultimately removed from COP30’s final text.
Many of the same countries now seem to see plastic as a way to keep extracting the fossil fuels that underpin their economies. Production limits brought on by a global plastics treaty could threaten that. What unfolded during 2023’s Paris plastics talks, therefore, triggered alarm bells that the same old tactics were being used.
‘Us’ and ‘them’
Busan, South Korea, November 2024:
Journalists jostled into the press room, briefly warming the frigid air of the cavernous conference centre, where the fifth (and supposedly final) plastics treaty meeting was underway. A panel of negotiators were making a rare speech, about a proposal to reduce global plastic production to sustainable levels.
Most country delegates, civil society representatives and scientists in attendance believed production limits were key to a successful treaty. This is in line with the 2022 UN Environment Assembly resolution that created these negotiations. It mandated that the talks should tackle pollution across the entire plastic lifecycle. But over the preceding four meetings, countries had broadly split into factions for and against this issue.
Several factors had stoked the division. At the third meeting in Nairobi in November 2023, a cluster of petrochemical-producing countries formed the “like-minded group”. It pushed for waste management over production cuts. A fourth meeting, in Ottawa in April 2024, featured aggressive pro-plastic ad campaigns and almost 200 petrochemical lobbyists, exposing corporate influence on the process.
By the Busan meeting, the US – a major treaty player – had started rolling back its support for production cuts. (Later, under President Trump, this evolved into an allegiance with oil-rich states, and secret pressure on countries to reject production limits.)
The press briefing in Busan made it clear that the majority was trying to keep a production limit on the negotiating table.
Wearing his trademark straw hat, Panama’s lead negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey-Gomez, said countries opposing limits had “not moved a centimetre”. He urged them to negotiate to meet the majority halfway. And with something approaching anger, he had a message for those unwilling to do so: “Please leave it to the rest of us and get out of the way.”
If anyone was looking for a sign that multilateralism was flailing, this atypical “us” and “them” framing was it.
Behind the scenes, the like-minded minority had been suggesting “no text” or “no article” on production reduction, meaning no mention of it. “When we started to talk about the text among those of us who wanted it, they didn’t want to have that conversation,” Dennis Clare, a negotiator for Micronesia, told me at the time. He said they used several tactics to shut it down. “It was an impasse.”
Meanwhile, I watched as these countries kept raising the importance of consensus in plenaries and public statements – despite reportedly not engaging in the normal processes of discussion and compromise needed to reach it.
This tendency has crept into other multilateral spaces. Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement, told Carbon Brief that “consensus” has come to be misunderstood as “unanimity”. A decision doesn’t actually need the unreserved agreement of everyone. In difficult decisions of all shades, consensus is achieved through flexibility and compromise, delivering a compromise that all parties are satisfied with, if not necessarily ecstatic about.
In Busan, it seemed, the fears expressed 18 months prior in Paris had become real. Without voting, a handful of countries hiding behind the cover of consensus had been emboldened to veto the majority.
Cacophonous collapse
Geneva, Switzerland, August 2025:


On a sweltering summer night, exhausted delegates gathered on a manicured lawn at the UN headquarters in Geneva — Emma Bryce via Dialogue Earth

It was the final day of the sixth UN plastics treaty meeting, called after the fifth in Busan had failed to reach an agreement. People had been waiting hours for the final text.
Just before midnight, everyone was summoned into the vast plenary hall, and an expectant hush fell. But then Luis Vayas Valdievieso, the meeting’s chair, explained that the treaty was still not ready. “This plenary is adjourned!”, he boomed, banging his gavel down. Almost 4,000 delegates let out a roar of frustration. At 31 seconds, it was the shortest plenary in UN history. It seemed to symbolise a process in crisis.
The anticipated text was expected to be a significant upgrade on a draft Valdievieso had released the day before, which had provoked widespread outrage and despair. It remains unclear why, but that draft barely resembled what most negotiators wanted. A section on production controls was replaced with pollution measures only, language on regulating harmful plastic chemicals was erased and the agreement was no longer legally binding.
Camila Zepeda, Mexico’s lead negotiator, described that draft to me as “an empty shell.”
The text had been roundly rejected, pushing countries back into negotiations to try and develop another draft. That still wasn’t ready by the midnight plenary on the final day. When Valdievieso gavelled that bafflingly brief plenary to a close, the meeting moved into overtime and he held informal meetings with countries to try and reach some resolution.
Ultimately, they could not agree on a final text. At a final closing plenary just after 5am, Colombia captured the sense of frustration, saying the process had been “consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don’t want an agreement”. Two months later, Valdievieso resigned as chair.
A vote for the future
How different would things be if voting had been part of this fraught process? Azoulay feels sure it would have at least brought an agreement “very, very much closer”. Voting in multilateral environment agreements, intended as a last resort, has become one of the only available tools to defend multilateralism.
Having watched the process unfold, along with others, I feel unsure whether voting could realistically have closed the gaping void between the countries on either side of this issue. In other words, voting is not a substitute for political will.
Fernando Tormos-Aponte, policy lead at the Just Transition Alliance, worries that a voting process might just encourage countries that dislike a negotiated outcome to leave the whole process, as the US has done with the Paris climate agreement. “If [the plastics treaty] becomes too ambitious, the US won’t sign it, just like they didn’t sign Kyoto and just like they eventually withdrew from Paris.”
I consulted Alexandra Harrington, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Plastic Pollution Task Force. She sees things slightly differently. Fighting harder for voting at the commencement of the plastics negotiations would have helped, Harrington says, by immediately revealing countries’ true intentions.


Despite attempts by massed negotiators, sessions in Geneva last year failed to lead to a global plastics treaty — Newscom / Alamy via Dialogue Earth

A vote demanded by the majority in the early days of the treaty may have pushed the blockers to actually consider whether they could commit and negotiate in good faith, or if they would prefer to exit the negotiations. It also helps avoid a situation where ambition is compromised by a minority that may never even ratify the agreement.
“I think voting brings more honesty to that process,” says Harrington.
Along these lines, some have suggested that those countries that do actually want a treaty – the so-called “coalition of the willing” – could break out of the UN system and begin a new process among themselves.
That idea is not unique to the plastics treaty. Frustrations with the creaking, consensus-focused multilateral system also surfaced at COP30. As it ended, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a separate global conference for nations willing to transition away from fossil fuels.
A new plastics process that at least includes the world’s major plastics consumers could be effective in reducing production and pollution, experts argue. It could shift the markets, even without the world’s biggest plastics and petrochemicals producers on board.
Others say an agreement outside the UN could be effective if it includes China, the world’s biggest plastic producer.

This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless.
David Azoulay, Center for International Environmental Law

Some national negotiators I spoke to in Geneva said it is important not to knock multilateralism when it is already down, and therefore to stay within the UN. But Azoulay feels the damage is already done, pointing to the plastic treaty process itself: “This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless.”
For most nations, an exit may be a step too far for now. “I believe there’s not enough appetite to move outside of the UN system,” says Felix Wertli, Switzerland’s lead negotiator in the plastics treaty process.
An alternative could be for some of the measures of the plastic treaty to be adopted under an existing international agreement, such as the 1989 Basel Convention, Wertli says. That convention includes the possibility to vote.
The plastics treaty process will continue in some form. The next step is for countries to elect a new chair to replace Valdievieso at a one-day meeting scheduled for February. This meeting won’t include formal negotiations but countries can raise procedural issues. Harrington says voting rules could come up.
Formal negotiations are due to resume at some point after that. Voting is still an option. As Harrington points out, it is hibernating in the rules of procedure, ready to be reawakened by a party bold enough to roll the diplomatic dice: “You need one country that is willing to just put its hand up and say, okay, we’re calling for a vote.”
Future momentum
Amid the various twists and turns of the plastics treaty process, one thing seemed clear to me throughout: there is huge momentum to reach a deal. It is embodied by the activists who turned up, year after year and at great expense, to fight for the cause. It is in the mounting science, and the raw emotion of negotiators who wept in the final plenary.
But even as that momentum grows, tonnes of plastic continue to be churned out, advancing one of the planet’s richest and most destructive industries. While many mourn the treaty’s apparent collapse, some are celebrating it.
Ultimately, the world’s majority wants a treaty that begins to reduce the damaging impact of plastic on people and planet. History will judge the treaty by whether it achieves that goal.

He made the decision based on data from his recent study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, which linked getting a smartphone at a young age to worse health consequences.
Kids who owned a smartphone by age 12 had a greater risk of depression, obesity, and insufficient sleep compared to those who didn’t, a research team led by Barzilay found.
That was based on observational data collected between 2016 and 2022 in an ongoing study of more than 10,000 children across the United States. Designed to assess brain development and child health, the nationwide Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study has been following children for the last decade, starting from ages nine to 10 into early adulthood.
The age at which kids got a phone in this cohort ranged from four to 13, with a median age of 11.

“We’re not advocating for people to go back to the Stone Age. We know that eventually, almost every teen will get their smartphone,” said Barzilay, the study’s lead author.

Smartphone ownership is high among US children and teens. Nearly 60 per cent of parents of an 11- or 12-year-old said their child owned one in a 2025 Pew Research Centre survey.
By comparison, 29pc of kids ages 8 to 10 and 12pc of 5- to 7-year-olds had smartphones, the survey found.
Concern about the impacts of mobile devices comes as rates of depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety have been rising among US youth over the last decade. Though screens are unlikely to be the only factor, many studies have linked excessive use to worse mental health.
That’s not to say smartphones don’t have benefits. The devices can help youth stay connected with people and address safety concerns parents may have.
“We’re not saying smartphones are bad, but we’re not saying they’re good,” Barzilay said.
To him, the takeaway is that parents should consider how giving a child a smartphone could impact their kid’s health.
“Make sure that it doesn’t consume all of their life,” he said.
What the data says
Barzilay’s team first compared the health outcomes of children in the study who owned a smartphone by age 12 to those who didn’t.
Those who had the device had a 31pc greater risk of depression, a 40% greater risk of obesity, and a 62pc greater risk of insufficient sleep, which in this case meant getting less than nine hours of sleep.
They next found that there was a roughly 10pc increase in the odds of obesity and insufficient sleep at age 12 for each year younger than 12 that the child received a smartphone.

Earlier age of ownership, however, was not associated with a higher risk of depression.
A limitation of the study is that the researchers did not have data on what children were doing on their smartphones. They could not account for whether the child was exposed to adverse content on their device, or what they tended to use it for.
His team’s last analysis zeroed in on the children who did not already have a smartphone at age 12.
A year later, at age 13, roughly half of the kids in that group had received one. That came with a higher risk of having mental health problems and insufficient sleep compared to half who had not received a smartphone.
His team controlled for factors, such as income, parental education level, puberty, parental monitoring, and whether the kids had tablets, laptops, or a smartwatch, that might also affect the outcomes.
However, other factors not captured by the research, which relied on observational data, still may have contributed to the outcomes identified.
What parents can do
It’s important to keep in mind that these findings speak to broad trends seen in the population and wouldn’t predict a specific child’s outcome, Barzilay said.
“We need to remember that this is on average,” he said. “It doesn’t say anything for the individual child.”
His oldest two children, who are now in high school, received their first phones before age 12.
If parents give their child a smartphone, they should check in regularly to see how it impacts the child’s lifestyle. Screen time shouldn’t come at the expense of sleep, physical activity, or quality time with friends and family.

Barzilay also suggested having the child keep their smartphone out of their bedroom at night and having tech-free family time, such as during dinner.

Ultimately, he would encourage parents to make an informed decision on smartphone ownership for their child based on the evidence out there on the harms and benefits.
“Things that can help families delay the use of phones will probably make sense,” he said.

According to ESPN Cricinfo, the decision was announced after a meeting in Dhaka between Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam Bulbul, CEO Nizamuddin, Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul and several national team players.
“Our only demand is to play the World Cup – but not in India,” the BCB president told reporters.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that it would not be making any changes to the World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.
“We will go back to the ICC with our plan to play in Sri Lanka,” the BCB president said.
“They did give us a 24-hour ultimatum but a global body can’t really do that. ICC will miss out on 200 million people watching the World Cup (if Bangladesh is axed). It will be their loss…”
“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” the BCB’s Bulbul said.
“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure,” he said.
Meanwhile, Nazrul said, “There is no scope for changing our decision.”
He said Bangladesh’s security concerns “did not arise from speculation or theoretical analysis”.
“They arose from a real incident – where one of our country’s top players was forced to bow to extremists, and the Indian cricket board asked him to leave India,” he said.
“We are hopeful that ICC will give us the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.
Following yesterday’s decision by the ICC, Islam had said Bangladesh players were keen to play in the World Cup and that he was “hoping for a miracle from the ICC.
“Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” Islam said on Wednesday.
“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players,” Islam had said.
Bangladesh announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C. The team is scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22164200ed87d8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968435/nestle-announces-60m-additional-investment-in-pakistan-to-expand-operations-in-country' target='_blank'><strong>Nestle announces $60m additional investment in Pakistan, to expand operations in country</strong></a><br><p>Nestle on Thursday announced that it would invest an additional $60 million in Pakistan and would also “undertake a robust expansion of its operations in the country”.
The development came as Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met Remy Ejel, the executive vice president and chief executive officer for Asia, Oceania, and Africa at Nestle, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry.







The ministry said Aurangzeb chaired a high-level business roundtable on the sidelines of the WEF, bringing together chief executive officers and senior leaders of leading global corporations to discuss Pakistan’s reform trajectory, investment climate, and long-term growth potential.
“The roundtable formed part of the government of Pakistan’s ongoing engagement with multinational investors to promote policy predictability, economic formalisation, and sustainable, export-oriented growth,” it said.
“A major highlight of the discussion was the announcement by Ejel … of an additional investment of $60 million in Pakistan. Ejel stated that Nestle will undertake a robust expansion of its operations in the country, reaffirming its long-term commitment to Pakistan,” the statement said.
“He further announced that Nestle intends to use Pakistan as a regional manufacturing and export hub, exporting products to 26 countries from Pakistan. Expressing strong confidence in Pakistan’s economic outlook, Ejel foresaw robust growth in Nestle’s business in Pakistan in the coming years,” the statement said.
According to the finance ministry, the announcement builds on the company’s recent engagement with the minister in Islamabad, where the company had “outlined its strategy centered on localisation, advanced manufacturing, sustainability, and agricultural transformation”.
The statement further said that Ejal noted that Pakistan’s demographic profile, growing nutrition needs, and underpenetrated value-added food segments closely mirrored successful growth trajectories seen in Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb welcomed the announcement and described it as a “strong vote of confidence in Pakistan’s economic reforms and formalisation drive”.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening the tax ecosystem, ensuring policy consistency, and facilitating responsible long-term investment through continued engagement with the private sector, including via the Tax Policy Office established within the Finance Division,” the statement said.
The minister also emphasised that Pakistan offered compelling opportunities in affordable nutrition, climate-resilient dairy, localised sourcing, and export-oriented manufacturing, and reiterated the government’s resolve to position Pakistan as a competitive base for regional production and global value chains.
Azerbaijan’s Socar signals investment in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector
A separate handout by the ministry said that following the high-level business roundtable chaired by Aurangzeb, the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Socar) announced that it was set to finalise its investment in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector in February.







The announcement was made by Socar’s president, Rovshan Najaf, during the roundtable, the statement said.
Socar viewed Pakistan as a natural long-term energy partner, pointing to the country’s market depth, rising energy demand, and reform momentum in the oil and gas sector, the statement quoted him as saying.
He added that Socar’s planned investment would build on its existing commercial footprint in Pakistan and expand cooperation across the energy value chain, it said.
He noted that the company was already in a commercial engagement in Pakistan through Socar Trading, providing Pakistan with flexible liquefied natural gas arrangements.
Najaf also noted Socar’s engagement with Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and expressed interest in expanding cooperation across the broader oil and gas value chain as Pakistan continues to implement energy-sector reforms. He emphasised Socar’s experience as a peer national energy company from an emerging economy, positioning it as a credible long-term partner for Pakistan’s energy sector.
Meanwhile, the finance minister reiterated the government’s commitment to attracting strategic and commercially viable investment in the oil and gas and mining sectors, describing these areas as central to Pakistan’s energy security and industrial growth.
“He noted that ongoing reforms are focused on improving pricing transparency, contractual clarity, and risk-sharing mechanisms to support sustained private-sector participation,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22144727a7257ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968429/over-288000-tickets-issued-under-e-challan-system-in-karachi-since-october-sindh-igp-told' target='_blank'><strong>Over 288,000 tickets issued under e-challan system in Karachi since October, Sindh IGP told</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Over 288,000 e-tickets have been issued under the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS) since its launch in October last year, it emerged on Thursday.
Last year, the Sindh government had decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. The system was officially inaugurated in October and drew a mix of praise and criticism from the public.
According to a press release issued from the office of Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Javed Akhtar Odho, in a meeting held at the Central Police Office Karachi today, the newly appointed IG reviewed the performance of the new traffic system.
During the meeting, the deputy inspector general of traffic police briefed Odho that “so far, over 288,000 e-tickets have been generated under TRACS,” out of which 52 per cent of the tickets had been delivered, while 48pc were still under process.
The IGP was informed that the “reason for the delay in delivery was due to refusal to accept tickets, change of address or incomplete address,” and that redelivery was underway.
The IGP was further briefed that 71 percent of the tickets issued had been paid by citizens, while a significant percentage were waived as they were first-time offences.
“So far, 7,681 complaints have been registered against the e-challan system, out of which 81pc have been resolved and another 19pc are under review,” according to the briefing.
It further emerged that 12,000 vehicles have been blacklisted under the ticketing system since October 27.
The IGP was briefed that under the new system, vehicles associated with “non-transfer of ownership rights, fake number plates, incomplete number plates, theft, mischief,” and other illegal activities have been blacklisted.
IGP Odho also “directed traffic police to work in collaboration with district police to take action against the blacklisted vehicles,” the press release said.
He also issued instructions that the data of blacklisted vehicles should be provided to Safe City cameras, Emergency Response Vehicles and the Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell.
“Additional IG Karachi, prepare a comprehensive plan for action against blacklisted vehicles,” IGP Odho said.
The statement added that he also directed traffic police to issue e-tickets through smartphones on an experimental basis.
He termed the use of technology essential to modern policing, adding that the “extraordinary steps need to be taken to make policing simpler”.
During the meeting, it was also decided to impose a Rs100,000 fine on heavy vehicles without trackers.
IGP Odho also issued instructions to the traffic police to ban transfers in the department.</p><small>2026-01-22 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221306495ac7420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968422/mqm-p-demands-karachi-be-made-federal-territory-be-declared-financial-capital' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P demands Karachi be made ‘federal territory’, be declared ‘financial capital’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Thursday called on the federal government to declare Karachi a federal territory by making it the country’s “financial capital”.
The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno in the metropolis, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need for reforms in the city’s administration, particularly in local governments (LGs).
Kamal, addressing a press conference today, called on the federal government to “invoke Article 148 and 149 of the Constitution, and declare Karachi as the financial capital of the country”.
Article 148 of the Constitution pertains to the obligation of provinces and the federation, while Article 149 allows the federal government to issue directives to provinces in certain cases.
Article 149 enables the federal government to direct provincial governments regarding the “manner in which the executive authority thereof is to be exercised for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity or economic life”.
Kamal stressed that given the potential of the metropolis, “it can not be given to such a provincial administration”, referring to the ruling PPP in Sindh.
“We have an administrative capital, but Karachi should be made a financial capital,” he reiterated, adding that the demand for provinces can be addressed later.
“A city that runs the entire country cannot remain under an administration engaging in democratic terrorism,” the MQM-P leader claimed.
Kamal insisted that the current city administration was “turning people against the state” by “disenfranchising them”, and cautioned that Pakistan’s enemies stood to gain from such a situation.
‘PPP taking unfair advantage of 18th Amendment’
The MQM-P leader further claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage of the 18th Amendment”, alleging that it was being “used against us (Karachi citizens)”.
“End this 18th Amendment drama now,” Kamal said.
He also reiterated the party’s demand for strengthening the LG system.
Recalling the discussions ahead of the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed in November last year, he said that “even the prime minister agreed to the local government reforms”.
“The cabinet, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer and Rana Sanaullah, supported it unequivocally. However, the PPP was the sole party which refused to comply,” the MQM-P leader said.
“They threatened to pull out from voting for the other clauses in the Amendment, so we had to retreat,” Kamal added, echoing his stance of the PPP creating a “deadlock”.
The MQM-P has been calling for empowering LGs for a long time, even tying its support for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the inclusion of related provisions in Article 140A.
However, after both amendments did not address the matter, the party claimed that its suggested constitutional tweaks would now be advanced as the 28th constitutional amendment.
On Tuesday, the National Assembly session also echoed with calls for empowering LGs as lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deadly Gul Plaza tragedy.
MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units”, and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city management.
Memon assails MQM-P for ‘politicising’ Gul Plaza fire
On the other hand, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon lashed out at the MQM-P for “politicising” the Gul Plaza incident.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he regretted that “certain parties” were attempting to politicise the Gul Plaza fire incident, and asserted that the Sindh government was displaying “great patience”.
“You call yourself the entire city’s party, so you have the full right to criticise, but they start making other sorts of statements in the guise of criticism,” Memon said, indirectly mentioning Kamal’s press conference from a while before.
“Will ending the 18th Amendment and handing over Karachi to the Centre prevent such incidents?” the PPP minister asked.



“We are not evading our responsibility,” he asserted, acknowledging that the protection of the public’s life and property.
He quipped, “This (Gul Plaza fire) was an incident. […] But those who have carried out such incidents in this city with their hands are making such remarks.
“Those parties are talking that have even burned people alive for extortion,” he alleged.
Memon said he was “forced to respond” as “serious allegations” were being made against his party.
“The Baldia factory was set on fire, innocent people were deprived of their lives, and the human hunting game was played on May 12, 2007, […] such statements from your mouth do not suit you.”
The PPP leader then played some old video clips of Kamal, wherein he could be heard making allegations against his current party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and coalition ally PML-N, as well as hurling abuses in public.
Memon said he had responses for each statement made by Kamal, but he would “not fall in that trap”.
The PPP leader questioned why Kamal, being the federal health minister, had not paid a visit to Gul Plaza or asked if his help was needed in any matter.
“When your quaid (Altaf Hussain) used to give a strike call, when your workers used to count a score of 100 and kill people on the roads, and when bodies in sacks were found daily, did you not remember humanity then?”
Responding to a query, Memon said he was unable to “comprehend the objective” of the recent statements made by Kamal and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif.
Speaking on the Gul Plaza incident, Memon affirmed that the Sindh government was working on the “one-point agenda” of returning the remains of the victims to their loved ones.

 

“Neither can there be a price for a valuable life, nor can there be any substitute,” the minister said, reiterating that the government stood with the survivors during this “difficult time”.
Of the 1,200 shops in Gul Plaza that suffered damage, he said: “We will not argue about how many of these were legal and how many were built afterwards. Whoever has suffered damages and however much, the Sindh government has said that it stands with them and considers it its responsibility to get them back on their feet.”
Memon added that the government was also planning on giving interest-free loans to shop owners of Gul Plaza to help them.
According to Memon, Sindh’s Rescue 1122 received 1,094 reports of fire incidents across Karachi in 2025, while 84 such incidents were reported this month so far.
“It will come forward how this incident happened, how rescue efforts were carried out — if there is any shortcoming anywhere, the government will take action against it,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-22 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22124521ab0e6e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968420/us-set-to-quit-world-health-organisation' target='_blank'><strong>US set to quit World Health Organisation</strong></a><br><p>The US is due to officially exit the World Health Organisation on Thursday, in the face of warnings it will hit both US health and global health and also in violation of a US law that requires Washington to pay the UN health agency $260 million in fees that it owes.
President Donald Trump gave notice that the US would quit the organisation on the first day of his presidency in 2025, via an executive order. Under US law, it has to give one-year notice and pay all outstanding fees before departure.
On Thursday, a US State Department spokesperson said the WHO’s failure to contain, manage and share information had cost the US trillions of dollars and the president had exercised his authority to pause the future transfer of any US government funds, support, or resources to the WHO.
“The American people have paid more than enough to this organisation and this economic hit is beyond a down payment on any financial obligations to the organisation,” the spokesperson said by email.
Quick return unlikely
Over the last year, many global health experts have urged a rethink, including most recently WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“I hope the US will reconsider and rejoin WHO”, he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month. “Withdrawing from the WHO is a lose for the United States, and its a lose for the rest of the world.”
The WHO also said that the US has not yet paid the fees it owes for 2024 and 2025. Member states are set to discuss the US departure and how it will be handled at the WHOs executive board in February, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters by email.
“This is a clear violation of US law,” said Lawrence Gostin, founding director of the ONeill Institute for Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington, a close observer of the WHO. “But Trump is highly likely to get away with it.”
Speaking to Reuters at Davos, Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, a major funder of global health initiatives and some of the WHOs work said he did not expect the US to reconsider in the short-term.
“I dont think the US will be coming back to WHO in the near future,” he said, adding that when he had an opportunity to advocate for it, he would. “The world needs the World Health Organisation.”
What the departure means
For the WHO, the departure of the US has sparked a budgetary crisis that has seen it cut its management team in half and scale back work, cutting budgets across the agency.
Washington has traditionally been by far the UN health agency’s biggest financial backer, contributing around 18% of its overall funding.
The WHO will also shed around a quarter of its staff by the middle of this year.
The agency said it has been working with the US and sharing information in the last year.
It was unclear how the collaboration will work going forward.
Global health experts said this posed risks for the US, the WHO and the world.
“The US withdrawal from WHO could weaken the systems and collaborations the world relies on to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats,” said Kelly Henning, public health program lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a US-based non-profit.</p><small>2026-01-22 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22171648b314f8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968412/president-zardari-confirms-27-judges-of-sindh-lahore-and-peshawar-high-courts-as-permanent' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari confirms 27 judges of Sindh, Lahore and Peshawar high courts as permanent</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday approved the confirmation of a total of 27 additional judges of the Sindh, Lahore, and Peshawar high courts.
According to a statement issued on Thursday by the president’s secretariat, the approval was given in accordance with the recommendations of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
For the Sindh High Court (SHC), the statement said the president had approved the confirmation of all 10 additional judges recommended by the JCP: Justices Miran Muhammad Shah, Tasneem Sultana, Riazat Ali Sahar, Muhammad Hasan, Abdul Hamid Bhurgi, Jan Ali Junejo, Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro, Ali Haider ‘Ada’, Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi and Muhammad Jaffer Raza.
President Zardari also approved a six-month extension in the tenures of Justices Khalid Hussain Shahani and Syed Faizul Hassan Shah of the SHC, the statement added.
For the Lahore High Court (LHC), President Zardari confirmed all 11 additional judges recommended by the JCP as permanent judges, namely Justices Hassan Nawaz Makhdoom, Malik Waqar Haider Awan, Sardar Akbar Ali, Syed Ahsan Raza Kazmi, Malik Javed Iqbal Wains, Muhammad Jawad Zafar, Khalid Ishaq, Malik Muhammad Awais Khalid, Chaudhry Sultan Mahmood, Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh and Abher Gul Khan.
The president further approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa as an additional LHC judge, according to the statement.
Finally, for the Peshawar High Court (PHC), he approved the confirmation of the following six additional judges: Justices Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Abdul Fayaz, Salahuddin, Sadiq Ali, Syed Mudasser Ameer and Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah.
He also approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justices Farah Jamshed, Inamullah Khan, Sabitullah Khan and Aurangzeb as PHC’s additional judges.
“The approvals have been made on the advice of the prime minister,” the statement added.
Last week, over multiple days of meetings presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP had recommended making additional judges of multiple high courts permanent. It had approved three of the Islamabad High Court, 10 of the SHC, 11 of the LHC, six of the PHC and one of the Balochistan High Court.
By a majority of its total membership, the JCP had recommended the confirmations after due consideration of the relevant data forms, antecedents and evaluation of material placed before it.
Subsequently, the federal government had notified the appointment of IHC’s Justices Muhammad Azam Khan, Muhammad Asif and Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as permanent judges, with them taking oath on Monday.</p><small>2026-01-22 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22113838279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968414/pta-wrote-to-x-three-times-seeking-closure-of-imran-khans-x-account-over-the-past-35-years' target='_blank'><strong>PTA wrote to X three times seeking closure of Imran Khan’s X account over the past 3.5 years</strong></a><br><p>Over the past 3.5 years, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has written to X three times seeking closure of an account in PTI founder Imran Khan’s name, but received no response, it emerged on Thursday.
The information came to light in a PTA report, seen by Dawn and submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) today in relation to a petition against the incarcerated former premier regarding “inflammatory posts” made from an X account operated in his name.
The report stated that the first request was sent on August 21, 2022, to X, and the body received no response from the social media platform.
On April 18, 2024, PTA submitted another request for the blocking of Imran’s account via email.
The report said that the email included “citation of relevant court orders against Imran and details of his conviction and sentence to 14, 10, and seven years in Toshakhana, cypher, and unlawful marriage cases”.
However, it added that once again, no response was received from X.
The report added that on November 27, 2025, PTA wrote to the platform seeking the blocking of 47 tweets from Imran’s X account.
However, out of the 47, X only blocked one tweet.
PTA, in its report, also noted that the over-the-top (OTT) services operating in Pakistan were not regulated as they were registered in their country of origin.
It added that the companies “are not necessarily bound by the region/country in which the user is accessing their content”.
It also took note of the fact that “content management, social media operators do provide an official channel to the users as well as the regulators to lodge their complaints”.
The authority said that the “other option remains to block the internet traffic flowing to these operations, however, since they utilise secure channels, selective blocking on their content cannot be enabled.”
“But complete access to their services can be revoked on a best effort basis,” it added.
The authority added that in October 2021, PTA had requested social media companies to comply with Section 7 (6) of the Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules and register themselves with PTA and “appoint a local compliance grievance officer”.
“However, no affirmative response has been received to date,” it added.
On Wednesday, the IHC took up the petition regarding the X account and questioned how proceedings in the case could continue if authorities were denying his counsel access to him.
The former premier’s family and party leaders have recently faced increased restrictions in meeting him.
During yesterday’s proceedings, the court told the PTA counsel that the authority’s response to the petition was “unsatisfactory”.
In September last year, a petition was filed in the IHC challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
A written reply submitted to the court by Adiala jail authorities last year denied that the X account was being operated from within the jail premises.
Superintendent of the Adiala jail stated the PTI founder was under strict surveillance and had no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”.</p><small>2026-01-22 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22104902ef8e784.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968410/in-davos-speech-trump-repeatedly-refers-to-greenland-as-iceland' target='_blank'><strong>In Davos speech, Trump repeatedly refers to Greenland as ‘Iceland’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump repeatedly made an apparent gaffe in a speech Wednesday to world leaders assembled in Switzerland by referring to “Iceland” several times instead of his much coveted “Greenland”, with the White House furiously denying any confusion on his part.
The 79-year-old Republican has been clamoring for the United States to acquire Greenland, a large island territory of Denmark, citing what he called security threats from Russia and China in the Arctic Circle.
On Wednesday he announced a “framework” for a future deal on Greenland and the cancellation of planned tariffs on European countries that had opposed his moves to control the island — but not before ruffling Nato allies and straining transatlantic relations.
“I’m helping Nato, and until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said during his remarks to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.
“They’re not there for us on Iceland — that I can tell you. I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”

 


It seemed obvious he was referring to Greenland and not the smaller neighbouring Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic famous for its breathtaking volcanic landscapes.
After the speech, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against a post on X by a journalist, Libbey Dean, who wrote that “President Trump appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”
“No he didn’t, Libby. His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here,” Leavitt fired back on X, misspelling the journalist’s name.







During his speech at Davos, Trump, as he often does, frequently strayed from the written script scrolling on the teleprompters.
Asked about the events in Davos, Gavin Newsom, California’s Democratic governor and a leading opposition figure in the United States who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, seized on the moment.
“None of this is normal,” Newsom said. “There’s a normalisation, a deviancy of consciousness.”
Sensitive subject
The issue of mental acuity is a sensitive one for Trump.
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he attacked incumbent Joe Biden, claiming the Democrat suffered from dementia.
In recent days, some Democratic lawmakers have called for invoking the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows for removing a president who no longer has the physical or intellectual capacity to carry out the duties of office.
The politicians justified their calls by citing a message that Trump had sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
In the message, made public on Monday, Trump expressed his displeasure with not being awarded last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump also reiterated his desire for the US to take control of Greenland.
“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump wrote.
However, an independent committee — not the Norwegian government — is the body that awards the peace prize and other Nobel prizes at an annual ceremony in Oslo.</p><small>2026-01-22 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22091329846caae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968262/after-two-year-delay-sbca-issues-fire-safety-directives' target='_blank'><strong>After two-year delay, SBCA issues fire safety directives</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Only after a devastating fire at Gul Plaza caused massive human and financial losses, enraging the public over the lack of firefighting mechanisms and emergency exits, has the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) decided to enforce fire safety rules in buildings in the metropolis.
The delayed action has triggered backlash from builders, developers and civil society, who say that the building regulator has been sitting on a KMC fire safety audit report for over two years despite being formally notified.
They termed the SBCA’s sudden directives to building owners “too little, too late”, accusing the authority of criminal negligence and questioning how many lives could have been saved if the warnings had been acted upon earlier.

 

“Since the SBCA will not be able to achieve the desired objectives without the cooperation of your members in this matter, you are therefore requested to direct your members to immediately comply with the fire safety deficiencies highlighted in the audit reports within three days, as this is an urgent matter requiring immediate compliance,” said a SBCA letter to the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) chairman.

Building regulator accused of ‘sitting on’ a KMC fire audit report for over two years; critics term move ‘too little, too late’

The KMC in January 2024 compiled a report on fire safety in hundreds of buildings across Karachi, following a deadly blaze at RJ Mall on Rashid Minhas Road in 2023.
The report identified at least 265 buildings lacking fire safety systems, emergency exits or a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire brigade. It warned that these structures could face disastrous consequences in case of a fire.
However, the SBCA moved to implement the report’s recommendations only after the Gul Plaza tragedy and that too more than two years later.
Muhammad Hassan Bakhshi, the ABAD chairman, — who has been asked by the SBCA to “cooperate” in implementing the fire compliance rules “within three days” — said he was hearing about the report for the “first time”.
He said the SBCA had never approached him earlier in this connection, adding that now it appeared that the authority was “trying to complete years of inaction in a matter of days”.
“These surveys and their implementation will only open another door to corruption,” Mr Bakhshi warned.
He stressed the need to digitise regulatory processes, arguing that reducing human-to-human contact was essential to prevent further corruption.
Saad Abdul Wahab, a fire and structural safety expert and CEO of Grow Safe, criticised the SBCA’s sudden push for fire safety compliance, warning that the move appears to be a temporary correction.
“A proper corrective action requires identifying root causes, assessing hazards, and implementing suitable and sufficient control measures,” he said.
He questioned the seriousness of the regulator and asked which legal framework or safety standard the authority was using as a benchmark for compliance, pointing out that multiple national and international codes exist.
The expert warned that enforcing fire safety installations without ensuring structural integrity could be dangerous.
He said there was no clarity on whether buildings were structurally capable of bearing additional loads from fire-fighting systems.
Meanwhile, a review by Dawn of the fire safety report compiled by the KMC two years ago showed that it included many residential and commercial buildings.
An official from the management of a commercial building on Sharea Faisal told Dawn that the SBCA had never warned them or provided any information regarding fire safety compliance.
“More than two years ago, a team of KMC fire department visited us and conducted a survey. But after that, we were never approached by the SBCA.”

In a statement issued from its regional office in Hong Kong, the agency said the rating actions reflect the application of Fitch’s new Sovereign Rating Criteria, effective September 2025, and the inclusion of recovery assumptions into sovereign debt ratings for the first time.
The recovery rating RR4 denotes ‘average’ recovery expectation from default in a scale of six categories, starting from RR1 for outstanding, RR2 for superior, RR3 for good and RR4 for average. This is followed by RR5 for below average and RR6 for poor.
The senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Pakistan and The Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Company Ltd are equalised with Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting Fitch’s expectation of average recovery prospects in a default scenario, given Pakistan’s high levels of general government debt and interest payments as a percentage of revenue, and the absence of any other clearly identifiable criteria factors that would cause us to notch the debt ratings up or down from the IDR.
On April 15, 2025, Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR to ‘B-’ with a stable outlook, from ‘CCC+’. In terms of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) key rating drivers for the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR and, in turn, the debt ratings, Pakistan has an ESG Relevance Score of ‘5’ for political stability and rights and for the rule of law, institutional and regulatory quality and control of corruption, as is the case for all sovereigns.
These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have for sovereign rating model. Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile. The bond and sukuk ratings are sensitive to any changes in Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, which could change with sensitivities.
It notes that factors that could individually or collectively lead to a negative rating for downgrade include failure to keep government debt and debt-servicing metrics on a firm downward path, renewed deterioration in external liquidity conditions, for example, from delays in IMF programme reviews or insufficiently tight economic policy settings.
On the other hand, factors that could rating upgrade include significant declines in government debt and debt-servicing burdens, for example due to the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans in line with IMF programme commitments, leading to structural improvements in tax revenue generation and further significant easing of external financing risks, including evidence of greater ability to source external funding and a sustained recovery in foreign-currency reserves beyond Fitch’s forecasts.

DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies.
In a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force, but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark.
“We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Meanwhile, the European Parliament decided to suspend its work on a trade deal between the 27-member bloc and the United States, a parliament member said, following President Trump’s repeated threats to take control over Greenland.
The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table.
“Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote.







In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon.
Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets.
“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said.
“I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.”
Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post.
Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.
“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.
All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments.
Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland.
“What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.
Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”.
‘Immediate negotiations’
Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades.
He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China.







The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”.
Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland.
He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes.
Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions.
French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition.
‘Thoughtful diplomacy’
Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked.
Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark.
UN chief warns
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday of world leaders upending international order in a statement made as President Donald Trump said the United States needs to acquire Greenland in a hardline speech at Davos.
“When leaders run roughshod over international law, picking & choosing which rules to follow — they are undermining global order & setting a perilous precedent,” Guterres said on X.
“When a handful of individuals can bend global narratives, sway elections, or dictate the terms of public debate, we are facing inequality and the corruption of institutions.”

In January 1997, I published an article, titled The CSS English Paper: A Scrutiny, in Dawn.
The argument was simple: the English (Précis and Composition) paper of the Central Superior Services (CSS) examination tested neither authentic language proficiency nor the communicative skills required of a modern civil servant. Instead, it relied on archaic formats, ritualised exercises, and decontextualised language fragments, that distorted both teaching and learning.
Nearly three decades later, the English paper of 2025 forces a sobering conclusion: nothing of substance has changed.
This is no longer a matter of academic disagreement or pedagogical fashion. When a critique is placed in the public domain, grounded in language education and assessment principles, and then ignored for almost three decades, the question shifts. It is no longer “Is the criticism valid?”, but “What does such sustained inaction reveal about the institution itself?”
ENGLISH AS SYMBOLIC CAPITAL
The CSS English paper occupies a peculiar position. Unlike university examinations, it is not tied to a syllabus, a degree programme or a prescribed curriculum. It enjoys exceptional autonomy. That autonomy should have encouraged innovation.
Instead, it has produced rigidity. Where there is no curriculum to constrain reform, repetition becomes a choice.
The most striking contemporary feature is the prominence of synonym-antonym questions built around rare, arcane or low-utility vocabulary. These items do not test how candidates read, write, summarise, argue or communicate. They test whether candidates have memorised esoteric word lists — often through coaching centres that specialise in precisely this form of ritual preparation.

A critique of the CSS English paper published in 1997 remains unanswered nearly three decades later. What does such institutional inaction reveal about how standards, merit and authority are understood in Pakistan’s most powerful examination?

This is not English as a working language. It is English as symbolic capital.
Language proficiency, in any meaningful sense, is contextual. Meaning emerges from use, register, audience and purpose. Yet, the CSS English paper persists in stripping language of context, presenting words and sentences as isolated tokens to be decoded. This produces an illusion of rigour — multiple-choice questions appear objective and easy to mark — but it sacrifices validity for convenience. Reliability is purchased at the cost of relevance.
INSTITUTIONAL INERTIA
The précis exercise, long treated as the paper’s intellectual centrepiece, illustrates this confusion. Compressing a few hundred words to a prescribed length may look demanding, but it bears little resemblance to the kinds of summarising tasks civil servants actually perform: extracting key points, identifying implications, organising information for decision-makers.
Modern applied linguistics questioned the pedagogical value of such exercises decades ago. That the format persists unchanged speaks less to its merit than to institutional inertia.
Equally troubling is the asymmetry of power embedded in the examination. Candidates are penalised relentlessly for minor linguistic lapses, while the examination paper itself has, over the years, displayed ambiguities, careless proofreading and conceptual confusion. When errors occur in a high-stakes paper and provoke no accountability or public explanation, the message is clear: the examination is beyond challenge. Power, once insulated from scrutiny, stops learning.
In 1997, it was still charitable to attribute these problems to ignorance or habit. Today, that charity is harder to sustain.
Over the last three decades, communicative approaches to language teaching have become mainstream. The needs of public administration have grown more complex, not less. And yet, the paper remains anchored to a conception of English proficiency that privileges lexical obscurity over functional competence.
At this point, continuity itself becomes evidence.
It is no longer unreasonable to describe the paper as a gatekeeping mechanism — one that filters candidates not by their ability to think and communicate in English, but by their familiarity with an inherited testing ritual. Gatekeeping does not require malice. It requires only that tradition be mistaken for standards and difficulty for merit.
The real cost of this failure is not borne primarily by CSS candidates. It is borne by millions of students whose English education is shaped by the gravitational pull of this examination. When the highest-status assessment rewards ignoble skills, entire systems of teaching reorganise themselves accordingly. Rote learning flourishes; reading, writing and thinking wither.
What, then, should be done?
THE WAY FORWARD
First, the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), which is responsible for recruiting government servants and bureaucrats, must publicly articulate a clear competency framework for English: what kinds of reading, writing and reasoning does a civil servant actually need?
Second, language must be tested in context — through tasks such as summarising policy passages, revising flawed official prose or constructing concise, reasoned arguments.
Third, if objectivity and marking efficiency are concerns, they should be addressed through rubrics and training, not by retreating into lexical trivia. Finally, the FPSC must invite informed critique and treat assessment as a living practice, not a sacred inheritance.
After 29 years of silence, reform is no longer a favour to candidates. It is a responsibility owed to the state.
