The entrance was lined with food stalls which welcomed visitors with snacks and tea, while a man handed Rs100 entry tickets to oncoming vehicles for parking.
Inside the mandi, red tents near the entrance glowed under small chandeliers, while large pens stretched on for miles, filled with sacrificial animals.
From goats to sheep to oversized bulls and camels, the cattle market offered something for everyone.
However, amid the lively buzz of the mandi, what stood out the most were the soaring prices of the livestock.
Sellers quoted steep rates, as the price of cows jumped by several hundred thousand rupees within just a year, while healthy goats that cost Rs40,000 only two years ago were now being sold for Rs45,000 and above.
With transport, rent, and feed costs soaring, many struggle to keep up, and the spirit of sacrifice is increasingly overshadowed by steep price tags.

While economic indicators like inflation and remittances have shown improvement, prices at the cattle markets tell a different story.
According to the 2024 Pakistan Economic Survey (PES), the [livestock sector][5] accounted for approximately 61 per cent of the agriculture value added and 15pc of the GDP during FY24, with a growth rate of 3.8pc.
“The gross value addition of the livestock sector has shown an increase, rising to Rs5.8 trillion in 2023-24 from Rs5.59 trillion in 2022-23, marking a growth rate of 3.9pc,” stated the PES.
Despite this, however, sellers and buyers of sacrificial livestock are shouldering an economic burden, as these prices do not seem to drop.
One seller, Mohammad Abid, told Dawn.com that the prices of cattle vary depending on different sellers, mandis and factors related to the quality of cattle, as well as where the cattle are brought from.

“Cattle from Sindh would be cheaper as it is closer, while livestock from Punjab would be more expensive due to greater transportation costs,” he explained.
He also remarked on the increasing prices for goats over the past two years.
“In two years, there has been a Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 increase in the prices of goats,” he said. “If a goat cost Rs40,000 a year or two ago, it now costs between Rs43,000 and Rs45,000, with the highest price ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs70,000.”
Abid also opined that the government did not provide funds for the animals’ upkeep, stating, “Sellers must pay rent to set up their tents in the mandi.”

Another seller, Ibrahim, added that although the government had provided the space and electricity for generators and lights, they had to pay between Rs100,000 and Rs150,000 in rent every 10 days on top of bearing the cost of the animals’ food and water intake.
These prices reflected expenses like rent, feed, and caretaking — plus a profit margin — all of which are ultimately passed on to the customer.
“A cow worth Rs1.8 million last year now ranges between Rs2.3m to Rs2.5m. For more expensive animals, costing Rs2.5m to Rs3m, people may negotiate and take them for Rs1.8m to Rs1.9m,” Ibrahim highlighted. “Even with soaring prices, people are still willing to pay.”
Khurram Jameel, a customer who visited a few mandis to get an idea of the prices, said that he had seen cows sold for up to Rs7 million.
“I bought most of my cattle from a mandi near the Karachi-Hyderabad Super Highway,” he said, adding that he also had to pay Rs14,000 to transport the animals to the Defence Housing Authority, located on the other end of the city.
Jameel also agreed that rising prices had an impact on cattle-buying, but said it was also a matter of faith.
“This is Sunnat-i-Ibrahim and honestly, we enjoy it as Muslims,” he emphasised. “This is why it is called ‘Bari Eid’ — buy cattle yourselves, sacrifice them yourselves in your homes, take care of the animals and love them as we have been asked to do in our religion.
“If you are passionate about something, you do your best to get what you can.”

Despite complaints and disappointment over inflated prices, some customers echo similar sentiments, highlighting the true meaning of Eid and what it means to partake.
Another visitor at the mandi, Razia Abbasi, pointed out that the idea of a mandi had become more about “showing off wealth.”

“It’s become more of a show, a status symbol, as people believe the
bigger the better, even though it’s not a [part of] Islamic criteria
that you must get something bigger and more expensive.
Qurbani (sacrifice) is what you can afford with an open heart, it
is not about showing off.”

She added that she mostly chose to buy Qurbani shares rather than only livestock.
“It is more affordable, costing between Rs38,000 and Rs39,000 for a share of a cow; though this has also increased from last year’s Rs32,000,” she said. “There is also the bonus of convenience as there is not always someone to take care of the animals, nor may there be space to keep them.”
In light of price surges, several customers said they now resorted to window shopping at mandis and opted to buy qurbani shares and search for cattle on online marketplaces for cheaper prices.
Yet, for some, the essence of Eidul Azha remains untouched as they keep in mind the deeper devotion behind the rising costs, but for how long can faith outweigh financial strain as prices climb consistently?

The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the ECP exp­ired on March 12, with no action from the government.
On Wednesday, it emerged that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrote a letter to Ayub inviting him to join consultations to appoint a new CEC. No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs in the letter, dated May 16.
In today’s letter to the NA speaker — seen by Dawn.com — Ayub recalled a previous letter written on January 15 in which he requested that the parliamentary process to appoint a new CEC be initiated.
“I am writing once again to remind you that a considerable period has passed since the expiry of the Chief Election Commissioner’s tenure,” Ayub wrote.
In accordance with parliamentary procedure, the opposition leader nominated six members of the opposition; two from the National Assembly and two from the Senate.
The nominees from the lower house were PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza and MNA Latif Khosa.
Senators Shibli Faraz and Allama Raja Nasir were Ayub’s nominees from the upper house.
Ayub requested that “the process for the formation of the Parliamentary Committee under Article 213(2B) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (The parliamentary committee to be constituted by the speaker shall comprise fifty per cent members from the treasury benches and fifty per cent from the opposition parties) be initiated at the earliest, to facilitate the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and two members of the Election Commission of Pakistan from Sindh and Balochistan”.
The 26th Constitutional Amendment allowed the CEC and its members to continue until their successors take the position. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution (vacancy in the office of the Commissioner or a member
shall be filled within 45 days), the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05163904779e62d.jpg?r=165135' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915596/pakistan-fighting-raw-funded-intelligence-driven-war-bugti' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan fighting RAW-funded, intelligence-driven war: Bugti</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti on Thursday said Pakistan was fighting a full-fledged “intelligence-driven war” funded by India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and carried out through “Indian proxies”.
The security situation in Balochistan has deteriorated, with militants escalating attacks as part of a long-running insurgency. Last month, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” post-Pahalgam to intensify terrorism in Pakistan, citing “irrefutable evidence” of state-sponsored attacks directed by Indian military personnel. He said “credible intelligence” showed India tasked groups such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban and other militant cells to ramp up activity.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Bugti referred to the attacks in his province and said: “This is a completely Raw-funded intelligence-driven war against the state of Pakistan.”
He said India changed its narrative after suffering a crushing blow by Pakistan’s security forces during their recent military escalation.
“Pakistan army gave a befitting reply to Indian aggression. The failure of Operation Sindoor ignited the Indian proxy Fitna ul Hindustan,” he said, adding that the Indian media shared fake news about an attack on Karachi port.
 


Last month, India and Pakistan engaged in a military confrontation over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi launched air strikes killing civilians, prompting Pakistan to down five Indian jets in retaliation. After reciprocal strikes on airbases, American intervention on May 10 secured a ceasefire.
During his press conference, CM Bugti showed a video of what he said was an “Indian proxy” agent talking to an unknown person — that the chief minister claimed was a RAW handler — sharing intelligence about Karachi port as evidence of Indian involvement.
“The government has sufficient evidence against Fitna ul Hindustan which will be shared at appropriate time,” he said. “The enemy wants to destroy Pakistan’s emerging economy.”
The chief minister said these “Indian proxies” had no connection with the Baloch identity, but were terrorists attacking Pakistani citizens and security forces.
“They should not be connected with Baloch identity. The Baloch have their own culture but they [terrorists] have [done away with] all norms. They are terrorists killing innocent Pakistanis and attacking security forces,” the chief minister said.
In reply to a question, he said the government could launch an operation in Balochistan against the terrorists, but security forces were focusing on small kinetic operations.
“There can be an operation in Balochistan like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but it is not in law enforcement agencies’ capacity,” he said. “The solution is small, kinetic operations which security forces are conducting.”
“If required, we will not hesitate to use the military to conduct an operation.”
Bugti said terrorist capacity had risen due to US gadgets available on the black market and weapons supplied by RAW.
“The solution is small kinetic IBOs (intelligence-based operations).”
Regarding the issue of missing persons, the chief minister said that “a narrative had been built” against the state on a controversial subject.  “There is a missing count. There are people missing in KP. No one speaks about them,” he said.
He said the Balochistan government passed legislation to set up centres where radicalised youth would be trained to reintegrate them into society.
“They will be kept there, their parents will be there, a magistrate will be present. A high-powered board chaired by BHC (Balochistan High Court) chief justice will be giving them extension,” he said.
Bugti also said there was a difference between “self-disappearance” and enforced disappearances.
“Many have self-disappeared. That’s why we passed a law and political dialogue will continue,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0516181614cd0a2.jpg?r=161823' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915607/colorado-fire-bomb-suspect-to-make-court-appearance' target='_blank'><strong>Colorado fire-bomb suspect to make court appearance</strong></a><br><p>The man charged with fire-bombing a Colorado march by people who wanted to raise awareness of Israeli hostages in Gaza is scheduled to be formally charged in state court on Thursday, as those he targeted vowed to carry on their efforts.
State prosecutors say Mohamed Soliman, 45, faces nearly 400 years in prison on attempted murder charges in state court. He also faces other state charges.
Prosecutors on Wednesday said the number of people injured in the attack rose to 15 ranging in age from 25 to 88. A dog also was injured. Soliman also faces federal hate crimes charges that carry a life sentence. A federal court appearance is scheduled for Friday.
 
 

The Boulder public defenders office, listed in court documents as representing Soliman, did not respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors say that Soliman, an Egyptian national, on Sunday tossed Molotov cocktails and yelled “Free Palestine” at people taking part in an event organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the devastating onslaught in Gaza.
The incident comes as pressure on Israel rises to cease what has been called a “genocide” in Gaza by the United Nations and Amnesty International among other international human rights organisations.
Soliman entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and recently lived in Colorado Springs. Federal officials say he had overstayed that tourist visa and his work permit had expired, and he was in the country illegally.
His family, including his wife, two teenagers and three younger children, were taken into custody on Tuesday and may be deported, though a federal judge on Wednesday blocked their immediate removal.
The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans amid Israel’s escalating military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed over 54,000 Palestinians, prompting growing criticism from the international community.
It followed the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy aides that took place outside Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum last month.
Walk on
Shira Weiss, the global coordinator for the Run for Their Lives grassroots movement, said the Boulder attack had stunned her organisation, which has 230 chapters around the globe.
 
 

Weiss said it was bewildering why the organisation — which she said is apolitical, aims to stay out of policy arguments and that had never threatened before — was targeted by Soliman.
“This is so sad that we were trying to do something positive and something good, and this horrible thing happened,” she said.
Following the attack, Weiss asked local chapters to pause their short weekly walks, but overwhelmingly heard back that people wanted to carry on.
About 80 per cent of chapters will hold their weekly walks as scheduled this weekend. That includes a Sunday walk in Boulder, which will coincide with the city’s 30th annual Jewish festival, which organisers said would go on with heightened security measures and a focus on the efforts of Run for Their Lives.
Weiss has received 20 enquiries about starting new chapters since the attack in Boulder, and has also seen an increase in the number of people wanting to walk with existing groups.
Maya Bajayo, organiser for the Denver chapter of Run for Their Lives, said the group will join the Boulder chapter on its Sunday walk. Despite anxieties about security, she expects that all 50 regular members of her group would participate.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05153334800d935.png?r=153359' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915603/heatwave-likely-to-intensify-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-from-june-7-to-12' target='_blank'><strong>Heatwave likely to intensify in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from June 7 to 12</strong></a><br><p>With the heatwave in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa likely to intensify from June 7 to 12, the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) on Thursday issued an advisory cautioning the public.
Day temperatures are likely to remain 5 to 7°C above normal from June 7-12 in Peshawar, Swabi, Mardan, Charsadda, Nowshera, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Khyber, Kurram, Orakzai, Waziristan, Tank, Dera Ismail Khan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur and Mohmand, according to a PDMA advisory dated June 5, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“Additionally, dust storm/rain-thunderstorm associated with gusty winds are expected over the province,” PDMA said.
It noted that rising temperatures in upper areas may enhance the snowmelt rate during the forecasted period, and advised precautionary measures be taken to avoid any loss of life, damages to crops/ infrastructure and livestock.
The general public, especially senior citizens and children, should avoid direct exposure to sunlight during peak hours between 10am-5pm.
The PDMA said it was necessary to ensure that the general public was “made aware to make judicious use of water for drinking and cooling-off.”
Individuals with underlying health conditions were encouraged to remain especially vigilant and ensure they have necessary medical supplies readily available.
The PDMA advised to promote the use of appropriate protective measures, such as lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing, along with SPF and hats.
“Educate the public about the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses (ie
dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke) and necessary steps to take when
experiencing these symptoms,” the advisory said.
The KP Health Department, in coordination with local administration, was directed to mobilise resources to establish heatstroke centers, cooling points, and mobile cooling stations at high-traffic areas.
“Ensure the facilities are equipped with adequate cooling equipment (air
conditioners, fans, misting systems) and drinking water [and] have trained personnel available to provide immediate medical assistance if needed.”
Additionally, farmers were advised to manage their wheat harvesting keeping in view the weather conditions, and to take care of their livestock as well.
The advisory requested that emergency services, such as Rescue 1122 and the fire brigade remain alert against possible fires.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05145419498382e.jpg?r=145427' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915598/prisoners-in-punjab-granted-90-day-remission-on-eidul-azha' target='_blank'><strong>Prisoners in Punjab granted 90-day remission on Eidul Azha</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Home Department on Thursday granted a special remission of 90 days in sentences of prisoners in Punjab jails on the account of Eidul Azha.
Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7, the moon sighting Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) announced last month after the crescent for the month of Zilhaj was not sighted.
According to the spokesperson of the Home Department, 450 prisoners will benefit from the order for the remission of sentences, while 270 prisoners have been released to celebrate Eid with their families.
On the instructions of the Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the Home Secretary issued a notification for the remission of the sentences of prisoners.
The notification dated June 5, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said, “In exercise of power conferred under Rule 216 of Pakistan Prisons Rules 1978, ninety (90) days Special Remission to prisoners confined in Punjab jails is hereby granted on the occasion of Eidul Azha.”
It further read that the prisoners not allowed the special remission include those who were punished under jail offences during the last one year, those who benefitted by the Rule 216 during the year and those convicted of financial embezzlement and damage to the national exchequer.
It added that the pardon does not apply to the prisoners who were “sentenced on account of offences/cases under Chapter XVI of PPC ( 289 to 377) espionage, subversion, anti-state activities, sectarianism, terrorist acts (as defined in the anti-terrorism (second amendment) Ordinance, 1999, Drug and Narcotics offences, Zina (Sec 10 offence of Zina Enforcement of Hudood) Ordiannce 1979, 376 PPC, robbery (Section 394 PPC), dacoity (Section 395-396 PPC), kidnapping/abduction (Section 364-A and 365-A) Foreigners Act 1946.”</p><small>2025-06-05 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05134123a68e9b3.jpg?r=134255' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915589/karachi-victim-in-dha-assault-case-forgives-suspect-but-court-rejects-bail-plea' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi victim in DHA assault case ‘forgives’ suspect but court rejects bail plea</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi resident who was assaulted in the Defence Housing Authority earlier this week says he has forgiven the suspect and does not want to take the case to court, even as a judge rejected the suspect’s bail in a separate hearing.
On Monday, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with two of his employees over charges of beating a citizen named Dheeraj. The suspect, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded.
Farooqi, who was travelling in a luxury car, allegedly assaulted a motorcyclist accompanied by a woman on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad Road following a minor accident.
A judicial magistrate on Tuesday remanded Farooqi and his guard, Owais Hashmi in police custody in the case. They were produced in court today by the police following the completion of their two-day remand.
Today, Dheeraj appeared in court and identified the suspect.
“I was not aware that the court had summoned me,” he said. “The lawyer told me today, so I appeared.”
The judicial magistrate asked Dheeraj whether he was facing any sort of pressure.
“It was my fault, my bike hit his car,” Dheeraj told the court.
“I do not want to file a case. I forgive the suspect,” he said, adding  “Whatever the court decides, I will have no objection.”
Public Prosecutor Irfana Qadri told the court that a case had been registered against the suspect for threatening and humiliating a woman, identified as Dheeraj’s sister Kalpana.
“These are non-bailable charges,” Qadri said. The court reserved its verdict after the lawyers’ arguments.
In a separate hearing, however, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio rejected the bail application filed by Farooqi and Hashmi.
A case had been registered against the suspects at the Gizri police station on the complaint of an eyewitness citizen.
Dheeraj filed a no objection certificate (NOC). However, the sessions court noted that the affidavit appeared to have been submitted under undue influence or coercion and did not accept the NOC.</p><small>2025-06-05 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05135918df554ec.jpg?r=135956' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915573/bilawal-led-team-stresses-need-for-pak-india-dialogue-in-meetings-with-us-congress-members' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal-led team stresses need for Pak-India dialogue in meetings with US Congress members</strong></a><br><p>A high-level delegation led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has stressed the need for dialogue with India in a series of meetings with US Congress members in Washington, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Thursday.
Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
During Wednesday’s discussions at Capitol Hill, the delegation underscored the urgency of dialogue on the Kashmir issue, noting it was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations”.
It stressed the imperative of respect for international law, UN Security Council resolutions and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), Radio Pakistan added.
Bilawal emphasised that sustainable peace in South Asia hinged on dialogue, restraint and a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute, rather than “unilateralism or intimidation”.
He briefed members of Congress on India’s recent acts of unprovoked aggression, including the targeting of civilians, as well as the “deeply concerning” and unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
Bilawal appreciated the US, particularly “President Donald Trump, for his constructive role in helping de-escalate tensions and supporting efforts towards a ceasefire”, according to the report.
The delegation reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on regional peace, counterterrorism efforts and recent Indian aggression, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment “to peace, responsible conduct, and rejection of baseless allegations”.
Meanwhile, members of the Congress welcomed the Pakistani delegation, urging “both countries to demonstrate restraint and prioritise regional peace and stability”, Radio Pakistan stated.
They reiterated the US support for the people of Pakistan and its commitment to aiding the country’s economic progress.
Earlier today, Bilawal posted on X that his team met with Congressmen Jack Bergman and Tom Suozzi, who co-chair the Congressional Pakistan Caucus, along with Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar and Republican Party’s Ryan Keith Zinke.
During the meeting, the Pakistani delegation underscored that enduring regional peace rested on “principled dialogue, mutual restraint, and a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, not unilateralism and coercion”.
 






Bergman and Suozzi were among a group of lawmakers who visited Pakistan in April and met with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, along with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
Bergman has repeatedly voiced support for former prime minister Imran Khan, calling for his release.
On the delegation’s meeting with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, Bilawal termed the exchange constructive. The PPP chairman said they discussed “Pakistan’s deep concerns over India’s increasingly belligerent posture and its refusal to engage, whether through dialogue, joint investigation, or third-party facilitation”.
 






He also met with Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, “for a frank discussion on peace and stability in our region”.
“Shared Pakistan’s concerns over the new abnormal imposed by Mr. Modi, where every incident by nameless actors triggers unprovoked aggression, risking war between two nuclear-armed neighbours,” Bilawal said on X.
Bilawal further met with Republican Senator Jim Banks for a “candid discussion” on regional peace and security […] and appreciated the “critical peacemaker role played by President Trump in facilitating the ceasefire understanding, intended as a pathway to broader, sustained peace and dialogue”.
“Reiterated that there is no military solution to our challenges. Only diplomacy and dialogue can deliver lasting peace in South Asia,” the ex-foreign minister added.
 






A day ago, the delegation concluded its two-day visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York, where it met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, along with elected and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4. It met with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin.
On its part, India had also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, as well as meet members of the UNSC, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
Pakistan wants Trump to arrange talks with India
Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam incident was a false-flag operation”, and credited Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a ceasefire.
Addressing an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, the premier said Trump had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.
He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”
 






PM Shehbaz said Pakistan downed six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.
“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”
He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.</p><small>2025-06-05 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051037354d42c99.jpg?r=103739' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915479/karachi-man-tries-to-take-own-life-after-killing-wife-son' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi man tries to take own life after killing wife, son</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A man attempted suicide after killing his wife and a minor son in Surjani Town on Wednesday, police said.
They added that Faisal Sagheer, 45, allegedly killed his wife Sana, 35, and 10-year-old son Mohammed Ali. Later on, he attempted suicide by cutting his throat and got injured.
Surjani Town police SHO Mohammed Ali Shah told Dawn that Faisal owned a hardware shop in the area but on the day of the incident, he did not open it.
His children study the Quran at the home of his sister in the vicinity of the same area, but on that day they did not attend the class as well.
It triggered suspicion among his relatives. Faisal’s sister made calls on the cell phone of her sister-in-law, which was on, but no one responded. Ultimately, she visited the residence of her brother in Yusuf Goth near Karimi Chowrangi, knocked at the door but did not get any response.
Then she saw from a window that both her brother and sister-in-law were struggling for their lives. She raised alarm, alerting neighbours who entered the home with the help of a ladder. They took them to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where the woman and her son were pronounced dead on arrival while Faisal was admitted in critical condition.
The officer said that Sana sustained cuts while her son’s cause of death is yet to be ascertained. The couple’s two daughters remained safe.
 
 

He said it appeared that Faisal did not want to kill his son. He hinted at the possibility that he might have given tranquiliser to his family, which might have led to the death of the minor son due to the overdose. He said the couple’s daughters did not wake up till afternoon, which indicated the possibility that they might have been given a tranquiliser, but they remained safe.
The officer said the husband killed his wife by putting a piece of cloth on her face and suffocated her.
He said it seemed that the man stabbed his wife to death for some reason and later on tried to kill himself as he did not want to stab and kill his children, but one of his children died due to an overdose of drugs.
However, he said the exact cause of death of the son would be ascertained after a post-mortem examination as there were no injury marks on the body.
In a statement, the officer said when the police arrived at the spot, the house was locked from the inside.
The couple’s two daughters Bareeda and Aimal were present in the house. They told the police that they usually wake up at 10 or 11am but on that day, they woke up at 4pm, indicating a strong possibility that they were given sleeping pills or something.
The police have recovered the knife used in the incident.
“Different aspects of the incident are being probed and after completion of the investigation, an FIR will be registered,” according to the police statement.
“The case has been almost solved as a strong possibility has emerged during investigation so far that the injured man Faisal killed his wife and son and then attempted suicide,” said SSP Mastoi.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the husband is alive but in critical condition with cut injuries while the wife had sustained fatal cuts.
Dr Summaiya added that the minor boy has no visible marks of violence. All samples have been collected and cause of death reserved.

Thousands of pilgrims began to gather before dawn around the hill and the surrounding plain where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is believed to have given his last sermon.
While some arrived early to take advantage of the relatively cool morning, carrying colourful umbrellas, many pilgrims will remain for hours of prayers and Holy Quran recitals until the evening in the most arduous portion of Haj.

After sunset, they will head to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles so they can perform the symbolic “stoning of the devil”.
“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” said 33-year-old Ali from Pakistan, one of 1.5 million pilgrims who had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage.
“I’ve been trying to get here… for the past 3 years,” he added as he gazed at the mount. “I feel very blessed.”
Hundreds of pilgrims dressed in white dotted the mount itself, with many more at its foot praying or taking pictures.
Earlier this week, Saudi authorities called on pilgrims to stay inside their tents between 10am and 4pm (12pm and 6pm PKT) and on Thursday, when the desert sun is at its harshest.
Fans spraying mist and providing cool air were dispersed at the foot of the mount.
 
 

Temperatures this year have already exceeded 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, kicked off earlier this week.
Officials have beefed up heat mitigation efforts, aiming to avoid a repeat of last year’s Haj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims die as temperatures reached 51.8C.
“I came here early to [avoid] the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.
To make this year’s pilgrimage safer, authorities have expanded infrastructure, deployed thousands of extra personnel and relied on an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.
Authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.
Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres, thousands more medics will be on standby, and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, the Haj minister has told AFP.

Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.
“It’s a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,” the woman in her fifties told AFP from the foot of the mount.
Authorities said a majority of the deaths in 2024 were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to amenities like air-conditioned tents and buses.
This year, they have also cracked down on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, relying on frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery.
But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.
Saudi Arabia earns billions of dollars a year from Haj, and Umrah, which is undertaken at other times of the year.</p><small>2025-06-05 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02155621ca5eddc.png?r=155632' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913414/a-test-of-vision-finance-gurus-lay-out-expectations-from-upcoming-budget' target='_blank'><strong>‘A test of vision’: Finance gurus lay out expectations from upcoming budget</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is all set to unveil next year’s budget on June 10. In the days leading up to his much-anticipated budget speech on the floor of the National Assembly, much is being discussed in the public domain on what could be and shouldn’t be on the government’s priority list.
At a pre-budget meeting last week, Aurangzeb promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and the documented sector to others through digitisation. He hinted at significant steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
At a public event the same week, he also announced that the upcoming federal budget would introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction.
Dawn.com reached out to leading economists for their thoughts on the upcoming budget. Here’s what they had to say:
Not just a spreadsheet exercise
Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management and Sciences, said that the government faces a uniquely narrow policy corridor as the country prepares to table its federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26.
“On one side lie our binding fiscal constraints, which demand a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) and steep revenue enhancements if we are to find a path out of our debt. On the other hand is a range of domestic and geopolitical pressures, from defence sector demands to the fallout of intensifying global tariff wars, particularly between the US and China.”
 
 

“The defence budget, though nominally growing, has shrunk dramatically in real terms over the past five years — by nearly $4.6 billion according to Jane’s Defence Budgets. Restoring defence purchasing power is a top priority, especially after recent skirmishes on Pakistan’s eastern border,” he stated, referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation.
However, a knee-jerk reaction would be folly, Hasanain noted, adding that full nominal recovery of that spending would consume an additional 1.13pc of GDP — nearly the entire fiscal buffer painstakingly constructed under the International Monetary Fund programme. “Doing so risks derailing hard-won macroeconomic gains, would almost certainly crowd out critical social and development spending, and ultimately — due to its unsustainable nature —defeat the goal of sustainably improving our regional security outlook.”
“The government has shown its intent to broaden the tax base through new levies on retailers, wholesalers, and petroleum sales, while also offering some relief to the salaried class. These are steps in the right direction, but they will test political capital and administrative capacity alike,” the academic commented.
At the same time, he highlighted that the global trade environment is darkening. With the US and EU considering tariff escalations on Chinese electric vehicles and other AI-intensive exports, Pakistan must prepare for further volatility. “We should be creating fiscal space to reposition our export sectors, attract diverted FDI, and invest in logistics and trade facilitation. A budget that is locked into the past — whether via subsidies or unreformed pensions — risks missing the window to adapt.”
“In short, this budget is not just a spreadsheet exercise. It is a test of vision. Pakistan must demonstrate that it can meet its defence needs without compromising its economic future — and that it is ready to claim a place in the new global industrial realignment. That will require discipline, but also courage to prioritise what builds long-term resilience over short-term optics,” Hasanain added.
Towards a private-sector-oriented economy
“The upcoming budget will continue to prioritise macroeconomic stability,” said macroeconomist Ammar H Khan. “It is expected that the budget will continue to focus on maintaining a primary surplus, while utilising available room in financing costs to reallocate the same to incremental defence allocation, and infrastructure development.”
He emphasised that rationalising expenditures should remain a key priority; any laxity in this regard can lead to higher deficits and, eventually, higher debt to finance.
“Any adventures in extracting growth through higher government spending, or import-driven consumption, may lead to a short-lived growth spurt followed by another few years of low-to-no growth,” Khan said. “Macroeconomic stabilisation should be prioritised, and a move away from import-driven consumption-oriented growth, to an investment-driven and export-oriented growth model is the only way forward.”
“A potential tariff liberalisation regime, wherein excess duties and tariffs are expected to be either completely removed or rationalised, can be a highlight for the budget, as that would signal a shift away from a protected trade regime, to a more export-oriented regime,” he stated, adding that taxes on imports are effectively taxed on exports, and rationalising the same is the only way forward if “we want to move towards an export-oriented growth structure”.
 
 

The evolving composition of tax revenues would be critical, the macroeconomist noted. “Any excess reliance on salaried employees, or higher indirect taxes, is only going to expand the informal economy, while chipping away at any efforts for deepening the tax net,” he explained, adding that the current taxation structure is regressive at best, actively discouraging any value addition.
“It makes more economic sense to evade the tax net by producing low-value-added products, as any transition towards higher value-added attracts a significant tax, which makes the business uncompetitive. Similarly, the tax delta that exists between the formal and informal economy is substantial, which penalises entrepreneurs taking risks,” he explained. “One expects that some of this would change if we are to move towards an indigenous, economic-output-oriented growth structure, rather than one that only relies on imports.”
Speaking of the upcoming budget, he said it is expected to gradually transition towards a more private-sector-oriented economy, with a greater focus on enhancing formal savings, in a way that the same can be converted into investments. “The inability to expand the savings net, while imposing more taxes to extract another ounce (there is no pound left anymore) of flesh, will only constrain growth in the mid-to-long term.
“The expectation here is that the budget will prioritise stabilisation, and slowly transition towards growth, rather than going all out for growth, and sacrificing any gains made in the last few years in the process,” Khan added.
Is the government ready to break from routine?
“The budget 25-26 should be grounded in facts, centred around people’s needs, supportive businesses, and fully transparent,” stressed economic journalist Afshan Subohi.
“The government must move away from policies that disproportionately burden the voiceless majority to compensate for inefficiencies in governance and systematic flaws in the energy sector,” she stressed. “Rather than relying on token cash handouts, the budget should prioritise the revival of agriculture and industry to spur job creation and offer citizens the opportunity to earn a dignified livelihood.”
She emphasised that the tax structure must be reformed to make it more progressive by increasing the share of direct taxes by at least 5pc points. “It is unjust to impose income tax on families subsisting below the poverty line; the income tax exemption threshold should be raised to Rs1,300,000 from the current Rs500,000. The tax rates on the middle class must be scaled down.”
The journalist was also of the opinion that the rate of super tax should be moderated, while the tax net should be broadened. Moreover, she continued, the government must reduce the petroleum development levy to ensure that the benefits of falling global oil prices are passed on to the masses.
 
 

“Whenever there is a resource crunch, the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) is the first to face cuts. In the current fiscal year, under 50pc of the chopped PSDP has so far been disbursed. Given the private investor’s reluctance to invest in the current conditions, the government must not only increase development spending but also ensure its timely disbursement.
“It should also engage with the military hierarchy to explore the possibility of funding additional security-related needs through their commercial ventures, at least for the next fiscal year,” she said.
Afshan highlighted the need for the federal government to shut down redundant departments, which will cut recurring costs, tighten oversight of overseas travel and wasteful spending, and promote technology by supporting startups through incentives, policy support, and funding access.
“It is high time the government takes decisive steps to improve the collection and dissemination of relevant economic data and encourages provinces to systematically report key economic indicators through regular publication of provincial economic surveys.
“These suggestions align with IMF guidance and serve Pakistan’s long-term interests. The real test is whether the government is ready to break from routine and embrace a new path,” she added.
Military budget — the big job
Economist and academic Aadil Nakhoda said that the finance ministry has found itself facing significant challenges as the upcoming budget not only involves plans to cut import duties and tariffs, impose petroleum levy and carbon taxes, but also increase the military budget amid the possibility of intense border conflicts.
“The tariff liberalisation involves a drastic reduction of customs tariffs to 7pc in the next five years, while reducing the number of duty slabs from five to four and peak tariffs on imports from 20pc to 15pc. The revenues from customs tariffs may decrease by more than Rs 250 billion.
“However, the government expects that the increase in economic activity because of these drastic cuts may lead to not only higher revenue generation from direct taxes but also indirect taxes as import volumes subsequently increase due to the measures.”
According to Nakhoda, incentives to purchase imports from informal and grey channels may see a significant reduction as tariffs fall. Hence, the revenue may increase even without incurring significant losses, as importers may formally declare their imports to the government.
“Further, it is expected that exporting activities may increase as businesses find not only greater competition in the domestic market due to the increase in competing imported varieties, but may also adopt more efficient production methods in the face of increasing competition. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to improve the domestic business environment through market reforms such that innovation is encouraged.”
The economist further predicted that the government was also likely to increase the petroleum levy on fuel products and impose carbon taxes on older vehicles. “Both these measures may increase government revenue, but at the same time push consumers towards more environmentally friendly substitutes, lowering carbon emissions and improving the standard of living.”
Therefore, replacing older technologies with more efficient ones is also likely to boost efficiency and productivity. It may also result in lowering the demand for imported fuel products, which is a major component of the import bill, he added.
 
 

Lastly, Nakhoda highlighted that the military budget will inadvertently increase as the risk of border conflicts is high, but alerted that this may hurt development programs as well as funding of other sectors such as health and education.
“However, the recent conflict has seen a shift from using army personnel as a primary resource towards the use of machines and technology. This itself can have an impact on not only the financing of the military budget but also the size of the army,” he said.
Need to embed sustainability measures
“There are a few things that will remain standard in the budget, which will focus on stabilisation because it is being prepared along with the IMF,” said Sajid Amin Javed, who writes on macroeconomic policy.
According to him, not much relief can be expected in the budget, and whatever will be there will be minimal. “The government’s efforts to provide relief to the salaried class … that discussion is still pending with the IMF. So the first two to three slabs of the salaried class may get some sort of relaxation.”
He believes that there might not be a lot of effect on the tax rate, especially the upper slabs. But it is expected that taxable income will be increased from Rs600,000 to the Rs1-1.2 million range. “The government is trying to avoid new taxes as it has realised that there already is a lot of burden on people within the tax net.”
The macroeconomist also believes that Pakistan will see an increase in terms of defence expenditure.
“Another thing I see, as far as commitment and announcement is concerned, is bringing new sectors into the tax net, such as agriculture and textiles,” he said. “There will be some leniency for the real estate sector, whether it is explicit or implicit. Because the government realises that if economic activity needs to be increased and the growth rate target for next year needs to be increased, the real estate sector plays a pivotal role in it.”
So, tax rates can be adjusted, and proposals have been sent to the IMF.
 
 

For the common man, Amin noted, the upcoming budget will be “balanced” as compared to the previous two years. But it won’t have a lot to give, he warned.
“In my opinion, the government should try its best to provide relief to the salaried class, and the taxable income should be increased. Another direction that the government needs to set is to what extent these taxes will support investments, because I feel the focus this year, too, will be on revenues, as our target is huge.
“Last year, we saw that we couldn’t meet our targets even with high inflation. The government must balance, because we have been very focused on revenues for the IMF programme and meeting its targets. Our focus was also stabilisation, which is why taxation policies were tight. But now I feel the government must embed sustainability measures in the budget. And one big indicator in this is to support livelihoods for the common man,” the macroeconomist pointed out.
On a positive note, Amin said that he felt the budget will not be as tough as the previous two times, but at the same time, it will also not be as relaxed as the government wants it to be.
“In the context of PSDP, some schemes that were subject to delays or were at an early stage may be shelved, and the angle of expenditure reprioritisation of the IMF will be incorporated. We can expect this year’s PSDP to be a little less than that of last year,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-05 05:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051039407a9b362.png?r=104605' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915468/teenage-tiktokers-murder-suspect-sent-on-14-day-judicial-remand-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Teenage Tiktoker’s murder suspect sent on 14-day judicial remand in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A local court on Wednesday approved a 14-day judicial remand for Omar Hayat, the prime suspect in the murder of social media influencer Sana Yousaf, to facilitate his identification parade.
The accused was presented before Judicial Magistrate Ahmed Shehzad Gondal by the federal police. Tensions rose in the courtroom when the magistrate noticed the absence of both the prosecutor and the district public prosecutor.
Expressing his displeasure, Magistrate Gondal said: “Where are the prosecutors of my court? Usually, no one shows up, but today the courtroom is full.”
Upon being informed by the duty prosecutor that the regular prosecutor was on leave, the magistrate ordered the presence of the district prosecutor before the proceedings could continue. The hearing was briefly adjourned, and the accused was taken back into police custody while awaiting the district prosecutor’s arrival.

Identification parade to be conducted once victim’s mother, aunt return from Chitral

Senator Falak Naz was also present in the courtroom during the hearing.
 
 

Later, upon reviewing the investigation officer’s request, the magistrate approved the remand and ordered Omar Hayat to be sent to jail for 14 days for the purpose of conducting an identification parade.
The suspect had allegedly murdered 17-year-old Sana Yousaf at her house in G-13 on Monday. He was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were also recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,” said the police.
Moreover, the mother and aunt of Sana Yousaf are likely to identify the suspect arrested by the police in connection with the teenage girl’s murder, Dawn has learnt.
Police officers said that on Wednesday, the suspect was sent to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand for the identification parade.
 
 

They said that a case had been registered over the murder in response to a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, Farzana Yousaf. According to the FIR, the victim’s aunt was present in the house, while her father was outside.
However, the FIR does not clearly state whether the victim’s mother was present in the house at the time of the murder, the officers added. They said the family of Sana Yousaf had left for their hometown in Chitral along with the body for burial.
The police will request the mother and aunt to return as soon as possible for the identification parade.
The victim’s aunt, who also resides in Chitral, had come to Islamabad a few days ago to visit her brother (Sana Yousaf’s father) and was present in the house at the time of the murder.
The officers said that, so far, the investigators only have evidence in the form of geo-fencing data, recovery of an iPhone from the suspect, and CCTV footage. The suspect has yet to be interrogated, as no witness has so far recorded a statement regarding the murder.
However, there are two potential witnesses. The aunt who was present at the scene and the mother, on whose complaint the case was registered.
So far, the police have made successful efforts to trace and arrest the suspect and obtained his judicial remand for further legal action, the officers said. The investigation into the murder will gain momentum after the identification parade and recording of witness statements.
The police are also tracing other individuals considered as suspects who may have either assisted the suspect or been used by him intentionally. After committing the murder, the suspect reportedly left the victim’s house in a car driven by another person and reached Chungi No 26, from where he boarded a passenger vehicle.
The police will also investigate the ownership of the weapon used in the murder — whether it was licensed or illegal — and determine who owned or lent it to the suspect.
Bringing the weapon to the victim’s house suggests that he came there with the intent to harm her, the officers added.

• 105 rearrested out of 216 escapees so far
• Meetings between families, inmates resume
KARACHI: Police and allied agencies are taking all-out efforts to recapture over a hundred prisoners who escaped from District Prison Malir on Monday night and are still at large, officials said on Wednesday.
The jailbreak began on Monday night and continued into the early hours of Tuesday after hundreds of prisoners — spooked by low-intensity quakes — were allowed into the prison courtyard. Later, the prisoners snatched guns from prison staff and forced open the main gate after a shootout and fled.
Officials said that 216 inmates had managed to break out of the prison and by Tuesday night 83 of them had been rounded up and police teams were carrying out raids to bring in those still at large.
On Wednesday, jail officials accompanying Sindh Prisons Minister Ali Hasan Zardari during his visit to the Malir jail told the media that out of 216 escapees, a total of 105 prisoners had been recaptured and 111 prisoners were still at large.
They said meetings of prisoners with their families have been resumed amid strict security arrangements.
The minister was briefed about the jailbreak and escape of over 200 prisoners following a small-intensity earthquake in the area.
However, he did not speak much about the high-profile incident, saying the Sindh government had formed an inquiry committee and it would not be advisable for him to talk prior to their findings.
Accompanied by newly appointed DIG-Prisons Aslam Malik, Malir jail superintendent Shahabuddin Siddiqi and Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi, the minister said escaped prisoners were returning back to the jail voluntarily. He promised that no action would be taken against such prisoners.
He said the jail would be upgraded to accommodate more prisoners while new barracks would be constructed. He said the prisoners are getting all facilities as per jail manual.
Following the jailbreak, the Sindh government had formed a two-member inquiry committee comprising Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi and city police chief Javed Alam Odho to conduct a thorough investigation.
The Sindh chief minister had ordered the removal of Inspector General of Prisons Qazi Nazir and suspended DIG-Prisons Hassan Sehto and Jail Superintendent Arshad Hussain.
The now-suspended prison superintendent had claimed in his report that prisoners became agitated due to tremors and started raising a commotion and shouting from the barracks. When security staff rushed to control the situation, many of the inmates broke down the doors of the barracks at Circle No IV, overpowered the jailer and other security staff and rushed towards the main gate.
Ordinance promulgated
Also on Wednesday, acting Sindh Governor Awais Qadir Shah promulgated an ordinance — the Sindh Prisons & Corrections Service (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 — empowering the Sindh chief minister to appoint an officer of the Police Service of Pakistan, Pakistan Administrative Service or Provincial Management Service as the prisons IG and DIG in place of officers belonging to the regular prisons service.
Governor Kamran Tessori is out of country and in his absence Sindh Assembly Speaker Shah became the acting governor.
Officials said that after the new law, the provincial government can post police officers as SSP and SP of prisons across the province.
They said that the decision was taken against the backdrop of the Malir jailbreak.

In a statement, the HRCP said this action, coupled with the requirement that Ahmadis should submit affidavits disavowing their beliefs, violates the community’s constitutional right to freedom of religion or belief under Article 20 as well as their right to equal citizenship.
 






The commission feared that this continued institutionalised discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community would empower vigilante actors and extremist groups to enforce a defacto ban on the community’s freedom of movement and public participation.
 
 

It said the LHCBA must withdraw its letter and the Punjab government should instruct local authorities to protect members of the Ahmadiyya community at a time when they were especially vulnerable to vigilantism.
In its letter to the Punjab IGP, the LHCBA sought to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and action against its members if found violating the law.
Child marriage act challenged before FSC
The “Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2025” has been challenged before the Federal Shariat Court (FSS) for being ‘un-Islamic’.
Shahzada Adnan, a resident of Lahore, filed a petition through Advocate Mudassar Chaudhry pleading that the impugned law has been enacted in clear conflict to the Shariah, the Constitution and the fundamentals of Islam. The petition argues that the impugned legislation has totally negated the Islamic concept of marriage as according to the injunction of Islam, age does not matter but puberty is the key of ceremony of Nikah as well as marriage.
Citing Quranic verses, the petition says the impugned law is ultra vires and against the basic principles of Islamic Shariah.
It alleges that the implementation of the impugned law would open a door for pre-marriage sex in the country.
The petition argues that the parliament did not consider the legislation work of Quran, Hadith, Muslim jurists and other Islamic countries.
It said the legislative body also ignored the opinion of Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body, which already declared the impugned law against the spirit of Islam as well the Constitution of the country. The petition asks the FST to declare the impugned law as unconstitutional and against the Islamic principles.

• Fear has gripped media industry, judge told
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday issued a final deadline to the federal government to respond to the identical petitions filed against “co­­ntroversial amendments” in the cybercrimes law, and hinted at deciding the matter ex parte if re­­plies to the challenges were not received.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued final notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice, Mi­­nistry of Information Techno­logy, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA, and the Pakistan Telecom­munication Authority (PTA) to submit their replies to the petitions filed against controversial amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The judge made it clear that the hearing will proceed even if responses were not filed.
The petitions filed by the Pak­istan Federal Union of Journa­li­s­­ts, anchorpersons, and various journalist organisations have chal­­lenged the expanded scope of Peca, which, they argue, crimina­lises journalistic activity and curtails press freedom. During the hearing, several senior media rep­­­resentatives appeared in court.
Imran Shafiq, counsel for the pe­­­­­titioners, informed the court that only the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Information had filed partial responses, while the Ministry of Law, PTA, and other agencies concerned had ei­­ther sub­­mitted incomplete replies or igno­red the court’s orders altogether.
He accused the government of using delaying tactics, highlighting that it had raised jurisdictional objections. He asserted that only a constitutional bench could hear the case under the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
He argued that this objection was unfounded.
“This is merely an attempt to prolong the proceedings,” Mr Shafiq told the court, also pointing out that one of the government’s objections mentioned a verse from the Holy Quran that suggests caution before sharing information publicly. He alleged that the government had done so to justify the registration of FIRs against journalists.
Senior journalist Mazhar Abbas emphasised that an atmosphere of fear had gripped the media industry, adding that journalists were routinely harassed, summoned by the FIA, and threatened with arrest for performing their professional duties.
“We are not demanding any special treatment,” Mr Abbas said, adding, “We only ask for the protection of our constitutional rights and the right to report freely.”
Advocate Riasat Ali Azad urg­ed the court to issue an interim stay order to prevent the registration of FIRs and arrests of journalists.
Besides, he suggested the court should impose a fine of Rs500,000 on the agencies for failing to comply with court orders.
Justice Minhas wondered whether journalists were being truly prevented from reporting.
In response, Adnan Haider said, “We are fighting a war on social media just like the army defends the country in a war.”
The court granted a final opp­ortunity to the government depa­rtments to file their responses and adjourned the hearing to the second week of July.

While presiding over a meeting on railways, the premier instructed Pakistan Railways to expedite efforts to connect Gwadar with its network.
Earlier, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi briefed the prime minister on ongoing reforms in the railways department, saying that the organisation had immense potential for further investment.
He highlighted the establishment of modern information desks at major railway stations, outsourced cleaning systems at Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Multan railway stations, collaboration between his department and provincial food authorities to monitor food quality at trains and stations, and the resumption of long-suspended services.

Hanif Abbasi briefs premier on railway projects, plans to outsource assets

The minister told the meeting that Bolan Mail had recently been relaunched as a daily service, besides the restoration of Dera Ghazi Khan Express and Khushhal Khan Khattak Express.
Outsourcing, auction
Mr Abbasi said concrete sleeper factories in Sukkur, Khanewal, and Kohat, and railway hospitals, schools, colleges, and rest houses in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, and Sukkur were being outsourced.
Moreover, Royal Palm Golf and Country Club, Lahore, is being auctioned with the potential to establish a five-star hotel and the digitisation and restructuring of the Railways IT directorate was underway.
He highlighted that free Wi-Fi was introduced on trains; Rabta App upgraded for ticket booking; 155 railway stations shifted to solar, saving millions; 17,101 posts cut, 5,695 more to be phased out; and Pakistan Railways Advisory and Consultancy Services, Rail­cop, Pakistan Railways Freight Transport Company, and Project Implementation Unit discontinued.
It was told that Rs10 billion railway land had been reclaimed and planning with Punjab was in progress on Lahore-Rawalpindi high-speed train, station upgrades, and suburban services.
Besides, the Sariab-Kuchlak and Quet­­ta-Chaman sections will be upgra­ded.
MQM delegation
Later, a MQM delegation, led by convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, called on the prime minister.
The prime minister consulted the MQM delegation regarding the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026. The delegation presented its proposals concerning the budget.
PM Shehbaz said that providing top-notch transport facilities to the people of Karachi through the Green Line project was among the top priorities of the federal government. He said work on mega water (K-IV) project of Karachi would be expedited while instructions had already been issued to accelerate work on the Karachi-Hyderabad package as well.
The Muttahida delegation included Mustafa Kamal, Aminul Haque, Farooq Sattar, and Javed Hanif, PM Office said.
In a separate meeting with a delegation led by Belarusian Defence Minister Lt-Gen Victor Khrenin, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan desired to strengthen econo­m­­ic partnership with Belarus and benefit from country’s expertise in agricultural machinery manufacturing, adds APP.
The seven-member delegation included Belarusian ambassador Andrei Metelitsa, commander of the Belarusian air force and air defense and officials from the Belarusian defence ministry.
The premier said that cooperation with Belarus in IT and defence sectors would be further strengthened.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be departing for an official visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Thursday (today).

The draft of the bill was moved by Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) MPA Mir Sadiq Sanjrani.
JUI-F MPA Ms Shahida Rauf, while speaking on the floor of the House, said that the bill is being bro­ught to the assembly with good intentions and her party would support it.
She, however, suggested to the Leader of the House that every clause of the bill should be discussed in the House again so that there remained no ambiguity about it.
“If only one party opposes it, that will cause great loss to the province,” Ms Rauf said, adding that the bill should not be passed in haste.
Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, while taking up the issue of missing persons, said the matter must be resolved.
Commenting on the draft of the amendment, he said the anti-terrorism bill might be correct, but it needs to be clear who it actually benefits.
 
 

“Who will be held accountable for those being killed?” Maulana Rehman said, adding that the Counter Terrorism Department’s actions are visible to everyone and the House should be taken into confidence on the bill and it should be passed only after taking the opinion of every member of the House.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed the issue of missing persons has been used to discredit state institutions, and legislation was the solution to the problem.
“We must now prevent this issue from being misused. Now, anyone arrested will be presented before a magistrate.”
Six-year sunset clause
The bill, seen by Dawn, proposes that anyone suspected of offences enshrined in the anti-terrorism law may be held in preventive detention for up to three months for the purpose of inquiry.
The inquiry will be held by a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent or through a Joint Interrogation Team (JIT). If the detention order is issued by the armed forces or intelligence agencies, the inquiry shall be conducted by a JIT consisting of members of the concerned agency.
During the course of inquiry, the concerned law enforcement officer heading it shall be vested with all powers relating to search, arrest, and seizure of property and other materials relevant to the offence.
The amended law also allows for detainees to be confined in a detention / rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre who, upon a written request by the investigating agency or investigating officer, can be handed over to any law enforcement agency for the purpose of investigation.
 
 

The provincial government shall notify Oversight Board(s), comprising two civilians, two military officers, a psychiatrist, and a criminologist, under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary (Home) or any other nominated officer to assess the case of each detainee and their ideological disposition and mental, physical, and psychological condition during detention, and recommend, where necessary, their transfer to a rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre.
Explaining the bill’s salient features, CM Bugti told the House that if any institution picks someone up, it can keep them in custody for up to three months, after which they must be presented before a court and informed of the charges filed against him/her.
The detained person will be kept in a centre where he/she can meet their family members and the lawyer of the detained person will also be informed about it.
“If anyone disappears beyond this system, then he/she will be considered a truly missing person,” Mr Bugti said, adding that the new law would be valid for six years. The legislation also includes a provision to extend its operation by two years through a notification by the provincial government.

Trump said the measure was spurred by a makeshift flamethrower attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.
The move bans all travel to the United States by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
 
 

Trump also imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries will be allowed.
The bans go into effect on Monday, the White House said.
“The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted,” Trump said in a video message from the Oval Office posted on X.
“We don’t want them.”
 






World Cup, Olympics excluded
The ban will, however, not apply to athletes competing in the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Trump’s order said.
Trump separately on Wednesday announced a ban on visas for foreign students who are set to begin attending Harvard University, ramping up his crackdown on what he regards as a bastion of liberalism.
The US leader compared the new measures to the “powerful” ban he imposed on a number of mainly Muslim countries in his first term, which caused travel disruption across the world.
 
 

Trump said that the 2017 ban had stopped the US from suffering terror attacks that happened in Europe.
“We will not let what happened in Europe happen in America,” Trump said.
“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen.”
Venezuela hit back by warning that the United States itself was a dangerous destination.
“Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,” Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said after the announcement, warning citizens against travel there.
Trump’s new travel ban could, however, face legal challenges, as have many of the drastic measures he has taken in his whirlwind return to office.
‘Terrorists’
The White House unveiled the new ban with virtually no warning, minutes after Trump had addressed some 3,000 political appointees from his balcony at a celebratory “summer soiree”.
Trump also made the announcement with no reporters present, an unusual move after sharing many of his most headline-grabbing policy announcements at signing ceremonies in the Oval Office.
But rumours of a new Trump travel ban had circulated following the attack in Colorado, with his administration vowing to pursue “terrorists” living in the US on visas.
 
 

Suspect Mohammed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, is alleged to have thrown fire bombs and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
US Homeland Security officials said Soliman was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.
“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson said on X.
 






Trump’s proclamation gave specific reasons for each country in his proclamation, which says it is aimed at protecting the United States from “foreign terrorists and other national security” threats.
Notably, Egypt was not on the list of countries facing travel restrictions.
For Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and war-torn Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, it said they lacked “competent” central authorities for processing passports and vetting.
Iran, with which the United States is in negotiations on a possible nuclear deal, was included as it is a “state sponsor of terrorism”, the order said.
“The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child,” said National Iranian American Council president Jamal Abdi.
For most of the other countries, Trump’s order cited an above-average likelihood that people would overstay their visas.
Trump administration ramps up attack on Harvard, Columbia
Meanwhile, Trump ramped up his campaign against top US universities on Wednesday, banning visas for all foreign students coming to attend Harvard and threatening to strip Columbia of its academic accreditation.
Trump is seeking to bring the universities to heel with claims that their international students pose a national security threat, that they ignored anti-Semitism on campus, and perpetuate liberal bias.
A proclamation issued by the White House late on Wednesday declared that the entrance of international students to begin a course at Harvard would be “suspended and limited” for six months, and that existing overseas enrollees could have their visas terminated.
“Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” said the order.
“I’m trembling. This is outrageous,” Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, told AFP.
“He is abusing his executive power to harm Harvard as much as he can.”
 
 

“My god!” said another international student at Harvard, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, on learning of the executive order.
“This is such a disgrace.”
The announcement came after the Trump administration’s earlier efforts to terminate Harvard’s right to enrol and host foreign students were stalled by a judge.
The government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution from any future federal funding.
Trump has also singled out international students at Harvard, who in the 2024-2025 academic year accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment, and a major source of income.
“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,” a university spokesman said.
“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”
 
 

The latest sweeping action against Harvard came as Trump’s education secretary threatened on Wednesday to strip Columbia University of its accreditation.
The Republican has targeted the New York Ivy League institution for allegedly ignoring harassment of Jewish students, throwing all of its federal funding into doubt.
Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including Columbia — have already bowed to far-reaching demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is too left-wing.
But Wednesday’s official action suggested it was not enough for Trump.
“Columbia University looked the other way as Jewish students faced harassment,” US Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on X.
 






She accused the school of breaking rules prohibiting recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, colour, or national origin.
In the statement, the US Education Department said its civil rights office had contacted Columbia’s accreditation body about the alleged violation.
Withdrawing Columbia’s accreditation would see it lose access to all federal funding — a very significant proportion of the university’s income. Students attending the university would also not be able to receive federal grants and loans towards tuition.
Critics accuse the Trump administration of using allegations of anti-Semitism to target educational elites and bring universities to their knees.
 
 

The administration has already put $400 million of Columbia’s funding under review, prompting the university in March to announce a package of concessions to the government around defining anti-Semitism, policing protests and conducting oversight for specific academic departments.
Following Wednesday’s announcement, a Columbia spokesperson said the university is “aware of the concerns” raised by the government with its accreditation body.
“We have addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,” the spokesperson said, adding that “Columbia is deeply committed to combating anti-Semitism on our campus”. “We take this issue seriously and are continuing to work with the federal government to address it. “</p><small>2025-06-05 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0509321349d114c.jpg?r=093225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915540/pm-approves-plan-to-cut-import-duties-on-raw-materials' target='_blank'><strong>PM approves plan to cut import duties on raw materials</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif has approved a reduction in duties on over 7,066 tariff lines, which include raw materials, intermediate and capital goods aimed at stimulating industrial growth in the country.
The premier green-lit the proposals for a formal announcement in the budget speech, which had received earlier approval from the Tariff Policy Board and Steering Committee. However, the premier asked that the implementation committee identify any irritants before the budget announcement.
Official sources told Dawn on Wed­­nesday that the government will announce the abolishing of 2 per cent additional customs duty (ACD) on 4,294 tariff lines in the upcoming budget. These are mostly raw materials, which will reduce the industries’ input cost.
It was also decided that the ACD will be reduced from 4pc to 2pc on 545 tariff lines, from 6pc to 4pc on 2,227 tariff lines, and from 7pc to 6pc for all products currently subject to a customs duty above 20pc.

Orders committee to consult sectors enjoying 100-150pc tariff protection

According to officials, the major impact will be seen in products classified in chapters 28 to 38, which mostly cover products related to chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, etc. The 2pc to 4pc duty cut will lower the cost of all these products.
The reduction will also cover information technology products, which fall under chapters 84 and 85 of the Pakistan Customs Tariff. Polyester Filament Yarn and HRC of steel sectors will also see a cut in import duties.
Simplified structure
In the budget, the government will also introduce a simplified customs duty structure with slabs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20pc. The existing 16pc slab will be reduced to 15pc, while the 11pc rate will drop to 10pc. The 3pc slab will be abolished, with products either moved to a zero-duty category or the new 5pc slab.
Regulatory duties, which range from 5pc to 90pc on various products, will also see a drastic reduction in the upcoming budget. However, it will be fully eliminated over five years, easing import costs and improving market accessibility.
The regulatory duties, which currently reach as high as 90pc on various products, would be reduced to a maximum of 30pc.
Moreover, the 5th Schedule of Customs, which provides industry-specific tariff concessions, will be dissolved, with all products covered under it transitioning to the 1st Schedule in a phased manner. There are no changes in the tariff structure in the upcoming budget which will hurt the interest of any specific industry, the official added.
Engaging stakeholders
PM Shehbaz Sharif has directed the steering committee to initiate formal engagement with leading sectors such as auto, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and plastics — currently shielded by effective tariff rates ranging between 100pc and 150pc after the budget announcement.
The committee will propose an agreed-upon reduction in tariffs for all these sectors in consultation with all stakeholders, the officials said, adding that the premier stated his government’s priority is to shift away from import substitution to an export-led growth strategy.
The premier agreed on the overall plan of a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
Under the approved plan, the government has set a target to slash the simple average tariff from the current 19pc to 9.5pc within five years. A key adjustment in the plan includes restructuring duty slabs, replacing the existing slabs of 0pc, 3pc, 11pc, 16pc and 20pc with a streamlined system of 0pc, 5pc, 10pc and 15pc.
By the end of the five-year implementation period, the tariff overhaul will establish a uniform maximum duty slab of 15pc, eliminating sector-specific peaks that previously exceeded 20pc — primarily affecting the auto industry.
The additional customs duties curren­tly set at 2pc, 4pc, 6pc and 7pc across var­ious slabs will be gradually phased out to zero within the next three to four years.

• Israeli army designates roads leading to Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid centres ‘combat zones’
• UK minister seeks ‘independent’ probe into deadly incidents
UNITED NATIONS: The United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza, which Washington claimed undermined ongoing diplomacy to resolve the conflict.
“This resolution would undermine diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire that reflects the realities on the ground and emboldens Hamas. This resolution also draws false equivalence between Israel and Hamas,” said Washington’s United Nations envoy Dorothy Shea.
The result of the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, one vote against (by the US), and zero abstentions. It was the 15-member UNSC’s first vote on the subject since November, when the US blocked a move calling for an end to fighting.
In her remarks before the votes, the US ambassador said she would not back the resolution. “United States opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise.
“The United States has taken the very clear position since this conflict began that Israel has the right to defend itself, which includes defeating Hamas and ensuring they are never again in a position to threaten Israel. In this regard, any product that undermines our close ally Israel’s security is a non-starter.”
The new resolution, seen by AFP, “demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties.”
It also calls for the “immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all [prisoners] held by Hamas and other groups.” Underlining a “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the Palestinian territory, the resolution additionally demands the lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Israel’s war on Gaza since October 2023 has killed at least 54,607 Palestinians and wounded 125,341, according to the health ministry.
16 more killed in Gaza
On Wednesday, Israeli bombardment killed at least 16 people in Gaza, including 12 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said. A day earlier, 27 people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire near a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s site in southern Gaza. The US- and Israeli-backed group operating aid sites in Gaza later shut its facilities, as the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were “considered combat zones”.
At least 95 Palestinians were killed and 440 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s health ministry said on Wednesday.
The wave of deadly incidents at the aid distribution sites in the Gaza Strip drew condemnation from the United Nations, as the UN aid chief said the recent ‘horrifying scenes’ of Gazans being killed while trying to access food aid were the result of ‘a series of deliberate choices that have systematically deprived two million people of the essentials they need to survive’.
“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement.
UK protests
On the other hand, pro-Palestinian protesters staged demonstrations outside the House of Parliament in London, calling for sanctions on Israel over ongoing hunger among Gaza’s war-struck population. The demonstrations were organised by several campaign groups, including Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Avaaz and Parents for Palestine.
Amid the protests, the UK government called for an “immediate and independent investigation” into the deaths. UK’s Minister for Middle East Hamish Falconer said the deaths of Palestinians as they sought food were “deeply disturbing” as he called Israel’s new measures for aid delivery “inhumane”.
Also, the BBC defended its Gaza coverage after White House criticism of its reporting of an incident in which Palestinians were killed near a Gaza aid centre, after the White House accused the broadcaster of taking “the word of Hamas”.

The provincial cabinet had decided to cut the power tariffs of these two plants by 30-40 per cent to reduce electricity bills. This move is similar to the federal government’s, which recently renegotiated contracts with independent power plants (IPPs) to reduce tariffs.
The provincial government said that both power companies would not make a profit or withdraw savings, and the amount would be diverted towards public relief. The two state-owned entities had been making between Rs12 to Rs13 billion in profit, which they would now forgo.
Likewise, both companies had savings of about Rs12 billion and it was decided they would not withdraw it to make room for tariff cuts. The amount saved on these heads is expected to translate into a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in electricity rates. This relief would then be conveyed to the federal government to help it overall reduce national tariffs.

Provincial govt says two state-owned companies will forgo profits, give up savings; CM Maryam asks authorities to curb vaping

Welcoming the step, power sector experts believe that Punjab still has more margin, which can be exploited. For example, local banks, which financed these projects, can be requested to reduce the mark-up rate, and a shift away from payments in dollars can also create further space, besides any insurance rate cuts.
Ideally, the government should have shifted loans and their servicing to its accounts; however, what it has already done is commendable and should help reduce national tariff, they added.
In February this year,  the government claimed to have secured about Rs1.571 trillion in savings in future payments to a total of 27 independent power producers (IPPs) through re-negotiations.
This was the key takeaway from a presentation made by the power division officials before the Senate Standing Committee on Power.
“The above savings will be passed on to the consumers through changes in agreements and tariffs over the contracting period,” read one of the slides that had been shared with the panel. It explained that Rs411 billion in savings had been secured through the termination of contracts with five IPPs, Rs238bn through the revision of tariff contracts with eight bagasse-based IPPs, and Rs922bn in tariff revisions with 14 thermal IPPs.
Meanwhile, the provincial cabinet has also approved the ’Chief Minister Wheat Program 2025’.
The establishment of Punjab’s first ‘Air Punjab Private Limited Company’ was also approved. CM Maryam Nawaz decided to start the airline within one year. She directed to ensure “safety gear” for labourers and workers and assigned the labour department a target of implementing safety SOPs within one month.
About the cabinet’s decision to shut down vaping stores, Dr Imran Aslam, the CM’s PRO confirmed that she had instructed the departments concerned to impose a ban on vaping as well.
Punjab Energy Secretary Dr Naeem Rauf told Dawn that in light of the recent decision, they would approach Nepra for a reduction in power tariffs for these two plants and would likely revise their power purchasing agreements so that these price reductions get permanence and are reflected in the new tariff.

• Met Office warns of above-normal rate of snow melting in GB, raising risk of Glof events
ISLAMABAD: India’s ‘water aggression’, higher-than-normal estimated rainfall and temperatures have reduced the response time for floods expected in the upcoming monsoon season, raising the risk of greater natural and man-made devastation unless improved vigilance and coordination is ensured, particularly in the country’s eastern parts.
This was the central theme of the annual flood preparation meeting of the federal and provincial governments on Wednesday, presided by Fed­e­ral Minister for Water Resources Muhammad Mueen Wattoo.
Participants of the meeting agreed to enhanced inter-agency and inter-provincial coordination and round-the-clock vigilance to manage flood risks during the upcoming monsoon season, set to begin on July 1.
The Pakistan Meteorological Depar­tment (PMD) officials told participants that temperatures were already abo­ve normal in Gilgit-Baltistan and forecast to remain so in the days ahead, resulting in above-normal snow-melting.
As a consequence, there could be higher and repeated chances of Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (Glofs) in the monsoon season.
The rainfalls were also projected to be higher than normal across the country, particularly in the northern parts — Azad Jammu and Kashmir, GB, Potohar and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — and there could be greater frequency of all-weather events, including excessive thunderstorms and hailstorms.
Adding risks to the challenge was the unpredictability of water events from across the eastern borders as India is not sharing data relating to weather and river flows. Therefore, it was decided to be extra vigilant in relevant areas, particularly more than extra vigilance would need to be kept at Sialkot flood warning station because that would not provide more than 5-6 hours of response time.
In this regard, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) expressed serious apprehensions over unpredictable and volatile Chenab flows which had already started affecting the Mangla dam filling. India has been reducing Chenab flows, forcing irrigation authorities to discharge around 40,000 cusecs of water from Mangla Dam instead of normal 10,000 cusecs a few days ago. Chenab flows reached just 6,000 cusecs about three days ago instead of 35,000-40,000 cusecs. The Mangla dam releases had to be increased to compensate for Chenab loss. With some improvements for subsequent two days, India against reduced flows to 21,000 cusecs on Monday.
An official statement said the PMD has “forecasted normal to slightly above-normal rainfall across central and southern Pakistan for the July to September period. Enhanced precipitation is expected in northeastern Punjab and Kashmir, while northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan may experience normal to below-normal rainfall”.
The forecast also warned of higher-than-normal temperatures nationwide, increasing the likelihood of extreme hydrological events such as riverine floods, flash floods, urban flooding, and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs), the statement said.
Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), on the other hand, reported that enough storage was available both in Tarbela and Mangla dams and even at Chashma barrage. Therefore, there would not be a big challenge to cater for floods, whether on the Indus or Jhelum side as standard operating procedures were in place for controlled discharges downstream reservoirs in case of peak floods. However, localities around catchment areas in the northern part could be at risk in case of unusual floods.
In view of these inputs, the meeting agreed to have enhanced inter-agency coordination and round-the-clock vigilance to manage flood risks during the upcoming monsoon season. The crucial meeting, an annual ritual, was held to assess national preparedness for Monsoon Season 2025 and brought together representatives from federal agencies and provincial governments, to review flood mitigation strategies and pre-emptive measures for the safe passage of potential floodwaters.
Minister Mueen Wattoo directed to ensure immediate clearance of storm water drains in major urban centers and removal of encroachments and debris around waterways, particularly near barrages and key infrastructure such as National Highway Authority and Pakistan Railways bridges, to prevent floodwater blockages. Special attention was given to the de-silting and encroachment removal from urban nullahs in flood-prone cities including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi, the statement said.
The chairman of the Federal Flood Commission briefed the meeting on pre-monsoon initiatives undertaken by the Commission, including readiness assessments and coordination plans. Stakeholders reported on ongoing monitoring of river flows, infrastructure readiness, and the functionality of meteorological and telemetry systems.
The minister also called for special attention to ensure the safety of vulnerable communities and public infrastructure.

ISLAMABAD: Amid final consultations on the budget, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) wants strict compliance with programme requirements, including the coverage of agriculture income tax in provincial budgets to ensure effective collection starting no later than September 2025.
The Fund also does not agree with a plan for incentivising enhanced power consumption desired by the federal government to absorb surplus capacity. Informed sources said the IMF wanted a strong commitment from the provinces for expenditure control, notwithstanding expansionary development plans presented by the provinces and approved by the National Economic Council (NEC). The four provinces have already exceeded their development allocations for next year by almost Rs850 billion than the IMF’s estimates.
The provinces, on the other hand, might not be able to provide a committed budget surplus this year, given the Centre’s revenue shortfall, and were maximising their next year allocations to ensure they did not lose their financial rights guaranteed by the National Finance Commission (NFC) before its next meeting.
The IMF also wants full implementation of the agriculture income tax and related services that the federal government and the provinces have not been able to settle, as the Centre believed corporate agriculture fell within its domain.
The sources said the authorities had tried their best getting a waiver for the sale of 7000mw of surplus power capacity at marginal cost — meaning no subsidy involved — but the Fund believed similar distortions in the economy, including taxation, incentives and allowances, had landed the country in a difficult state of affairs.
The government believed that surplus power could help boost economic activity if provided to new consumer sectors and industrial sectors even at breakeven rates, but the IMF believed it to be unfair to existing consumers paying a heavy price.
It was also considered unjustified to force old industries running at higher input costs to compete with new setups running on cheaper energy. The government was advised to continue cost-cutting efforts to stabilise the power sector and provide a level playing field to all. In this context, it was yet unclear if a section of the government trying to allocate 2000MW electricity to crypto farming would succeed in providing 3-4 cents per unit (Rs8-9 per unit) against Rs24-25 per unit base rate.
The IMF has also opposed provincial subsidies on electricity and gas as provided during the current year by Punjab, which intends to repeat it next year. In addition, it wants joint strategies to fight electricity and gas theft and smuggling to minimise financial leakage and tax loss. In this regard, the provinces would also have to right-size their departments in the next year to support a similar federal exercise during the current year.
The FBR tax target for next year would remain around Rs14.2tr or so as agreed during the first review of the extended fund programme a couple of months ago. Most of the other estimates shared at the time would also remain unchanged. There would be minor relaxation in tax rates for the salaried class but greater focus on recoveries from the retail sector. The cross-cutting theme of the next year’s budget would be digitisation and differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital means.

• Centre to finance projects worth Rs1 trillion amid 29pc PSDP cut, provincial allocations to fund the rest
• Sindh, KP ‘unhappy’ with exclusion of projects from federal budget
• Premier, all CMs to meet today on Indian moves against Pakistan’s water
ISLAMABAD: Fuelled by a 22pc increase in provincial allocations, the National Economic Council (NEC) on Wednesday approved with consensus a record Rs4.22 trillion national development outlay for the next fiscal year to upgrade growth rate to 4.2pc from 2.7 this year, despite an IMF-decreed 29pc cut in the public sector development programme (PSDP) compared to the current year.
The provincial expansionary stance is expected to come under the International Monetary Fund’s watch, which has been pushing for greater provincial cash surpluses to support the federal government in delivering a healthy amount for debt servicing, besides effective taxation of the agriculture income under a new national fiscal pact.
The meeting of the NEC — the country’s highest economic decision-making forum — was moved up by a day so that the prime minister, who chaired the meeting, could travel abroad. All provincial chief ministers, the deputy prime minister, and federal ministers for planning, finance and information were present. PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah also attended the meeting.
The meeting also decided that the PM and all CMs would meet on Thursday morning for a special meeting in light of India’s move to disrupt Pakistan’s water share. They will ponder a strategy to safeguard Pakistan’s water resources.
The development portfolio includes Rs1tr from PSDP, Rs2.869 trillion from the provincial annual development plans (ADPs), and Rs355bn for separate projects by the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through their resources.
Technically speaking, the Centre has allocated Rs880bn for the PSDP, down 20pc when compared to the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the original allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after including Rs120bn to be generated through a petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month to finance projects in Balochistan.
The provincial share for next year has gone up by 22pc from Rs2.358tr. The provinces had pitched Rs2.795tr ADPs two days ago at the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), but revised it to Rs2.869tr for the next year.
Punjab leads charge
The next year’s development plan is led by Punjab with a record Rs1.204tr, 20pc higher than the Centre, up 10.6pc compared to the current year’s Rs1.089tr. This is the first time a federating unit has exceeded the federal allocation, showing enhanced financial muscle of the provinces. Sindh trailed just behind the Centre with Rs967bn allocation, a healthy 27pc increase from its current year’s Rs705bn development fund. Punjab and Sindh enhanced their allocations by Rs16bn and Rs80bn respectively over what they had reported to the APCC on Monday.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced to invest Rs417bn in development next year, showing a massive 33pc increase over the current year’s allocation of Rs313bn. It had reported Rs440bn ADP in APCC but scaled down by Rs23bn. Balochistan, mostly dependent on the federal support, would announce Rs281bn development plan, up 12pc over the current year’s Rs252bn. Likewise, estimates for SOE’s projects were also jacked up to Rs355bn from Rs288bn two days ago.
Sources said despite their own heavy allocations, the Sindh and KP chief ministers complained over exclusion of their projects from the federal budget, while the Balochistan chief minister thanked the Centre for giving special attention to the restive province. KP chief minister’s adviser on finance Muzammil Aslam, however, appreciated the centre’s limitations in the given circumstances.
The cash-strapped government, however, did not forget protecting allocations for coalition partners’ parliamentarians scheme at Rs50bn and also enhanced funds for PML-N’s trademark road-building projects.
All other sectors, including special areas like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations, as all sectors, including energy, food, and water, faced funding constraints.
Based on these spending plans, the government set next year’s growth target at 4.2pc, supported by 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.
It set the target for national savings at 14.3pc of GDP in FY 2025-26, slightly higher than the current year’s 14.1pc and total investment of 14.7pc of GDP, up from 13.8pc in FY 2024-25. This reflects a narrowing saving investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows.
Public investment is projected to increase from 2.9pc to 3.2p; similarly, private investment is also projected to rise from 9.1pc of GDP to 9.8pc. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim for consolidation and stability, with an expected inflation of 7.5pc due to the low base effect and risk of ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.
The agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7pc) and cotton ginning (7pc), as well as robust performance in livestock.  The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in LSM with 3.5pc growth, the planning ministry said, with 3pc growth in mining and quarrying, “alongside sustained growth momentum in construction and energy, gas and water supply”.
The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4pc, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage & communications, financial services and real estate.

• Bilawal says New Delhi can’t be ‘net security provider’ in the region if it can’t even defend its own skies
• Dar blames political rhetoric from Indian leaders for keeping South Asia tensions high
WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have praised US President Donald Trump for his role in helping de-escalate the latest India-Pakistan military confrontation, and urged Washington to facilitate a comprehensive dialogue between the two nuclear neighbours.
Speaking at an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, PM Shehbaz said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam incident was a false-flag operation”, and credited President Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a ceasefire.
The premier said that the US president had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.
He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan downed six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.
“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”
He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.
PM Shehbaz also extended heartfelt felicitations to the US president and people of the United States, on his behalf and on behalf of the Pakistani nation, on celebrating their Independence Day.
He said the bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan were entering into renewed friendship, and the close contacts were being revived.
Facilitate dialogue
Meanwhile, speaking to US-based Pakistani journalists in Washington, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said President Trump “deserves credit” for helping facilitate the ceasefire between Pakistan and India last month.
“We should also pay attention to what the US president is saying. On 10 different occasions, he has taken credit for facilitating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan — and rightly so. He deserves that credit, because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the leader of the Pakistani delegation that began a three-day visit to Washington on Wednesday.
“So, if the US is willing to help Pakistan in maintaining this ceasefire, it is reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us,” he added.
While India publicly denies that President Trump played any role in the ceasefire agreement and consistently rejects third-party mediation on bilateral issues, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks appear aimed at drawing the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
“Yes, America has an establishment, a thought pattern,” he acknowledged, “but knowing the ground realities, we are not delusional. We know what the realities of this city (Washington) are, what its geopolitics are, but we are here because we believe that our message is the message of truth. It aligns with international laws and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”
His comments also targeted what he described as a failed US strategy of building up India as a regional security anchor. Referring to New Delhi’s recent troubles, he said: “What security will that net security provider provide to others when it cannot do that for itself? They were supposed to protect others, but couldn’t protect their own planes.”
“The concept of India as a counterweight to China now seems hollow. It’s not even a paperweight anymore. This approach, I believe, must now be re-evaluated,” he said.
India has long pitched itself as a “net security provider” in the Indo-Pacific region — a concept US policymakers have also endorsed. But Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this strategy had outlived its utility.
“I believe that this strategy of building up India as the net security provider has failed,” he said. “I believe what can really provide security to this region, and to the rest of the world, is peace bet­ween India and Pakistan.”
Rhetoric sustaining tensions
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday expressed readiness for a comprehensive dialogue with India, but warned that rising political rhetoric from Indian leaders is sustaining high tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals following last month’s military confrontation.
“Whenever they (Indians) want a dialogue, at any level, they will find us ready, but we are not desperate,” Mr Dar said during a press briefing in Islamabad.
Mr Dar said that although the ceasefire has held, political tensions remain inflamed by statements from Indian leaders, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently described the military exchange as “just a trailer” ahead of upcoming elections in Bihar.
“Political rhetoric is still on, possibly for internal reasons,” Mr Dar said. “I wish sense prevails. We are peace lovers, focused on economic revival, but dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity come first.”
Mr Dar insisted that any future dialogue between Pakistan and India must be comprehensive, addressing terrorism, water rights under the Indus Waters Treaty, and broader bilateral issues. “When India is ready for talks, it will find us ready for talks on all issues.”
He also rejected Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar’s assertion that the talks should only cover the issue of terrorism, saying it wouldn’t work.
