• In written order released on Saturday, court orders formation of new committee comprising govt officials and civil society members
to inspect zoos across Sindh
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered formation of a new committee to visit zoos across the province and suggest steps for improvement as well as sending the exotic animals to their natural habitats.
Inviting suggestions to phase out zoos in the entire province, a two-judge SHC bench comprising Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah declared that the court had decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.
The remarks were part of a written order issued on Saturday regarding the Nov 6 hearing of a petition seeking shifting of lone female bear Rano from Karachi Zoological Gardens to Bear Sanctuary, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
The order stated that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and other respondents filed statements and reports and submitted that Rano had been successfully transported to the federal capital on Nov 5 in compliance with the orders issued by the bench earlier.
However, the bench enhanced the scope of the petition from Rano to the welfare of all animals kept in zoos and invited suggestions as to how to phase out zoos in the entire province.
Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar proposed that a committee may be constituted with the municipal commissioner, forest & wildlife secretary, wildlife conservator and KMC’s senior director-zoo as its members.
 
 

Representing the petitioner, Mohammad Jibran Nasir also suggested that philanthropist Ava Ardeshir Cowasjee, Dr Uzma Khan from Asia lead for WWF Pakistan, Advocate Nazia Hanjrah, Zhalay Sarhadi and petitioner/animal rights activist Jude Allen Preira may also be made part of the committee.
The bench ordered constitution of the committee and inclusion of all the names suggested by the wildlife conservator and the petitioner’s counsel.
The bench in its order stated: “In addition, the committee shall be given mandate to co-opt experts of the subject fields, who shall visit the zoos in the province and suggests steps for improvement in the zoos and identify issues being confronted by them at the moment to resolve them as a short term measure. As a long term measures, they shall recommend steps to be taken which may include but not limited to sending the exotic animals to their natural habitat.”
It further stated that as per the petitioner’s counsel the committee, constituted by the chief minister for shifting of Rano, had visited Karachi Zoo and found all the medical equipment out of order.
 
 

The bench stated that Zoo Director Aklaq Ahmed Yousufzai had undertaken to replace all out-of-order machines immediately and to outsource vets for treatment of the animals.
The hearing was adjourned till Nov 21.
At a previous hearing, the bench had directed the committee formed by the CM to visit the Karachi zoo and prepare a detailed report about the number of animals kept there as well as their physical and mental health.
It also asked the committee to examine the circumstances under which animals are being kept as well as to identify the animals as natives or exotic and must also make recommendations for improving the situation if it found the animals were kept in improper conditions.
The bench further ruled that since the issue was not of one bear but hundreds of animals being kept in captivity apparently just for entertainment of people and court has decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.

It is materialising and has triggered speculation about how this regime expects to consolidate its power. It is clear why it was kept under wraps: the proposed legislation will hollow out the Supreme Court and supplant it with a supra-court with all powers to overrule the former’s authority. The other subjects it touches on are the number of ministers and advisers, as well as the leadership of the armed forces.
It would seem as if the potential rollback of the 18th Amendment and significant changes to be made to the National Finance Commission Award were but a smokescreen. There is no mention of either of the subjects in the legislation presented before the Senate. Did the government use a bait-and-switch to make its proposals more digestible? We must wait to see how they are received.
Meanwhile, one cannot help but comment on the grand ambitions of the proposed amendment. The Supreme Court, once the last resort on all questions of law and legality, will be superseded by the federal constitutional court, which will quite literally be handpicked by the ruling regime. In theory, under the amendment, the ruling parties could stack the entire bench of this new, most powerful court in the country.
 
 

Could such a bench ever be expected to rule impartially on the constitutionality of the government’s actions? It would seem naïve to expect it to do so. How supporters of the amendment will explain this blatant subversion of judicial independence remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is to be reduced to a final court for routine civil and criminal appeals only. This demotion will complete the apex court’s descent to irrelevance, triggered by its failure to enforce its writ in the ‘90-days elections’ case. The humiliation will be complete.
One also wonders about the wisdom behind granting five-star ranks immunity from all prosecution for life. It is a rather surprising concession, given that past governments of both the PML-N and PPP were persecuted and overthrown by military strongmen. Those same military rulers also committed gross excesses against ordinary citizens and resorted to subjugating civil rights wholesale whenever the public’s will clashed with their personal interests. Unfortunately, they never faced justice for their crimes.
 
 

Given such precedents, would the promise of near-blanket, lifetime immunity not give future despots more incentive to commit violations of oath and law with impunity? The government should perhaps have considered formally recognising the titles of five-star-ranked personnel only and conferring all the prestige it wished upon them. A lifetime of immunity is a rather odd honour to bestow on anybody.
Attention now turns to the debate. The government must not rush matters and allow all to share their thoughts freely.

Some passengers were coming home for the weekend, some were coming for cricket.
Saturday’s third One-day International betw­e­­en Pakis­tan and South Africa has been set up perfectly; the series, marking the return of international cricket to the city after 17 long years, tied at 1-1 ahead of the final fixture.
 
 

“I work in Islamabad and this is my hometown but I’ve come here specially for the match,” said one passenger, scurrying for his luggage in the cargo hold of one of the executive buses that had made a stop in Faisalabad on its way to Sahiwal. “I hope it’s a great game and Pakistan win tomorrow.”
That sense of anticipation or the feeling of excitement wasn’t shared by everyone, though.
“Cricket has returned, yes, but it’s brought a lot of complications with it,” Abdul Rehman, a driver from a ride-hailing app, told Dawn, sharing the sentiment of many across Pakistan. “The road closures for teams travelling to and from the Iqbal Stadium are too much … it’s impossible to go to areas close to it.”
A hazy, cool night had given way to a lazy, sun-kissed morning and the afternoon, by which the crowd had started to fill in at the venue. The return of international cricket hasn’t only seen cricket enthusiasts from the city be entertained, but fans from districts and tehsils in the Faisalabad division have also come over.
“Fans have poured in from tehsils in Chiniot, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh districts as well as adjoining divisions like Sargodha and Mianwali,” local television journalist Arsalan Hussain Durrani told Dawn.
“The appetite for cricket here is huge, crowds filled up the venue for the National T20 Cup in March so imagine how long they’ve been waiting for international cricket to come here even though the stadium is very basic, very much as it is since it was inaugurated in 1968.”
The entrance to the stadium is through a large red brick gate but the venue itself is a throwback to the past. Just two stands, on either side of the pavilion, have seats. The rest of the seating is on steps or ‘tharray’ in the local dialect.
The Iqbal Stadium is under the district administration, with the Pakistan Sports Board having been its caretaker for a few years. Two amusement parks are on either side of the venue. The Pakistan Cricket Board rents it, with the crowd turnout at the Champions Cup in September last year having convinced PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi that international cricket should finally return.
“Not only is it good for the fans in the city and the adjoining districts but the return of cricket will also see more business come to Faisalabad, which is the textile hub of the country,” Umer Rafique, the owner of Celebrity Cricket League which has held exhibition cricket matches across the country, told Dawn.
“The fact that cricket sees packed crowds in Faisalabad is a puller for corporates, attracting greater sponsorship opportunities due to the eyeballs here,” added the Faisalabad native. “And while Sialkot remains the country’s sports good hub, cricket’s return will help Faisalabad’s textile industry as well, shining light on the exceptional sports kit-making here.”
In the interim, though, it is the cricket’s enthusiasts in the region that are making the most of the opportunity that has presented itself.
A group of teenaged boys, led by Sumair and Abdullah, arrived at the Iqbal Stadium in t-shirts printed with pictures of former Pakistan middle-order batter Umar Akmal accompanied with messages of ‘Miss You’. “We haven’t found anyone like him in the middle order since he’s been cast away,” quipped Abdullah in front of a loud group.
A teenaged girl and her younger brother, coming to the ground with their father, expressed her excitement, stating it was going to be her first time watching an international cricket match. Alongside them was Mohammad Yasin, ‘Junior Chacha Cricket’, who arrived decked in a bright green robe of Pakistan colours.
“I go wherever Pakistan are playing and it’s wonderful to see them in action here in Faisalabad,” Yasin, who has travelled for the series from Lahore, told Dawn.
The start of the match, the toss and South African skipper Matthew Breetzke’s decision to bat first, was greeted by loud roars. There ‘oohs’ and ‘ahs’ as an edge off Lhuan-dre Pretorius flew for a boundary off Haris Rauf. Cheers of “Fauji” accompanied Fakhar Zaman as he came towards the boundary to field, a reference to him being an officer of the Pakistan Navy.
The biggest cheers, though, came when Salman Ali Agha had Pretorius caught at long-off by Babar Azam, whom the majority of the crowd had come to see. Babar’s highest first-class score of 266 came at the Iqbal Stadium in 2014, when he was a 20-year-old. Three years prior to that, he’d been part of Pakistan ‘A’ side that beat Afghanistan in an unofficial one-dayer at the venue.
Faisalabad’s fixation with the batting superstar was evident on Saturday and the fans are hoping to see more of Babar and the national team in the times to come after Pakistan sealed a convincing victory to clinch the series 2-1.
“I’ve come here to see Babar and it’s an opportunity I’ve waited for a long time,” Shakeel Awan, who had travelled for the match from Toba Tek Singh — two hours away from Faisalabad, told Dawn. “I hope this series is the start of more to come.”

• US coordinates Gaza aid flow but Israel maintains oversight, officials say
JERUSALEM: Israeli forces continued to wage deadly assaults across the Palestinian territories and southern Lebanon on Saturday, in a series of air and artillery attacks that violated ceasefire agreements on both fronts.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops shot dead two 16-year-old boys, adding to the mounting number of Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces.
The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah identified the victims as Mohammed Abdullah Moham­med Ateem and Muhammad Rashad Fadl Qasim, both from the village of Judeira. The ministry said Israeli forces were withholding the boys’ bodies.
The Israeli military acknowledged the killings, referring to the teenagers as individuals it had “eliminated” — a term frequently employed by Israeli authorities to obscure civilian deaths and dehumanise Palestinians.
At the same time, in the besieged Strip, Israeli gunfire killed one Palestinian and wounded another near the Bureij refugee camp.
A separate attack in western Khan Younis left another Pales­tinian wounded, medics reported.
Three killed in Lebanon
In a separate escalation, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed three people and wounded several others on Saturday.
Lebanon’s National News Agency said two brothers from the town of Shebaa were burned alive when an Israeli missile hit their SUV. A separate strike in Baraashit killed one person and wounded four. Another Israeli strike on Saturday morning on a car near a hospital in the southern city of Bint Jbeil wounded seven people, according to the ministry.
The latest attacks came as the European Union voiced concern. “Focus by all parties must be on preserving the ceasefire and the progress achieved so far.”
Body exchange
Simultaneously, under the cea­­sefire’s prisoner exchange plan, for every one dead Israeli prisoners returned, the bodies of 15 slain Palestinians are handed back by Israel.
On Saturday, Israel identified the latest prisoner remains sent back from Gaza as those of Lior Rudaeff. Meanwhile, the Nasser Medical Centre in Khan Younis reported receiving the bodies of 15 Pales­tinians.
US, Israel coordinate aid
Meanwhile, according to the Washington Post, US forces are now involved in coordinating aid through the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that will replace Israel in overseeing aid into Gaza. It cited a US official and people familiar with the matter as saying Israel was part of the process but that CMCC would decide what aid enters Gaza and how.
 
 

However, an Israeli security official confirmed that Israel remains part of the supervision and monitoring process, with decisions made jointly. This suggests little change to the stifling Israeli control over what aid enters Gaza.

Trump had announced in September that Vice President JD Vance would travel to the meeting later this month instead of him, but has now said that US representatives will skip it entirely.
“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”
Trump said that Afrikaners — descendants of the first European settlers of South Africa — “are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated”. He added that he looked forward to hosting the 2026 G20 summit in the US — which the billionaire US president will controversially hold at his own golf resort in Miami, Florida.

South Africa calls Trump’s decision ‘regrettable’, pledges smooth summit

The South African foreign ministry cal­led Trump’s comments “regrettable” and said it was looking forward to hosting a “successful” summit set for November 22-23.
“The characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution is not substantiated by fact,” it said in a statement.
Pretoria chose “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability” as the theme for its G20 presidency but has faced some resistance, including from Washington.
“South Africa’s focus remains on its positive global contributions,” the foreign ministry said.
“Drawing on our own journey from racial and ethnic division to democracy, our nation is uniquely positioned to champion within the G20 a future of genuine solidarity.”
Trump has singled out South Africa for harsh treatment on a number of issues since he returned to the White House in January, most notably on his false claims of a “white genocide” in the country.
He ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval office earlier this year, playing a video in which he alleged a campaign against white farmers by the post-apartheid government.
South Africa’s government denies any such policy. Trump’s administration announced plans last week to drastically cut back the number of refugees to be accepted annually by the United States to a record low of 7,500 — and give priority to white South Africans.

Eliot
Newspaper editors, at times, require writers to cobble up a short article on famous persons, in the throes of death, that can be used as an obituary when they cease to be. Institutions on the brink of extinction merit similar consideration.
This is not an essay on the impact of the 27th constitutional amendment bill on the judiciary. It is not even a comment. It is an obituary of the Supreme Court (SC) and the high courts that we once knew. If you have known a person or institution well and for long, such a piece is also not easy to write. Expression requires words. The bill has left us at a loss for words. Trying as it is, one must nevertheless soldier on.
One must begin with the high courts. Central to the authority of these highest provincial courts is their jurisdiction to check executive and legislative overreach.
Any aggrieved citizen can call an action of state in question by invoking Article 199 of the Constitution. That jurisdiction will survive. Such cases will, however, be heard now by the constitutional benches of the high courts.
In the past, the chief justice of the res­pective high court assigned these cases.
With the 26th Amendment, this authority has been transferred to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), where the chief justice of Pakistan and other judges are in a minority.
The state whose actions are under scrutiny in such matters is ascendant.
Every experienced lawyer knows that a party with the authority to control the assignment of cases can also control outcomes.
Judges, like the rest of us, have their pre­ferences and prejudices. Baser moti­v­es are not needed. When the desired outcome of a case is matched with the inclinations of a judge, success is almost assured.
Any miscalculation in assessing human predilections is ringfenced by keeping the sword of transfer in full view of any judge, who may entertain adventurous ideas.
The president of the country will have the authority to transfer a judge of one high court to another. They can be exiled from a city or an area, where they have spent a lifetime, to another high court in another province.
They will have no say in the matter. To the contrary, a judge, who does not accept such a transfer will be deemed retired.
 
 

The powerful dissent of SC’s Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan in the Islamabad High Court judges’ case ought to have made us pause and reflect on the deleterious consequences of such transfers for judicial independence.
Instead, we have swung full throttled in the opposite direction. Even the judges of the SC will no longer be immune from such actions.
The judges of the Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) will be appointed from lawyers or from judges of the SC.
Any SC judge, who refuses to accept this appointment, will be deemed retired.
Do not be surprised if you soon witness a purge of “undesirable” SC judges.
In matters of transfer, the SC will at least be at par with the high courts. In other respects, it will fare worse.
It will not be left with any authority to hear any appeals in constitutional cases from the high courts.
That authority will belong to the FCC. So will the jurisdiction to decide disputes between provinces, or between one or more provinces and the Federation, to adjudicate petitions for the enforcement of fundamental rights, and to advise the president on questions of constitutional law. All such matters presently pending in the SC will stand transferred to the FCC.
Appeals, under various statutes, will be diverted to the FCC by making an amendment to them.
It is apparent that the Elections Act, 2017 and other such statutes will soon be modified to effect this change.
All election disputes will soon fall into the FCC’s lap. If a substantial question of constitutional law, by some quirk of fate or lawyer’s ingenuity gets raised in any case before any court, the FCC will have the authority to sweep all such matters into its domain.
With one stroke of pen, the almost century old law of precedent will be erased. The FCC will not be bound by a judgment of the SC. All courts, including the SC, will be bound by the judgement of the FCC. That settles any lingering doubt about which of the two courts is higher.
Where does this leave the SC? It will not be the highest court in the land anymore. It will be restricted to hearing appeals in civil and criminal matters just like the district and sessions courts.
Nothing of any consequence on the national and constitutional plane will remain in its domain.
For all effects and purposes, it will be reduced to the ‘Supreme District and Sessions Court’.
What General Ziaul Haq may have dreamt of, and what General Pervez Musharraf could not achieve, will soon be an accomplished fact.
This amendment, when carried, will give a lie to all those who have protested the ineffectiveness of our “elected” representatives and the inability of our parliament to change things. As demolition jobs go, this one is inimitable.

Its implementation may prove far more difficult than its drafters imagine. The plan collides with entrenched institutional cultures, long-standing inter-service rivalries, and the delicate balance between civilian oversight and military autonomy that has, at least in theory, defined Pakistan’s power structure since 1973.
At the heart of the bill lies the deceptively simple premise of modernising defence coordination by creating a Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and abolishing the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC).
But in practice, the reform would elevate the army chief to a constitutionally enshrined position of supremacy — combining operational command with overarching control of all services.

Article 243 overhaul marks a leap towards military centralisation and consolidation of uniformed supremacy

For over four decades, the CJCSC has served as the symbolic head of the armed services, designed to ensure coordination among the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
In practice, the role remained largely ceremonial, with the army — for over two and a half decades — reluctant to rotate it to other branches.
The proposed amendment would dissolve the post entirely on Nov 27, 2025, coinciding with the retirement of the current CJCSC, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, and make the chief of army staff concurrently the Chief of Defence Forces — placing all three services under his authority.
Former human rights minister and defence academic Dr Shireen Mazari highlights an ambiguity left unaddressed in the bill.
“With the end of the CJCSC position, would the joint chiefs of staff committee also be dissolved?” she asks.
If so, which forum would replace it for coordination among the three services though the CJCSC’s ineffectiveness is well known.
The supporters of the legislation argue that the change will streamline decision-making and enhance unified command.
 
 

However, critics see it as institutional capture. “By placing an army officer as the Chief of Defence Forces with authority over the Air Force and Navy, the proposed system invites institutional imbalance and potential disaster,” warns retired Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, a former defence secretary.
“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” he adds.
The criticism cuts to the core of the country’s military culture — the deep-seated rivalries among the Army, Air Force, and Navy, each guarding its operational turf and doctrine.
The Air Force and Navy have long resisted attempts to subordinate their autonomy under land-centric command.
Harmonising these distinct traditions — air power’s rapid, decentralised decision cycles versus the army’s hierarchical chain of command — has historically been the Achilles’ heel of every “joint” reform effort.
A critical question under the new system is who would control transfers, postings, and promotions in the Air Force and Navy.
Would the two service chiefs readily cede that authority? Dr Mazari cautions that if promotions in the Air Force and Navy were to be decided by an army-origin CDF, it “could lead to festering resentments and affect morale in the long run”.
She raises another hypothetical scenario: “What if there is a Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet while the COAS is a four-star general — will they then be under a four-star army officer if the latter is the CDF?” she asks. “Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions.”
Equally consequential is the proposal to create a Commander of the National Strategic Command, a position overseeing the country’s nuclear forces.
Under the amendment, the commander would be appointed by the prime minister on the army chief’s recommendation and must be chosen from within the army.
That subtle shift moves control of the country’s most sensitive assets away from the collegial National Command Authority (NCA), designed to ensure civilian oversight and inter-service balance, toward a single service.
Dr Mazari warns the change could have grave operational implications.
“Effectively, all nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under the army’s control, including second-strike missiles which normally fall under naval command,” she says.
“This could lead to command-and-control problems and time delays, especially in a war-like situation.”
Her concerns recall a rare moment of institutional dissent — the 2019 National Security Committee meeting after the Balakot strikes — when, according to retired Lt Gen Malik, the then-army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa advised restraint but was reportedly overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC.
“Under the proposed arrangement, would such dissent, and the powerful response it ensured, even be possible?” he asks pointedly.
Perhaps the most controversial innovation lies in the clauses granting life-long constitutional protection to officers elevated to five-star ranks — field marshal, marshal of the air force, or admiral of the fleet.
These officers would “retain rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through impeachment under Article 47 and protected by immunities “similar to those enjoyed by the president” under Article 248, applied mutatis mutandis.
The language is designed to legalise the extraordinary promotion of Gen Asim Munir to field marshal following the India-Pakistan confrontation in May this year.
What looks ceremonial on paper, however, amounts to a permanent legal armour around an unelected officeholder — “a parallel authority insulated from the very rule of law it is sworn to defend”, as one constitutional lawyer puts it, asking not to be named.
Such provisions blur the line between honour and power.
“Even in the United States, the chairman of the joint chiefs does not wield absolute powers,” notes Lt Gen Malik.
“Creating lifetime immunities for military officers upends the very idea of civilian supremacy”. The supporters of the amendment, including government ministers, argue the changes merely formalise existing practices.
Yet the bill remains ambiguous about the tenure of the service chiefs.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik told reporters that there was “no need for a fresh notification” on the army chief’s tenure, since existing legal provisions already establish a five-year term under the Army Act as amended by the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
But such reassurances overlook a deeper concern, which is that the proposed amendment will move the defence management from statute to constitutional entrenchment, making future civilian corrections exponentially harder.
Military affairs expert Muhammad Faisal, a doctoral researcher in Sydney, sees the bill as “the first phase” of a broader restructuring.
“There could be more updates coming with changes in the Army Act and NCA Acts to reflect new proposals,” he says.
“This could also lead to the restructuring of strategic forces, currently administered by three services separately, into a unified single command.”
That trajectory — toward centralisation rather than coordination — captures the tension at the heart of Pakistan’s military politics. Every attempt at “jointness” risks hardening into hierarchy because institutional habits and prestige are resistant to reform.
The stakes are profound. The country’s Constitution has endured repeated experiments in balancing military power and civilian authority.
A Chief of Defence Forces position can be created, as many democracies have done, through statutory reform subject to parliamentary review.
But embedding such a role in the Cons­titution transforms it from an administrative necessity into a permanent political reality, one that cannot easily be undone.
Ultimately, the question is not whether Pakistan needs a modernised defence structure. However, it definitely needs to be updated.
The question is whether modernisation must come at the cost of institutional equilibrium. History offers a cautionary note that once military power is constitutionalised, it rarely yields ground voluntarily.
Article 243 was meant to preserve civilian command over the armed forces. The 27th Amendment risks rewriting it into a charter of military supremacy.

According to the 2025 Review of Climate Ambition in Asia and the Pacific, released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), Pakistan needs significant investment and coordination to upgrade and expand its grid network to integrate large-scale renewable energy while maintaining system stability.
The report says that a successful phase-down of coal in Pakistan will require a comprehensive energy transition plan with clear targets, strong policies and engagement of all stakeholders. The transition, it adds, must be “just” to avoid disproportionate impacts on workers, businesses and households.
Renewable edge over coal
The UN report highlights that solar and wind energy are now cost-competitive with coal, giving Pakistan an opportunity to accelerate its shift towards cleaner energy. Data from the SDG-7 Roadmap for Pakistan show that the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind generation is significantly lower than that of coal-based power.

Solar and wind can cut power costs, but weak infrastructure may slow carbon-free transition

The energy landscape, the report notes, is evolving as global pressure to cut emissions increases. However, Pakistan’s transition will depend on long-term policy stability, financial support and institutional reforms that encourage private investment in renewables.
Regional context
The report places Pakistan’s situation within a broader Asia-Pacific context, describing the region as being at a “critical juncture” amid accelerating economic growth and intensifying climate pressures. Economic activity in the region expanded 4.6pc in 2024, contributing 60pc of global GDP growth over the past decade. Yet, rising debt, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to expose countries to mounting risks.
Despite these challenges, the Asia-Pacific has maintained its position as a global leader in renewable energy, accounting for 70pc of new capacity additions in 2024. Governments are increasingly adopting net-zero targets, revising climate policies and integrating them into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to meet emission-reduction goals.
Policy and carbon pricing reforms
To translate these commitments into action, countries are reinforcing their legal and regulatory frameworks to attract investment in clean energy. The report says private companies also have a crucial role in implementing deep decarbonisation strategies across their operations and supply chains.
The region remains heavily reliant on coal, producing 84pc of the world’s coal-fired power in 2024 and consuming 81.7pc of global coal output in 2023. The UN stresses that phasing down coal will require strong political commitment, removal of fossil fuel subsidies and coordinated policy frameworks to support renewable growth and energy efficiency.

The crackdown, which spanned Lahore and other districts over the last 24 hours, led to the arrest of the violators and resulted in fines totaling over Rs1.067 million imposed on 491 people. An additional 38 individuals were issued warnings for environmental violations.
 
 

According to the breakdown provided by the spokesperson, the operations targe­ted key sources of pollution. A total of 209 smoke-emitting vehicles were cited, alon­gside 101 incidents of crop residue burning and 7 violations related to brick kilns.
This recent enforcement action is part of a larger, year-long initiative.
The spokesperson revealed that since the beginning of the current year, the police have registered a significant 2,275 cases and arrested 2,027 violators. The financial penalties have been substantial, with fines exceeding Rs227.1m imposed on 87,780 individuals, while 11,268 others have received warnings.
 
 

The annual data highlights the scale of the problem, with 52,872 violations for smoke-emitting vehicles, 3,365 for brick kilns, 1,725 related to industrial activities, and 1,166 cases of crop residue burning.
IG police Dr Usman Anwar has directed officers to further accelerate the anti-smog crackdown.
In his directives, the IG emphasised a zero-tolerance policy, ordering strict and immediate action against all those found violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) designed to combat smog. The operations are to be intensified on highways, in industrial areas, on agricultural lands, and at other key locations contributing to poor air quality.

But deliberations on field marshal’s status under Article 243 of the Constitution were deferred to Sunday (today).
The joint session of the National Assembly and Senate committees was convened under the chairmanship of Senator Farooq H. Naek.
Despite a boycott by two members of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Senator Kamran Murtaza and MNA Aliya Kamran, the committee continued its proceedings and examined several key constitutional amendments, particularly those pertaining to the superior judiciary.

JUI-F members boycott proceedings; deliberations on field marshal’s status today

The JUI-F legislators staged a walkout, alleging that provisions previously discarded during the 26th Amendment process were being reintroduced through 27th Amend­m­ent, terming the move a “breach of trust”.
Presidential order
The committees discussed the composition and functioning of the proposed federal constitutional court.
According to informed sources, it was decided during the deliberations that the initial strength of the federal court would be determined through a presidential order.
 
 

However, they said, any subsequent increase in the number of judges would be made through an act of parliament.
Judges’ transfer
The standing committees in a joint sitting are also likely to finalise the mechanism for the transfer of high court judges through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — a process which may not require the consent of the judges being transferred.
Speaking to the media after the session, Senator Naek said that the JUI-F members had boycotted the meeting on the directives of their party leadership.
“After their departure, the meeting continued. Around 80 per cent of the proposed amendments have been examined.
The committee addressed the reservations raised by some members, developed consensus on most points, and resolved ambiguities on several issues,” he said.
Field marshal’s status
Responding to a question, he said the committee had not yet discussed Article 243, which would determine the constitutional status of a field marshal, but clarified that the matter would be examined in detail during the clause-by-clause review of the bill.
 
 

Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told rep­orters after the meeting that all parliamentary parties were participating in the process and that the government had also “requested the opposition to contribute constructively”. He described the proposed constitutional package as a “long-awaited and comprehensive reform,” noting that it has been under discussion for more than a decade.
“At the time of the 18th Amendment, this issue was part of the broader constitutional agenda. It resurfaced during the 26th Amendment, but could not materialise due to certain political and procedural considerations,” he recalled.

However, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to first seek the IMF’s clearance for the incentives proposed under the new policy.
Officials said a meeting between IMF representatives and a team led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan is expected later this month to discuss the annual fiscal cost of the incentives planned for various sectors.
The policy targets $60 billion in exports by 2030, GDP growth of 6pc and manufacturing growth of 8pc annually by the end of the decade. It aims to provide a roadmap for industrial competitiveness, job creation and export expansion.
Key constraints
The NIP identifies a range of structural and policy-related challenges impeding industrial growth. These include macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, costly industrial land, excessive regulation, unreliable and expensive power supply, and limited access to long-term credit.

NIP targets $60bn exports by 2030; identifies high costs, weak regulation and uneven taxation as key hurdles

The ministry said local industries face high borrowing costs and limited access to capital markets. Weak investor protection and an inadequate insolvency framework have further discouraged lending, leaving banks with few tools to restructure loans.
The policy notes that uneven taxation across sectors discourages industrial investment. While manufacturing bears a heavier tax burden, sectors such as real estate, construction, wholesale and retail remain undertaxed, reducing returns on industrial ventures.
Manufacturing firms also face foreign exchange constraints, with frequent delays in accessing dollars for importing raw materials. In some cases, foreign investors struggle to repatriate profits, deterring foreign direct investment.
The NIP highlights weak standards compliance, which hampers exports, and calls for reforms to improve product quality and certification systems. It also stresses the need for inclusive industrialisation, noting that women remain largely excluded from industrial entrepreneurship and management.
 
 

“Women remain at the periphery and suffer from a sense of not belonging. This needs to change, and more women industrialists must be promoted,” the document states.
The policy proposes a predictable and transparent taxation regime consistent with IMF-backed reforms. It recommends widening the tax net and ensuring that all sectors contribute proportionately to their share of value-added in GDP.
The NIP also calls for the review and simplification of corporate income tax (CIT), currently set at 29pc, higher than the regional average of 26pc, which affects export competitiveness. The super tax, levied in addition to the CIT, should also be reassessed to ease the burden on industries, the document says.
Structural measures
To support struggling firms, the policy proposes setting up a National Industrial Revival Commission (NIRC) to oversee company rehabilitation and coordinate regulatory support.
It further calls for strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) through accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and enhancing the enforcement capacity of the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan (IPO) to counter counterfeiting and piracy.
Reducing port charges, particularly those levied by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) — among the highest in the world — is also recommended to improve export competitiveness.
Officials said the policy, once approved, will serve as a framework for industrial transformation through improved governance, fiscal discipline and an enabling environment for private investment. However, its implementation will depend on IMF endorsement of the incentive package, given Pakistan’s commitments under the ongoing economic stabilisation programme.

• Supporters believe new constitutional court will modernise judiciary
ISLAMABAD: The initial draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, ta­­b­led in the Senate on Saturday, has led many legal experts to believe that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the Sup­r­e­­me Court as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to a proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
However, proponents of the amendment say the new constitutional court would modernise the judiciary, reduce backlogs and separate constitutional and appellate jurisdictions — a reform they argue will improve efficiency and clarity in the justice system.
“Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’,” remarked a senior counsel who asked not to be named.
He warned that the government could now amend laws like the Elections Act 2017 and others to route appeals to the FCC instead of the Supreme Court.
 
 

Amendment to Article 175, he said, was “virtually the end of the judiciary as we knew it”, arguing that the Supreme Court had been “amended out of the Constitution by making it irrelevant”.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar said the essence of the package was twofold.
First, the insertion of a new Chapter 1A in the Constitution that, in his view, tightens executive control over the superior judiciary through expanded powers to transfer high court judges, and establishes an FCC “empowered by disempowering the Supreme Court”.
Second, an amendment to Article 243 that formally vests the office of Chief of the Defence Forces in the Chief of the Army Staff and constitutionally guarantees the Field Marshal rank for life.
 
 

Another lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the senior-most of the two chiefs would chair the Judicial Commission of Pakis­tan, “for all other purposes, the FCC will be in the commanding position”.
He pointed out that wherever the oaths of judges of the Supreme Court and FCC are mentioned, the FCC is referenced first. “It is clear now which court is higher in terms of hierarchy,” he said.
He noted that under the amended Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC is listed before the chief justice of the Supreme Court and will have a longer tenure, retiring at 68, compared to the current retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court judges.
‘Forward-looking reform model’
In contrast, senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar welcomed the initiative, calling the proposed 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in the justice system.
He said the creation of two separate apex courts — the existing Supreme Cou­rt dealing primarily with appellate functions, and a new FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, inter-governmental disputes and matters arising under Article 199 — ref­lected “a forward-looking reform model”.
This division, he argued, would bring Pakistan closer to systems in many established democracies where constitutional and advisory jurisdictions are institutionally distinct, providing “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence”.
He said the reforms could help depoliticise the higher judiciary, eliminate internal divisions, reduce backlogs and prevent overlapping between constitutional and appellate benches.
Mr Khokhar said the amendments to Article 243 were in line with “modern constitutional democracies”, with a unified advisory framework under a principal military adviser answerable to the prime minister, the defence minister and the National Security Committee.
Meanwhile, newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rasheed supported the idea of setting up an FCC, and said the association was considering convening an All Pakistan Lawyers Convention, in consultation with the Pakistan Bar Council and other bar bodies. “I am glad that an FCC is being established in the country by amending the Constitution with consensus and unanimity,” he said.

Maulana Fazlur Rehman will be accompanied by Maulana Rashid Soomro, Mufti Abrar Ahmed and others.
Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
However, during the session of the standing committees, two JUI-F members, Aliya Kamran and Senator Kamran Murtaza, boycotted the meeting and said the proposed draft included amendments that were discarded in the 26th Amendment bill.
Yesterday, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that his party would oppose any proposed amendment that seeks to reduce the powers granted to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
“The provinces have a constitutional right to an increased NFC (National Finance Commission) award, not a reduced one,” he had stated, warning that if provincial rights were stripped, the JUI-F would “strongly oppose it.”
The JUI-F chief’s statement came after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad a day earlier, Fazl said his party had agreed on certain points in principle, but would only comment further once a draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment was presented.
Commenting on proposed changes to Article 243, he said the matter must be viewed in two ways: “If it is used to affect democracy, the Constitution or politics, we will not accept it. But if it is purely administrative, we will review it first and then decide.”
The PPP, a major ally of the ruling PML-N-led government, on Thursday also drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the NFC while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.</p><small>2025-11-08 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08213126ff3ddc6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953906/ppp-pml-n-dismiss-claims-of-27th-constitutional-amendment-being-passed-in-haste' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PML-N dismiss claims of 27th Constitutional Amendment being passed in haste</strong></a><br><p>The PML-N and the PPP on Saturday rejected the impression that the 27th Constitutional Amendment was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.
Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said there was “no urgency” in convening the cabinet meeting even though Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the session virtually from Baku, Azerbaijan.
Malik said there was “a lot of discussion” about the proposed constitutional amendment, adding that deliberations were continuing within party committees and that it was the parliamentarians’ right to propose amendments.
He maintained that a “wrong impression” had been created that the process was being hurried. The state minister also said that some changes can be made to the draft as it is under debate in parliamentary committees.
When informed by the show’s host that the 18th Amendment was passed after over a year of consultations and the 26th Amendment was debated for more than a month, while the proposed 27th Amendment appeared to have moved from draft to agreement in less than a week, with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari receiving the draft on Monday, holding a Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting, and reaching consensus shortly after, Malik acknowledged the unusually rapid pace of the process.
PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan, however, credited his party, highlighting that hours-long sessions were held during the two-day CEC, with every member participating in a detailed and open discussion on issues ranging from Article 243 to dual nationality. He assured that there was adequate debate within the PPP on the proposed changes.
“If law-making is done in a hurry, the public becomes suspicious for no reason,” Chan said.
When asked about revision in the NFC formula, Chan said that the federation grants tax exemptions worth Rs300 billion and oversees around 25 departments that do not even conduct audits.
“You cannot fix your own tax system and then say you will take money from the provinces,” he said.
The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar, who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting), requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
The PTI did not attend the subsequent session of the parliamentary committees and called it a “conspiracy against the Constitution”.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08224031e6d138c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953913/opposition-alliance-announces-protest-movement-against-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance announces protest movement against 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), on Saturday announced a nationwide protest movement against the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, urging the people to take a stand against the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
The TTAP is a coalition of six opposition parties and was formed last year. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.
Pashtunkhawa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, in a video statement, said the protest movement would begin from November 9 (Sunday).
 






Abbas said that democratic institutions in the country have been “paralysed” and the “nation must step up”. Lamenting the proposed changes, he said the government was given even more power through “to the powerful”.
“In this hour, it is the responsibility of the people of Pakistan to take a stand and speak against against such an extremely dark and extremely dangerous constitutional amendment, which is the 27th (amendment).
Leader of the opposition-designate Achakzai said the alliance, through the protest movement, will show that the “will of the people” of Pakistan will be the final decision.
“I have given an oath, at least on five different occasions, that I will safeguard the Constitution. Our parliament is attacking our Constitution,” said the PkMAP leader, who is also the chairman of the opposition alliance.
He added that as the parliament is representative of the people, the opposition alliance is approaching the masses directly. “The way they are attacking the parliament, and the manner in which they are shaking the foundations of the Constitution and Pakistan, we are left with no other option.”
Achakzai appealed to all political parties to participate and said their movement would kick off on Sunday night. “Every night, with a new slogan, we will awaken the consciousness of the people. The slogan of the people is the supremacy of the Constitution,” added the veteran politician.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
Key clauses of the proposed amendment
Tarar, while tabling the bill in the Senate, said it would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.
“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08093142373c66d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953877/pakistan-us-explore-ways-to-develop-economically-entrenched-strategic-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US explore ways to develop ‘economically entrenched strategic partnership’</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Pakistan early on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries, with Islamabad’s envoy describing it as an effort to build an “economically entrenched strategic partnership“.
The development came as S. Paul Kapur — who assumed charge as the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs on October 22 — met Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at the State Department for what was described as a cordial and forward-looking exchange.
Ambassador Sheikh said the two sides explored practical ways to translate recent high-level political resolve into concrete cooperation.
“We discussed the ways and means of translating the resolve — expressed at the leadership level — of developing Pakistan–US ties into an economically entrenched strategic partnership, through sustained engagement in multiple domains of mutual interest,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, Kapur said it was a “pleasure” to meet the Pakistani envoy.
“We discussed ways to advance the US-Pakistan relationship and make our countries more prosperous and secure,” he said in a post on X.
 






Kapur’s meeting with Ambassador Sheikh comes as Washington and Islamabad recalibrate their relations under US President Donald Trump’s second administration.
After years of uneven engagement and recurring mistrust, both sides are now emphasising economic cooperation alongside traditional security ties.
In recent months, US officials have pointed to Pakistan’s potential role in regional stability and its capacity to contribute to economic and energy initiatives in South and Central Asia. The Trump administration has also encouraged American firms to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s infrastructure, minerals, and technology sectors.
 
 

For Islamabad, the new tone in Washington offers an opportunity to diversify its partnership with the US, while the Trump administration appears keen to reduce Pakistan’s overreliance on China. Officials in both capitals say they want to anchor the relationship in trade, investment, and long-term development — not merely in aid or counterterrorism cooperation.
Late last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan, but added that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries did not come at the expense of Washington’s relationship with New Delhi.
In September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.
Trump’s South Asia narrative
Trump has continued to highlight his role in what he calls the prevention of a nuclear war in South Asia following the brief but intense military conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year in May.
During several public remarks, he has claimed that his administration’s swift diplomatic engagement “stopped a nuclear conflict” after the two neighbours exchanged air strikes, and that “eight planes were shot down“ during the clashes.
 
 

While New Delhi has not confirmed Trump’s account, his repeated references to that episode reflect Washington’s renewed interest in South Asian stability — and the value it assigns to maintaining direct communication with both capitals.
Despite the fresh tone, the relationship needs greater effort to sustain its current momentum. Washington continues to view Pakistan through a regional lens — balancing its strategic interests between India and China — while Islamabad seeks broader recognition of its economic and geopolitical relevance.
Analysts note that although the two countries are again speaking of a “strategic partnership“, much will depend on how the rhetoric translates into measurable progress. Both sides must still bridge differences over regional security, trade access, and Pakistan’s deepening engagement with China.
As one observer in Washington noted, “It’s an encouraging start — but what matters now is whether this goodwill can evolve into a sustained, structured partnership.”</p><small>2025-11-08 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08200436295530f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953887/saim-abrar-star-as-pakistan-seal-historic-home-series-victory-against-south-africa' target='_blank'><strong>Saim, Abrar star as Pakistan seal historic home series victory against South Africa</strong></a><br><p>A capacity crowd at the Iqbal Stadium got what it so desperately wanted: flowing strokes off the bat of Babar Azam. Normally, home supporters would’ve quietened at seeing Fakhar Zaman cleaned up early on in a small chase – potentially a harbinger of things to come; perhaps an all too familiar collapse in the offing.
But here on Saturday night, there were loud roars with chants of “Babar” echoing across the venue with Pakistan’s batting superstar set to come next. Babar didn’t disappoint, dispatching the South African bowlers with his trademark elan, and alongside Saim Ayub set Pakistan on their way to a rousing seven-wicket victory that sealed the three-match One-day International series 2-1 in their favour.
The venue had gone silent after Babar’s departure in the 11th over, disappointment filling the air that they weren’t able to see more of him when he was looking close to his best, run out for 27 after stroking five crisp fours.
But they soon found their voice as Saim tore into the South African attack with a 70-ball 77 that featured 11 fours and a six and although he fell with Pakistan nearing victory, Mohammad Rizwan (32 not out) took them through with Salman Ali Agha hitting the winning boundary.
The foundation for Pakistan’s victory, under new skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi for this series, had been laid by the spinners as the visitors were bundled out for 143 in 37.5 overs. South Africa captain Matthew Breetzke had elected to bat and his side were coasting smoothly with openers Quinton de Kock (53) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (39) well set until their lineup collapsed in the face of spin.
Salman (2-18) provided the first two wickets before Mohammad Nawaz (2-31) followed with the big dismissal of De Kock until Abrar Ahmed (4-27) ran through South Africa’s spine and Pakistan eventually secured their first-ever ODI series triumph at home against their opponents.
“The credit goes to the players,” reflected Shaheen at the post-match ceremony. “We didn’t get much help in the first five or six overs but when the spinners came in, they made it really tough for them.”
On a sun-kissed afternoon, the 72-run opening stand between Pretorius and De Kock ended after the former, who had hit four fours and a six, was caught at long-off by Babar and Salman struck again four overs later when Tony de Zorzi chipped him to the cover fielder.
De Kock, whose splendid century in the second game had helped South Africa level the series, completed his half century off 68 deliveries with his sixth four, a sweep of Nawaz, only to be trapped lbw by the spinner two deliveries later. The left-hander also hit a six.
South Africa then slipped from 106-2 to 109-4 with player-of-the-match Abrar cleaning up debutant Rubin Hermann on the first ball of the 26th over. Bails were flying once again, twice off two balls, two overs later as Abrar worked his magic. First Donovan Ferreira was bowled round his legs before a googly that stayed low knocked back Corbin Bosch’s off-stump.
Pakistan had South Africa on the ropes with Breetzke (16) running out of partners quick and fast as Nawaz had Bjorn Fortuin lbw, and the writing was on the wall for the Proteas when their skipper was caught behind off Abrar, who recorded his career-best ODI figures, as they slipped to 130-8.
Pakistan captain Shaheen (2-18) then cleaned up the tail with two wickets in two balls – both of them bowled, including the wicket of Nqabayomzi Peter who made a defiant 16.
“Batting conditions were pretty tough and we didn’t get enough runs and they batted freely because of that,” rued De Kock, who was named player-of-the-series.
The sentiment was echoed by Breetzke. “Not enough runs… we were probably looking at 250. It was tough conditions and unfortunately we lost too many wickets there.”
Nandre Burger’s dismissal of Fakhar, knocking his stumps through the gate, brought Babar to the crease and after a quiet opening couple of overs, the right-hander, who had scores of seven and 11 in the opening two matches, got Pakistan off the mark in the third which ended with a boundary of Saim’s bat – a punch through the covers.
A deft touch of Lundi Ngidi then brought Babar’s first boundary before Saim flicked away the pacer for four. Babar then pulled Burger away for four before treating the crowd to two delightful boundaries off Ngidi in the sixth over.
Boundaries were flowing for Pakistan – three of them coming off the eighth over off Bosch, all of them from Saim with the first a six. At the other end, Babar showed his elegance with a scrumptious cover drive for four as Pakistan reached 59-1 after the first 10.
Babar would soon be run out, but Saim took over and was unrelenting. He reached his 50 of just 39 balls with his eighth four, pulling away Burger. Fortuin and Ferreira were then swept for boundaries before the latter was hit for a one-bounce four.
Saim fell when he couldn’t get the distance off Fortuin but by then the job was done with Rizwan closing it out. Rizwan, who was replaced by Shaheen as skipper ahead of the series, hit three fours and a six – over midwicket – to leave Pakistan four runs away and Salman finished it off with 24.5 overs to spare.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/081825171abc2d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953880/pm-shehbaz-again-thanks-trump-for-bold-and-decisive-leadership-in-brokering-pak-india-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz again thanks Trump for ‘bold and decisive leadership’ in brokering Pak-India ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday, once again, thanked the “bold and decisive leadership” of US President Donald Trump for brokering a ceasefire between Pakistan and India during the conflict between the two nuclear neighbours in May.
While addressing Azerbaijan’s Victory Day parade in Baku, the premier praised President Trump’s exemplary leadership, which led to the success of the peace efforts.

“It was President Trump’s, bold and decisive leadership, that brought about, the ceasefire, between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia — averting a major war, and saving millions of people.”
In his speech, the PM reiterated that Pakistan, “just like their Azerbaijani and Turkish brothers”, seeks peace, adding that no one can ever be allowed to challenge its sovereignty or undermine its territorial integrity.
The premier recalled that the Azerbaijani and Turkish military contingents had “proudly” marched alongside the Pakistani armed forces in Islamabad amid tremendous applause on August 14 this year, when they celebrated ‘Marka-i-Haq’ to commemorate their “historic victory” in the four-day war with India.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
PM Shehbaz highlighted how, five years ago, “the courageous sons of Azerbaijan, under the bold and visionary leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, rose to respond to the call of history”.
“The world witnessed in awe as Azerbaijan’s brave armed forces liberated their ancestral lands of majestic Karabakh,” the PM stated. “Throughout this entire struggle for liberation, Pakistan stood like a rock with its brotherly country Azerbaijan.”
 






According to PM Shehbaz, Azerbaijan’s victory in Karabakh was a “glorious vindication” of a just cause and a beacon of hope for all nations striving for sovereignty and self-determination, including the brave and resilient people of Gaza and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
The prime minister arrived in Baku on Friday for a two-day official visit to Azerbaijan at Aliyev’s invitation and to attend the country’s Victory Day ceremony.
Referring to the recent flare up with the Afghan Taliban regime, the prime minister said that their common resolve for peace has most recently been tested in the case of Afghanistan and expressed gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well as to Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for their “invaluable contribution” in facilitating, the peace efforts, between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This is a true reflection of the strong and time-tested fraternal ties between our countries that stand together, through thick and thin,“ he opined.
Victory Day is observed to “commemorate the historic victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia”, according to the PM’s Office.

PM Shehbaz meets Türkiye’s President Erdogan
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Baku during his two-day official visit to the Central Asian country.
The two leaders reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Turkey and reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen cooperation in areas of mutual interest, reported state-run PTV.
 






During the meeting, the premier emphasised Pakistan’s commitment to transforming its longstanding fraternal relations with Türkiye into a broad partnership encompassing political, defense, economic, trade, investment, and people-to-people links.
The two also agreed that a Turkish ministerial delegation would visit Pakistan soon. They also agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and international issues of “mutual concern and reiterated their shared desire to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and the broader Muslim world”.
The prime minister, accompanied by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, also extended warm congratulations to President Erdogan and the brotherly people of Türkiye on the occasion of Türkiye’s Republic Day.
Later, the prime minister departed Baku for Islamabad.
JF-17s to participate in parade
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets would appear in Azerbaijan’s Victory Day parade scheduled for later today.
Since 2020, Victory Day has been observed in Azerbaijan on November 8 to commemorate its victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia.
“Long live Pakistan-Azerbaijan friendship. Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets will be appearing in Azerbaijan’s victory parade today, commemorating the liberation of Karabagh,” he said.
The minister made the comments while responding to a post on social media platform X by Pakistan’s embassy in Baku. The embassy had posted about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who embarked on a visit to the country a day earlier to attend Victory Day celebrations, and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev attending a joint dinner.
 






A day earlier, Pakistan and Azerbaijan had reiterated their resolve to further cement their cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence. The two sides made the pledge during a meeting between PM Shehbaz and Azerbaijan President Aliyev in Baku.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.
“The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationship and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence,” says a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
The prime minister also extended an invitation to the president of Azerbaijan to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience, which the latter accepted.
In a late-night post on X, Shehbaz had stated that he was looking forward to the “grand parade”.
Talking about his meeting with President Aliyev, he said the two “reviewed the deep-rooted and fraternal ties between our two countries and agreed to further expand cooperation in trade, energy, connectivity, and defence”.
 






Last month, a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, had landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise.
 






According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the exercise, called Indus Shield Alpha, aimed to enhance mutual understanding, tactical coordination and interoperability between the air forces of Pakistan and Azerbaijan.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08200814a5716e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953897/pti-terms-27th-amendment-conspiracy-against-the-constitution-boycotts-committee-discussions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI terms 27th Amendment ‘conspiracy against the Constitution’; boycotts committee discussions</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has called the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution” and refused to become part of the proceedings of the committee established to discuss the bill.
“The proposed 27th Amendment is nothing short of a conspiracy against the Constitution. The entire process is being carried out in haste, without consultation or deliberation, in complete disregard of democratic norms and parliamentary traditions,” Senator Ali Zafar said while talking to Dawn.
“These amendments strike at the very foundation of the constitutional structure by undermining the independence of the judiciary and eroding the delicate balance of powers that the 1973 Constitution so carefully created,” he said.
“Any change to the Constitution must come only through broad-based national consensus, not through secret drafts or executive dictates. The Constitution belongs to the people of Pakistan, not to any government of the day, and no one has the right to mutilate it for political convenience,” Senator Zafar said while explaining why his party has decided not to become part of the debate.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said the proposed constitutional amendment is a “ploy to enslave us”.
“Subjugating the Supreme Court to a new court, whose judges will be the favorites of the current Form 47 government, is to turn the judicial system into an instrument of coercion,” said the PTI leader in a post on X.
 






Former Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said that PTI has a clear stance that the current parliament cannot do any legislation as it lacks the mandate of the masses.
“We will use all possible tactics and platforms, including protest, to stop the legislation. I believe that fresh elections should be held before any such legislation because the current government is a Form-47 government and it does not have the mandate of the people,” he explained.
Asad Qaiser said that a meeting of the party leadership will be called to devise further strategy to resist against the move.
Earlier, while talking to the media outside the Parliament, Senator Zafar claimed that the draft of the 27th Amendment had 50 amendments.
He said it was strange that the amendments were being made without sharing them with the masses. Zafar added that his party’s Senators would not be able to discuss the amendment in the committee, as they had not read the bill.
Replying to a question, he said that the civil society, legislators and other stakeholders discussed the draft of the 18th Amendment for over a year and gave their recommendations and proposals, but this time “efforts were being made to pass the amendment in haste”.
Senator Zafar said that it was unfortunate that the spirit of the 1973 Constitution was being changed, and the PPP is supporting it.
Earlier today,  the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
The bill proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the ANP and the PML-Zia.
However, there was no meeting between the government and the PTI.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08151301a8b0e27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953879/bill-for-27th-constitutional-amendment-tabled-in-senate-after-federal-cabinets-approval' target='_blank'><strong>Bill for 27th Constitutional Amendment tabled in Senate after federal cabinet’s approval</strong></a><br><p>Shortly after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate on Saturday and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
A joint session of both the NA and Senate standing committees on law and justice was then summoned to discuss the amendment.
However, during the session of the standing committees, two Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) members, Aliya Kamran and Senator Kamran Murtaza, boycotted the meeting and said the proposed draft included amendments that were discarded in the 26th Amendment bill.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
‘Discussions will continue till consensus is reached’
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, speaking to the media after the adjournment of the committees, said all parties were participating in the session and they had also “requested the opposition to participate”.
“Aliya Kamran had informed us that they have instructions from their party not to attend the session; however, all other parties were in attendance. We even asked the opposition to be a part of the session.”
Tarar said the “long-awaited” proposed amendment has been in discussion for the last 10-15 years. “Even today we are having a constructive debate on the matter.”
“At the time of the 18th Amendment, it was on the constitutional agenda, and even earlier, during the 26th Amendment, but due to certain reasons, one of which was Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s suggestion that such a major change should not be made and that it would be better to move towards transition and form constitutional benches,” said Tarar.
The law minister elaborated that the formation of the benches increased the workload of the judiciary, as the same judges were hearing cases fixed for the bench and otherwise.
“The objective was to ensure that the cases fixed in the Supreme Court are not delayed further and the common man gets relief.”
Tarar added that one of the aims of the proposed changes is also to do away with the criticism of a “court within a court”.  “All members have reviewed it (proposed constitutional amendment) and we have completed arguments on around 60pc of the clauses.”
The law minister said a few questions have been raised by some members, clarifying that they are legal in nature and “not fundamental issues”.
“We will reconvene again tomorrow morning at 11am and continue our discussions. And till the time we do not reach a consensus, from all members of both Houses, the discussions will continue,” said the law minister.
The Senate and standing committee sessions will resume on Sunday, November 9.
Farooq H. Naek said no decision has been reached yet after deliberations on the proposed constitutional amendment, and claimed around 80pc of the bill was discussed.
He added that certain “mistakes” in the draft will be corrected and the law ministry has been made aware.
When asked about changes to Article 243, he said it was not discussed during today’s session.
Tarar tables bill in Senate
The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by the law minister, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar — who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting —  requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
 


During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said that debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
“I would suggest that instead of sending it to the committee, let this Senate be treated as a committee as a whole,” he said, suggesting the bill be debated by all individuals. He further said that the opposition had received the draft today and had also not yet read a word of it.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“We cannot debate something we have not read,” he said.
Law minister details key clauses
Meanwhile, the law minister said that the bill would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
 
 

He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
Federal govt approves draft
Shortly before the Senate session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had chaired the cabinet meeting via video link from Azerbaijan, according to state-run PTV News.
“The federal cabinet approved the draft for the 27th Constitutional Amendment and welcomed it to the fullest extent,” it had added.
“Everyone made joint efforts for the 27th Constitutional Amendment for strengthening the Centre’s relations with the provinces and the country’s wider interests,” the premier was quoted as saying. He commended the law minister’s efforts, as well as those of the attorney general of Pakistan.
 






Shehbaz noted that he had taken PML-N President Nawaz Sharif into confidence for the amendments and sought his guidance on them. “I also took President Asif Ali Zardari into confidence regarding the Amendment and we are deeply grateful to him for their approval,” the premier said.
He went on to specifically thank PPP Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and heads of other allied parties who held discussions with him and “strongly supported” the draft. The prime minister noted that Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan, PML-Zia head Ijazul Haq and other politicians were also apprised of the legislation.
He stressed that everyone must work together for the country’s progress and prosperity.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the ANP and the PML-Zia.
After the federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, the law minister had briefed the media on some of the key features of the draft and informed that the bill would be tabled in the Senate.
Moreover, Tarar recalled that at the time of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the MQM-P had contacted the prime minister and the PML-N seeking changes to Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish local governments (LGs).
“They had introduced a bill in the Senate, which was referred to a committee and on the directives of the premier, I, as the law minister, also gave a note in its support,” Tarar said.
“As that bill is already pending, the cabinet has also directed me today that when today’s bill is referred to the committee after being presented in the senate, the committee should also mull over [the one tabled by the MQM-P],” he said.
Tarar said that the government would try to convince its allied partners to develop a consensus on this bill so it could be passed, adding that a recent resolution by the Punjab Assembly regarding LGs would also be discussed.
He further said that Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) leaders, in their meeting with PM Shehbaz earlier this week, had directed his attention to a bill pertaining to an increase in the seats for the Balochistan Assembly.
“So both these bills, which are already pending before the law and justice standing committee, will be debated,” the minister said.
“Pakistan is going through very tough circumstances, and I think the country’s greatest need today is political consensus and political stability,” the law minister stressed.
The proposed constitutional tweaks have been heavily criticised by lawyers and politicians, who termed them an attempt to revoke provincial rights granted in the 18th Amendment.
The federal cabinet meeting was originally scheduled for Friday, but was postponed due to PM Shehbaz’s commitments in Azerbaijan, sources in the PM Office said. However, some were of the opinion that the meeting was put off due to a lack of consensus between the ruling PML-N and the PPP over the Amendment.
The PPP has said it would support amendments to Article 243, which defines the powers of the armed forces, but has rejected proposals related to provinces’ shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and any rollback of the 18th Amendment.
The PPP’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) yesterday decided that it “agrees in principle with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed” — a proposal also mulled during the 26th Amendment discussions last year.
The MQM-P presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong and autonomous LGs across the country. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which met with an MQM-P delegation on Thursday, has opposed any amendment that would reduce the powers granted to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0818540999fc719.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953895/tehran-to-restrict-water-as-iran-battles-drought' target='_blank'><strong>Tehran to restrict water as Iran battles drought</strong></a><br><p>Iran was laying plans on Saturday to cut off water supplies periodically to Tehran’s 10-million-strong population as it battles its worst drought in many decades.
Rainfall in the capital has this year been at its lowest level in a century, local officials say, and half of Iran’s provinces have not seen a drop fall in months.
Now, to save water, the government is planning water cuts in Tehran — and several local news outlets have already reported pipes running dry overnight in some areas.
“This will help avoid waste even though it may cause inconvenience,” Iran’s Energy Minister Abbas Ali Abadi said on state television.
In a speech broadcast on Friday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned that Tehran might have to be evacuated if no rain falls before the end of the year.
But he gave no details about how such a vast operation would be conducted.
Tehran nestles on the southern slopes of the Alborz mountains and has hot, dry summers usually relieved by autumn rains and winter snowfall.

Reservoirs run dry
Tehran is by far the country’s biggest city and its inhabitants use three million cubic metres of water per day, according to local media.
The main Amir Kabir dam on the Karaj river, one of five reservoirs serving the capital, is running dry and holds only 14m cubic litres, according to Behzad Parsa, director general of the Tehran water company, cited by the official news agency IRNA.
During the same period last year, the reservoir held 86m cubic metres, he added, but now it only has enough to maintain supplies to the Tehran region for less than two weeks.
On Saturday, state television broadcast images of several dams, serving the central city of Isfahan and Tabriz in the northwest, showing significantly lower water levels compared to previous years.
Hassan Hosseini, the deputy Iran’s second-largest city Mashhad, told IRNA agency on Thursday that night-time water cuts were being considered to address the water shortage.
And over the summer on July and August, two public holidays were declared in Tehran to save water and energy, at a time when power outages were almost daily during the intense heatwave.</p><small>2025-11-08 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/081604443a3027b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953890/funeral-of-judicial-independence-how-proposed-constitutional-changes-affect-structure-of-pakistans-judiciary' target='_blank'><strong>‘Funeral of judicial independence’: How proposed constitutional changes affect structure of Pakistan’s judiciary</strong></a><br><p>Barely had the dust settled on the 26th Amendment when another constitutional storm began to brew in Islamabad. The government’s freshly tabled 27th Amendment promises, on paper, to “streamline” governance — through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates, and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.

Key changes proposed to judicial structure:

Creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, with its own chief justice and judges
FCC to assume SC’s most significant powers; SC to be downgraded to apex court for civil and criminal appeals only
FCC decisions to be binding on all courts, including the SC
HC judges may be transferred to other high courts on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission; refusal to accept a transfer is treated as retirement.


At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court: the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the Supreme Court (SC), senior High Court (HC) judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice. Judges would retire at 68.
The amendment further stipulates that the president may transfer a high court judge from one high court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan. A judge of a high court who does not accept a transfer under this Article shall be deemed to have retired from his office.
The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.”
Moreover, the FCC would take over the Supreme Court’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the President’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.
Beneath all the bureaucratic phrasing lies a familiar unease: is this reform, or a fundamental reinvention of Pakistan’s judicial architecture?
With the ink on the last amendment still contested in court, the legal fraternity isn’t buying the calm. Lawyers across the country have now entered the debate, warning that the proposed changes could redraw — or perhaps blur — the boundaries between the judiciary, the executive, and the federation itself.
 






Altering the social contract
Abdul Moiz Jaferii described the proposed amendment in stark terms, saying a draft of it “should be sent to North Korea, so that Kim Jong Un can read it to his children as a lullaby.”
“This is the stuff of tinpot dictatorships,” he added, drawing parallels to “sub-Saharan African regimes where the rule of law has never taken root.”
Jaferii emphasised that Pakistan has historically maintained a system of laws and justice, “as deficient as it may be,” along with a warrant of precedence and democratic governance. But, he argued, a regime whose election is in doubt and which cannot satisfactorily address questions about its legitimacy is “delegitimising the state itself.”
“Our social contract is being altered by people who know they were not elected into office legitimately,” he said. “The fabric of the state is being stitched up to allow for this power grab to continue.”
 


He criticised senior figures in politics, noting that “a few old men with ulterior motives are rolling back the rules of the game in a country where the vast majority of the population finds nothing in common with their age, their politics or their principles.”
“The nation of smartphone natives has been made subject to the dial-up dreams of septuagenarian landline merchants,” he concluded.
The funeral of judicial independence
For lawyer Basil Nabi Malik, “If the 26th amendment was the death of the independence of the judiciary, the 27th amendment is its funeral.”
“In essence, this amendment seeks to strip the judiciary of the remaining vestiges of independence that one could possibly conceive to remain within it. It straitjackets judges into forced consent when it comes to transfers, nominations or appointments, failing which they would be retired, firmly retains and expands executive control over judicial functions, and even secures the selection of the first batch of FCC judges to make sure they fit their deemed ‘criteria’.”
According to Malik, the age of FCC judges has been increased, while that of SC judges remains the same, thereby adding a reward and punitive element to the selection or non selection to the FCC.
“All in all, it is marvellous invention. The institution which makes the law controls the institution that is supposed to interpret it and ensure it protects the citizens rights,” he said.
When a person is aggrieved by the government, he said, they are supposed to be happy going to a court controlled by that government against that very government. And they need not complain about it. “After all, what could possibly go wrong? How could such a court not be inclined to side with the government? How could one even think that this is a bad idea?”
“It is said that all is well that ends well, but this, unfortunately, will not end well by any means.”
Great blow to the Constitution
Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig too warned that the 27th Amendment “spells the final death knell of an independent judiciary.” He said that while the 26th Amendment had reconstituted the Judicial Commission of Pakistan by giving members associated with the executive a majority, the 27th Amendment goes further by creating a Federal Constitutional Court.
“Not content with an executive-dominated Judicial Commission,” Baig explained, “the Amendment also provides that the first Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court shall be appointed by the President in consultation with the Prime Minister. The other judges of the Constitutional Court would then be appointed by the President on the prime minister’s advice, and in consultation with their handpicked Chief Justice.”
Baig argued that the 27th Amendment “deals a greater blow to our Constitution than any change introduced by dictatorial regimes.” He added that with the creation of the Constitutional Court and its packing with judges handpicked by the government, “the polis has finally fallen apart.”
A tool to intimidate, punish, and purge independent judges
Lawyer Rida Hosain also criticised the proposed amendment, saying it effectively creates “a new court that serves the government.” She explained that the first Chief Justice of the new “Federal Constitutional Court” is to be appointed by the President on the Prime Minister’s advice, leaving “not even a semblance of independence.”
Hosain further underscored that the amendment permits the transfer of judges without their consent, with refusal treated as a “deemed resignation.” She warned that the amendment is “a tool to intimidate, punish, and purge independent judges, turning the judiciary into a servile arm of the executive.”
Direct assault on the independence of the judiciary
For lawyer Ahmad Maudood Ausaf, the 27th Amendment is “an extension of the 26th, though this time the disguise is fully gone.” He said that while the legal fraternity had warned of the implications back then, “now the fear has a face.” According to him, the judiciary, “once the last line between citizen and state, is being folded neatly into the hands of those it was meant to hold accountable.”
“How could this have ever been about reform? It is not,” Ausaf said, calling the amendment “a retreat, and the biggest one post the 2009 lawyers’ movement.” He argued that the measure is designed to hollow out institutions and constitutes a direct assault on the independence of the judiciary.
Ausaf warned that the new ‘constitutional court’ will allow those in power to “decide who gets to sit, who gets to stay and for how long, and who gets quietly transferred out of sight,” with seniority rendered meaningless. Citing the 26th Amendment as a “trial run,” he said judges were moved “like chess pieces, shuffled around for convenience rather than competence.”
He also dismissed claims that the amendment is meant to speed up cases, noting that only a sliver of all pending cases sit before the Supreme Court” and the real backlog is in lower courts. He added that the reform will blur more than it solves and could spark jurisdictional conflicts among top courts.
“In the end,” Ausaf noted, “this amendment trades independence for influence, merit for loyalty, and justice for convenience. And when that happens, the courts don’t decide anymore. They are decided.”

The far-reaching legislative proposal, among other changes, rewrites Article 243 of the Constitution, creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces and abolishing the long-standing office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC).
It also vests broader, constitutionally protected powers and privileges in the country’s top military leadership.

Article 243 governs the relationship between the prime minister (as head of the federal government) and the president (as the head of state) in relation to the control and command of the armed forces.
Key changes proposed to Article 243:

Army chief to be recognised as Chief of Defence Forces, positioned at top of Pakistan’s armed services
Office of CJCSC to be abolished
Establishing a Commander of National Strategic Command position
President to appoint army, naval, air chiefs on advice of premier
Life-long constitutional protection to be provided to 5-star rank officers


According to the draft tabled in the Senate today, the amendment would make the Chief of the Army Staff the constitutionally recognised Chief of the Defence Forces, effectively merging the army chief’s current authority with a new overarching title that places him at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.
 


It also proposes establishing a Commander of the National Strategic Command and defining extensive entitlements for officers elevated to the rare five-star ranks of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet.
Under the new language, the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, would appoint the army, naval and air chiefs, with the army chief serving “concurrently as Chief of the Defence Forces”.
The draft further provides that the Commander of the National Strategic Command, a position overseeing the country’s nuclear and strategic assets, would be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the army chief, and must come from within the army.
A separate set of clauses grants life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star rank. Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47. Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.
Their post-command duties and remuneration would be determined by the federal government and the president on the prime minister’s advice.
While presenting the draft in the Senate today, Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said that the Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal, which “is not a rank or an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure”.
“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes.
“These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
Tarar noted that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but the Parliament’s, adding that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025.
“The present CJCSC is also our hero; it [the position] will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
However, the minister continued, there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
A brewing storm
Government officials and some lawmakers describe the measure as a technical update meant to modernise command arrangements and regularise extraordinary promotions made in recent months. But the proposal has set off a storm of political debate in Islamabad, with opposition parties and civil-rights groups warning that it could tilt the balance of power further toward the military at the expense of civilian institutions.
The amendment’s political context has fueled controversy. The proposal surfaced earlier this month amid delicate negotiations within the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz coalition. It became public when Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari disclosed on November 3 that a PML-N delegation, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, had sought the PPP’s support for a package of constitutional changes.
The timing of the introduction of the bill drew further scrutiny because the draft’s changes to Article 243 coincide with the extraordinary promotion of Gen Asim Munir to the rank of Field Marshal after the India-Pakistan confrontation of May 2025. That promotion, the second in Pakistan’s history, has been cited by government officials as a reason to formalise such ranks in law.
If approved, the office of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, long regarded as the principal inter-service coordinating body, would be abolished on Nov 27 — the date on which incumbent CJCSC Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza is set to retire. Gen Mirza would hence become the last Chairman of Joint Services in the country’s history.
For now, the 27th Amendment Bill sits at the centre of an increasingly charged debate over the limits of civilian oversight and the military’s constitutional role. If enacted, it would mark the most consequential revision of Pakistan’s defence command structure since the constitutional battles of the 1980s and could redefine, in law, the delicate balance that has long shaped the country’s civil-military relations.</p><small>2025-11-08 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08125649df10371.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953883/indonesia-police-find-possible-explosive-powder-in-jakarta-mosque-blasts' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia police find possible explosive powder in Jakarta mosque blasts</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian police found possible explosive powder as they investigated explosions at a mosque in the capital Jakarta, and the suspected perpetrator is recovering, the police chief said on Saturday.
Explosions that injured dozens of people during Friday prayers could have been an attack, officials said, with a 17-year-old student the suspected perpetrator.
“Several pieces of supporting evidence were found,” police chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo told a press conference after visiting the victims at a hospital.
“There were written materials and some powder that could have potentially caused an explosion,” he said.
“We are gathering other records, including examining social media and family members to gather all the information.”

“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
Earlier, officials and sources said the talks stalled without any agreement. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told reporters, confirming that the third round of discussions — which had began on Thursday in the Turkish capital — had hit an impasse.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”
Asif elaborated that during the earlier rounds, the negotiators urged for another round. “Even after the talks in Istanbul failed, they committed that they would participate in the next round.”
“Our returning empty-handed reinforces a lack of faith in Afghanistan. The situation, God forbid if it flares up, if there are attacks on us from their soil, then we will respond depending on the gravity of the situation,” said the defence minister.
Asif clarified that the ceasefire stands for the time being, but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
“If they have put forward any unacceptable demand, then it is a means of escape, since they knew they would be unsuccessful, they can turn around and say that Pakistan denied our demands,” added the minister.
He reiterated that Pakistan has one main demand: the cessation of attacks from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, the Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid held Islamabad responsible for the deadlock in the talks, saying that the Pakistani delegation’s “irresponsible and uncooperative spirit” led to the breakdown.
Atmosphere described as ‘not positive’
Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lieutenant General Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate.
The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.
The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.
Reports from Istanbul suggested that the Pakistani delegation left for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.
DG ISI and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process.
A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials stayed behind to work with the mediators.
For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.
“The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified, and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism,” Andrabi said. “They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”
Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islamabad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive,” suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.
According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation.”
A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive.”
Information Minister Ata Tarar, who had declared a similar deadlock at the previous round before mediators salvaged a statement, said the “onus lies on Afghanistan to fulfill its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism — in which so far they have failed.”
“Pakistan shall continue to exercise all options necessary to safeguard the security of its people and its sovereignty,” Tarar said, echoing the Foreign Office spokesman’s earlier warning about Islamabad’s response in case of failure of the talks.
“All I can say is that, in any eventuality, we will protect the lives of our people and make sure that our civilians, our military forces, and our law enforcement agencies on the border are not killed by attacks emanating from Afghanistan,” Andrabi said.
Border clashes and talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began yesterday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire.
Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.

North Korea’s missile launch on Friday came just over a week after US President Donald Trump — on a tour of the region — expressed interest in meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Pyongyang did not respond to the offer.
Pyongyang’s defence minister No Kwang Chol said Washington “has become brazen in its military moves to threaten the security” of the North, and that it was “intentionally escalating the political and military tension in the region”.
 
 

“We will show more offensive action against the enemies’ threat,” he said, according to Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Earlier in the week, before Friday’s launch, US Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and his South Korean counterpart visited the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) where they “reaffirmed the strong combined defence posture and close cooperation” between their countries.
On Wednesday, the US nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington arrived in the South Korean port city of Busan for logistics support and crew rest, according to Seoul’s navy — an act North Korea’s No said was “further escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula”.
No also said Hegseth’s DMZ visit was meant to “fan up war hysterics”.
The US Indo-Pacific Command said on Friday that North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch “highlights the destabilising impact” of Pyongyang’s actions, adding that the United States was “consulting closely with our allies and partners”.
South Korea’s military had strongly condemned Pyongyang’s missile launch.
Seoul’s military “urges North Korea to immediately cease all actions that heighten tensions between the two Koreas”, it said in a statement.
Trump last week also announced that he had approved South Korea’s plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine.
Developing such a submarine would mark a significant leap in South Korea’s naval and defence industrial base, analysts say, joining a select group of countries with such vessels.
They have said Seoul’s plan to construct an atomic-driven vessel would likely draw an aggressive response from Pyongyang.
South Korean lawmakers, briefed by the defence intelligence agency, said earlier this week that Pyongyang appears ready to promptly carry out what would be its seventh nuclear test, should leader Kim decide to proceed.</p><small>2025-11-08 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08074659829e6ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953781/ecc-clears-circular-debt-plan-paves-way-to-wind-up-power-holding-limited' target='_blank'><strong>ECC clears circular debt plan, paves way to wind up Power Holding Limited</strong></a><br><p>• Okays Rs960bn sovereign guarantee for Rs1.225tr loans from local banks
• Says remittance incentives to be phased out with caution
• Gas allocated to fertiliser sector; LNG cost adjustments cleared for tariffs
ISLAMABAD: The Econo­mic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Fri­day approved an inter-corporate circular debt settlement plan, including tariff rationalisation for all six operational nuclear power plants in line with other power producers, thus also paving the way to wind up Power Holding Ltd (PHL), a shell company created to park old circular debt.
The meeting of the ECC, pre­­sided over by Finance Mi­­nister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved about Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees for Rs1.225 trillion in commercial loans from local banks for circular debt settlement and the diversion of gas for fertiliser plants.
 
 

As finalised by the military-led task force on power sector reforms in line with similar previous renegotiations with private and government-ow­ned power plants earlier this year, the ECC approved a sum­mary of the Power Divi­sion for “rationalisation of tariffs and payment adjustments for nuclear power plants (NPPs), government-owned power plants (GPPs), OGDCL and SNGPL”, a statement said.
The ECC approved the memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and authorised the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division “to execute negotiated settlement agreements based on these MoUs”.
The meeting also authorised the CPPA and the commission to amend the relevant power purchase agreements of four key nuclear power plants, including four at Chashma (C1 to C4) and two at Karachi (K2 and K3), having a total capacity of about 3,500 megawatts.
The federal government would take over some of their financial contractual obligations, for which the ECC also approved a set of facilitation measures. Based on this, the PAEC will file separate tariff petitions for these six plants, in line with the debt adjustments agreed in the negotiated settlement agreements.
In most cases, the government has guaranteed some foreign supplier credits, while in other cases, it has extended cash development loans and charged significantly higher interest rates than the original borrowing cost.
The meeting also authorised the CPPA to pay outstanding liabilities of GPPs from funds available under the circular debt financing facility, worth Rs1.225tr, recently contracted with local banks.
The ECC approved PHL loan repayment of Rs23.6bn and a waiver of Rs119.5bn on late-payment interest receivables from the LNG-based GPPs at Bhikki, Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah. It also approved payment of the rem­aining balance due to OGDCL via the two Uch power plants of over 1,000MW combined.
The ECC also approved policy guidelines to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority un­­der Section 21 of the Ogra Ord­­inance, enabling the inc­or­­poration of Rs22bn appro­ved by the federal cabinet to include LNG cost of supply in the consumer tariff, subject to verification by auditors.
The Ministry of Finance said the decision would enh­ance financial sustainability, strea­mline payments, and redu­­ce overall costs in the power sector.
Circular debt financing
The ECC approved another summary of the Power Divi­sion for the issuance of a government guarantee amounting to Rs659.67bn for circular debt financing of Rs1.225tr. The guarantee is intended for the settlement of Power Holding Limited’s debt and overdue payments to independent power producers.
It authorised the Finance Division to issue a “letter of comfort”, a document that as­­su­­res one party to another ab­­out a potential or existing busi­­ness or financial obligation.
The Power Division was directed to report back to the ECC on the timeframe for PHL’s closure following the settlement of the debt issue.
The meeting also decided in principle to phase out incentive schemes for banks and exchange companies for channelling home remittances, su­­bject to an appropriate timi­ng, given the State Bank of Pakis­tan’s warning that imme­diate action would severely affect healthy inflows.
The ECC also approved a proposal from the Ministry of National Food Security and Re­­­search to reallocate funds within the division. The ap­­p­r­oval allows the transfer of res­ources from the Inter-Provi­n­c­i­­al Coordination Division thr­ou­­gh a technical supplementary grant to support ongoing agricultural research initiatives.
A summary from the Minis­try of Maritime Affairs on utilising Pakistan International Bulk Terminal at Port Qasim for handling and exporting copper-gold and other mineral commodities was deferred, with instructions to resubmit a clearer framework after stakeholder consultation.
The Ministry of Interior was granted Rs960 million to ensure timely disbursements to the transferred staff of the Pak Public Works Department for October 2025 to June 2026.

A total of 7,764 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained in the week ending Nov 1, a significant increase from the previous week, the report said.
Of those arrested between Oct 26 and Nov 1, Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders and undocumented Afghans accounted for 77pc, while Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders represented the remaining 23 pc, it added.
 
 

The report noted that 86pc of the arrests and detentions occurred in Balochistan. Across the country, the top three districts for arrests and detentions between Jan 1 and Nov 1, 2025, were Chagi, Attock and Quetta.

The rate of returns and deportations also rose sharply in the last week of October. According to the UN data, the number of returns increased by 101pc and deportations by 131pc compared to the week of Oct 19-25.
The figures climbed from 18,630 returns, including 3,341 deportations, in the previous week to 37,448 returns, including 7,733 deportations, in the week ending Nov 1.
“This notable increase is primarily attributed to the reopening of the Chaman border, with Torkham also reopening on Nov 1,” the report stated.
From Sept 15, 2023, to Nov 1, 2025, a cumulative total of 1,667,713 individuals have returned to Afghanistan.
For the returns from Oct 26 to Nov 1, the largest group was PoR holders at 47pc, followed by undocumented individuals at 44pc and ACC holders at 8pc. In contrast, deportees during the same period were overwhelmingly undocumented at 93pc.
The report found that fear of arrest was the primary reason for return among 93pc of undocumented individuals and ACC holders, and for 39pc of PoR holders, since April 1, 2023.
The recent activity follows several government directives issued this year impacting Afghan nationals.
In July, the government ordered the repatriation of PoR card holders following the expiration of their card validity on June 30, later
setting a Sept 1 deadline for them to leave Pakistan.

These observations and recommendations emerged during the closing plenary of the 28th Sustainable Development Conference held on Friday, where experts — including representatives from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) — underscored the need for immediate action.
World Bank Country Director Dr Bolormaa Amgabazar said that Pakistan faces alarmingly high vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, compounded by escalating air and water pollution. At the same time, the country’s rapid population growth — among the highest globally — is placing immense strain on its already depleting natural resources, posing serious long-term risks to environmental and economic stability.
 
 

She said that the Climate and Country Development Report by the World Bank predicted a 20-30 per cent decline in GDP by 2050, amid business as usual and no action to address climate vulnerability.

“Pre-arranged and predictable multi-year financing is the key for Pakistan in terms of emergency that should be multi-sectoral financing basically for development,” she added.
Dr Bolormaa mentioned the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework, which is a $20 billion financing for the next 20 years to be available for Pakistan, and the government can decide its future interventions and projects around it.
 






IMF Country Representative Mahir Binici, on the occasion, said that Pakistan’s newly approved $1.4 billion arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) will play a vital role in strengthening the country’s economic resilience and capacity to withstand environmental shocks.
“The initiative is aimed at integrating climate considerations into Pakistan’s public financial management and fostering long-term sustainable growth,” he said, adding that the RSF is operating in parallel with Pakistan’s ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF), a three-year structural reform programme running until 2027.
“Both programmes are Pakistan’s own reform efforts, supported by the Fund,” Binici said, emphasising that the synergy between the two frameworks is “instrumental in placing Pakistan on a path toward stronger, more inclusive and climate-resilient growth.”
Mr Binici said Pakistan is taking concrete steps to embed climate priorities into its budgetary process, starting from the next fiscal year. “Project selection under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) will undergo climate screening, especially for major infrastructure investments,” he added, stressing that such transparency would enhance accountability and resource efficiency.
UNDP Resident Representative Samuel Rizk said the world is witnessing a transformative phase where financing has become more appropriate and critical for ensuring sustainable development.
He noted that the government is the biggest source of financing for sustainable development, chipped in by multilateral development entities and the private sector together.
