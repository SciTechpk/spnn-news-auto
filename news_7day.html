The draft policy estimates Pakis­tan’s annual vaccine requirement at 125 to 150 million doses in 2024-25 and suggests multi-year contra­cts of up to 10 years to reduce inves­tment risks and cut reliance on imports.
Prepared by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), the policy was finalised on Wednesday at meeting of a high-level committee formed by the prime minister.







Chairing the meeting, its chairman, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, announced that the policy would be forwarded to the premier for approval and implementation.

Proposes creating an alliance; draft will be forwarded to prime minister for approval

The meeting was co-chaired by Federal Minister for National Health Services Mustafa Kamal.
On capacity, the draft notes that Pakistan currently has only three vaccine manufacturing facilities: the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, Amson Vaccines and Pharma in Islamabad, and Dow University in Karachi.
Only one private facility produces limited vaccines, such as tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B, and it is not WHO-prequalified, restricting market access.

 

The NIH’s infrastructure is largely limited to small-scale fill-and-finish operations and would require major upgrades for end-to-end manufacturing.
To build capacity, the policy proposes a phased approach, starting with fill-and-finish operations, followed by technology transfer or joint ventures, and eventually full upstream production.
It acknowledges that WHO prequalification can take more than five years and prioritises meeting domestic needs first.
Around 40 different vaccines are administered in the country, of which 13 are included in the Expanded Programme on Immu­ni­sation (EPI).
However, due to the lack of local production, all vaccines are impor­ted, including some from India.
Guiding principles
The policy lays out guiding principles for developing local vaccine manufacturing to strengthen natio­nal health security, achieve self-suf­ficiency, enhance pandemic preparedness, and create a sustainable do­­mestic market with export potenti­­al. For FY 2025–26, the government will contribute 49 per cent of vacci­­ne costs, while Gavi will cover 51pc.
Pakistan is expected to enter the accelerated transition phase by 2030, followed by a five- to eight-year path to full self-financing.
The policy warns that reduced subsidies will increase pressure on public finances at a time when vaccine-preventable diseases remain a challenge.
To address these risks, it propo­ses establishing a National Vaccine Alliance under the Ministry of National Health Services as a coordination platform to guide investment and avoid duplication.
The alliance would include representatives from Drap, the pharmaceutical industry, public-sector manufacturers, the Federal Direc­torate of Immunisation, the Public Procurement Regulatory Autho­ri­­ty, academic institutions, development partners, and the Board of Investment.
Under its proposed mandate, the alliance would recommend buy-back guarantees or long-term procurement mechanisms, facilitate access to domestic and export markets, propose financing tools such as vaccine innovation funds and advance market commitments, and advise on regulatory reforms and incentive structures. The policy identifies high entry costs and the absence of sovereign procurement guarantees as the main barriers to local vaccine manufacturing.
Under the proposed buy-back framework, the draft calls for amendments to procurement rules to prioritise locally produced, non-WHO-prequalified vaccines once they pass lot release testing.
It proposes framework contracts of up to 10 years, with prices and volumes indexed to import parity benchmarks and efficiency targets.
Long-term contracts would be tied to technology transfer milestones, requiring manufacturers to move from fill-and-finish operations to full-scale production within the contract period.

KARACHI: Although police have claimed a significant reduction in the overall crime rate for the outgoing year, muggers, carjackers and mobilephone snatchers continue to haunt Karachiites in 2025, with official figures showing over 64,000 street crime incidents and more than 70 deaths resulting from these crimes.
The precise figure of 64,323 incidents is based on the number of FIRs registered during the outgoing year. However, the actual number of street crimes is believed to be much higher as there are a large number of victims who have either been turned away by the police or have chosen not to visit a police station to register a case of looting.
According to comparative street crime data of Karachi maintained by the police, a total of 64,323 incidents of street crimes — robbery, cell phone snatching, vehicle snatching / theft — have been reported in the outgoing year of 2025 as compared to a total 71,105 such incidents in 2024, showing a reduction of 6,782 street crimes.
The data show a total of 70 people were killed and 290 wounded by street criminals till the first week of December 2025, whereas in 2024 a total of 99 people were gunned down and 400 others injured by robbers.
The police say that during the same period of 12 months, a total of 17,706 mobile phones were snatched at gunpoint while during corresponding period in 2024, a total of 19,353 cell phones were snatched.
The police data say that 6,683 vehicles (302 cars and 6,381 motorcycles) were hijacked at gunpoint in 2025 as compared to 8,370 of last year.
As many as 39,934 vehicles (1,813 cars and 38,121 motorbikes) were stolen as compared to 43,382 vehicles of last year.
Analysis by expert
Analyst Dr Zoha Waseem, who teaches criminology at the University of Warwick, UK, and has done extensive research on policing and crimes in the metropolis, believes that a comparison of just two years is not a good benchmark as at least five- or 10-year data is required to assess whether crimes have been prevented or only a perception of “safe city” has developed.
She says there is no better data collection as all incidents are not reported because people still do not like to approach police.
She opines that maybe only half of the total cases are being reported as there is no estimation about unreported number of cases in the metropolis.
Dr Waseem says there is no study or research to assess people’s perception about police or state as to whether any improvement has occurred in the public perception.
“There has been no research that public perception has been improved and people feel safer and the city as safe,” Dr Waseem says.
“There is no study or survey that people’s perception has improved and the people are happy about performance of the police or the government. I have not seen such thing and I am not sure about the extent of achievement of the law enforcers,” she says, adding: “But if there is a trend that over a period of time, the number of crimes has gone down, then you could say they are doing good job.”
Carjacking ‘declines’ due to use of technology
Citizens-Police Liaison Commission (CPLC) Chief Zubair Habib opines that snatching of vehicles and cell phones is on decline partly because of use of technology (installation of CCTV cameras). As with the use of this technology, the criminals are being detected and arrested, he adds.
Mr Habib suggests that the way forward for controlling crimes, despite rising unemployment and closure of factories and migration of people to Dubai or other countries, lies in utilisation of technology.
Another major step that needs to be taken pertains to improving “Thana culture”, he adds.
He says that the Thana culture should be turned into service oriented.
As the use of technology has “ended” the “corruption” of traffic police through e-challan system, such technology should also be used at the police stations to end corruption of the police, he suggests.
IGP takes pride in crime reduction
Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn that there is an overall reduction in crime despite significant challenges.
He says this achievement has been made “despite severe socio-economic challenges, including inflation, unemployment, urban migration, and population growth”.
Regarding street crimes in Karachi, the IG says this crime has also been “contained”.
“Karachi is witnessing a stabilisation and gradual containment and reduction in street crime in 2025, preventing escalation despite economic stress and population growth,” says the top cop of Sindh.
“The daily average street crimes has declined from 1.36 per day in the year 2024 to 1.04 per day in the year 2025.” He says “violent robberies” have also been kept under check.
“The incidents of robbery with murder and injury have remained contained and closely monitored, with 70 fatalities and 290 injuries recorded during the year 2025 as compared to 99 fatalities and 400 injuries during the year 2024.”
The IGP cites a host of steps behind the reduction in street crimes. He says that the police are focused on operations against armed gangs and habitual offenders, which has helped prevent “a wider spike in violent crime”. Besides, targeted and intelligence-led policing has also been initiated, he adds.
He says that the police have emphasised data-driven deployments, snap checking, weapons recovery, and repeat offender tackling, which have delivered “tangible results in high-crime corridors”.

He hoped that the concerns of the telecom industry would be addressed and the spectrum would be offered under favourable terms during the auction.







Mr Bamatraf was addressing a press conference with the management of Telenor Pakistan, where they formally anno­unced PTCL’s acquisition of 100pc of Telenor Pakistan’s issued share capital and Orion Towers for Rs108bn.
Unresolved $800m issue
The PTCL CEO did not comment on the unresolved issue regarding the $800 million withheld by Etisalat since 2006, when the UAE-based company took control of PTCL. The Pakistani government still holds 62pc of PTCL’s shares, with the remaining 38pc divided between Etisalat (26pc) and public investors (12pc).
Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers are now fully owned subsidiaries of PTCL, alongside Pak Telecom Mobile Ltd (Ufone) and U Micr­ofinance Bank. Telenor Pakistan will continue to operate as a separate legal entity for the next 5-6 months before integrating with Ufone as a merged entity (Mer­geCo), subject to approval from the Pakistan Telecomm­unication Authority (PTA) and the Islamabad High Court.
Mr Bamatraf said the merged company would optimise spectrum reso­urces, expand network capabilities, and deliver seamless, secure, digitally enabled services aligned with Pakistan’s digital ambitions.
He also assured Telenor Pakistan employees that there would be no job losses due to the merger, emphasising respect for talent and the integration of industry best practices.
Following PTCL’s acquisition of Telenor Pakistan, the merged entity, which includes Ufone, will become the country’s second-largest telecom operator, with approximately 35pc of the subscriber base. Jazz Pakistan will remain the market leader with 37pc, while Zong will retain its position as the third-largest operator.
Acting CEO
In another development, the newly formed board of Telenor Pakistan appointed Awais Vohra as acting CEO.
Mr Vohra, a founding member of Telenor Pakistan’s launch team, was previously the company’s Chief Technology Officer. Telenor Pakistan, now an autonomous subsidiary of PTCL, completed all necessary regulatory approvals to finalise the acquisition.
PTA annual report
The Pakistan Teleco­mmunication Auth­ority’s Annual Report 2024-25 shows telecom revenues exceeding Rs1 trillion, up 12pc year-on-year. Subs­cribers crossed 200 million, broadband users topped 150m, and coverage exceeded 92pc. Fiscal contributions rose to Rs402bn, while investment reached $838m. Data usage surged to 27,727 petabytes. However, PTA official Naveed Butt said high electricity costs and dollar-linked government payments continue to strain operators despite revenue growth.

The controversial move aligns with the country’s new strategy toward its rivals, especially Iran, by granting Israelis unparalleled access to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
The move could help Israel militarily against Tehran’s so-called axis of resistance in the Middle East, while making the Horn of Africa a new battleground for its rivalries, experts say.

 

Israel’s announcement that it viewed Somaliland as an “independent and sovereign state” was a first for the self-declared republic that broke away from Somalia in 1991.
It followed discussions held “in the utmost secrecy, involving the Mossad in a para-diplomatic role”, said David Khalfa, a researcher at the Jean-Jaures Foundation in Paris.
Somaliland enjoys a unique geostrategic importance, as it offers direct access to the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el Mandeb Strait, one of the world’s busiest commercial shipping routes that connects the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.
It is also located in close proximity to the Iran-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen, who have struck Israel repeatedly since the start of the Gaza conflict in 2023.
If granted permission to deploy on the territory of Somaliland, the Israeli military would be able to operate jets and surveillance drones to “monitor and strike the Houthis”, said Khalfa.
“The possibility of operating from Somaliland territory could change the game,” said Asher Lubotzky of the Institute for Israeli-African Relations in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv.
Such access would be beneficial “given that the Gulf states, the United States and Israel have all fought the Houthis in recent years without any significant results”, he said.
Strait politics
Given its strategic location, Somaliland has long attracted Western interest.
Once under the influence of the Ottoman Empire, it became a British protectorate in the late 19th century, which lasted until 1960 when it joined the Somali Republic.
The United States later considered establishing a military base there in the 1980s.
In 1991, Somaliland unilaterally declared its independence from the rest of Somalia.
More than two years after the Hamas raid of Oct 7, Israel is now signalling its intention to build “counter-alliances” against Iran along the shores of a pro-Western, politically stable Somaliland.
That is “a rare asset in this part of the world”, said Khalfa.
For security expert Samira Gaid of the Somali think tank Baqiis Insight in Mogadishu, Israel’s recognition “reinforces concerns that the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are becoming militarised political spaces rather than neutral commercial corridors.”
It also accelerates “the entanglement, over the past decade, of the Horn of Africa in Middle Eastern rivalries,” she said.
Growing rivalry
Somaliland’s partnership with countries from the region is not new.
The United Arab Emirates operates a military base in the region’s port of Berbera under an agreement dating back to 2017, while sources claim that Abu Dhabi, an ally of Israel, may facilitate Israel’s access to the facility, Khalfa said.
Last year Somaliland also ent­ered into negotiations with landlocked Ethiopia, another Israel ally, to build a port on its coast.
Israel’s recognition “seems to align well with Israel’s alliances”, said Colin Clarke, research director at the Soufan Center in New York.
“The Horn of Africa, like other regions of the continent, has beco­­me a battleground between so-called middle powers,” Clarke added.
Analysts also point out how Israel’s new alliance in the region is further fuelling the growing rivalry between Israel and Turkiye.
The two countries have been at loggerheads as they both try to expand their influence over Syria, and as Ankara aims to send troops to the Gaza Strip under the US-led International Stabilisation Force.
Israel has categorically rejec­ted that possibility, highlighting Turkiye’s ties with Hamas.
Turkiye has long had a foothold in Horn of Africa, and views Somalia as a quasi “satellite country”, said Lubotzky.
So Israel’s alliance with neighbouring Somaliland is poised to open a new front of attrition.
Turkish President Recep Tayy­­ip Erdogan hit back at the diplomatic recognition on Tues­day, saying Ankara deemed it “illegitimate and unacceptable”.

This is the third time the police have used force to break up the sit-in outside the prison. Imran’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan, and Noreen Niazi, besides scores of supporters, have been staging weekly protests outside the jail to demand a meeting with Mr Khan.

TTAP says struggle to continue despite govt ‘heavy-handedness’

Videos shared by the PTI Punjab account on the social media platform X after 1am showed water cannons targeting protesters. “In the severe cold, an attack with water cannons was carried out on unarmed, peaceful children, women, and citizens,” the X post said.







In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan condemned the use of water cannons and the arrest of Imran’s sisters and other PTI workers. The police, in a late-night operation, used water cannon to disperse the protesters and also arrested the sisters. However, they were later released near Chakri on the motorway.
In its statement, the opposition alliance alleged that the water used to scatter the PTI supporters was laced with a chemical and hundreds of supporters were “badly affected”. The TTAP spokesperson said that such tactics would not deter them from their stance that the violation of basic human rights should be stopped. They will continue the struggle, the statement added.
On the other hand, the PTI shared another list of six persons with the Adiala Jail administration, requesting it to allow them to meet Imran Khan on Thursday. The letter, written to the Adiala jail superintendent and signed by Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, mentioned Dr Amjad, Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Jamal Khan, Iqbal Khattak, and Shoaib Ameer Awan.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 has mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the court order was not being complied with.

Terrorist attacks went down by almost 17 per cent in December, preceded by 9pc decline in November. Terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials also fell in the last quarter of 2025, by nearly 4pc and 19pc each in November and December, shows data collected by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of its annual security report 2025.

 

With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, the year 2025 went by as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, says the report. The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with almost 38pc in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024, and 34pc in 2025.
The comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveals a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2555 in 2024 to 3417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34pc year-on-year surge in violence.

CRSS report says most significant surge in violence recorded in KP

The most significant surge in violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the fatalities rose from 1620 in 2024 to 2331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.
Balochistan also had an upward trend, with fatalities increasing from 787 to 956; an additional 169 deaths, which are nearly 22pc higher than the previous year’s figures.
Regional impact of violence
Violence remained heavily concentrated in the country’s northwestern KP and southwestern Balochistan provinces, with both accounting for over 96pc of all fatalities and almost 93pc of violent incidents recorded during the entire 2025.
KP was the worst-hit region, suffering over 68pc (2331) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and around 63pc (795) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, accounting for 28pc (956) of the fatalities and over 30pc (386) of the incidents of violence.

 

In contrast, Punjab and Sindh experienced comparatively lower levels of violence. The former recorded 25 incidents of violence resulting in 40 fatalities and 24 injuries, representing just 1.15pc of total casualties, while the latter saw 51 incidents causing 56 fatalities and 40 injuries; 1.73pc of the total.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory though incidents numbers remained minimal, the injury figures were relatively high, with the former recording 103 injuries, and the latter registering 38, from just five incidents at each location.
Gilgit-Baltistan remained the least affected region. Compared to last year, though small in absolute numbers, the region recorded a four-fold increase from one to four fatalities.

In a post on the social media platform X on Thursday morning, the premier echoed the statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) a day earlier.
Calling it a “warm and most cordial telephone conversation”, PM Shehbaz said the two “reaffirmed our shared commitment to further strengthening the long-standing fraternal bonds between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which have attained new heights in recent months”.
“While expressing Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the kingdom, we also exchanged views on the regional situation, emphasising the need for unity within the Ummah and maintaining regional peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy,” he said.







PM Shehbaz said he was “grateful” to the Saudi crown prince, who reaffirmed the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest and also “shared his intention to undertake an official visit to Pakistan in the coming year”.
“Together, we envision an exciting and promising future for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
A similar statement was also issued by the PMO a day earlier, when the premier had also met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmad Al-Malkiy at the Prime Minister’s House to discuss regional and global developments.
The prime minister reiterated the need to maintain peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy.
He expressed satisfaction over bilateral relations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further deepening ties, while appreciating Saudi Arabia’s support for Pakistan and its role in promoting regional peace and stability, the statement said.
The prime minister recalled his meetings with the crown prince during the year, which he said had been highly productive and contributed significantly to elevating Pak-Saudi ties to new levels.
He also expressed deep appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s consistent support to Pakistan in times of need and its constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability.
Ambassador Al-Malkiy conveyed greetings from the Saudi leadership and reiterated the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.</p><small>2026-01-01 02:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3123472567be369.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964304/basant-to-be-celebrated-only-in-lahore-no-plans-for-festival-in-rest-of-punjab-home-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Basant to be celebrated only in Lahore; no plans for festival in rest of Punjab: home dept</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: In a major policy shift, the Punjab government on Wednesday announced that it has no plans to celebrate the Basant festival across the province and that it will instead be celebrated only in Lahore.
Basant is returning to Lahore after 18 years, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025 by the provincial assembly on December 24.
So far, only the Lahore deputy commissioner has notified the three-day festival starting on February 6, 2026, while deputy commissioners in other districts were expected to follow suit.
However, the 46th Cabinet Committee on Law and Order — chaired by Khawaja Salman Rafique — met at the Punjab Home Department today and noted that Basant would be celebrated only in Lahore and on a limited scale.
Though there was no need for all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to be present at the meeting, sources in the Home Department told Dawn that they were specially invited to attend via video link, particularly for the “Basant agenda”.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told the cabinet committee meeting, “The provincial cabinet had allowed limited Basant on February 6, 7 and 8 in Lahore only,” adding that kite-flying would remain completely banned elsewhere in the province under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
A divisional commissioner, on the condition of anonymity, told Dawn that an official informed the meeting that Basant would not be allowed across the district.
The Home Department had held several meetings on the revival of Basant and discussed permitting the festival at specific locations or at specially notified rooftops, both in the Walled City and elsewhere in the district.
The department had also instructed all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to begin registering twine and kite manufacturers ahead of Basant.
Meanwhile, the divisional commissioner said the government was piloting Basant in Lahore, calling it an opportunity for citizens to demonstrate responsibility and adherence to instructions, a move that could lead to the festival’s revival on a larger scale.
“People should watch their neighbourhoods and ensure that no illegality is committed and that no one is injured … in the best interest of the Basant festival,” he said.
Expressing apprehension, the commissioner noted that any serious accident during the festival could lead to Basant being banned for good.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed buses and rickshaws on city roads to offer free rides and minimise the use of motorcycles in Lahore. The government may employ buses from city colleges and universities during the three-day festival.
Eventually, the Home Department wrote to all commissioners, deputy commissioners, and senior police officers in the province regarding incidents of kite flying and injuries caused by stray kite twines on Wednesday, seeking action against those involved in the activity in violation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025.
The home department has expressed concern in the letter about illegal kite flying observed in certain parts of the province. It stated that incidents were being reported in which passersby had been injured.
In the letter, the department said, “such practices pose a serious threat to human life and public safety,” adding that action could be taken against violators, including the arrest of kite fliers and the manufacturers and suppliers of kite flying material, in accordance with the law.
The meeting also instructed authorities to adopt foolproof security arrangements for New Year’s Eve, besides taking strict action against those involved in aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling.
Additionally, the meeting approved the extension of the deployment of Rangers in Mianwali, Attock, and Dera Ghazi Khan.
Kite flying has been the cause of multiple injuries and fatalities across the province, usually caused by kite strings coated with chemicals or glass, or made from metal.
Last Saturday, a six-year-old girl was injured by a kite string near Adda Maan on Ganda Singh Road, within the jurisdiction of the Saddar Police Station.
The victim was riding on the front of a motorcycle with her brother when a chemical-coated twine slashed her throat. She was immediately rushed to the DHQ Hospital for medical treatment.</p><small>2026-01-01 02:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01074904b18ecf5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964303/petrol-price-slashed-by-rs1028-diesel-by-rs857-for-next-fortnight' target='_blank'><strong>Petrol price slashed by Rs10.28, diesel by Rs8.57 for next fortnight</strong></a><br><p>The government on Wednesday slashed the rates for petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs10.28 and Rs8.57, respectively, for the coming fortnight.
In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot petrol price was reduced to Rs253.17 per litre from its previous price of Rs263.45. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Meanwhile, the ex-depot price of HSD was decreased to Rs257.08 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs265.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2026-01-01 02:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/312251259fd8e04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964301/ptcl-completes-acquisition-of-100pc-issued-share-capital-of-telenor-pakistan-and-orion-towers' target='_blank'><strong>PTCL completes acquisition of 100pc issued share capital of Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) on Wednesday completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the issued share capital of Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers, said a press release.
The Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA) approved the merger of Telenor Pak­i­stan with PTCL earlier in December.
The regulator, however, imposed strict conditions to prevent abuse of market power and to bind the new entity to invest in upcoming spectrum auctions.
“Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers will operate as 100% owned subsidiaries of PTCL, alongside Pak Telecom Mobile Limited (PTML) commonly known as Ufone 4G, and U Microfinance Bank.”
However, Telenor Pakistan will continue to operate as a separate entity during the transition period, said the statement, adding that PTML and Telenor will then be merged as a single entity in “due course of time”, subject to regulatory approvals.
Acknowledging the contribution of Telenor to Pakistan’s telecom landscape, PTCL said the telco “played a defining role in elevating service quality and expanding connectivity over nearly two decades”.
“This milestone brings together complementary strengths to create a platform with a stronger focus on customer centricity, broader reach, and accelerated innovation,” added the press release.
“This is a proud moment for PTCL and a significant milestone for Pakistan’s telecom sector. Our focus remains on delivering a customer-centric, seamless, and high-quality services for improvement in user experience as we bring combined strengths at scale upon completion of regulatory approvals,“ said the press release, quoting President & Chief Executive Officer PTCL and Ufone Hatem Bamatraf.
“Together, we will build a stronger, future-ready organisation that serves customers better, empowers its people, and advances Pakistan’s digital future,” he added.
In October, the policy board of PTCL accepted the terms and conditions set by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) for the merger with Telenor Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-31 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31204455c2126a2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964298/in-pictures-the-most-stunning-fireworks-from-new-years-eve' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: The most stunning fireworks from New Year’s Eve</strong></a><br><p>Fireworks lit up the midnight sky over Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Sydney Opera House, and the Juyongguan Great Wall in Beijing, China, as different cities of the world started ringing in the New Year, marking the start of 2026 with a spectacular display watched by thousands on site and millions around the world.
Here are a few glimpses of the fireworks shows.

Midnight arrived first on the islands closest to the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean, including Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Tonga and New Zealand.
In Australia, Sydney began 2026 with a spectacular fireworks display, as per tradition. Some 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretched 7 kilometres across buildings and barges along its harbour and featured a waterfall effect from the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
This year, it was held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

Organisers held a minute’s silence for the victims of the attack at 11pm local time (5pm PKT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah — a symbol of Judaism — projected onto its pylons.
“After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026,” Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event.
In Croatia, revels got off to an early start. Since 2000, the town of Fuzine has held its countdown at noon, a tradition that has since spread across the country. Crowds cheered, toasted each other with champagne and danced to music - all in the middle of the day. Some brave souls in Santa hats took a plunge into the icy waters of Lake Bajer.

Elsewhere, preparations got underway for the more traditional midnight toast. In subzero temperatures in New York, organisers began putting up security barriers and stages ahead of the crowds that will flock to Times Square for the annual ball drop.
In Seoul, thousands gathered at the Bosingak bell pavilion, where a bronze bell is struck 33 times at midnight — a tradition rooted in Buddhist cosmology, symbolising the 33 heavens. The chimes are believed to dispel misfortune and welcome peace and prosperity for the year ahead.

Friendships that once relied on time, patience and shared presence now compete with algorithms, busy schedules and the quiet expectation of instant understanding.
As young people move through early adulthood, many find themselves drifting away from friends not through conflict, but through neglect, exhaustion or emotional distance. Today, the slow fading of friendships has become common, often leaving behind feelings of loneliness, guilt and unanswered questions that rarely find space in public conversations about mental health.
Counselling psychologist at Happy Minds, Arpita Subba, offers insights into how ending or drifting away from friendships in early adulthood can affect young people’s emotional well-being.
Why does the loss or distancing of friendships in early adulthood feel painful for young people?
Early adulthood is a period of exploration and self-discovery, during which individuals begin to step beyond the boundaries of family and parental control. During this time—whether in school, college, or new social environments—young people often form friendships with peers who are experiencing similar struggles and transitions. These friendships become a key source of emotional safety, validation and understanding.

When such bonds suddenly fade or end, it can feel unsettling. Young people may begin to question their self-worth, wondering whether they did something wrong or whether they were ‘not enough’. The loss also brings the fear of having no one left to confide in, which can lead to feelings of panic, lowered self-esteem and emotional insecurity. Young people often begin to question themselves emotionally.
Without someone to share experiences with, seek advice from, or celebrate achievements alongside, they can feel lonely and emotionally insecure.
Even decisions that once felt straightforward may now be second-guessed, as the reassurance and support previously offered by close friends are no longer present.
Many people experience guilt, confusion, or self-doubt after a friendship ends. How can such emotions affect one’s mental health if left unaddressed?
Past experiences with friendships can strongly influence how young adults respond to new relationships. When a friendship ends, individuals may begin to doubt themselves and question the effort they have invested in their relationships.

This can lead to hesitation in forming new bonds, as they may fear repeating past disappointments. Such experiences can also contribute to trust issues, making it difficult to share openly or feel safe with others.
If these emotions remain unaddressed, they can create a persistent cycle of self-doubt, confusion and guilt, leading to prolonged stress and negatively affecting overall mental health.
Are there common signs that a friendship breakup is taking a toll on someone’s emotional or psychological well-being?
Friendship breakups can have a profound impact on young people, yet they are often overlooked compared to family loss. Emotional and psychological signs may include self-doubt, confusion, negative self-talk, and the belief that one was ‘not enough’ to maintain the friendship.
Individuals may struggle with decision-making, overthink situations, feel lonely, or experience insecurity about forming or sustaining other relationships.
Social withdrawal is also common—they may avoid existing friends, isolate themselves, or hesitate to build new connections. Communication patterns may change, with a greater need for reassurance and difficulty trusting oneself.
Prolonged self-stress can manifest physically as sleep disturbances, low energy, changes in appetite, headaches, body aches, or a weakened immune system.
Over time, these effects can impact self-confidence, social identity, and the ability to set healthy boundaries, sometimes leading to over-pleasing behaviours in relationships.
What healthy ways can young adults process the grief or loneliness that may follow the end of a close friendship?
It is natural to want to rush through the pain of a friendship ending, but processing it requires patience and self-compassion. Young adults can benefit from accepting the situation, reflecting on what they have learned, and speaking kindly to themselves. Engaging in creative activities, journaling, or revisiting hobbies can also provide constructive ways to cope.

It is important not to overpressure oneself to ‘move on’ too quickly. Instead, individuals should allow themselves time to experience their emotions and use the process as an opportunity for self-discovery.
If the feelings become overwhelming, seeking support from a trusted person or speaking with a professional can help—expressing emotions rather than suppressing them is key to healthy recovery.
How can individuals rebuild a sense of connection and self-worth after losing a meaningful friendship?
Friendships often form a key part of our sense of identity, so when a close bond ends, it can feel as though a part of ourselves has gone too. Rebuilding self-worth involves reconnecting with oneself and with existing relationships.
Young adults can focus on activities they enjoy, such as hobbies, journaling, or volunteering, and reflect on their values and interests beyond the loss of the friendship.
It is helpful to ask questions like, “Who am I beyond this friendship?” and to allow oneself to rediscover meaning and purpose without rushing to recreate the exact type of connection lost.
Re-engaging with existing friendships, maintaining open but healthy boundaries, and learning from past experiences can foster a renewed sense of belonging.

The change in command comes after incumbent IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon relinquished charge today after attaining the age of superannuation.







According to a notification issued by Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah, “Mr. Allah Bux alias Javed Akhtar Odho, an officer of Police Service of Pakistan (BS-21), Additional Inspector General of Police, Karachi Range, is assigned the additional charge of the post of Inspector General of Police, Sindh, in addition to his own duties, until further orders.”

Karachi police chief Odho, who took charge as additional inspector general of Karachi last year, has assumed the additional charge of IGP Sindh on the same day that his predecessor relinquished his position, said a police spokesperson.
Meanwhile, in his farewell message, the outgoing IGP said that he had prioritised ‘technology-driven policing’ and ‘systemic investigation reforms’ as key components of the policing strategy.
Memon, a BS-21 officer, took charge as IGP Sindh in March, 2024. He was serving as State Life Insurance Corporation executive director before his posting.
He also served in the Intelligence Bureau (IB) as a director in Karachi from 2006 to 2008, and later as joint director of IB Sindh twice between 2011 and 2016.
The government awarded him the Sitara-i-Shujahat and Tamgha-i-Imtiaz for his professional achievements.</p><small>2025-12-31 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311945346d3679d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964294/pakistan-expresses-complete-solidarity-with-saudi-arabia-reiterates-support-for-territorial-integrity-of-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses ‘complete solidarity’ with Saudi Arabia, reiterates support for ‘territorial integrity’ of Yemen</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday expressed “complete solidarity” with Saudi Arabia amid a resurgence of violence in Yemen, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
“Pakistan expresses complete solidarity with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reaffirms its commitment to the security of the Kingdom,” said a statement by the FO.
Islamabad also reiterated its support for the “unity and territorial integrity” of Yemen, along with all efforts to establish “lasting peace and stability” in the country.







“In this regard, Pakistan strongly opposes unilateral steps by any Yemeni party that may further escalate the situation, undermine peace efforts, and threaten the peace and stability of Yemen as well as that of the region,” the statement read, adding that Islamabad welcomes regional efforts for de-escalating the situation.
“Pakistan maintains its firm support for the resolution of [the] Yemen issue through dialogue and diplomacy and hopes that Yemen’s people and regional powers work together towards [an] inclusive and enduring settlement of the issue, safeguarding regional stability.”</p><small>2025-12-31 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3118415181362e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964292/cdf-munir-warns-of-firm-and-decisive-response-if-pakistans-territorial-integrity-is-violated' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir warns of ‘firm and decisive’ response if Pakistan’s territorial integrity is violated</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday warned that any violation of the country’s integrity will be met with a “firm and decisive” response.
The CDF made these remarks during the 18th National Workshop on Balochistan at General Headquarters (GHQ), where he highlighted the continued efforts of Indian sponsored proxies to “propagate violence and disrupt development”, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement added that the field marshal reaffirmed that these groups’ plans would be thwarted through “stern actions” by the security forces to rid the province of terrorism and unrest.
“Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, the COAS & CDF also emphasised that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity, whether direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response,” the statement read. “[The] Pakistan Armed Forces remain committed to protect the lives and well-being of its citizens.”
The ISPR said that today’s workshop focused on exploring Balochistan’s socio-economic development and its strategic importance for Pakistan.
In an address, Field Marshal Munir appreciated the resilience of the people of Balochistan and highlighted their pivotal importance for Pakistan’s prosperity and development.
“He lauded the wide-ranging initiatives being undertaken by the federal and provincial governments, underscoring a people-centric approach that aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of the province and unlock its vast economic potential for the benefit of its people,” the statement added.
According to the ISPR, the CDF also hailed the role of civil society in his address, highlighting their role in countering disinformation and propaganda, as well as their driving sustainable development.
“He stressed the importance of rejecting vested political agendas to ensure that Balochistan’s future is shaped by long-term prosperity for all its residents,” the statement read.
In May and October this year, Pakistan saw violations of its sovereignty by neighbours India and Afghanistan, respectively.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, in October, Pakistan – Afghanistan relations deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), with Islamabad pressing Kabul to curb cross-border terrorism.
After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire followed talks in Doha and later in Istanbul, but successive rounds of negotiations failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar.
Pakistan has also witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.</p><small>2025-12-31 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311849495a411df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291/na-speaker-sadiq-indian-fm-jaishankar-shake-hands-in-dhaka-in-first-high-level-contact-since-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>NA Speaker Sadiq, Indian FM Jaishankar shake hands in Dhaka in first high-level contact since May conflict</strong></a><br><p>Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May of this year.
Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe.
A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake.
“Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read.
“During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [sic].”







The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“.
Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan.
Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.
Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations.
However, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.
Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.</p><small>2025-12-31 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31155524a125853.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271/bangladesh-mourns-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-with-state-funeral' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh mourns ex-PM Khaleda Zia with state funeral</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh bade farewell on Wednesday to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in a state funeral drawing vast crowds, mourning a towering leader whose career defined politics for decades.
Khaleda, the first woman to serve as prime minister in the South Asian nation of 170 million people, died on Tuesday aged 80.
Flags were flown at half-mast, and thousands of security officers lined the streets as her body was carried through the streets of the capital Dhaka in a vehicle in the colours of the national flag.
Large crowds had gathered outside parliament — many waving national flags or those of Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — where the funeral prayers were held at around 3pm local time, according to Dhaka-based Daily Star.







Khaleda was laid to rest alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 during his time as president. The burial took place at around 4:30pm local time, Daily Star reported.
Seventy-year-old retired government official Minhaz Uddin, who was attending Khaleda’s funeral, said he had never voted for her, but came to honour the three-time prime minister.
“I came here with my grandson, just to say goodbye to a veteran politician whose contributions will always be remembered,” he said, watching from behind a barbed wire barricade as her body passed by.
“Khaleda Zia has been an inspiration,” mourner Sharmina Siraj told AFP, adding that “it is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon”.
The 40-year-old mother of two said stipends introduced by Khaleda to support girls’ education “had a huge impact on the lives of our girls”.
NA speaker meets family, expresses condolences
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who is in Bangladesh for the funeral, visited the residence of the former Bangladeshi prime minister, where he met her son and daughter.
According to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat, Sadiq expressed his condolences at the passing of their mother.
“In this hour of grief and sorrow, the government and the people of Pakistan stand with you,” he was quoted as saying. The family of the late premier thanked Sadiq for his condolences.







The NA speaker also met the country’s national security adviser, Khalilur Rehman, the statement said.
It said that Sadiq “conveyed a message of sympathy and condolences on behalf of the residents and prime minister of Pakistan”.
The speaker also met the adviser for law, justice and parliamentary affairs of Bangladesh, Asif Nazrul, where the two discussed matters of mutual interest.
Later, a post on the NA‘s X account said Sadiq also had an interaction with Indian Foreign Minister Dr S, Jaishankar at Bangladesh’s parliament.
‘Legacy lives on’
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Khaleda had vowed to campaign in elections set for 12 February — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.
Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is widely seen as a frontrunner, and her son Tarique Rahman, 60, who returned only last week after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if they win a majority.
“She is no more, but her legacy lives on — and so does the BNP,” said Jenny Parvez, 37, who travelled for several hours with her family to watch the funeral cortege pass her on the street.
The interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, declared three days of national mourning and an elaborate state funeral.
Yunus said Bangladesh had “lost a great guardian”.
‘Unbreakable’
Tarique Rahman said in a statement that “the country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations”.
His mother, he added, “endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution”, but that “her resilience … was unbreakable.”
Suffering from a raft of health issues, Khaleda was rushed to hospital in late November, where her condition had gradually deteriorated despite treatment.
Nevertheless, hours before her death, party workers had on Monday submitted nomination papers on her behalf for three constituencies for next year’s polls.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Khaleda’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.</p><small>2025-12-31 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31123205e8ea303.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964276/double-decker-buses-introduced-in-karachi-to-be-available-to-the-public-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Double-decker buses introduced in Karachi, to be available to the public from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Double-decker buses were introduced in Karachi on Wednesday, with Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon saying that they would be available to the public from January 1 (Thursday).
“Today marks the beginning of double-decker bus [services] in the city. They will be available to the public from tomorrow, and today, they will be tested [on the city’s road],” Memon, who also has the transport portfolio, said while speaking to the media at the inauguration of the bus service in Karachi.
Memon inaugurated the bus service along with Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah.

The development comes more than a year after the Sindh government announced the initiative in October 2024 for the city of over 23 million that has faced mobility issues for long.
Memon recalled that the Sindh government had promised to introduce double-decker buses in Karachi by December 2025, pointing out that today was December 31.
He further said the Sindh government aimed to provide transport facilities across the province in 2026, adding that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had also instructed to introduce “double-decker buses on every road in Karachi” in the coming year.
Yesterday, while announcing the launch of double-decker buses in the city, Memon said the buses would operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal. He had added that more double-decker buses would be brought to Karachi as these would help solve traffic problems.
His spokesperson, Hussain Mansoor, separately told Dawn that the buses would run between Zainab Market in Saddar and Model Colony. He further said that stops were designated for double-decker buses along this route at/near Malir Halt, airport, Colony Gate, Natha Khan Bridge, Drigh Road, Nursery, Baloch Colony and Finance and Trade Centre.
The spokesperson added that a one-way ticket for commute via the double-decker bus would cost between Rs80 and Rs120.
Meanwhile, a handout issued by Memon’s office said the double-decker bus service was “being introduced again for Karachiites after 65 years”.
Speaking to the media on Wednesday, he said new routes for electronic buses would also be designated in Sindh, including Karachi, from next week, the minister said.
Acknowledging that public transport was a necessity, he expressed the Sindh government’s intention to facilitate the public in this regard. Without specifically mentioning any of the bus services launched by the government, he said these transport facilities were being provided at a subsidised rate.







“The Sindh government pays that subsidy to facilitate passengers,” the minister said, further claiming that over 125,000 commuters were using transport services being provided under the People’s Bus Service project in Karachi daily.
In response to a question about criticism of the poor condition of roads, Memon said the Sindh cabinet had allocated more than Rs9 billion out of the budget just for roads in industrial areas to address complaints. He said work on several other projects was also under way, particularly mentioning the Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway in Karachi.







When asked whether double-decker buses’ routes would also cover tourist spots in Sindh to present a “positive image” of the province, the minister replied, “Yes, definitely. We aim to cover not just tourist spots but every road.”
‘A gift from CM’
A handout from the Sindh CM’s office termed double-decker buses “a gift” from the provincial chief executive.
The statement quoted CM Murad as saying that Karachiites had the right to better transport facilities and that the new bus service would make commuting easier for them.







“The city is now not just running, it’s progressing. Today, a bus has started running, and tomorrow, the city will transform.
“Better transport facilities for Karachi is not a mere promise, it is now becoming a reality,” the CM was quoted as saying.
He further said that better facilities strengthen cities, expressing the ambition to make Karachi join the ranks of modern cities.</p><small>2025-12-31 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3115305883f29bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964126/snowy-peaks-and-silk-road-secrets-a-winter-journey-through-uzbekistan' target='_blank'><strong>Snowy peaks and Silk Road secrets: a winter journey through Uzbekistan</strong></a><br><p>For many travel enthusiasts, the year-end holiday is synonymous with seeking a climate that actually requires a jacket. Uzbekistan has emerged as a compelling alternative for those wanting a mix of alpine adventure and deep Islamic history.
The gateway to Central Asia is more accessible than ever, offering a winter experience that is both culturally familiar and geographically spectacular.
Amirsoy: A new winter standard
The highlight for any winter traveller is the Amirsoy Mountain Resort, the largest ski destination in Uzbekistan.
Nestled on the spurs of the Chatkal Ridge within the western Tian Shan Mountains (a Unesco World Heritage site), it is located just an hour’s drive from Tashkent. It is easy to see why the resort is a draw as the majestic, sprawling peaks create a stunning backdrop, offering a sharp, beautiful contrast between the crisp, sunny air and the endless blankets of white snow.

Amirsoy features high-speed gondolas that take visitors up to 2,290m to ski down the slopes. Even if you aren’t a skier, the “top of the world” views from the peak are worth the trip.
For families, the resort provides designated areas for tubing and sledging, activities that require zero experience but offer plenty of fun in the snow, alongside five-star chalets for housing the whole family. Everything from winter jackets to boots can be rented on-site, making it easy for those coming from the tropics to jump straight into the action.

Tashkent: The urban hub
Tashkent itself is a city of wide boulevards and surprising greenery, even in the colder months. It serves as a base where you can experience the intersection of ancient history and modern life.

The Tashkent Metro is a must-visit; the stations are designed with marble, chandeliers and intricate mosaics, making a simple commute feel like a walk through an underground museum.

In the old part of the city, the Hazrati Imam Complex brings together mausoleums, mosques and libraries, crowned with blue domes. The Uthman Quran, the world’s oldest Quran, once housed here, is now preserved at the Centre for Islamic Civilisation, a modern cultural landmark dedicated to Uzbekistan’s Islamic heritage and its role in world civilisation. Nearby, the Chorsu Bazaar offers a sensory overload of smells and people.

Under its massive blue dome, you can find everything from local spices and dried fruits to the famous Tashkent bread (non), which is stamped with unique patterns and baked fresh in clay ovens. However, come prepared with local cash (Uzbek Som/UZS), as some vendors will only accept local currency.

The golden road: Samarkand and Bukhara
No trip to Uzbekistan is complete without boarding the Afrosiyob high-speed train. In just about two hours, you can reach Samarkand, a city that feels pulled from a history book.


The Registan is the stunning, historic heart of Samarkand, a public square famed for its breathtaking ensemble of three majestic madrasas (Islamic schools) – Ulugh Beg, Sher-Dor and Tilla-Kori – showcasing intricate tilework and grand portals, making it a Unesco World Heritage site and an iconic symbol of Central Asian Islamic architecture. — Via The Star

For Muslims, the true heart of Samarkand lies at the Imam Al-Bukhari Memorial Complex. As the final resting place of the scholar who compiled the most authentic hadith used in religious life, this site is a deeply spiritual pilgrimage destination.
For the best photos, arrive early at opening (7am) or near closing (7pm) to capture the shimmering turquoise domes in soft golden light without the heavy midday tour groups.
Finally, walk through Registan Square, where the three towering madrasas are especially atmospheric and quiet during the winter off-season.
Further west lies Bukhara, the spiritual heart of Uzbekistan and Central Asia. Renowned for its deep Islamic heritage, this “open-air museum” remains a sacred beacon of the Muslim world. Walking through the narrow alleys of the Ark Fortress or standing at the foot of the Kalyan Minaret, a structure so impressive that even invaders in the 12th century refused to destroy it, gives you a profound sense of the scale of the ancient Silk Road.

Bukhara is also the country’s premier destination for artisanal souvenirs. Its historic 16th-century trading domes are still filled with masters practising ancient crafts, from intricate gold embroidery and hand-stitched suzani textiles to the city’s famous bird-shaped hand-forged scissors and high-quality ikat silks. Bukhara offers both a treasure trove of heritage gifts and a deep connection to an Islamic history that has remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.
Halal Comfort and Hospitality
As a majority-Muslim country, travellers are spoilt for choice when it comes to finding halal food. You will find yourself gravitating toward Plov, the national rice dish cooked in massive cauldrons with tender lamb and yellow carrots. Other staples like Samsa (flaky meat pastries), Mastava (soup with spiced meat and rice) and Shurpa (a hearty lamb soup) provide the perfect warmth after a day of sightseeing.

Expect to be welcomed with endless tea (choy) and warm bread, especially if you choose to stay in traditional boutique hotels that are restored madrasas or 19th-century mansions. From five-star city centre hotels to immersive boutiques, guests are greeted with a “welcome tea”, served in an ornate piala (ceramic bowl), reflecting a culture that treats every traveller as a deeply honoured guest and friend.
If you are looking for a winter break that offers more than just a cold breeze, the snow-capped mountains and turquoise domes of Uzbekistan are waiting to be explored.

According to the FO, Dar will be visiting Beijing at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
It said that the dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism between Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.







It added that during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers will also announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
“The visit forms an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflects their shared determination to broaden and deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development,” the FO statement said.
While the FO did not give the exact dates for Dar’s visit, the Chinese foreign ministry said he would be visiting from January 3 to 6, 2026.
The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in August, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.</p><small>2025-12-31 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31140633b4c56a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964282/in-tit-for-tat-move-mali-and-burkina-say-they-are-restricting-entry-for-us-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>In tit-for-tat move, Mali and Burkina say they are restricting entry for US nationals</strong></a><br><p>Mali and Burkina Faso have announced travel restrictions on American nationals in a tit-for-tat move after the US included both African countries on a no-entry list.
In statements issued separately by both countries’ foreign ministries and seen on Wednesday by AFP, they said they were imposing “equivalent measures” on US citizens, after US President Donald Trump expanded a travel ban to nearly 40 countries this month, based solely on nationality.







That list included Syrian citizens, as well as Palestinian Authority passport holders, and nationals of some of Africa’s poorest countries, including also Niger, Sierra Leone and South Sudan.
The White House said it was banning foreigners who “intend to threaten” Americans.
Burkina Faso’s foreign ministry said in the statement that it was applying “equivalent visa measures” on Americans, while Mali said it was, “with immediate effect”, applying “the same conditions and requirements on American nationals that the American authorities have imposed on Malian citizens entering the United States”.
It voiced its “regret” that the United States had made “such an important decision without the slightest prior consultation”.
The two sub-Saharan countries, both run by military juntas, are members of a confederation that also includes Niger.
Niger has not officially announced any counter-measures to the US travel ban, but the country’s news agency, citing a diplomatic source, said last week that such measures had been decided.
In his December 17 announcement, Trump also imposed partial travel restrictions on citizens of other African countries including the most populous, Nigeria, as well as Ivory Coast and Senegal, which qualified for the football World Cup to be played next year in the United States as well as Canada and Mexico.</p><small>2025-12-31 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3113540664070b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964281/rules-amended-to-legally-recognise-facial-iris-scans-as-biometric-identities' target='_blank'><strong>Rules amended to legally recognise facial, iris scans as biometric identities</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has amended the National Identity Card (NIC) Rules, widening the definition of biometrics to legally recognise facial and iris scans as valid biometric identifiers, besides fingerprints, the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) said on Wednesday.
The amendment, made on the authority’s recommendation, provides a robust legal foundation for the implementation of a multi-biometric verification system in Pakistan.
Based on this legal framework, Nadra has introduced technical innovations enabling contactless fingerprint and facial recognition-based biometric verification.
In a statement, Nadra said this system is currently available both at the authority‘s registration centres and on the Pak ID mobile application for services falling within the authority’s jurisdiction. It is already being utilised for biometric verification in transferring Islamabad-registered vehicles and online passport applications.
In the near future, proof-of-life certificates for federal government pensioners will also be issued under this system, while the scope of these digital services is being expanded in phases.
Effective from Jan 20, 2026, Nadra will start issuing facial recognition-based biometric verification certificates at all its registration centres for those citizens for whom fingerprint-based verification is not possible. Wherever any institution requires such verification, citizens may obtain this certificate from any Nadra registration centre after paying a nominal fee of Rs20.
Under this procedure, if fingerprint-based biometric verification fails at the service provider’s end, the citizen will visit the nearest Nadra registration centre to have a fresh photograph taken.
This photograph will be matched with the image already available in Nadra’s records. Upon successful verification, Nadra will issue a certificate containing the purpose of verification, the citizen’s recent photograph alongside the photograph on record, their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number, name, father’s name, a unique tracking ID and a QR code.
The certificate will be valid for seven days. The citizen will submit it to the relevant institution where biometric verification is required and the concerned institution will incorporate the certificate into its records and verify it online through Nadra.
In the future, facial image-based biometric verification certificates will also be available through Nadra’s e-Sahulat franchises. Following the formal launch of the Digital ID, this facility will be made available for all services through the Pak-ID application.
In a statement, Nadra said it was fully prepared to implement this system. However, for its effective execution, it requested all regulators, relevant public institutions and private sector organisations to progressively upgrade their hardware and software in accordance with approved standards to enable the use of this biometric verification service.
In the first phase, technical upgrades to institutional software applications will be required to allow the integration of facial recognition-based biometric verification certificates issued by Nadra. In the second phase, it will be necessary for institutions to install cameras at service counters or integrate cameras into existing know your customer (KYC) biometric machines, as without these upgrades, the authority cannot provide this facility directly at such locations.
If citizens encounter any issues regarding the availability of this service after Jan 20, 2026, they may lodge complaints with the relevant institution or department, as the service will be available from Nadra’s end.
To ensure the earliest possible operationalisation of this facility, Nadra has also requested the interior ministry to issue appropriate instructions to all institutions concerned. It is envisaged that, following the rollout of this system, the difficulties faced by citizens due to faded fingerprints will be effectively resolved.
Upon full implementation, citizens will be able to avail this facility directly at the relevant institution without the need to visit a Nadra Registration Centre. Following the formal launch of the Digital ID, citizens will also be able to access this facility independently through the Pak-ID application.

 

On the occasion of the new year, Nadra reaffirmed its commitment to further enhance its services through technological innovation while strengthening safeguards against identity fraud and misuse.
Due to age or certain medical conditions, the fingerprints of many citizens gradually fade over time. When such citizens approach banks, SIM card franchises, housing societies or seek services related to property transfer and other transactions where biometric verification through fingerprints is mandatory, they often face significant difficulties.
Moreover, at many service points, biometric verification is also not possible due to the use of substandard or low-quality fingerprint readers. Although the State Bank of Pakistan and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority have prescribed mechanisms to facilitate such citizens, in practice individuals continue to face considerable challenges in availing these services.
To ensure an immediate and effective resolution of this issue, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had issued directives to Nadra and key measures have been taken in compliance.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311141422b558fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964274/lawyers-booked-for-assaulting-sho-after-case-registered-against-roughing-up-of-youtuber-rajab-butt-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers booked for ‘assaulting SHO’ after case registered against roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A first information report (FIR) has been registered against several lawyers for allegedly assaulting a station house officer (SHO) after a case was registered against them and others for roughing up YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi, it emerged on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, it emerged that a case was registered against more than a dozen lawyers after Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday. The FIR nominated Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah Chandio and “another 15-20 lawyers”.
Subsequently, lawyers stormed the City Courts police station demanding a case against the YouTuber and others. They also staged a protest on M.A. Jinnah Road outside the City Courts against the SHO of the City Courts police station for allegedly failing to register their FIR.
The fresh FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn and which emerged on Wednesday, was registered on the complaint of City Court SHO Jahangir Bhutto.
The FIR was registered under sections 337-A (punishment of shajjah), Section 504 (intentional insult), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 147 (punishment for rioting), and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of their duty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant said that on December 30 (Tuesday), he received a call while out patrolling that “around 40-50 lawyers“ led by Abdul Fatah Chandio, Advocate Abdul Wahab Rajper, and Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi had forced their way into the Risala police station, which had been temporarily set up at the City Courts police station.
He alleged that they were creating a ruckus and demanding that a FIR be registered against Butt and his lawyer.
“When I reached the police station around 2pm, the lawyers demanded to know why I had allowed a FIR to be registered against them,“ Bhutto said.
“They asked me to register a FIR against Butt and his lawyer,” he added.
“I tried to make them understand that a case had already been registered [..] upon hearing this, they started verbally abusing me and then proceeded to kick and punch me,“ he recalled.
He said that the lawyers left after the police staff came to his rescue. “However, they started chanting slogans and gave me death threats as they marched out of the station,” he said.
The FIR nominated three people — Chandio, Rajper, and Solangi, along with 40-50 others, who were unnamed.
It should be mentioned that Solangi was named in the case registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer. He is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, for which the YouTuber had appeared in court on Monday.
Bhutto said that the accused had “stopped me from performing my duty, gave me death threats, assaulted me and verbally abused me“.
Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, had registered a case against Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers” under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the PPC.
Ashfaq stated in the FIR that his client had arrived at City Courts at 9am to seek bail, but when he reached the inner premises near the West building, lawyers Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating the YouTuber, causing him injuries. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” he added.
He alleged that during the attack, Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing.
Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/310826141a37715.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964266/first-winter-rain-drenches-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>First winter rain drenches parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Winter’s first spell of rain drenched parts of Karachi late on Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, bringing a dip in temperature.
Light to moderate rain was reported in Old City area, Lyari, Keamari, Mauripur, DHA, Clifton, Saddar, North Nazimabad, Malir, Mehmoodabad and Akhtar Colony.
According to data released by the Pakistan Meteorological Department at 8am on Wednesday, Keamari received the highest level (6mm) of rain.
Masroor Base received 5mm while Orangi Town, DHA and Saddar received 3mm of rainfall. Korangi and Faisal Base received 2mm, and 1mm was recorded across Old Area Airport, Jinnah Terminal, University Road, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and Surjani Town.
Rainfall was also reported in parts of Sindh. PMD data showed that Rohri recorded the highest rainfall at 32mm, followed by Sukkur at 24mm. A total of 19mm was recorded in Hyderabad (13mm in the city and 6mm in the airport area), 11mm in Tando Jam, 10mm in Mohenjo Daro, 8mm in Khairpur, 6mm in Larkana, 5mm in Jacobabad, 4mm in Mirpur Khas and 3mm in Dadu and Padidan. Trace amounts of rainfall were also recorded in Sakrand and Thatta.
Asked if more cool weather and rain were forecast for Karachi, PMD spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said on Wednesday that westerly winds had been affecting the country since Dec 29, “the effect of which we saw last night in Karachi”.
“There has been light rain in almost all areas of Karachi,” he said, but added that this situation was almost over.
He said that clouds were still present and that some light rain might be seen in some areas, which would be over by this evening.
The spokesperson also said that a drop in temperature would be felt in Karachi from Jan 4 or 5, when this weather event left Pakistan and moved eastward.
He added that when the northern winds, known as Siberian winds, began to impact the country, Karachi would experience increased cold weather.
“In the coming days, Karachi’s temperature could go into the single digits,” he said.
Separately, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana, in a post on X, urged people to “exercise caution when using electrical appliances“ in light of the rain.
“A brief spell of rain was recorded in various areas across Karachi; K-Electric’s power system has remained stable,” he said.
He further advised people to “maintain safe distance from power transmission installation.”
“Obtaining electricity through illegal means and using hooked connections can cause fatal accidents,” he said.







On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had forecast rain and thunderstorms, with snowfall over the hills, in most parts of the country during this week.
In Sindh, it predicted isolated light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Larkana, Thatta, Badin and adjoining areas on Dec 30 (Tuesday).</p><small>2025-12-31 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31111324c873d2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964273/decline-in-polio-cases-in-pakistan-during-2025-even-as-800000-children-missed-in-years-last-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>Decline in polio cases in Pakistan during 2025 even as 800,000 children missed in year’s last campaign</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Despite missing around 800,000 children during the year’s last polio campaign, Pakistan has made progress in its fight against poliovirus in 2025, according to a statement issued by the polio eradication programme.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
“During the year, six polio vaccination campaigns were conducted, including five nationwide drives. As a result, reported polio cases dropped sharply from 74 in 2024 to 30 in 2025, with no new cases reported anywhere in the country since September,” the statement said.
However a polio expert, wishing to remain anonymous, said that it was the tendency of the virus to remain recessive for some years and then bounce back.
“It is correct that Pakistan reported 74 cases in 2024 and the number of cases declined to 30 during the ongoing year,” he said. “However, only six cases were reported in 2023 while as many as 20 cases were reported in 2022.“
Additionally, he added that although the year was almost complete, there was a possibility that the number of cases may further increase, as it took almost three weeks to confirm that a child was paralysed due to polio or for some other reason.
“In the lab, we get almost 4,000 samples from paralysed children every year for testing. So by the end of January, we will be in a position to confirm the number of cases for 2025,” the expert said.
It is worth mentioning that the target for the last nationwide polio campaign was to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five. However, a total of 44.6m children were vaccinated as refusals were reported from across the country.
The statement issued by the polio programme said that although the number of polio cases continued to decline, Pakistan’s unwavering fight against the disease would persist until complete eradication was achieved. The virus, however, continues to circulate in certain high-risk areas, making sustained vigilance crucial.
Targeted interventions, robust community engagement, and ongoing vaccination efforts remained essential to reach every missed child and prevent any resurgence. Frontline health workers, security personnel, and local authorities continue to work in close coordination to maintain high immunity levels and ensure that Pakistan remains on course toward becoming polio-free, it said.
These gains were further reinforced during the most recent national polio vaccination campaign, conducted from December 15-21. The campaign achieved over 98 per cent coverage at the national level, with strong provincial-level performance across all four provinces, as well as in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), and Islamabad.
Compared to the previous round, an 18pc reduction in missed children was recorded, alongside notable improvements in access and operational performance, particularly in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Nevertheless, efforts will continue until every unreached child is protected,” the statement added. While these efforts have led to significant gains, the fight against polio will continue, it said.
“Ongoing engagement with communities, religious leaders, civil society, and the media remains crucial to strengthen trust, counter misinformation, and ensure that every child is protected from polio,” the statement said.
It added that while localised access challenges persisted, especially in parts of southern KP, these gaps had been clearly identified and were being addressed through “targeted, district-specific interventions”.
Enhanced microplanning, improved team deployment, strengthened community engagement, and close security coordination remains central to these focused efforts, it said.
“Building on the progress achieved in 2025, Pakistan’s polio eradication programme is intensifying targeted efforts in 2026 to interrupt remaining virus transmission and move decisively toward eradication.
“With transmission now limited, population immunity rising, and performance improving in historically challenging areas, the programme remains firmly on track to secure a polio-free future for every child in Pakistan,” the statement said.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic.</p><small>2025-12-31 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3110193466b7588.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964270/doctors-without-borders-expects-to-be-barred-from-gaza-after-missing-israels-deadline-for-relief-agencies' target='_blank'><strong>Doctors Without Borders expects to be barred from Gaza after missing Israel’s deadline for relief agencies</strong></a><br><p>Medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, expects to be barred from operating in Gaza once it misses Wednesday’s deadline to comply with new registration rules for relief agencies that Israel claims are meant to prevent Hamas from exploiting international aid.
The organisation, which provided care to nearly half a million people during a two-year Gaza Strip war, says deregistration would cut off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian enclave.
COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, said MSF had refused to provide Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Ministry with a list of its employees as required.
The Diaspora Affairs Ministry claims individuals affiliated with MSF have links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. MSF rejects the accusations as unsubstantiated.
When asked, MSF did not state if it had provided names.
In May, aid agency Oxfam said the requirement to share staff details raised protection concerns, following attacks on humanitarian workers in Gaza.
MSF told Reuters that the impact would be devastating if it is barred from operating, as the humanitarian crisis deepens.
“If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care,” the group said, highlighting the stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services.
Dozens of other international aid groups are at risk of deregistration, potentially forcing closures or restrictions on operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, within 60 days, if they did not comply by December 31 with new criteria set by Israeli authorities.
While some international aid groups have been registered under the system that was introduced in March, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Oxfam told Reuters they too are preparing for possible deregistration.
If that happened, the NRC said it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and will not be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza. It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
“At a time when needs in Gaza far exceed the available aid and services, Israel has and will continue to block life-saving aid from entering,” Shaina Low, spokesperson for the NRC, said.

 

Oxfam’s Policy Lead in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Bushra Khalidi told Reuters that its Palestinian staff and partners would continue supporting communities but said forcing aid agencies to rely on obtaining supplies locally — as they will not be permitted to bring in goods from outside — was part of a wider dismantling of the humanitarian aid system.
On Tuesday, the British Foreign Office published a statement alongside France, Canada and others saying Israel should allow NGOs to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and shared concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
COGAT said 4,200 aid trucks will continue to enter every week via the UN, donor countries, the private sector, and more than 20 international organisations that have been reregistered.</p><small>2025-12-31 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/310818121f5f2ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964226/afghans-returning-from-iran-pakistan-face-different-challenges-un-report' target='_blank'><strong>Afghans returning from Iran, Pakistan face different challenges: UN report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Findings of UNHCR’s “Afghanistan post-return monitoring survey report” released on Tuesday highlighted different challenges for Afghan returnees from Iran versus Pakistan: those from Iran often have more education, better food security, and housing, while returnees from Pakistan face severe economic hardship, relying more on daily wages, and carrying heavier debt burdens.
The returnees from Iran were less likely to have income-generating employment, and more often reported barriers to girls’ education. Those returning from Pakistan after April found more casual income opportunities but struggled to afford rent and maintain sufficient food.
According to the survey, across all groups, returnees continue to settle in areas with fragile conditions marked by deepening poverty and limited access to essential services. Many cannot return to their areas of origin due to lack of shelter, land, or livelihoods. Over half of households surveyed reported missing essential civil documentation, restricting access to education, healthcare, and housing.
Education remains sharply constrained for all women and girls in Afghanistan: returnees from Iran most often cited policies and laws as the key barrier, while returnees from Pakistan pointed to economic obstacles. Access to healthcare is limited by cost, distance, and medicine short ages, with women disproportionately affected due to movement restrictions, survey results show.

UNHCR says Afghans coming from Iran more educated, have better food security than those returning from Pakistan

Most returnees (88 per cent) reported living in debt, representing a slight decline from the 2024 survey. Indebted households were typically large, averaging six members. Debt was particularly widespread in Nangarhar province, where 96 per cent of returnees reported financial distress.
Returnees from Iran were slightly less likely to hold debt than those from Pakistan, while differences between female-headed (90 per cent) and male-headed (87 per cent) households were minimal. Almost all indebted households stated that their debt exceeded their monthly income, under scoring widespread, unsustainable debt cycles and the financial pressures that undermine economic reintegration.

 

In August 2025, the monitoring expanded to include returnees from Iran for the first time, alongside those from Pakistan.
This round draws on interviews with 1,658 returnee households from Pakistan and Iran. Two new data sets were introduced for returnees from Pakistan: one for those who returned before April 2025 and one for those who returned after when cash assistance was reduced due to funding shortfalls.
The survey also includes undocumented returnees, allowing analysis of possible differences between returnees with refugee documentation in countries of asylum and those without.
The UN refugee agency says these findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support to protect returnees and assist their reintegration. Interventions must be tailored to the differing profiles and needs of returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking into account their distinct vulnerabilities and circumstances behind their return. Continued post-return monitoring remains critical to track evolving challenges, adapt programming, and advance long-term stability and protection.
The changes in data sets reflect the need to understand evolving returnee experiences. In 2025, Afghanistan saw massive return movements, with an estimated 2.7 million returns between January and November. These returns reflect changes in the profiles of those coming back.
Many returns occurred under duress and adverse conditions, driven by policies in neighbouring countries and deteriorating conditions for Afghans abroad, particularly in Pakistan and Iran. These mass returns often resulted in abrupt departures and difficult journeys back to Afghanistan.
Food insecurity remains critical despite modest improvements, with returnees from Pakistan disproportionately affected. Shelter, water, and education access further highlight disparities. Returnees from Pakistan, particularly recent arrivals, are more likely to rent housing and struggle to afford rent, whereas returnees from Iran more often own or inherit their homes. Access to safe water and sanitation is also more limited for returnees from Pakistan.
These findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support that addresses both immediate and long-term needs. Assistance must combine short and medium-term cash support with livelihood opportunities, durable housing solutions, water and health infrastructure, and access to civil documentation, among other key needs and challenges faced by returnees.
Targeted interventions are essential for the most vulnerable groups, including female-headed households and people with disabilities. Continued monitoring, disaggregated by country and period of return, is critical to adapting programming based on evidence and ensuring that reintegration translates into lasting improvements in stability and protection.

These realities underscore the need to view population not as a burden but as a strategic driver of sustainable and inclusive development, UNFPA Pakistan said in a statement on Tuesday.

 

Looking ahead to 2026, UNFPA called for a shift in how population is reflected in national planning and financing, particularly in the NFC formula.
Moving beyond population size as the primary det­e­rminant, a forward-loo­k­ing appro­ach should rew­ard provinces for measurable progress in gender equ­ality, climate resilience, bal­anced population outco­mes, and improvements in the quality of health and education services.

 

Such reform would align fiscal incentives with human development res­ults, encourage innovation and accountability, and help translate population policy into tangible gains for people and communities, the statement said.
UNFPA also urged the implementation of the recommendations of the Council of Common Interests with clear accountability mechanisms, defined timelines, and sustained domestic financing, supported by strong population data and evidence-based planning.
Despite gains, challenges remain, the agency said. High maternal mortality, unmet need for family planning, early marriages, gender-based violence, and unequal access to quality reproductive health services, particularly in remote communities, continue to demand attent­ion. These challenges are also closely lin­ked to stalled fertility decline and uneven development outcomes, UNFPA said.
