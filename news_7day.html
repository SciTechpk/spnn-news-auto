<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/10091230883309b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954250/pml-n-senator-irfan-siddiqui-passes-away-in-islamabad-after-brief-illness' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui passes away in Islamabad after brief illness</strong></a><br><p>PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui passed away on Monday in Islamabad after a brief illness, his son confirmed.
His family earlier today said that he had not been placed on a ventilator but was admitted to an intensive care unit due to breathing difficulties. In a statement, the senator’s family said that Siddiqui had been receiving treatment at a local hospital in Islamabad for the past few days due to respiratory distress.
President Asif Ali Zardari extended his condolences to the senator’s family on their loss, according to a statement from the President’s House.
Paying tribute to Senator Siddiqui, President Zardari said the departed had made “immense contributions” to democracy in Pakistan.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also extended his condolences and praised Siddiqui as a “champion of high traditions in both journalism and politics”.
 






Earlier today, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry claimed that the PML-N leader had been put on a ventilator after his health had worsened.
“Senior politician and important PML-N leader Siddiqui is extremely unwell. He has been put on a ventilator due to severe illness,” said Chaudhry, who is also a PML-N leader, in a post on social media platform X. He also prayed for the health of the senator.
 






The development came shortly before a session of the upper house of Parliament was slated to begin to discuss the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment. His absence in the Senate may make things difficult for the government, which needs a two-thirds majority to pass the bill.
Siddiqui is the chairman of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the PML-N’s parliamentary leader in the Senate.
In 2019, he was arrested at his residence in Islamabad for not informing police while renting out his house under the tenancy law. He was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-11-10 19:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/102006129bfd796.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954283/at-least-eight-dead-in-explosion-near-red-fort-in-indias-new-delhi-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>At least eight dead in explosion near Red Fort in India’s New Delhi: local media</strong></a><br><p>An explosion was reported near the Red Fort in the Indian capital of New Delhi on Monday, in which at least eight people were killed and at least 20 people were injured, local television channels reported.
The exact cause of the blast was being investigated, city police spokesperson Sanjay Tyagi said.
However, India’s financial capital of Mumbai, as well as its most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which borders Delhi, went on high security alert after the blast, local media reported.
“Eight people have been killed in the explosion,” Tyagi said.

A previous owner of the car, named only as Salman, was arrested after the blast, NDTV reported, without going into more details. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha said the blast took place minutes before 7pm (6:30pm PKT).
“A slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light. An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,” he told reporters. “The situation is being monitored.”
At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws caught fire, Delhi’s deputy fire chief said, adding that the flames had been doused by firefighting teams.
“We heard a big sound, our windows shook,” one resident, who did not give a name, told NDTV.
“I was at the metro station, going down the stairs, when I heard an explosion. I turned around and saw a fire. People started running helter-skelter,” Suman Mishra, whose husband owns a hotel in a nearby area, told Reuters.
Wali Ur Rehman said he was sitting at his shop when he heard a loud explosion.
“I fell from the impact of the explosion, it was that intense,” he told news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake.
About 30 to 40 ambulances were near the site of the blast and the entire area was cordoned off after the fire was put out, a Reuters witness said, adding that he could see remains of mangled cars and crowds milling around.
Police tried to clear crowds that gathered around the site of the incident.

Visuals on local media showed flames and smoke billowing from more than one vehicle in what was described as a congested street located near a metro station in the old part of Delhi.
Mangled bodies and the wreckage of several cars could be seen on a congested street near a metro station in the old quarter of Delhi, as police poured into the area to secure it and push back gathering crowds.
According to Indian outlet NDTV, the fire brigade was on site, while The Times of India reported that the fire caused by the explosion engulfed three to four other vehicles.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi published a message extending his condolences to the families of those killed in the blast on his X account.
“Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi earlier this evening,” he wrote. “May the injured recover at the earliest. Those affected are being assisted by authorities.
“Reviewed the situation with Home Minister Amit Shah ji and other officials,” he added.
 






Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said that within 10 minutes of the explosion, teams from the Delhi Crime Branch and Special Branch, along with the National Security Guard (NSG) and National Investigation Agency (NIA), arrived on the scene.
“Orders have been given to examine all nearby CCTV cameras. I have also spoken to the Delhi CP and the Special Branch in-charge,” Shah said in a video statement.
“We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account,” he said. “All options will be investigated immediately and we will present the results to the public.”
The minister added that he would visit both the incident site and the hospital in the video statement.
Earlier today, Indian media claimed that 2,900 kilogrammes of bomb-making material were seized during a raid in India’s Haryana area.
“Officials confirmed that 360kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900kg of IED (improvised explosive device)-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized,” The Times of India claimed in its report, adding that two people were arrested.
The Red Fort, known locally as Lal Qila, is a sprawling, 17th-century Mughal-era edifice melding Persian and Indian architectural styles, and is visited by tourists throughout the year.
The Indian prime minister addresses the nation from the fort’s ramparts every year on August 15, India’s Independence Day.
Delhi targeted in the past
Delhi was the target of blasts during the 1980s and 1990s, with public places such as bus stations and crowded market areas hit in attacks.
About a dozen people were killed in a briefcase explosion outside the Delhi High Court in 2011 — the last such major incident in the city.
Security in the national capital is the responsibility of the federal home ministry. Delhi police report directly to it, though the capital territory also has its own local government.</p><small>2025-11-10 19:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/102130356fd51c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954284/security-forces-kill-two-terrorists-operation-ongoing-for-3-others-who-infiltrated-cadet-college-wana' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill two terrorists; operation ongoing for 3 others who infiltrated Cadet College Wana</strong></a><br><p>At least two terrorists were killed during an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan on Monday as security forces conducted a clearance operation at the educational facility, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The military’s media wing said the initial attempt by the terrorists to breach the perimeter security was foiled by the “vigilant and resolute response by own troops”.
However, the attackers then rammed an explosives-laden vehicle against the main gate of the college, causing it to collapse and damaging an adjacent structure. The terrorists then entered the educational facility and were “cornered in the college’s administrative block”.
“Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, own troops engaged the intruders with precision, eliminating two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij,” said the ISPR.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP.
The ISPR added that the terrorists, inside the college, are in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan and “are getting instructions”. “This blatant act of barbarism orchestrated by Khwarij from Afghanistan is in contrast to assertions made by the Afghan Taliban Regime claiming non-presence of these terrorist groups on their soil.”
The military added that Pakistan reserves the right to respond against the terrorists and their leadership present in Afghanistan.

“These khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij have once again tried to repeat the barbaric act of terrorism carried out by them in Army Public School Peshawar in 2014,” said the ISPR.
On December 16, 2014, Pakistan lived through one of its most horrific chapters. The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar and the operation to clear out the terrorists unfolded in less than 10 hours, during which 147 people, including 132 schoolchildren, were martyred.
The military maintained that the latest attack aims to instill fear among the youth of the tribal areas, “who are acquiring quality education at their doorstep to excel in life and achieve a better future for not only themselves and their families but also for their communities.”
Earlier today, the military’s media wing said at least 20 terrorists were killed in North Waziristan and Dara Adam Khel districts of KP.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
PM, Naqvi condemn attack
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack and lauded the retaliatory action of the security forces.
He said the cowardly enemy had once again tried to target an educational institution and failed.
“Unwavering resolve of the security forces will thwart the nefarious designs of the terrorists,” the premier added.
“The entire nation salutes the security forces,” he said, adding that the government was determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the professionalism and courage of the security personnel for repelling the attack and eliminating two terrorists.
He said the timely and decisive action of the forces prevented a major tragedy and demonstrated their high level of preparedness.
“By thwarting the terrorists’ attempt, our brave soldiers have once again proven their dedication to protecting the nation,” Naqvi said.
Naqvi reiterated that the government and people stood united against terrorism and would continue efforts to eradicate all extremist elements from the country.
State broadcaster PTV News also released a video message from parents of the students condemning the attackers and expressing their solidarity with the security forces.

The government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the vote following the defection of two opposition members, leading to a total of 64 votes for the bill.
The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings.
Initially, a clause-by-clause voting was carried out. Later, voting by division was conducted, with the entry and exit gates of the Senate closed as per the protocol.

Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward Tarar’s table as he began to present it.
Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill.
A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s (NA) law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House.
Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the NA. The session had begun today but it was adjourned. The NA will now reconvene at 11am tomorrow (Tuesday).
In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each.
PTI senator resigns after voting in favour
Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”.
He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.”
When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”.

The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction.
 






‘Historic bill’
Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties.
“There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said.
Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces.
“The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified.
Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report
Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee. Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, so they could be present during the briefing.
 


Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”.
Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause.
Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court.
Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added.
Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office.
Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age.
 
 

He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member.
The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.”
He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion.
As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”.
On the transfer of judges, the PPP senator said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted.
 
 

“The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was reconstituted under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said.
Naek said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then.
Senate debate
The Senate session began shortly after 11am with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani.
At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches.
During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure.
His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“. He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”.
“The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued.
Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May. “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests.
“What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned.
He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”.
After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August.
Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI.
She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”.
For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment.
“Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added.
PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib.”
Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life.
He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits.
The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it.
Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm.
Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.”
Will ensure amendment does not pass: PTI
Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers.
“It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media.
He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said.
However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment.
“The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity.
The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006.
Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve.
He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices.
MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers
In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.”
As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone.
Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.”
The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies.
On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts.
“What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said.
Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it.
He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy.
 
 

The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said.
Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.</p><small>2025-11-10 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/10195248485121b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953713/lhc-demands-report-from-punjab-wildlife-dept-over-demolition-of-lahore-pet-market' target='_blank'><strong>LHC demands report from Punjab Wildlife Dept over demolition of Lahore pet market</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday ordered the Punjab Wildlife Department to submit a report on the demolition of a pet market in the walled city within 30 days and decide on a framework to prevent such incidents from occurring again, according to the lawyer who filed the petition with the court.
A demolition operation was carried out at a bird market in Lahore’s Bhati Chowk area, near Data Darbar last Friday by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), with shopkeepers accusing the Punjab government of killing dozens of birds and other caged pets; allegations the government has denied. This incident led to public outrage as the animals were not moved during the demolition.
Animal rights lawyer Altamush Saeed filed a petition with the LHC on Saturday, naming the Punjab government, the Punjab Wildlife and Fisheries Department and the LDA, as respondents.
A press release stated that the court ordered the Wildlife Department to submit a “comprehensive report” on the matter.
It added that LHC Judge Shehram Sarwar ordered the Wildlife Department to treat Saeed’s petition as a “formal representation” and submit a comprehensive report to the court on the demolition within 30 days.
According to the lawyer, the department was ordered to include in its report the details and causes of the demolition, a concrete road map to ensure similar incidents do not happen in the future, criminal action against those responsible, and training and sensitivity programmes to promote “empathy and responsibility” towards animals within the Punjab government and its departments.
The press release also stated that if the Wildlife Department does not submit the report within the 30-day deadline, they would be “brought back before the court under contempt proceedings”.
“These deaths were entirely preventable. Had the [LDA] coordinated with the Wildlife Department, these animals could have been safely relocated,” the press release read.
In separate comments to Dawn, Saeed stated that the department had an obligation to coordinate with the LDA to protect the animals at the market.
“The legal issue is that [with] the demolition and everything that happened, the Wildlife Department had to be involved for the relocation of the animals,” he explained to Dawn. “That did not happen and that is why the animals died.
“Secondly, there’s no accountability from the LDA as well, therefore sending this matter to Wildlife — which has the right authority and the legal authority under the Punjab Wildlife Act — to not only take criminal action, but also to devise some kind of framework that [ensures] this does not happen again.”
Saeed noted that the department should have been involved from he beginning since they were the right authority to decide on the matter, adding that had the issue gone directly to the LDA, “we would have lost”.
“You can clearly see that the LDA did everything unilaterally; the department does not have the jurisdiction to deal with wild animals, it also does not have the expertise,” Saeed stated.
“We have no idea when the animals were relocated, we have no idea where they’re actually relocated. Secondly, it’s not in their (the LDA) legal domain to do so.”
The petition — available with Dawn — requested that the court declare the actions of the LDA and the Lahore commissioner and DC’s actions “illegal if [the] killing of animals is proved and to ensure regardless [that] future projects of any kind do involve a safe animal evacuation or relocation program and no animal cruelty”.
It further requested that six of the respondents launch an inquiry into the matter and publicly collect debris and rubble from the demolition site, in order to prove the presence of animals when the structure was torn down.
“In the interim, do not allow any debris excavation without transparency to prevent [the] removal of evidence,” the petition read.
It further requested that the court order the Punjab government “to hold ethics and empathy training on animal and human rights in light of Islam and the policy for government employees and [the] general public in line with Article 9, 9A and 25A of the constitution”.</p><small>2025-11-10 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/102127286aadb8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954286/sanaullah-rubbishes-alleged-connection-between-imran-khan-and-pm-immunity-clause' target='_blank'><strong>Sanaullah rubbishes alleged connection between Imran Khan and PM immunity clause</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday rubbished the notion that the status of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan had any bearing on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s withdrawal of proposed immunity for the top office as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Government senators Anusha Rahman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu had tabled a proposal for the 27th Amendment bill to extend the immunity currently enjoyed by the president under Article 248 of the Constitution to include the prime minister. The clause sought to extend presidential immunity to the prime minister, effectively barring criminal proceedings against the premier during the term in office.
Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office”.
However, PM Shehbaz had ordered the clause’s withdrawal on Sunday, saying that the premier must remain “fully accountable”. Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity”, owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister.
Questioned in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’ today about speculation that the clause was withdrawn because it could potentially benefit the PTI founder, Sanaullah said: “No. If we had intended to do this, we could also have done it in a way that the benefit would apply only from today.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. He served as the prime minister from August 2018 till April 2022, when he was ousted through a vote of no-confidence.
He said the prime minister made a very “democratic” decision and he should be congratulated for it.
The premier’s aide added that the premier’s office was not a constitutional one but an executive and elected office, thus “it should remain answerable to the people”.
PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion.
It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.”
Issue of immunity
Discussion also veered towards a post on X by renowned Islamic scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani, a former judge of the Federal Shariat Court, against immunity for anyone.
“In our Constitution, previously, the president was granted protection during their tenure, which was against Islam. Now, granting anyone such protection for life is completely against the spirit of Sharia and the Constitution, and would be extremely shameful for the country … A heartfelt request to the members of Parliament is that they should not take this sin upon themselves.”
 






Questioned about the senior scholar’s post, Sanaullah instead asked whether such immunity was not already present for the president, or was it being granted for the first time. He said the immunity would end if the president again accepted any public office.
He said the president enjoyed immunity in his term of office since 1973 and such was the case for other heads of state around the world as well.</p><small>2025-11-10 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/101851324aebff4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954282/govt-to-table-27th-constitutional-amendment-bill-in-na-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to table 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in NA tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The government is set to table the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment in tomorrow’s National Assembly session after it sailed through the Senate kn Monday.
A notification from the NA Secretariat for the orders of the day for Tuesday’s session said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar would table the bill.
Today’s NA session was adjourned after being marred by ruckus from the treasury and opposition benches during speeches from each side.
PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was disrupted by shouting from the opposition benches as he began to speak in the NA. Speaking on the immunity for the president, he said this was standard practice in many countries for the head of state.
Ashraf assailed the opposition, asking who was it to criticise the treasury benches when its ranks were filled with those who had violated the Constitution.
As he continued to speak, PTI lawmakers chanted slogans of “Go Zardari go” and “Long live Imran Khan” while terming the former prime minister as “Raja rental”.
 


The former premier said the opposition was only content when it was raising a hue and cry in the house, adding that treasury benches would react in a similar manner to any speaker from the other side.
Taking the floor after the PPP leader, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the need for haste in the matter and said all stakeholders were not consulted and taken on board.
Meanwhile, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi paid tribute to the army chief for “the respect God has granted us with in the world because of him and our martyrs”.
The minister said Pakistan would fight every terrorist till they abandon militancy, whether they were in Pakistan, Afghanistan, or any other corner of the world.
Earlier today, the government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the Senate vote for the bill following the defection of two opposition members.
The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings.
Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward the Tarar’s table as he began to present it.
Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill.
A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House.
Approval by parliamentary committees
The bill, which was tabled by Tarar in the Senate on Saturday amid outcry from the opposition and hours after getting the federal cabinet’s nod, aims to set up a federal constitutional court and grant lifetime status to the field marshal rank.
On Sunday, a joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees had app­roved the 27th Consti­tutional Amendment bill with minor changes amid a boycott by the opposition.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the meeting, said all key amendments, including changes to Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and pertains to the military command structure, were amicably approved by both committees.
Senator Naek, who was presiding over the meeting, said the bill was adopted with minor changes. He said that the committees empowered him and the law minister to make a couple of amendments.
The committees, however, deferred the Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) proposal, seeking to amend Article 140 that pertains to local governments, as well as the Awami National Party’s (ANP) recommendation for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The ANP had submitted a proposal to rename the province by removing ‘Khyber’, arguing that Khyber was a district and other provinces did not include district names in their titles. Likewise, the Balochistan National Party’s proposed amendment to increase the province’s seats in Parliament was also deferred.
Earlier in the day, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan told reporters that the committee had sought time until Monday to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, the law minister told reporters it was dec­ided that provinces would be taken into confidence on changing KP’s name.</p><small>2025-11-10 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/10131312bbfe69c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954264/radical-restructuring-justice-shah-retired-judges-top-lawyers-urge-cjp-to-summon-full-court-on-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>‘Radical restructuring’: Justice Shah, retired judges, top lawyers urge CJP to summon full court on 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>As the government made moves toward the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, present and former judges and top lawyers on Monday urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to summon a full court meeting to discuss the proposed legislation.
The request came in a letter, dated November 9 and a copy of which is available with Dawn, that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi. It was also signed and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.
The letter said that the missive was being written “not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its establishment in 1956”.
It termed the 27th Amendment Act as the “biggest and the most radical restructuring of the Federal Appellate Court structure since the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935”.
“We say this without any fear of contradiction that no civilian or military government in Pakistan’s history has even tried, let alone succeeded, in relegating the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a subordinate court and permanently denude it of its constitutional jurisdiction, as is being done through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025,” the lawyers and judges said in the letter.
“If your Lordship is in agreement with us that this proposed amendment act is the biggest and most radical restructuring of the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its inception, then we would most respectfully request, and fully expect your Lordship, to call a full court meeting to discuss this proposed Amendment Act and to give an appropriate response to the federal government in the form of inputs and suggestions regarding this proposed amendment act,” they added.
“We would respectfully not like to explain to your Lordship that the Supreme Court has every right and power to give its input to the federal government on any proposed amendment act,” the legal experts said, adding that the legislation proposes “radical restructuring” of SC’s basic essence, structure and its constitutional obligation to administer justice for all.
The letter reiterated the call for an immediate full court meeting, noting that the Amendment was expected to be passed by November 11 (today) “or any day thereafter”.
 
 

The lawyers and judges went on to add that in case this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation (which we consider to be reasons without any substance), then we would at
least expect you to accept and admit in a written response to us that you are now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”.
“At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” they said.
The letter requested that, as this was a matter of “utmost public importance”, a copy of the missive be released to the media.
Besides Siddiqui and retired judges Alam and Akhtar, the letter was also endorsed by former attorney generals for Pakistan (AGP) Muneer A. Malik, Anwar Mansoor Khan; ex-presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Abid Shahid Zuberi, Ali Ahmad Kurd, Muhammad Akram Sheikh and Kanrani B. Amanullah; and SC advocates Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shabnam Nawaz Awan.
Zuberi, Sheikh and Salahuddin are among the petitioners who have challenged the 26th Amendment, which had also faced great opposition from the legal fraternity at the time of its passage in October 2024. Kurd and other lawyers had vowed to launch a protest movement to reject that Amendment and “restore the judiciary’s independence”.
Malik and Hosain had last month presented their arguments in the 26th Amendment case as counsels for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA) and veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, respectively.
Justice Shah’s letter to CJP Afridi
Separately, Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah urged CJP Afridi to hold urgent institutional consultation regarding the 27th Amendment in a letter dated Nov 8.
He urged the chief justice to engage with the executive and make it clear that no amendment affecting the judiciary would proceed without consulting judges of the constitutional courts.
He also asked CJP Afridi to convene a full court meeting on the matter.
 






Proposed judicial restructuring
Shortly after its approval by the federal cabinet, the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate on Saturday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. The Senate has convened for the third consecutive day today and is likely to greenlight the legislation, after which it will land in the National Assembly.
Among the various changes proposed in the Amendment, many pertain to the judiciary, with the most notable being the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC will deal with constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the Supreme Court itself, which has led to many experts believing that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the SC as the country’s highest judicial forum.

At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court, the FCC, building upon the constitutional benches formed under the 26th Amendment, which remains challenged before the SC.
Even before the 27th Amendment gets the parliament’s nod, the government has already begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the FCC.
Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the SC’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC. The names of Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Mus­arrat Hilali, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi from SC, along with SHC’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court’s Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, are also being discussed for inclusion in the FCC’s initial composition.
Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament.
Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the SC, senior high court judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice.
FCC judges would retire at the age of 68. The retirement age for SC judges currently is 65 as per Article 179 of the Constitution.
The amendment further stipulates that the president may transfer a high court judge from one high court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). A judge of a high court who does not accept a transfer under this Article shall be deemed to have retired from his office.
The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself.
The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution“.
Moreover, the FCC would take over the SC’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the president’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.

According to police, the incident took place around 1:45am when the attackers fired several shots at the main gate of the house, leaving bullet holes in it. The assailants fled the scene soon after the firing.
The Mayar police registered a case and launched an investigation. Officials said CCTV footage from nearby houses was being examined, and security had been enhanced around the cricketer’s residence.
The Lower Dir police said that according to the initial investigation, the incident was not one of terrorism but possibly the result of a land dispute or regional enmity.
Shah’s father also met Lower Dir District Police Officer Taimur Khan, who assured the former of early arrests.
Local residents said Shah’s family belonged to a respectable background and had no known enmity or dispute with anyone.

Shaheen was appointed in the role last month in what seemed like an abrupt development with Rizwan being stripped off captaincy despite spending only five ODI series and an ICC Champions Trophy campaign in charge.
While the wicket-keeper-batter had a disastrous show at the Champions Trophy, he led Pakistan to series wins in Australia and South Africa last year and against the West Indies this year.
According to multiple media reports, Rizwan was at loggerheads with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) when he was removed as captain – reportedly turning down the central contract.
Shaheen, however, seems to have cleared the air, stating in the press conference on the eve of Pakistan’s three-match ODI series opener against Sri Lanka in Rawalpindi, that he had a discussion with his predecessor prior to his appointment as skipper.
“Rizwan was the only person [from the team] I had a discussion with when I was about to be appointed as captain,” said the Pakistan pace spearhead. “I asked him how he felt and what he wanted.
“Rizwan is a good human and he decided himself to stake a step back and let me replace him, and that was how the decision was taken.”
Shaheen had been in Rizwan’s position himself when he had replaced Babar Azam as Pakistan’s T20I skipper back in 2024 before being placed by the latter after just one series in charge.
The pacer, who lead Pakistan to the national side’s first-ever ODI series victory over South Africa at home last week, said the past did not spill into his decisions in the present and that he took advice from all his team-mates as captain.
“I talk to everyone for advice and I am not too egoistic to not talk to the ex captains because of things that happened in the past,” he said.
Moreover, Shaheen was not reluctant to back both Babar and Rizwan amid their recent struggles in white-ball cricket, observing that responsibility was for every player to take and not only for the established pros.
“Everyone has to take responsibility if you want to improve as a team,” the 25-year-old, who managed three wickets at an average of 38 in his first series as captain. “It’s not just for Rizwan, Babar, Fakhar [Zaman], Shaheen, Saim [Ayub] to ensure this. The first and the last, all players should take responsibility.
“As far as Rizwan is concerned, he is Pakistan’s top-scorer in one-dayers since 2023. We are trying to back players who are not in form so that they can do well in future matches. If you get hopeless about such players it will bring in worse results. We have to go into matches as a unit and win them as a unit.”
Babar, too, despite getting starts, failed to come up to the fans’ expectations, scoring only 45 runs across the three matches against the Proteas. Shaheen believed the right-hander would bounce back with a big performance in the near future.
“Babar can falter in one or two matches but he is in good touch and I hope he will score a hundred soon,” he said.
While no guarantees have been assured to Shaheen at least publicly by the PCB about the longevity of his stint as the skipper, the left-armer is looking forward to the 2027 ODI World Cup — which will be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
“My job as captain is to ensure how to improve our one-day cricket and how to take my fellow players forward,” he said.
After winning his first assignment as captain against a depleted South African team, Shaheen and his subordinates are gearing up to take on a much stronger Sri Lanka side, who are expected to flourish on the slower surfaces in Rawalpindi — where all the three ODIs are to be contested from Tuesday.
The bowler said he preferred to play an important role in selection matters amid lack of clarity over who essentially picks the Pakistan squads.
“The captain, I believe, should be involved in selection matters because after all he is the one who is going to lead the XI,” Shaheen noted. “Obviously the selectors pick the squads but the captain should be involved. And if it is in the captain’s knowledge, the team would be better and would fight harder.
“My job as captain is to ensure how to improve our one-day cricket and how to take my fellow players forward.”</p><small>2025-11-10 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/10174649451871d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954277/at-least-24-terrorists-killed-in-kp-and-balochistan-ibos-says-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>At least 24 terrorists killed in KP and Balochistan IBOs, says ISPR</strong></a><br><p>At least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
The ISPR said the KP intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted between November 8-9.
During an intelligence-based operation in the general area of Shawal in North Waziristan, eight terrorists were killed by the security forces. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, eight Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” said the military’s media wing.
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In the second IBO conducted in the Dara Adam Khel district of the province, 12 terrorists were killed after “an intense fire exchange”.
The military’s media wing added that sanitisation operations were being conducted in the areas to “eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”. It added that under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam, approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan, the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan “will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
 






In a later post on X, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Kalat district on the night of Nov 1 on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al-Hindustan”.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell.”
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities.
It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian sponsored terrorist” found in the area.
 






In June last year, the federal government approved a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism campaign, Operation Azm-i-Istehkam.
On Oct 16, security for­ces killed 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP over the course of three days, the military’s media wing said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-11-10 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1018220406b6d39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954279/propaganda-targeting-pia-flight-safety-operations-is-baseless-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Propaganda targeting PIA flight safety, operations is baseless: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday assailed claims that national carrier Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA), flight operations and safety measures were not meeting international standards.
On November 3, PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety.
The defence minister, whose portfolio includes aviation, wrote in an X post that any “propaganda targeting PIA, its flights’ safety and its operations is totally baseless”.
“Safety is non-negotiable, but unqualified people cannot dictate it in the presence of Pakistani and international regulators,” he wrote. “PIA flight [operations] are strictly adhered to PCAA/international safety standards.”
Asif said he fully backed the flag carrier’s efforts to “return to profitability and expand its network”, adding that PIA generated a per-day average of Rs600 million in revenue over the past three days, which he claimed was generated through a “regular domestic/international schedule without disruption”.
“By spreading malicious news, they are trying to harm national interests and sabotage it,” he said, referring to those making the claims. “We have worked tirelessly over [the] last five years to revive PIA.”
“PIA is now continuing to fly domestically as per schedule and covering coveted international destinations such as Toronto, Manchester, Paris, [Saudi Arabia], China and [the] Far East as per schedule. In future, more routes to Europe and North America shall also be operated,” he added.
 






For nearly a year, engineers working at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), represented by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP), have been raising their voices over what they describe as unfair treatment and safety concerns within the airline. Recently, however, the matter has escalated, turning into a protest, resulting in the delay of flights and leading to the suspension of a few SAEP officials.
Last Monday, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities as well as safety and the unavailability of spare parts.
SAEP members claim that while pilots receive salary hikes, engineers’ pay remains stagnant. Moreover, the engineers claim they are often told to reuse old aircraft parts instead of being provided with new ones, a practice they say could compromise passenger safety.</p><small>2025-11-10 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/101531035bf93dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954274/amir-muqam-demands-kp-cm-apologise-to-public-armed-forces-for-remarks-about-security-personnel' target='_blank'><strong>Amir Muqam demands KP CM apologise to public, armed forces for remarks about security personnel</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam on Monday demanded that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi apologise to the nation and the armed forces for his recent remarks about security forces.
During a media talk on November 6, Afridi alleged that the sanctity of worship places was violated when sniffer dogs were brought there by the security forces. He also made disparaging remarks about security personnel. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi had condemned those statements, while a case was also registered against CM Afridi under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
“The destruction of KP has already been happening, but now he (Afridi) has taken on the task to defame all institutions, make such false allegations and devalue them so much,” Muqam said while addressing a press conference in Islamabad.
“You (Afridi) should definitely apologise to the entire nation, the armed forces, as well as the families of those martyrs, for your statement,” he asserted.
“He has no realisation that ‘what am I saying and how much it will hurt people and how much it will make the enemies happy’,” the PML-N leader added.
 


The minister went on to say that “even an emotional union council-level person cannot issue such immature and irresponsible statements”.
He added that Afridi was not even “realising that he was the chief executive of a province and that whatever he says can spread and have consequences”.
“The work that India could not do, he (Afiridi) has taken on that task,” the PML-N leader alleged.
“Such irresponsible statements, so you can think what his aim and objective are,” Muqam said, claiming that Indian TV channels aired more of the KP CM’s statements than their local news.
The minister highlighted that not all of KP’s public were of the same thinking as CM Afridi. “He does not even know how much difficulty he is putting KP’s public in.”
 
 

“If you have so much capability, then tell an alternative that if the role of the armed forces ends in KP — on the borders, in merged and other districts — then can you guarantee that Pakistan’s flag will be there in two days?” Muqam said.
“I am extremely saddened by whose agenda you are peddling and what your demands are.”
Referring to the KP CM and his party opposing the federal government policy on Afghanistan, the minister asked, “Should Afghanistan policy be handed to you?”
Muqam asserted that it was “not possible” for a province to have its own foreign policy, adding that doing so could result in other provinces demanding the same.
The PML-N leader also slammed the PTI’s governance in KP.
“It is our misfortune that for the past 12-13 years, the same party of social media and empty slogans has been ruling KP. They have nothing other than lies,” Muqam said.
“They cannot even compete with Punjab or someone else on performance, or consider that the ‘if the people of KP consistently gave us a mandate, then what did we give back to them’,” he added, criticising the PTI for “showing false dreams and false slogans”.</p><small>2025-11-10 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/101827227a67279.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954281/new-delhi-police-detain-dozens-in-anti-pollution-protests' target='_blank'><strong>New Delhi police detain dozens in anti-pollution protests</strong></a><br><p>Indian police detained dozens of people during a rare protest at the famed India Gate monument in New Delhi, who were demanding action to curb an annual scourge of toxic air swathing the capital and its surrounding region.
Sunday’s protest by crowds of all ages holding banners and chanting slogans before police bundled them away was a scarce event, even though Delhi and the national capital region have battled such fumes every winter for years.
“We have only one problem, and that is of clean air,” said Neha, a mask-wearing protester, who gave only one name. “This problem has been going on for many years, but no action is being taken,” she told news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake.
Visuals from the agency showed police dragging protesters, some holding banners that read, “Breathing is killing us,” while others chanted slogans such as “Our right, clear air” into waiting buses before they were driven away.
The city’s air quality index of 345 on Monday ranked as “very poor”, compared to ratings of “good” in the category from zero to 50, and “severe” in the range from 401 to 500, according to the Central Pollution Control Board.
Police had called for the spot to be vacated as it was not a designated protest site, they told reporters earlier, while opposition leaders criticised the removal of the protesters.
“The right to clean air is a basic human right,” Rahul Gandhi, leader of the Congress party that has ruled India for much of its history as an independent nation, said on X. “The right to peaceful protest is guaranteed by our constitution. Why are citizens … peacefully demanding clean air being treated like criminals?”
 






The Delhi government was taking steps to prevent pollution, said its environment minister, Manjinder Singh Sirsa.
“We will continue every possible effort to rid us of pollution,” he said in a statement from BJP Delhi on X. “This is the resolve of our government.”
 






The state government is formed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
Winter shrouds the region in a thick haze as cold, heavy air traps construction dust, vehicular emissions, and smoke, bringing respiratory illnesses for many.

Last week in an interview with The Riasat Azim YouTube channel, the 32-year-old pacer accused then selector and team manager Manjurul Islam and other officials of sexual harassment.
She detailed multiple incidents spanning from 2021 through the 2022 Women’s World Cup, which she said left her mentally distressed and ultimately sidelined from the national setup, according to cricexec.
Manjurul, who is currently in China, rejected the allegations as “baseless”.
According to the Times of India, BCB President Aminul Islam said on Sunday during a press briefing that the board would act firmly once the investigation concludes, adding that the committee should be given time to complete its work.
He reaffirmed that no one — be it coach, director or staff member— was above the law, nor did any position within the board hold immunity.
“Even the Prime Minister of this country isn’t exempt from such rules. We’re just ordinary directors. If I go and harass someone, and it’s proven to be true, then I’m just an ordinary director not above the law,” Times of India quoted him as saying.
The news outlet said that the board has constituted a three-member inquiry panel headed by retired Justice Tariq ul Hakim, with Rubaba Dowla, a newly appointed BCB director, and Barrister Sarwat Siraj Shukla, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court, as members.
The committee has been given 15 working days to submit its report.
Meanwhile, as per a Cricbuzz report, the BCB has placed four officials linked to women’s cricket on special duty pending the inquiry.
While affirming the board’s zero-tolerance stance, Aminul also emphasised the need for a fair process.
“If the allegations are true, they will not be tolerated. But since such investigations touch upon personal lives, it can harm those falsely accused. So they should be given five to seven days to defend themselves,” he said.
The BCB’s official statement echoed the same sentiment: “The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings.”
Despite the mental toll it took on her, Jahanara said she felt a responsibility to protect the other female cricketers, who allegedly also had similar experiences but were afraid to speak up due to professional repercussions.
Aside from Manjurul, she named other BCB officials, and said that she had previously written to the board, but that no action had been taken.
Jahanara took 48 wickets in ODIs, and 60 in T20s, across 135 white-ball matches for her country.
Manjurul, 46, a former left-arm seamer, played 12 Tests and 34 ODIs for Bangladesh between 1999 and 2004, before serving in various coaching and managerial roles.</p><small>2025-11-10 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1013432010ee909.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954268/renowned-educationist-arfa-sayeda-zehra-passes-away-in-lahore-at-83' target='_blank'><strong>Renowned educationist Arfa Sayeda Zehra passes away in Lahore at 83</strong></a><br><p>Dr Arfa Sayeda Zehra, a human rights activist, poet and education expert, died on Monday.

“The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s the power and…the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged on a recent podcast with OpenAI chief Sam Altman.
“So if you can’t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can’t plug in,” Nadella added.
Echoing the 1990s dotcom frenzy to build internet infrastructure, today’s tech giants are spending unprecedented sums to construct the silicon backbone of the revolution in artificial intelligence.
Google, Microsoft, AWS (Amazon), and Meta (Facebook) are drawing on their massive cash reserves to spend roughly $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 — backed for now by enthusiastic investors.
All this cash has helped alleviate one initial bottleneck: acquiring the millions of chips needed for the computing power race, and the tech giants are accelerating their in-house processor production as they seek to chase global leader Nvidia.
These will go into the racks that fill the massive data centres, which also consume enormous amounts of water for cooling.
Building the massive information warehouses takes an average of two years in the United States; bringing new high-voltage power lines into service takes five to 10 years.
Energy wall
The “hyperscalers,” as major tech companies are called in Silicon Valley, saw the energy wall coming.
A year ago, Virginia’s main utility provider, Dominion Energy, already had a data-centre order book of 40 gigawatts —  equivalent to the output of 40 nuclear reactors.
The capacity it must deploy in Virginia, the world’s largest cloud computing hub, has since risen to 47 gigawatts, the company announced recently.
Already blamed for inflating household electricity bills, data centres in the United States could account for 7 per cent to 12pcof national consumption by 2030, up from 4pc today, according to various studies.
But some experts say the projections could be overblown.
“Both the utilities and the tech companies have an incentive to embrace the rapid growth forecast for electricity use,” Jonathan Koomey, a renowned expert from UC Berkeley, warned in September.
As with the late 1990s internet bubble, “many data centres that are talked about and proposed and in some cases even announced will never get built.” - Emergency coal - If the projected growth does materialise, it could create a 45-gigawatt shortage by 2028 — equivalent to the consumption of 33 million American households, according to Morgan Stanley.
Several US utilities have already delayed the closure of coal plants, despite coal being the most climate-polluting energy source.
And natural gas, which powers 40pc of data centres worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, is experiencing renewed favour because it can be deployed quickly.
In the US state of Georgia, where data centres are multiplying, one utility has requested authorisation to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators.
Some providers, as well as Elon Musk’s startup xAI, have rushed to purchase used turbines from abroad to build capability quickly. Even recycling aircraft turbines, an old niche solution, is gaining traction.
“The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change.
It’s the fact that we could lose the AI arms race if we don’t have enough power,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum argued in October.
Nuclear, solar, and space?
Tech giants are quietly downplaying their climate commitments. Google, for example, promised net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 but removed that pledge from its website in June.
Instead, companies are promoting long-term projects.
Amazon is championing a nuclear revival through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an as-yet experimental technology that would be easier to build than conventional reactors.
Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa in 2029. And the Trump administration announced in late October an $80bn investment to begin construction on ten conventional reactors by 2030.
Hyperscalers are also investing heavily in solar power and battery storage, particularly in California and Texas.
The Texas grid operator plans to add approximately 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2030 from these technologies alone.
Finally, both Elon Musk, through his Starlink programme, and Google have proposed putting chips in orbit in space, powered by solar energy. Google plans to conduct tests in 2027.</p><small>2025-11-10 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/10115814e44a8ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954263/uae-probably-wont-join-gaza-stabilisation-force-senior-official' target='_blank'><strong>UAE ‘probably’ won’t join Gaza stabilisation force: senior official</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is not planning to join the international stabilisation force for Gaza because it lacks a clear framework, a senior official said on Monday.

In a procedural vote, senators advanced a House-passed bill that will be amended to fund the government until January 30 and include a package of three full-year appropriations bills.
If the Senate eventually passes the amended measure, it still must be approved by the House of Representatives and sent to President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days.
Under a deal struck with a handful of Democrats who rebuffed their party’s leadership, Republicans agreed to a vote in December on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies, which help lower-income Americans pay for private health insurance and are due to expire at the end of the year, have been a Democratic priority during the funding battle.
The vote to advance the bill passed by a 60-40 margin, the minimum needed to overcome a Senate filibuster.
 
 

“It looks like we’re getting very close to the shutdown ending,” Trump told reporters at the White House prior to the vote.
The bill would prohibit federal agencies from firing employees until January 30, a win for federal worker unions and their allies. It would stall Trump’s campaign to downsize the federal workforce.
Some 2.2 million civilians worked for the federal government at the start of Trump’s second term, according to federal records. At least 300,000 employees are expected to leave the government by the end of this year due to Trump’s downsizing efforts.
It would also provide back pay for all federal employees, including members of the military, Border Patrol agents, and air-traffic controllers.
When the Senate reconvenes on Monday, Republican leaders will try to get a bipartisan agreement to circumvent Senate rules and move quickly to passage. Otherwise, the chamber would require much of the coming week to move through procedural actions before voting on final passage, possibly extending the shutdown into next weekend.
“It was a good vote tonight,“ Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters after the Senate adjourned on Sunday. “Hopefully, we’ll get an opportunity tomorrow to set up the next votes. Of course, that’s going to take some cooperation and consent.”
Sunday’s deal was brokered by Democratic Senators Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, both from New Hampshire, and Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said a person familiar with the talks.
“For over a month, I’ve made clear that my priorities are to both reopen government and extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits. This is our best path toward accomplishing both of these goals,” Shaheen posted on X.
 






Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Democrat, voted against the measure.
Many Democrats on the Hill watched the deal unfold with displeasure.
“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” wrote US Representative Ro Khanna on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?“
 






Sunday marked the 40th day of the shutdown, which has sidelined federal workers and affected food aid, parks and travel, while air traffic control staffing shortages threaten to derail travel during the busy Thanksgiving holiday season late this month.
Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said the mounting effects of the shutdown pushed the chamber toward an agreement.
“Temperatures cool, the atmospheric pressure increases outside and all of a sudden it looks like things will come together,” Tillis told reporters.
Should the government remain closed for much longer, economic growth could turn negative in the fourth quarter, especially if air travel does not return to normal levels by Thanksgiving, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on the CBS “Face the Nation” show. Thanksgiving falls on November 27 this year.
The wrangling on Capitol Hill came as Trump on Sunday again pushed to replace subsidies for the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplaces with direct payments to individuals.
The subsidies, which helped double ACA enrollment to 24 million since they were put in place in 2021, are at the heart of the shutdown. Republicans have maintained they are open to addressing the issue only after government funding is restored.
Trump took to his Truth Social platform on Sunday to blast the subsidies as a “windfall for Health Insurance Companies, and a DISASTER for the American people,” while demanding the funds be sent directly to individuals to buy coverage on their own.
“I stand ready to work with both Parties to solve this problem once the Government is open,” Trump wrote.
Americans shopping for 2026 Obamacare health insurance plans are facing a more than doubling of monthly premiums on average, health experts estimate, with the pandemic-era subsidies due to expire at the end of the year.
The ACA enrollment period, however, runs through January 15, which would allow time for a legislative effort to extend the credits for next year.</p><small>2025-11-10 05:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1007205196cbaf4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954190/7-judges-on-the-shortlist-for-federal-constitutional-court' target='_blank'><strong>7 judges on the shortlist for Federal Constitutional Court</strong></a><br><p> 

The Federal Shariat Court, located opposite the Supreme Court building, will house the new FCC.—Tanveer Shahzad/White Star

• Constitutional Bench head Justice Aminuddin Khan among leading candidates for top slot
• Federal court will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters
ISLAMABAD: With the 27th Constitutional Amendment progressing smoothly through parli­ament, the government has begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) — an institution designed to deal with constitutional interpretation and intergovernmental disputes.
Official sources said the government has initiated consultations on the composition of the new court, and Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC.
The names of Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Mus­arrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Farooq, and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi from the Supreme Court, along with Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, the incumbent chief justice of the Balo­ch­istan High Court, are also being discussed for inclusion in the initial composition of the new court.
 
 

Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the president, on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint judges to the new court under the proposed amendment.
The FCC proposal has been revived in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill to streamline the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and improve efficiency in constitutional adjudication.
The government believes this initiative will ease the SC’s workload, speed up constitutional rulings, and enhance judicial independence and credibility.
The idea of a separate constitutional court was first introduced in the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by the PPP and PML-N. The CoD proposed a specialised court for constitutional matters to let the SC focus on final appeals. The idea reappeared in the 26th Amendment draft but was dropped due to opposition from JUI-F and others.
The proposal sets the Constitutional Court judges’ retirement age at 68, three years beyond the Supreme Court’s 65, to ensure continuity and attract experienced jurists.
The new court will be housed in the Federal Shariat Court building in Islamabad, while the Federal Shariat Court moves to the Islamabad High Court. This will symbolically and administratively separate the FCC from the Supreme Court and other superior courts.
The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, intergovernmental disputes between the federation and provinces, and matters arising directly from constitutional provisions. It will also be empowered to examine the legality of presidential orders, constitutional amendments, and questions referred to it by the president or the Parliament.
Judges’ profiles
Justice Aminuddin Khan, the likely nominee for chief justice of the FCC, was born in Multan in 1960. A second-generation lawyer, he earned his LL.B from University Law College, Multan, in 1984 and began practice under his father, Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan.
He became an advocate of the LHC in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001, later rising to the LHC bench in 2011 and the SC in 2019. He has authored several landmark judgements in civil and constitutional law.
Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, born in Karachi in 1962, began practicing law in 1988 and was elevated to the SC in 2023. He is known for his integrity and expertise in constitutional and administrative law.
Justice Musarrat Hilali, the first woman chief justice of the Peshawar High Court, was elevated to the SC in 2023. She has a distinguished legal career and has served as Additional Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Federal Ombudsman for Protection against Harassment of Women.
Justice Aamer Farooq, former IHC chief justice, was elevated to the SC in February 2025. Educated in London and at Lincoln’s Inn, he specialises in constitutional and commercial law.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the LHC has vast experience in civil, criminal, and constitutional law. He has decided over 37,000 cases and led key inquiries, including the 2014 Model Town investigation.
Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, chief justice of the Balochistan High Court, joined the judiciary in 1998, was elevated to the High Court in 2019, and became chief justice in July 2025.
Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court has an extensive international career, having served as prosecutor at the UN tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and as senior counsel at the Special Court for Sierra Leone.

• Traffic police advise motorists to use Rashid Minhas Road via Aladdin Park
KARACHI: A new wave of road closures is set to cripple Karachi once again as after the much-delayed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line project turned major arteries into construction zones, the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project (KWSSIP) is bringing fresh digging, roadblocks and traffic congestion to one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares — University Road.
“The closure is necessary for laying new 96-inch and 72-inch pipelines as part of the K-IV augmentation plan,” said a senior official. “This stretch, which is roughly 2.7 kilometres long, will form part of a new network that’s crucial for improving the city’s water supply.”
Digging work has already started on a section of the University Road  between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science  and Technology (Fuuast).
The second phase will extend from Hasan Square to Nipa Chowrangi, according to project documents.
 
 

Officials have set Dec 30 as the deadline, but many remain “sceptical”, given the city’s track record of repeated delays and missed timelines.
Traffic police have suggested a diversion route via Aladdin Park, Rashid Minhas Road, to ease congestion, though officers admit that alternative roads are already under heavy pressure due to ongoing construction.
However, for hundreds of thousands of daily commuters, the Red Line’s construction has already brought endless congestion, dust and frustration to residents of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Johar and adjoining areas.
“It’s been years of digging and no relief,” said Abdul Maalik Atiqi, a commuter who travels daily from Gulshan-i-Iqbal to Saddar. “Now they’re closing another part of University Road. We’re trapped in a city that never stops breaking.”
“In Karachi, progress always begins with a roadblock,” said Nighat Tasneem, a daily user of University Road for her work at I. I. Chundrigar Road.
For city’s weary residents, the new closure marks yet another chapter in the city’s long saga of “development at the cost of daily life.”
Sources within the government organisations involved with the Red Line and K-IV projects admit that coordination between multiple agencies has been poor.
“This is true to a large extent — there’s a serious lack of a unified plan. One department digs up what the other has just restored,” said an official.
The K-IV Augmentation Project involves the construction of a bulk transmission and distribution system to supply an additional 260 million gallons per day of water to Karachi from the main K-IV line.
This project, funded and executed solely by the Sindh government, is a crucial supplementary initiative designed to connect the main K-IV filtration plants to Karachi’s existing water network. However, its University Road section is likely to create political fallout for the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government.
Opposition parties take PPP to task
The opposition parties have wasted no time criticising the Sindh government.
Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Monem Zafar Khan lashed out, saying the city has turned into a maze of broken roads and failed projects.
“The PPP’s so-called development means endless suffering for Karachi’s citizens,” he said.
Similarly, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders echoed similar frustration, accusing the provincial government of mismanagement and corruption.
“Every few months we hear new deadlines and new projects, but the result is the same — dust, traffic, and despair,” said Fauzia Siddiqi, the PTI spokesperson for the Karachi chapter.

In a statement, a PIA spokesperson also disputed claims about aircraft safety put forward by the Society of Aircraft Eng­ineers of Pakistan (SAEP), which had maintained that its personnel could not compromise on safety and airworthiness.
“The body responsible for air safety in Pakistan is the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), which regulates all airlines, including PIA, under the strictest international stan­dards and procedures. All matters concerning the use and replacement of parts, the fitness of aircraft for flight, and the routes, sche­dules, or changes thereto are under the direct purview of the PCAA and are executed only after seeking their approvals,” the spokesperson said.
 
 

Referring to images of damage to an aircraft win­dscreen that circulated on the media, the spokesperson said that the use of steel tape for curing (drying) sealant after winds­creen repair was a routine matter. But, he maintained, an impression was wrongly created that “flights were being operated with a windscreen held together by tape”.
The spokesperson also claimed that the PIA management had not taken administrative or retaliatory action against any engineer, adding that the dismissal of the body’s “self-styled” president and general secretary was the result of administrative proceedings ongoing for the past four months.
However, the dismissal letter issued to both men last week stated they had been issued notices for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media. The two men were subsequently fired after they failed to appear before an enquiry committee.

• Senate body to question industry on steep hikes
KARACHI: Prices of more than a hundred commonly used medicines have increased by an average of 32 per cent since February last year, after the caretaker government lifted price controls under its deregulation policy, prompting concern among officials and calls for the pharmaceutical industry to explain the steep hikes, according to officials and industry sources.
The steep rise has not only fuelled public anger but also caught the authorities off guard, as they had expected that price deregulation would promote competition and eventually bring down costs for consumers. However, the outcome appears to be quite the opposite.
 
 

The surge in medicine prices came to light through recent findings of an ongoing national survey ordered by the prime minister, following complaints from citizens, hospitals, and provincial health departments about soaring drug costs.
Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, told Dawn that officials of the federal health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) had informed the committee that an overall 32pc increase in medicine prices had been observed since the caretaker government deregulated non-essential medicines in February 2024.
He added that in some cases, prices had risen by as much as 100pc, while an increase of around 50pc was recorded in several others.
Senator Chishti said the purpose of deregulation was to boost competition, attract investment and increase exports, not to burden consumers.
Industry to face questions
He noted that a 32pc overall rise in medicine prices within two years warranted corrective action.
“We have decided to seek justification from the industry in all cases where medicine prices have increased by 50pc or more,” Senator Chishti added.
“We expect to meet industry representatives next month, and if we detect any element of cartelisation by the pharmaceutical sector, we will ask the Competition Commission of Pakistan to look into the matter.”
 
 

He said the committee did not want the pharmaceutical industry to suffer and wanted it to grow, but not at the expense of patients, who were already struggling due to the prevailing economic situation.
He continued that the committee was expecting recommendations from the prime minister on the pricing of non-essential medicines.
Before deregulation, pharmaceutical companies were allowed to increase prices by up to 7pc annually in line with the Consumer Price Index under the previous pricing system.
Officials pointed out that, under this formula, prices would have risen by about 14pc over two years, far lower than the 32pc surge witnessed after deregulation.
Claims rejected
The Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA), however, rejected claims of an excessive price increase. It argued that the survey reflected an average rise of about 15pc and that, if the roughly 3pc linked to the launch of new products and strengths is excluded, the actual two-year increase stood at around 12pc.
PPMA’s Tauqeerul Haq said the deregulation was a timely move that prevented the collapse of the pharmaceutical industry amid soaring input costs, currency depreciation, inflation, rising energy and labour costs, and heavy taxation over the years.
“The policy helped restart production of many previously unavailable medicines, improved their availability, and curbed the circulation of counterfeit drugs during shortages,” he added.
The pharmaceutical industry argues that deregulation was necessary as the previous controlled pricing system made production unsustainable. Even under the old system, prices could not be raised without the federal cabinet’s approval. “Whenever a proposal to raise drug prices was presented, the cabinet would usually reject it due to political pressure,” said an industry representative. “Thus, deregulation was only possible during the caretaker government’s tenure.”
While deregulation has led to an increase in medicine prices, it has had a positive impact by resolving shortages of medicines at the retail level.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, said the deregulation of medicine prices ensured abundant availability of medicines, ending persistent shortages.
He described deregulation as a necessary step to move away from centralised pricing controls that had hindered the sector’s ability to respond to rising production costs.
However, Mr Budhani noted that challenges remain for essential drugs classified as “hardship cases”.
“The real need for relief was in essential drugs, but their prices were not approved, while non-essential drugs received pricing approvals,” he said, adding that bureaucratic delays had contributed to shortages of some vital medicines.

Mr Achakzai said the peaceful protest would be held under the slogan of a Habib Jalib ghazal: “Aise Dastoor Ko, Subh-i-BeNoor Ko, Me Nahi Manta, Mai Nahi Janta”.
Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, he anno­unced two additional slogans: “death for dictatorship and democracy live long” and “free the prisoners”.
Mr Achakzai described himself as a “true patriotic” who has taken the oath to protect the country five times, noting that the current National Ass­embly speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, administered two of those oaths.

He recalled an exchange from 1993 with then-speaker Gohar Ayub Khan.
“I spoke to the speaker that he has taken an oath of protecting the Constitution from hundreds of people, but how will we protect the constitution,” Mr Achakzai said. “I suggested taking another oath from us that if any general violated the constitution, we will be on the roads. How­ever, my suggestion was not considered.”
Mr Achakzai drew a parallel with Afghanistan, noting the shared language and blood. “We can only forgive them if there will be constitution and democracy in Pakistan,” he said.
 
 

He criticised the country’s economic state, stating that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line while some seek lifetime impunity from the law.
“Then who will be investigated, a drug addict who steals money for the drugs or food?” he asked, claiming that those who commit minor crimes will be punished while those who “loot the country will have impunity”.
Mr Achakzai argued that the country cannot be protected by empowering a single individual but by stren­gthening its constitution and people.
“We appeal to all sections of society that it is an attack on the foundation of the country, so all should rise and resist against the conspiracy to smash the Parliament,” he said. “We all should get united and make a system to protect the country before it gets too late, here people are being killed, and they are being pushed to take the weapons in their hands.”
Another TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the 27th Amendment was designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and was disconnected from the issues facing the public.
 
 

A draft of the TTAP’s plans detailed a National Conference to be held this week to strategise against the amendment. The day after the amendment is passed will be observed as a “Black Day,” with lawyers and citizens encouraged to wear black arm strips.
It claimed that the 1973 constitution was no more representative of the masses and was being used to protect the power in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Larkana.
The movement will also involve publishing articles in national and international newspapers and establishing committees to meet with stakeholders, including bar councils and retired Supreme Court judges.
