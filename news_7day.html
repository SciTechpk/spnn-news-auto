<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961955/a-clear-indictment' target='_blank'><strong>A clear indictment</strong></a><br><p>YET again, the UN Security Council’s monitoring report on Afghanistan has painted a grim picture of the presence of transnational terrorist groups on Afghan territory. The report, a regular feature, reiterates that Afghanistan remains a staging ground for some of the most lethal terrorist outfits in the world. Pakistan, which has been a victim of the TTP, based in Afghanistan, has known this painful reality for years.
The report notes that over 20 international and regional terrorist organisations currently call Afghanistan home. These include IS-K, Al Qaeda, the TTP and ETIM, among others.
With the exception of IS-K, these groups have good relations with the Afghan Taliban. Importantly, the report says that the Taliban’s claims that no militant groups are based on their soil are “not credible”.

 

For Pakistan, the TTP — largely due to the permissive environment it enjoys under Afghan Taliban rule — poses a major security challenge. The UN document says that the terrorist group has conducted over 600 attacks against this country in the current year.
Moreover, TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud is believed to spend time in Kabul, while other anti-Pakistan terrorists, such as Gul Bahadur, are also based in Afghanistan.
The report highlights links between the TTP and Al Qaeda, as well as ETIM. Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, said to be a front for TTP and Al Qaeda fighters, is amongst the other terrorist groups active next door. Meanwhile, another matter of grave concern is the presence of madressahs run by IS-K near the Pakistani border.
The details mentioned in the UN report shatter any illusion that Taliban-run Afghanistan poses no threat to its neighbours. On the contrary, just as it used to be before the US-led invasion, Afghanistan has become a safe haven for extremely dangerous and violent militant outfits that threaten the region and the world.
And while the report says that there are differences within the upper echelons of the Taliban leadership on how to deal with the TTP, Kabul’s rulers are unlikely to take action against the group, as the regime may actually “lack the ability to do so”.

 

This should be a matter of great concern for the international community, particularly Afghanistan’s neighbours. Nearly all states bordering Afghanistan have experienced terrorist attacks carried out by groups based on Afghan soil, with Pakistan the hardest hit.
The way forward does not seem to be clear-cut. More conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan will not solve the problem in the long run. Talks with the Kabul regime have also failed to provide meaningful outcomes.
In such a situation, perhaps the least bad option is to reach out to the relatively ‘moderate’ elements within the Taliban set-up, and press upon them the need to stop terrorists from threatening Afghanistan’s neighbours.

Simply put, teachers matter and good teaching is important for ensuring better learning outcomes.
However, recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers gainfully and efficiently employed is not easy. In Pakistan, a couple of decades back, teacher recruitment was seen as having too much discretion with not enough reliance on rules. Allegations of corruption and nepotism in teacher recruitment were common. Many of these charges were based on facts. Two decades ago, reforms were introduced to move to more rules-based (merit-based) recruitment. This has definitely reduced the allegations, and litigation on recruitment issues has also decreased. But has it improved teacher and/or teaching quality? Has it improved student learning? And what unintended consequences has it led to? These are important follow-ups for completing the loop for feedback and continuous improvement. ‘Merit’-based recruitment might reduce corruption, but does it allow us to differentiate between good and bad teachers? If not, the reform might be of limited value.
Many places worldwide have significant requirements for specific courses, diplomas and even degrees before a person can become a teacher. When we moved towards merit-based recruitment, provincial governments removed the requirements for education degrees before joining as a teacher. This has increased the pool of candidates for teaching (a physics graduate can come into teaching directly) but many of these applicants did not choose to be teachers and have no understanding of what teaching is: you can be good at physics but teach it badly. How has this impacted learning outcomes?
Some jurisdictions even have teacher licensing. Teacher licensing has often been talked about in Pakistan but it was only recently that Sindh introduced it. But will licensing improve teaching and learning? We have 1.5 million or so teachers in Pakistan and still suffer a shortage. Will licensing help? Is it only for government schools or also private schools? Will teachers be required to have licences in low-fee private schools, where sometimes they teach Matriculation- or Intermediate-level students? Who will pay for the cost?

Recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers efficiently employed is not easy.

Once a teacher has been recruited, is she a teacher forever? Does she need any education, training or upgradation? Is there a role for continuous professional development and how is it to be structured? Punjab has some 450,000 teachers. How do you design effective professional development systems for such large numbers? Do we design devolved systems or centralised ones? How do we ensure quality and some level of uniformity across the system? We have had continuing professional development systems in place, but the general feeling is that they don’t seem to work and haven’t had the intended impact and definitely not the one needed.
Once deployed, how do we keep teachers motivated to teach effectively for the entire length of their careers — 30-35 years? What are effective career paths for teachers? If a teacher is a good Grade 1 teacher today, how do we ensure that she will be a good, motivated and effective Grade 1 teacher in 10, 20 or 30 years from now? What should happen to her financial returns and other ‘incentives’ so that she is able to have a rewarding career in Grade 1?
We do not have research on most of these important questions. Which means we do not have effective feedback loops on policies. Policies keep coming and getting implemented. But what consequences do they have? How can we improve if we don’t have effective feedback loops that research consequences and impact?

 

What is heartening is that there is an increasing realisation — in government and academia and among development partners and research institutions — of the need to have these feedback loops and to do relevant policy research on important questions. Most education departments already have specific implementation and planning units to structure some of this work. Development partners have historically funded and encouraged some research, but this has recently become more structured and is being given due importance. Academic research output has also been steadily increasing in education in Pakistan.
The most recent and current impetus has come from a very innovative research support programme funded by FCDO and called the Data and Research in Education-Research Consortium. DARE-RC has funded some 35 studies in the education sector, five to six of them on teacher issues. These studies are in collaboration with education departments. The programme is of medium term (it just closed the fourth round of call for proposals).
The results of the studies will allow us to bring out relevant issues more clearly, and some of them will start answering some of the questions raised above. By focusing on local researchers, the programme is also developing the capacity for research in education in Pakistan and a community of practice in the area. The hope is that other programmes, following this one and funded by government and partners, will continue to build on this approach, so that we not only have answers to the questions but also the local capacity to do such work. We will always have more questions and we need communities and people who are able to answer them so that we can keep improving outcomes in education.

 

Pakistan must have around 1.5-2m teachers today. With millions of children still out of school, and with most in-school children getting a poor quality of education across the country, we need more teachers — more motivated and committed teachers — and a lot more teacher training to ensure better content knowledge as well as a sound understanding of optimal pedagogical strategies. We also need much better policies for management and regulation of teaching, and effective feedback loops to ensure things keep improving. In this context, DARE-RC offers an interesting model for developing the capacity needed for such work. I hope education departments will not only look at the outcomes of the research studies being done under DARE-RC, but also at how the research capacity being built can be strengthened and deepened beyond the programme. This is important if we are to ensure our policies improve over time.

Faisal Karim Kundi

• KP governor wants PTI founder to be shifted to prison in other city or province• Says PTI workers’ daily protests near jail ‘continuous source of inconvenience’
CHINIOT: Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday demanded that the government shift incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan to a prison in another city or province, as party activists, due to their daily protests near Adiala jail, had become a continuous source of inconvenience.
“Whenever any foreign dignitary arrives, PTI workers either threaten to shut down Islamabad and Peshawar or stage long protest processions in the federal capital,” he said while addressing a press co­­nference at Rajoa House in Chin­iot, where he had arrived to condo­­le with PPP Central Punjab Gen­e­ral Secretary Syed Hassan Murt­aza over the death of his father.

 

He added that after Pakistan’s success in a clash with New Delhi in May, the country had earned respect within the global community. “Heads of state are visiting Pakistan to strengthen trade ties, but foreign dignitaries are forced to put up with protests by PTI workers,” he continued.
“Even those who come from KP to Islamabad for shopping go to Adiala Jail to have their names registered on the list of those who hold press conferences outside the jail,” he added.
“I therefore request the chief minister [Maryam Nawaz] to shift him to any other jail in Punjab or another province for the protection of other prisoners and to ease the lives of the people of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.”
Mr Kundi maintained that the entire KP government, including its chief minister, visited Adiala jail instead of working for the betterment of the people of the province.
“They stage ‘shows’ there and disturb the lives of people living in and travelling through the area,” he said.
He complained that the Punjab government was not implementing the jail manual, and providing gym and other facilities to Mr Khan that were not available to any other prisoner in the country.
Illegal Afghan immigrants
He welcomed the KP government’s policy shift to send illegal Afghan immigrants and refugees back to their homeland.
He said Pakistan hosted millions of Afghans during the war and now it was time for them to return. “Whenever there is a terrorist activity or an attack on a sensitive installation, Afghan terrorists are found to be involved,” he claimed.
To a question about the ‘Minus Imran Khan’ formula, the KP governor said many PTI leaders themselves wanted to sideline him and keep him in prison so that their businesses could continue.
On the 28th Amendment, he said the amendment was a reality; however, its contents had not been shared with the PPP leadership. “We supported the 26th and 27th Amendments and will support future ones if they are needed for the sake of the country,” he said.
He said that the National Accountability Bureau had become a tool for “kidnap for ransom”, as it arrested corrupt individuals and allowed them to walk away scot-free after paying money through plea bargains.
Mr Kundi claimed that most KP Assembly members were proclaimed offenders and wanted by Islamabad police. He questioned why the police were not arresting them. “The Islamabad police must arrest them when they roam the streets of Islamabad,” he said.
He said PTI was moving ahead with “imported leaders” like Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas becau­­se the party lacked any person to run its parliamentary affairs.

“They underestimated our military power and thought we will not react. They never expected a befitting response,” he said while speaking at a seminar here.
The seminar was organised by an overseas Pakistanis group led by Barrister Shehzada Hayat, in collaboration with the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PESS), headed by Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum to pay homage to Pakistan’s martyrs, express solidarity with the armed forces, and commemorate the 149th birth anniversary of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
The former air chief said the telling response by Pakistan shattered the myth of “shining India”. He chided India for blaming Chinese help to Pakistan for its failure saying “If we have Chinese JF-17 aircraft, you also have Rafale jets.

Overseas Pakistanis’ contribution to national economy praised

He made it clear that Chinese pilots did not come to fight with India during the four-day tension between the two South Asian nuclear powers.
Highlighting the importance of air power, he referred to founding father of Pakistan Quaid-i-Azam’s remarks that a nation without a strong air force is at the mercy of any aggressor.
Air Marshal Aman said wars were not just about aircraft and tanks and stressed the key role of support assets. He stressed that air power and technology-driven capabilities have become central to modern national security.
Emphasising institutional development, education, and indigenous capability, he underlined the importance of linking research, operations and innovation.
He cautioned that Pakistan must prioritise its national interest and avoid involvement in others’ wars. He also stressed the need for embracing smaller provinces and honouring those who rendered sacrifices for the country.
Federal Minister for Investment and Chairman of Board of Investment,Qaiser Sheikh, said the event reflected Pakistan’s core values of sacrifice, unity and resilience.
He paid tribute to martyrs and lauded the armed forces for safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and stability.
The minister emphasised the role of overseas Pakistanis as economic contributors and goodwill ambassadors, reaffirming the government’s commitment to improving investor confidence and promoting Pakistan as an attractive investment destination.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum highlighted the contributions of overseas Pakistanis to the country’s economy, calling them Pakistan’s ambassadors and an economic lifeline.

In compliance with the court’s directions, officials posted summons notices at prominent public locations and within Judicial Complex.
The proclamations specifically ask Sohail Afridi, Meena Khan, Amjad Khan, Shafiullah Jan, and Amjad Afridi to appear before the court immediately to face ongoing legal proceedings.
The court took action under Section 87 of the Anti-Terrorism Act after noting the suspects were “continuously avoiding court appearances and not complying with earlier summons”.

Officials post summon notices at judicial complex, public places in Islamabad

The court stated in its order that the defendants’ repeated absence left the bench with “no option but to initiate proclamation proceedings”.
The court has granted the group a final opportunity to surrender. The notices warned that if the accused fail to appear during the proceedings under Section 87, the court “will proceed with further legal action in accordance with the law”.
The case stems from an FIR registered in connection with a Nov 26 protest, in which the chief minister and the other named individuals were nominated as accused.
Earlier on Dec 17, ATC Judge Abual Mohammad Hasnat Zulqarnain initiated proceedings to declare CM Afridi, provincial minister Meena Khan Afridi and Shafiullah Jan Iqbal Afridi as proclaimed offenders for repeatedly failing to appear before the court.
During the hearing, none of the accused appeared despite repeated summons. Taking notice of their continuous absence, the court initiated proclamation proceedings against all three and adjourned the hearing.
A case has been registered against CM Afridi and others at Ramna police station over their alleged involvement in the November 26 protest.
Earlier, the same court had initiated similar proceedings against the chief minister and other accused in another case registered at Noon police station.

IS-K is a branch of the Islamic State terrorist organisation active in Central and South Asia, according to the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
The UN’s 16th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team noted that IS-K’s ability to operate in the region had been degraded as a result of high-profile arrests by Pakistan, such as that of Azzam from the border region this May.
The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said that Azzam was arrested by intelligence agencies during an operation near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
The APP report claimed that following his arrest, IS-K propaganda arms, such as the Al-Azaim Foundation, had suffered a major blow.
“Overall, the capability of [IS-K] has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations,” the UN report read. “Key [IS-K] commanders and ideologues have been neutralised, and the numbers of [IS-K] fighters have likely been reduced. Several plotted attacks have been disrupted.”
It further noted that IS-K’s capability to operate freely on both sides of the border has been disrupted, but acknowledged that Kabul’s claims of no terrorist groups operating in or from their soil are “not credible”.
“The Taliban contend that no terrorist groups operate in or from Afghanistan,” the report read. “Member state reporting, however, indicates that a range of terrorist groups still operate in the country, with varying degrees of autonomy and oversight from Taliban authorities.”
It added: “In North Afghanistan and areas close to the Pakistani borders, [IS-K] is reported to have indoctrinated children in madressahs, establishing a suicide training course for minors around 14 years of age.”
In a December 8 letter, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, requested that the report be brought to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC).
Who is Azzam?
The UNSC says that Azzam held the position of IS-K spokesperson since the group first established itself in Afghanistan in 2015. Islamabad-based platform The Khorasan Diary stated that he is the group’s second-in-command, while the European Council says he operated their media branch, Al-Azaim Media.
Shan A Zain wrote for Jamestown Foundation’s Militant Leadership Monitor journal that Azzam was born in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province and, before becoming IS-K’s chief propagandist, worked for at least three local radio stations and wrote books and poetry.
His major work, Travelers of the Maze, tells the purported stories of IS fighters living in the Spin Ghar mountains, according to Zain. Excerpts were shared over Telegram by would-be recruits.
“Sultan Aziz Azzam has been credited with recruiting IS members to carry out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan,” Zain wrote. “He has written several books and articles narrating stories about [fighters] in order to inspire people to join IS ranks.”
“As [IS-K’s] spokesperson, Azam has played an instrumental role in spreading ISIL’s violent … ideology, glorifying and justifying terrorist acts,” the UNSC’s website reads.
“Building on his former experience as an Afghan journalist, his activity as [IS-K’s] spokesperson has increased [IS-K’s] visibility and influence among its followers.”
Azzam claimed responsibility on behalf of IK-K for an August 26, 2021, suicide attack near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul and circulated messages from the group following the assassination of three female journalists on March 2, 2021 and a prison attack in Jalalabad on August 3, 2020.
Previous action against IS-K in Pakistan
In June this year, then-United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism, citing the nation’s struggle against IS-K among other actors.
“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
“They have extradited back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.
In November, a key IS-K commander was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn.
Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.</p><small>2025-12-19 02:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/190812211b7a962.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961907/pti-sit-ins-prompt-heightened-security-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>PTI sit-ins prompt heightened security outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>• 1,200 policemen, anti-riot personnel deployed; number of pickets increased• Party leaders return without visiting Imran after being barred by prison authorities
RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: As the PTI staged two sit-ins outside the jail in as many weeks, the Punjab government has deployed more than 1,200 police officials, installed additional pickets, and deployed anti-riot police in the vicinity of Adiala jail, in an apparent bid to pre-empt such protests.
Separately, the jail authorities also barred the PTI leaders, including KP’s former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who had arrived in Rawalpindi to meet their incarcerated party chief, Imran Khan.
According to the Islamabad High Court, Mr Khan can have two weekly meetings with his family and party leaders, but the authorities have routinely restricted such visits, much to the PTI’s chagrin. Last Tuesday, the PTI leaders staged a protest, which was dispersed by police with water cannons after midnight.
In a seemingly pre-emptive measure that would dissuade protesters from congregating outside the prison, protective measures around the jail have now been strengthened.
Besides more than 1200 police personnel, including the Elite Force and women police, four police squads have been put on standby for emergencies. The police will be equipped with rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and other anti-riot tools.
Similarly, one police picket was established at the jail’s gate and the second was established at Gate 5, while two pickets were set up at the Gorakhpur Road and near the Shaighan Factory. The area was also inspected by the Special Branch personnel and the bomb disposal squad for security measures.
In addition, traffic police wardens, remained on patrol in the area to keep the flow of traffic smooth during the proceedings of cases inside the jail. On Thursday, about 25 PTI supporters, including MPAs, visited the jail but returned empty-handed.
PTI leaders return without meeting
The PTI leaders, after spending a couple of hours outside the prison, returned after the jail administration did not allow them to meet Mr Khan. Talking to Dawn, Mr Jhagra said that the PTI leaders reached Adiala after 2pm and started waiting for permission to meet Imran Khan. He said the police told them they had no orders to allow them to enter the jail. “We waited there till 4:30pm and then decided to leave,” he said.
PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr, Liaqat Ali Khan, and Taimur Khan Jhagra, had come to meet Imran Khan but they were denied permission. This time, the PTI did not give the name of KP CM Sohail Afridi for the meeting.
Speaking to media outside the prison, he warned the ‘powers that be’ to beware of the day when things would go out of the hands of the party and people would take things into their own hands and take to the streets. Mr Jhagra said that government functionaries were claiming, while giving interviews to foreign media, including Sky News, that 870 meetings with Mr Khan had been allowed.
“However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed but not a single meeting between Imran Khan and his political friends has been allowed. Party leaders arrive here every week, but they are not allowed to meet Imran. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, Imran’s relatives have been allowed to meet him just once or twice,” he said.







To a question, Mr Jhagra said the major issue was that only Imran Khan’s narrative had credibility while the hybrid system has no credibility.
To another query, he said it was unfortunate that an ATA case was registered against peaceful protesters.
“We have been trying to convince the global community that we are fighting a war against terrorism, but cases of terrorism are being registered against PTI workers. How can we convince the world that we are against terrorism,” he wondered.
When asked why Sohail Afridi had not come, Mr Jhagra said that the KP CM has a double responsibility. “He is running the province, along with making efforts to secure the release of Imran Khan. He holds a cabinet meeting every week,” he said.
To a question about why the PTI was not giving a call for street agitation, he said that it was also the responsibility of the party to protect the lives of workers and not expose them to bullets.

ISLAMABAD: No decision has been taken yet on contributing troops to the planned International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, seeking to quell renewed speculation about Washington’s pressure on Islamabad for joining the mission.
“About Pakistan’s participation in the ISF, we have not taken a decision to participate in ISF as yet,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
ISF forms a key component of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, a 20-point framework announced in September that facilitated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in October.
On Nov 17, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution, with Russia and China abstaining, endorsing the plan and authorising the establishment of the ISF as a temporary multinational force to support security, demilitarisation, and reconstruction in Gaza. Pakistan had supported the resolution.
The FO spokesperson’s clarification on Pakistan’s possible contribution to ISF came amid growing conjecture that the Trump administration is stepping up pressure on Pakistan to commit troops to the force.
Those reports were fuelled by a Reuters report, which claimed that Field Marshal Asim Munir — in his capacity as both army chief and chief of defence forces — was expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks for talks with President Trump, with the Gaza stabilisation force likely to feature prominently on the agenda.
Asked about the report, Mr Andrabi was initially noncommittal on whether such a visit was in the works. When pressed, he pushed back against the suggestion that the trip had been finalised.
“On the visit of the chief of army staff/chief of defence forces, as reported by Reuters, I can contradict the Reuters story in its essence that it seemed to suggest that the visit has been planned and there is a finality about it. So, I am contradicting that,” he said.
“We would wait for an official announcement from the government of Pakistan in the event of such a visit. Our political and military leadership visits different capitals, and when an official visit is organised, an official announcement is made prior to it, which in this case, has not been made.”
Meanwhile, the White House also said that no meeting had been scheduled. “This is not on the President’s calendar at this time,” a White House official said on background, responding to an Arab News query about a possible Trump-Munir meeting.
On the ISF itself, Mr Andrabi said discussions were continuing internationally but emphasised that Pakistan had not received any formal request to deploy troops.
“The discussion on ISF is ongoing in certain capitals. I am not aware of any specific requests made to Pakistan to send troops. As stated, we have not taken any decision on this subject as yet,” he said.
The spokesman’s remarks appeared to contrast with earlier comments by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who had said Pakistan was ready “in principle” to contribute to the force, subject to clarity on its mandate and terms of reference.
“We are definitely ready to contribute to the force; the prime minister has in principle already announced after consultation with the field marshal that we will contribute, but this decision cannot be taken until it is decided what its (ISF) mandate and TOR (terms of reference) will be,” Mr Dar said a few weeks ago.
Mr Dar had also drawn a red line over any role involving disarmament of Hamas. “We are not ready for that (disarmament of Hamas). This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said, adding that Indonesia had expressed similar reservations.
Dar noted that Indonesia had offered 20,000 troops and that PM Shehbaz Sharif had signalled that Pakistan would positively consider participation in principle.
It may be noted that the US Central Command hosted a conference in Qatar on Tuesday with dozens of partner countries to discuss ISF’s command structure and other unresolved operational issues. Pakistan was among nearly 45 countries attending the meeting.
The US State Department has formally approached more than 70 countries seeking troops or funding for the proposed force. Some 19 countries have reportedly so far indicated willingness to assist through troops, logistics, or equipment, with international deployment in Gaza potentially beginning as early as next month.

In a post on X, PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib said he met SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad and discussed issues related to digital asset adoption, the implementation of central bank digital currency and Pakistan’s regulatory road­­map for digital assets.







President Zardari promulgated the Pakistan Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025 on July 8, 2025, with the stated objective of licensing, regulating and supervising virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.
Pakistan has since set up PVARA to regulate virtual-asset and blockchain-related activities.
Separately, the Ministry of Finance has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Binance, a global blockchain and digital-asset technology company, to explore potential collaboration, including tokenisation initiatives.

State Bank reserves jump to $15.9bn after IMF disbursement

In a post on Wednesday, Binance said Pakistan had signed an MoU to explore tokenising up to $2bn in state-owned assets.
Under the arrangement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the initiative could involve blockchain-based distribution of Pakistan’s sovereign bonds, treasury bills and commodity reserves, including oil, gas and metals.

 

He described the MoU as a signal of Pakistan’s reform trajectory, adding that the “next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality”.
Pakistan’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has also issued preliminary clearances to Binance and HTX to begin local licensing processes. The no-objection certificates allow the exchanges to register on the country’s anti-money laundering system and prepare full licence applications, but do not permit them to operate at this stage.
Binance founder Chang­­peng Zhao, who serves as a strategic adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council, described the MoU as “a great signal” for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan, and said it marked the beginning of a move towards full deployment of the tokenisation initiative.
Mr Saqib has said Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest crypto market by retail activity, with an estimated 40 million users and annual trading volume exceeding $300bn.
In July, the SBP governor said the central bank planned to launch a pilot for a digital currency and was finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government sought to modernise the financial system.
SBP reserves hit $15.9bn
State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves rose to $15.886bn following the receipt of $1.2bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to central bank data released on Thursday.
The SBP said that during the week ended Dec 12, its foreign exchange reserves increased by $1.3bn to $15.886bn, mainly due to the receipt of SDR 914 million (equivalent to about $1.2bn) from the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility.
The country’s total liquid foreign reserves stood at $21.089bn, including $5.202bn of net foreign reserves held by commercial banks.

ISLAMABAD: Develop­ment spending under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) remained subdued in the first five months of the current fiscal year, with utilisation amounting to just 9.2 per cent of the Rs1 trillion annual allocation amid fiscal rationing to meet the IMF’s contingency measures for growing revenue shortfall.
“Development spending remained modest, with Rs92 billion utilised against Rs196bn sanctioned, led mainly by infrastructure,” the Ministry of Planning and Development said in its Monthly Development Outlook (December 2025). It added that foreign-funded projects showed relatively better utilisation, with Rs12.8bn spent out of Rs25.1bn sanctioned.
At Rs92bn, the July-November utilisation was 20pc lower than the Rs115bn spent in the same period last year. The ministry attributed the slowdown to “significant reduction in expenditure by provinces, special areas and the Ministry of Railways”.
The government has given a written commitment to the IMF for contingency measures as part of the recent $1.2bn disbursement, as a five-month revenue shortfall touched Rs430bn.
According to the undertaking, if Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collections continue to lag in the second quarter of FY26, and other tax receipts fail to bridge the gap, the government will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase the federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the Eighth Schedule of the sales tax regime to the general GST framework.
“If by the end of the second quarter of FY26, there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26,” it added.
The report said ministries and divisions were sanctioned Rs196bn for the five-month period, against which Rs92bn was reported as expenditure.
The low release and utilisation of development funds come despite a 1.6pc budget surplus in the first quarter of the fiscal year, driven by elevated State Bank profits and petroleum levy collections, and as the government has sought to close hundreds of projects to focus resources on strategically important schemes at advanced stages of development for their early completion.

 

A sector-wise expenditure breakdown showed that the infrastructure sector had been allocated Rs626.767bn (63pc) in FY26, of which Rs55.238bn had been utilised till Nov 30. Within infrastructure, the transport and communication sector received the highest allocation of Rs333.484bn, which posted an expenditure of Rs30.433bn.
The energy sector and physical planning and housing sector recorded an expenditure of Rs3.52bn and Rs7bn against allocations of Rs122.653bn and Rs72.725bn, respectively. This meant the energy sector consumed less than 3pc in five months, while physical planning and housing utilised 9.6pc.
The water sector, with an allocation of Rs98bn, reported an expenditure of Rs14.281bn (14.6pc) in five months.
The utilisation was relatively better in the social sector. It was allocated Rs169.309bn (17pc) in the budget, wherein Rs60.75bn was allocated for the education sector, including higher education, which spent an amount of Rs12.292bn.
The health and nutrition sector utilised Rs211 million against an allocation of Rs16.8bn, accounting for only 1.25pc in five months. Furthermore, Rs21.7bn was allocated for “Others”, of which only Rs2.122bn (9.8pc) could be utilised in five months.
The budget entailed an allocation of Rs11.167bn to promote transparency and good governance and to provide an enabling environment for investors, but only Rs1.015bn could be utilised in five months.
The science and information technology sector recorded an expenditure of Rs3.619bn as of mid-December against an allocation of Rs37.586bn, accounting for 9.6pc.
The food and agriculture sector spent Rs605m against its allocation of Rs5.1bn, while the industrial sector utilised Rs227m against Rs2.856bn and stood at 11.8pc and 7.9pc, respectively.
The report said the PSDP portfolio comprised 86 foreign-funded projects with a total foreign cost component of Rs4.2tr, of which 15 projects are fully foreign-funded, while the remaining 61 projects are implemented with counterpart local funding.
It said a PSDP review was conducted from Nov 10-12 to assess financial and physical progress on the ongoing development portfolio. The executing agencies revealed that Rs90bn had been utilised during the first quarter, and 313 projects were expected to be completed this fiscal year.
It said the government had decided to prioritise fast-moving schemes, strengthen project execution and ensure timely allocations to maximise development impact. The report said Pakistan’s economic and development outlook was optimistic, supported by stronger fiscal management, moderating inflation and resilient remittance inflows.
“The development trajectory is steadily improving as high-priority initiatives in health, education, infrastructure, energy and governance are enhancing economic efficiency and social impact,” it said.
Under the mechanism announced by the Ministry of Finance for the current fiscal year, the government should release 15pc of budgeted allocation in the first quarter, followed by 20pc in the second quarter, 25pc in the third and the remaining 40pc in the last.

A division bench led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan issued the judgment, which was reserved earlier today, on a plea that challenged the legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree and appointment as a judge.
Political figures and lawyers came out and assailed the IHC ruling, stating that the “case and bench had no merit to be heard”, while standing in solidarity with Jahangiri.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan called Jahangiri’s removal an “unprecedented and troubling move” in a post on X.
“I take strong exception to the order. It further erodes judicial independence,” he wrote. “The constitutional oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution becomes meaningless if judges are unable to protect and defend themselves within their own court.”
Gohar noted that this was not the first case in which judges have been unceremoniously removed from their offices, but urged that this be the last one. He also demanded the restoration of Justice Jahangiri.







PTI lawyer Naeem Haider Panjhuta took to X and said that Jahangiri ‘s “degree became fake” when he “refused to open three constituencies”.
“Under Article 209 of the Constitution, only the Supreme Judicial Council has the authority to remove any judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court,” Panjhuta wrote.
“Not a judge of any high Court, and that judge must be one whose seniority has been challenged by the affected judge, who is sitting in the light of the 26th Amendment.”







In a post on X, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir lamented that an “ honest and brave judge was sent home for upholding his oath.
“This is a stain that cannot be erased. This is the result of the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh amendments,” she wrote. “If the lawyers let the lion of the judiciary become a martyr today, then tomorrow, when everyone’s turn comes in the jungle, no one should complain. Such a country cannot function.”
She added that lawyers need to come out onto the streets in protest of the ruling.
“In what words will the judges of this division bench be remembered? Everyone knows.”







Lawyer Hadi Ali Chatta, who is married to Imaan, also expressed solidarity with Jahangiri in a post on X
“Justice Jahangiri will remain ever alive, but those who attacked him will keep hiding their cowardly faces.”







Digital activist Usama Khilji also condemned the removal of Justice Jahangir, writing: “Bit by bit, whatever good is left in the judiciary in Pakistan is being completely dismantled — [the] question is how long will we continue to let this happen to us?”







Barrister Ahsan J Pirzada said that there was no “legal, ethical or constitutional justification for the ‘transferred’ judges of Islamabad High Court to hear or decide [the] manufactured case against honourable Justice Jahangiri”.
“This just goes to show how rotten the system has become, on one hand, 16 years old son of a ‘transferred’ judge can get away with killing two young women and on the other hand, the ‘transferred’ judges are absolutely comfortable and willing to humiliate their own institution by playing a role which is both questionable & unconstitutional,” he wrote, referring to an incident in which two women were killed by a car allegedly driven by an IHC justice’s son.

“The president has approved the de-notification of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri as [a] judge, IHC, on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC verdict and in accordance with the Constitution and law,” a statement from the President’s Secretariat said.







The development came hours after the an IHC division bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar ruled on Thursday that Justice Jahangiri’s elevation to the superior court “without lawful authority” and that he “ceased to hold” the office of the IHC judge forthwith.
The bench, which also included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, issued the judgement, which was reserved earlier in the day, on a plea that challenged the legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree and appointment as a judge.
A short written order of the court, available with Dawn, said at the time of Justice Jahangiri’s appointment as an additional judge of the IHC, “as well as at the time of his confirmation as a judge of the IHC, he was not holding a valid LLB degree, which is a prerequisite for enrolment as an advocate”.
“When he could not be considered as an advocate, then consequently he was not eligible for elevation as a judge of a high court in terms of the requirements of Article 175-A of the Constitution,” it added.
On the basis of this observation, the court ruled that Justice Jahangiri’s elevation to the IHC was “without lawful authority, as he was not eligible to be elevated as a judge of a high court”.
“Thus, he ceased to hold the office of the judge of the IHC forthwith.”
The court had also directed the law ministry to denotify him as a judge of the IHC. “All the pending miscellaneous applications are also disposed of,” it added.
The bench’s decision came a day after Justice Jahangiri accused CJ Dogar of being “biased” against him and requested the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to set aside the recent IHC decision to hear a petition challenging his law degree. The same day, he also filed a formal complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — against the chief justice.
The hearing
Prior to the issuance of the judgment, University of Karachi (KU) Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted a record of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree to the court.
He said the KU syndicate had cancelled the judge’s degree for having been “secured through unfair means”.
“Justice Jahangiri was found cheating and creating disturbance in an examination hall in 1988,” following which he was debarred from sitting an exam until 1992, he said.
However, instead of complying with the decision, the judge appeared in an exam in 1989 under a changed name, the registrar alleged.
He also submitted a log pertaining to marksheets and results to justify the KU syndicate’s decision.
During his arguments, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, who was representing Justice Jahangiri, objected to the bench hearing the case.
He contended that a judge who faced legal proceedings could not hear the petition involving a fellow judge, who had challenged his posting.
In July, Justice Jahagiri, along with four other IHC judges, had filed an intra-court appeal against the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges requested the SC not to consider Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they took fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The intra-court appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Constitutional Amendment and eventually dismissed for non-prosecution.
Sheikh’s argument today seemed to be referring to this matter.
He also highlighted that the Sindh High Court (SHC) had issued a stay order in connection with the matter, arguing that the IHC bench should not hear the case.
This, seemingly, was a reference ot the SHC order suspending the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree by the KU syndicate.
Barrister Salahuddin Ahmad, who was also representing Justice Jahangiri, requested more time from the court to submit a reply.
For his part, the petitioner in the case, lawyer Mian Dawood, alleged that Justice Jahangiri had “misused” the SHC stay order. “Instead of clearing his name […] the judge has been filing petitions and scandalising his chief justice,” he commented.
According to the court’s short written order, the bench observed that it had given “ample opportunity” to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply along with disputed education credentials, “but he failed to do so for the reasons best known to him”.
“As such, this court has left with no other option but to proceed further in the matter.”
The court also observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge “is personal to the individual and has no nexus with the performance of duties as a court or as a member of the court”.
“The qualifications for appointment of judges of the superior courts are duly provided in the Constitution. Possession of the qualifications prescribed under the Constitution is sine qua non (requirement) for an individual to hold the office of a judge of a superior court,” it said.
The court order further stated that during the case’s proceedings, it had heard arguments from counsel for the contesting parties, the representatives of the Islamabad Bar Council, IHC and Islamabad District Bar Associations, and perused the record with their able assistance.
Eventually, the court uniitiaaly reserved its judgement in the case on Thursday and removed Justice Jahangiri from his office.
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the KU controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the SJC last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by Dawood.
The controversy followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
After the IHC resumed the case’s proceedings, the Higher Education Commi­ssion (HEC) submitted a detailed report to the court on December 8, endorsing KU’s findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
The HEC claimed it had never verified Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at any stage, nor had the judge ever approached the commission for verification.
At the next hearing on December 9, the court declared Dawood’s plea maintainable.
Another notable development in the case came on December 15, when Justice Jahangiri appeared before the court in person, presented arguments in his defence and raised objections on the division hearing his case. He expressed a lack of confidence in the bench on the ground that he had filed an intra-court appeal CJ Dogar.
He also took exception to the “haste” in which the proceedings were being held and criticised the earlier IHC directive barring him from work.
The court, however, dimissed his objections.
On December 17 — a day before Thursday’s hearing — Justice Jahangiri moved a plea through senior counsel Uzair Karamat Bhandari in the FCC, requesting it to set aside the Dec 9 order that declared Dawood’s plea maintainable.
The FCC was told that CJ Dogar was biased against Justice Jahangiri and therefore disqualified from hearing any matter relating to his appointment. Justice Jahangiri recalled in the petition that he had already challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC, followed by his elevation as IHC CJ and in these circumstances judicial propriety required that the IHC chief justice should not preside over proceedings concerning the writ of quo warranto.
Separately, Justice Jahangiri also filed a formal complaint against his boss, IHC CJ Dogar, before the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution, accusing him of misconduct, bias, and violation of the Code of Conduct for Judges in relation to proceedings concerning the legitimacy of his degree and appointment.
According to the complaint, while the matter was sub judice, the IHC chief justice discussed the pending case with Justice Jahangiri and advised him, both directly and indirectly, to resign from office. Justice Jahangiri asserted that such conduct alone disqualified Justice Dogar from hearing the case.
The complaint alleged that during these discussions, the chief justice acknowledged that “tremendous pressure” was being exerted on him to decide the matter expeditiously and against Justice Jahangiri. It was claimed that Justice Dogar suggested that if he were to submit a post-dated resignation and hand it over to him for ‘safe-keeping’, it would help placate those exerting pressure and allow proceedings to be delayed.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.
He was also among the five IHC judges who submitted separate petitions at the SC together in September against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.</p><small>2025-12-19 02:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18202809e0bc2b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961827/sudden-variation-in-chenab-rivers-flow-affects-wheat-other-crops-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Sudden variation in Chenab River’s flow affects wheat, other crops in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>As the Foreign Office sought clarification from India via a letter over a sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow, the situation is badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab.
“The situation is really disturbing as the Chenab River’s control from upstream (India) is being handled by the Indian authorities through various run-of-the-river hydropower projects,” a senior official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said while speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity.
“When India releases the water from dams towards downstream (Pakistan) without informing us, the flow suddenly increases. Sometimes, they hold water for days, reducing flow massively,” he said.
He continued, “Once the river inflows recorded at Marala reduced to 1,500 cusecs, leaving us with no option but to stop outflows.”
“The situation is very serious and strange for us, as the growers, in several villages, couldn’t water wheat crops due to the lack of water flow they used to receive through various canals.”
According to daily reports of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks was found to be alarming from December 9-18.
The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on December 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on December 10.
No outflows were monitored from Dec. 11-17, with 3,700 cusecs of inflows on Dec. 11, 3,800 on Dec. 12, 3,000 on Dec. 13, 2,000 on Dec. 14, 2,000 on Dec. 15, 1,800 on Dec. 16 and 3,800 on Dec. 17.
Ameer Langra, a local grower of Mauza Sahib Langra from Baqir Pur Union Council, Kabirwala, Khanewal, told Dawn, they face difficulty irrigating the wheat crop and have to purchase water from tube well owners when there is no water in designated channels.
“Sometimes, we see a sudden rise in water courses, while other times the respective canals and water courses don’t receive a single drop of water,” he said, adding that a large number of growers weren’t able to water their crops fully.
“It is affecting the main and other crops as well.”
Langra told Dawn that his area was already facing water scarcity due to the closure of a large number of tube wells after the recent floods swept them away.
“We appeal to the government to help us and ensure water availability to save our farming.”
Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokar, while speaking to Dawn, condemned the Indian government for water aggression and termed it a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty.
“Many cultivators have complained about variations in water levels in the river and its impact on the agricultural activities,” he said, requesting the government to take up the issue with India and international forums.
FO seeks clarification from India
Earlier today, in a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi shared that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting the matter had been in the news in the past week.
Several media outlets reported this week that India had released water into the Chenab River.
“Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” Andrabi said.
“Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said.
“Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said.
“We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said.
He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”.
“The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said.
“Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said.
In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
Removal of Indian woman’s hijab
During his press briefing, the FO spokesperson also talked about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pulling down a female doctor’s hijab this week, a move which had invited criticism.
Noting the incident, Andrabi said that the incident was followed by the “public mocking” of a minister from Uttar Pradesh. A minister from Uttar Pradesh had defended Kumar, before backtracking.
“The forcible removal of the Muslim woman’s hijab by a senior political leader and subsequent public ridicule of this act are deeply disturbing and warrant strong condemnation,” he said.
“The action risks normalising the humiliation of Muslim women in India. The conduct also demonstrates public disrespect of India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslim citizens,” he said.
“Such conduct reflects a broader and troubling pattern associated with Hindutva-inspired politics, namely the alarming rise of religious intolerance and Islamophobia,” he added.
“We urge all responsible stakeholders and the Indian government to recognise the seriousness of this incident and to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of minority rights, respect for religious freedom, and the preservation of human dignity,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-18 22:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18235404917032e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961864/domestic-worker-allegedly-tortured-by-suspect-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Domestic worker allegedly tortured by suspect in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>A domestic worker was allegedly beaten by a man in Karachi earlier this week, it emerged on Thursday.
According to a first information report filed at Gabol Town police station — dated December 13 and available with Dawn — the complainant stated that she was working as a cleaner at a private residence when she got into an argument with the suspect on December 10.
“On December 11, when I finished working at a house, the suspect came and started beating me as I was descending some stairs,” she alleged. “He pushed me down the stairs while verbally abusing me.”
The complainant further alleged that bystanders also beat her, leaving her with facial and internal injuries.
According to the FIR, the suspect who initially assaulted the complainant was booked under Sections 337A (punishment for assault), 354 (assault or criminal force to [a] woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).
After a video of the incident went viral, Sindh Minister for Women’s Development, Shahina Sher Ali, took stern notice of the incident and sought details from police, a statement from her office said.
“The provincial minister directed the police to conduct an immediate and transparent inquiry into the condemnable incident,” the statement read
“In the video, the accused is clearly subjecting the woman to the worst torture,” Sher Ali was quoted as saying. “Whatever the motives of the incident, physical violence against the woman will not be tolerated under any circumstances and the suspect should be arrested immediately and severely punished.”
Last week, seven foreign nationals were booked for assaulting local women and trespassing into a slum in Islamabad, located a kilometre away from Golra Police Station.
The case was registered under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 354 and 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), on a complaint lodged by Mohammad Khan, a resident of the slum at Chora Stop near the police station.
The police said the foreign nationals forcefully entered the slum, which comprises huts and began making videos of the women living there.</p><small>2025-12-18 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18214826d3f9022.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961862/study-reveals-rampant-labour-rights-abuses-in-textile-factories-across-karachi-and-faislabad' target='_blank'><strong>Study reveals ‘rampant’ labour rights abuses in textile factories across Karachi and Faislabad</strong></a><br><p>A new study has revealed that labour rights abuses remained rampant in major textile factories in major production hubs — Karachi and Faisalabad — manufacturing healthcare exports to Europe.

The 52-page study was conducted collaboratively by Swedwatch and local organisations, including AwazCDS-Pakistan and NowCommunities, building on testimonies of textile factory workers from Karachi and Faisalabad, where it revealed rampant labour rights violations, enabled by weak enforcement of EU procurement rules and labour laws.
It revealed that using social audits and certifications as a way of ensuring compliance “repeatedly fail to capture or remedy these violations, raising serious concerns about their efficacy.”
At the outset of the report launch in Karachi today, Executive Director NowCommunities, Farhat Parveen, outlined the issues faced by workers in both informal and formal sectors in Pakistan, including their absence from consensus, lack of social protection, maternity benefits, occupational health and safety, and dire working conditions, noting that limited legislation exists within the country to address their issues.
AwazCDS-Pakistan founder Zia-ur-Rehman detailed that the scope of the study centred around “the textile sector, particularly products exported to the EU and the situation of labour rights at the lowest tier of the supply chain.”
European states such as Sweden, in this case, rely heavily on textile healthcare imports from Pakistan, the report said, highlighting issues within the supply chain process.
“The study was conducted in two districts across nine textile mills, which export to Sweden in Faisalabad and Karachi. The aim was to examine the labour conditions, environmental codes, whether health and safety are taken into consideration, fair wages, and the right to unionisation.”
He explained that the study was based on focus group discussions, which engaged around 98 factory workers.
The report noted that the textile industry around the world was “particularly vulnerable to labour rights abuses, including low wages, precarious employment, poor working conditions, and gender-based pay gaps.”
It noted that the problem was made “pronounced” in countries like Pakistan, “where textile factories supply goods for European public contracting authorities”, including Sweden.
It noted that in textile industries in Karachi and Faisalabad, which are the major “production hubs” of the country, workers often “endure excessive hours, unsafe workplaces, lack of social protection, and an absence of formal employment contracts.”
It detailed that the abuses were “exacerbated” by the lack of enforcement of labour laws and the lack of implementation of EU procurement rules.
It noted that the rules had failed to “prevent human rights abuses” in the lower tier of production.
The study presented ten key findings across the areas of wage theft, exploitation, gender pay gap, lack of social security, and overreliance on social audits, among others.
Contractual exploitation fueling ‘rights abuse’
Rehman revealed that the workers employed at the textile factories under review in the study were not hired contractually, as a way for companies to “evade” responsibility.
He recalled that “many of the participants in the study told us that we are given a contractor’s contract, which is usually in English, and we are forced to sign it,” adding that the process was often shrouded in “secrecy.”
As per the report, “these contractors supply labour to numerous home-textile factories serving the Swedish public sector while also collaborating with other subcontractors — creating a complex web of informal employment arrangements.”
It further noted: “Although the Pakistani labour code recognises the role of private contractors in recruitment, it does not require them to ensure minimum wages or social security.
“As a result, informal contractual arrangements have come to dominate Pakistan’s labour market, enabling factory owners to bypass legal obligations and evade accountability. This system fuels widespread labour rights abuse,” it said.
Wage theft ‘pervasive’
Rehman expressed concern that the average worker at these textile factories was getting approximately Rs25,000 per month, lower than the government-mandated minimum wage of Rs37,000 as of June 2024.

According to the report, “some factories display banners at their entrance stating that workers are paid the minimum wage by the first of each month. Yet, interviews revealed that these claims are often deceptive, with workers consistently receiving much lower pay.”
The report cited the account of a 38-year-old worker with 15 years of experience in Faisalabad’s textile sector, who was earning between Rs15,000–17,000 per month.
The AwazCDS-Pakistan founder called on European countries to notify living wages for countries involved in the downstream supply.
‘Stark’ gender pay gap
The study revealed that despite women working the same hours as their male counterparts, they earned as little as Rs6,000 at times.

“Both men and women do the same kind of work [..] despite the fact that women are given lower wages than men,” Rehman said, adding that women were also not given “adequate training”.
“Most supervisory roles are given to men,” he said, quoting the participants of the study.
As per the report, “one female worker from Karachi shared [that] even when workers perform the same tasks, women and younger employees often face wage discrimination. The management claims it’s based on performance, but the bias is evident.”
‘Significant’ barriers to unionisation
The report, in its findings, revealed that unions were often “prohibited”, and the association of a worker with a union could result in “severe repercussions such as immediate dismissal.”

NowCommunities director Parveen told the participants that “employers view unions as something that is formed in opposition to them.”
She added that “even registering to form a union was extremely challenging.”
“And when they do try to unionise, they are fired,” she continued.
“According to the ITUC Global Rights Index 2024, Pakistani law lacks explicit protections against anti-union discrimination, leaving workers vulnerable to retaliation for union activities,” the report noted.
“The index ranks Pakistan among the ‘worst countries in the world to work in’, which means that while certain rights exist on paper, workers often have no real access to them, leaving them exposed to unfair labour practices,” it said.
The findings also revealed that a pattern of “overreliance on social audits”, which often failed to “detect” human rights abuses in the sector.
The report said: “factories are meticulously staged before audits take place —workspaces are cleaned, health and safety gear like masks and gloves are distributed, and banners proclaim that minimum wages are paid on time.”
However, these arrangements are only made during the audits and abandoned afterwards.
The study revealed that workers in Karachi described “how on audit days, gatekeepers bar outspoken employees from entering the factory, while entire sections may be shut down under the pretext of technical issues.”
The findings also revealed poor occupational health and safety within the factories, excessive working hours, lack of social security.
Detailing the report’s recommendations, Rehman called on the government to “align labour laws with international standards”, noting that most factory workers were not aware of the laws.
He also called for the need for women factory inspectors.
“They will see if there is discrimination against women or sexual harassment, and if the factory has a sexual harassment committee in place,” he said.
Rehman, citing the report, suggested that “it was hard for workers to lodge complaints without facing repercussions, hence some digital portal should be launched where they can report violations anonymously.”
He also noted that there was a “severe lack of available data”, stressing that the data of labour workers should be published annually.
There should be protective mechanisms for whistleblowers, the gender pay gap should be addressed, he said.
The AwazCDS-Pakistan founder called for a need for “collaboration between labour unions, federations, and NGOs” in negotiations with the state.</p><small>2025-12-18 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18213912337b534.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961860/gender-gap-among-voters-shrinks-to-71pc-from-118pc-in-2018' target='_blank'><strong>Gender gap among voters shrinks to 7.1pc from 11.8pc in 2018</strong></a><br><p>Gender gap among Pakistan’s voters reduced from 11.8 per cent in 2018 to 7.1pc in 2025, the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) Secretary Omar Hamid Khan said on Thursday.
According to the Human Rights Watch, for the February 8, 2024, elections, which saw the registration of 127 million voters, there were 10 million more men than women, showing a large gender gap in a country in which women make up 49pc of the population.
Khan shared the numbers at a board review meeting of the Pakistan Legislative, Electoral, Digital Governance and Empowerment (Pledge) project.
“Women voter registration has outpaced men’s over the past five years, with a 27pc increase in female voters as compared to 17pc for males,” Khan shared with the members of the meeting.
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative Dr Samuel Rizk, Ministry of Economic Affairs Joint Secretary Mahmood Khan and representatives from the British High Commission and European Union were in attendance.
“The progress is attributed to a targeted campaign, comprised of four phases, for registration of women’s national identity card numbers and enrollment of voters,” he said, adding the fifth phase was ongoing in 62 districts where the gap exceeded 10pc.
Citing a Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) report, Khan said the ECP “adds around 7,599 new voters daily”, according to district-wise data published on its website, “with women leading the numbers”.
The UNDP would launch activities in 15 districts to support the fifth phase of the women-led voter registration campaign, starting from January 2026, through which 25,000 women would be facilitated to get their national identity cards, he said. “This would automatically enrol them as voters.”
After consultation with the stakeholders, the commission introduced the Gender Mainstreaming and Social Inclusion Framework (GMSIF), under which the ECP joined the ranks of the region’s “prominent” electoral institutions, he said.
Citing the ECP’s spokesman, Khan said the meeting took a detailed review of the progress of various projects initiated during the last year, while the proposed strategy and priorities for the year 2026 were also considered.
With the support of the UNDP, an election monitoring and control centre, equipped with modern technology, was established, where a gender desk was also active, facilitating the affected communities, he said.
An effective presence on social media was ensured for public awareness and prevention of fake news and misinformation, while informational videos in Braille, 3D content and sign language were introduced for the specially-abled, Khan said, adding an important project was launched on the role of Artificial Intelligence in the electoral process.
He further said the turnout of young voters in the 2024 general elections increased significantly as a result of thousands of awareness sessions organised across the country to involve the youth in the electoral process.
UNDP Resident Representative presented the Pledge project’s 2025 report and lauded the efforts of the ECP, saying the UNDP considered the partnership with the commission to be of utmost importance.
Under the Pledge project, the UNDP would continue its technical assistance to the commission from 2025 to 2029, he said.</p><small>2025-12-18 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18182040fd7d4f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961848/fo-contradicts-media-reports-of-cdf-field-marshal-munir-visiting-the-us-says-no-plan-finalised' target='_blank'><strong>FO ‘contradicts’ media reports of CDF Field Marshal Munir visiting the US, says no plan finalised</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi on Thursday denied reports that Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would undertake another visit to the United States soon.
Reuters reported a day ago that Field Marshal Munir was expected to fly to Washington to meet US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks for a meeting which would likely focus on the Gaza force, according to two sources, one of whom was described as a key player in the CDF’s economic diplomacy.
Andrabi’s statement came during the FO’s weekly press briefing today in response to a question, where he contradicted the Reuters report about the visit.
“The Reuters story was showing as if the visit had been planned, and there was a finality about it. So, I am contradicting that and I’m contradicting the fact that a visit has been agreed or planned,” Andrabi said.
“The fact is that this is information that I do not have, about the timing or any future visit that might take place. We obviously will wait for an official announcement that the Government of Pakistan makes about such a visit.”
Andrabi noted that official announcements are issued ahead of official visits to foreign capitals carried out by political and military leaders and maintained that he had no information about Field Marshal Munir visiting the US.
In an answer to another question about the CDF’s possible visit, the spokesperson said: “As regards the visit of the Chief of the Army Staff and the Chief of Defence Forces, I do not have any information right now. I have seen the reports, but I have no information to share with you.”
The field marshal is currently on a visit to Libya, where he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Tripoli, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
CDF Munir has visited the US three times over this year.
In June, Field Marshal Munir undertook a visit to the US and met with President Donald Trump over luncheon, marking the first time an American president had hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
In August, the army chief visited the US again and termed his visit a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad. He also engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora.
Meanwhile, in September, Field Marshal Munir, accompanied by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, visited the White House and met Trump to discuss regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism and other matters.
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a “great leader” was coming to the White House.
“We’ve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming, and the field marshal … [he’s] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,” he told reporters.</p><small>2025-12-18 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1819345308a564f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961855/rise-in-mild-karachi-earthquakes-prompts-calls-for-disaster-preparedness' target='_blank'><strong>Rise in mild Karachi earthquakes prompts calls for disaster preparedness</strong></a><br><p>In June, consecutive tremors shook Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. Fifty-seven low-intensity quakes, measuring 1.5-3.8 on the Richter scale, were recorded on 1-25 June, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reportedly said. Several months later, October began with a 3.2-magnitude quake in Malir, a neighbourhood in the city’s north.
Karachi sits near the boundaries of three major tectonic plates, and multiple fault lines run through the city. Some 49 earthquakes with a magnitude of four or above have struck within 300 km of Karachi in the last decade.
Mild quakes can sometimes act as “natural pressure releases, potentially reducing the risk of more destructive ones”, but the frequency of these earthquakes has raised concerns among experts, said geological oceanographer and former director of the Geological Survey of Pakistan, Asif Rana.
In Karachi, mild quakes can have potentially devastating impacts on buildings that lack structural integrity. The Association of Builders and Developers stated in July that some 700 buildings have been identified in the city as not stable enough for safe habitation. This was shortly after a dilapidated building collapsed in the densely populated Lyari area with no earthquake involved, killing 27 people.
Rana warns that, in densely populated areas, even moderate tremors of magnitude 3-4 can lead to “partial or complete collapse of vulnerable old buildings”.
Amid these dangers, experts say more needs to be done to improve structural resilience and disaster preparedness in Karachi. They have in mind a more powerful earthquake. “If a repeat of the 1945 event, the magnitude of which was 8.1, occurs near the Makran triple junction, much of coastal Karachi could be devastated,” noted Moin Raza Khan, an oil, gas and minerals exploration expert, on LinkedIn.
The Makran triple junction lies between the Eurasian, Indian and Arabian plates, which Karachi is located around 150 km from.
What makes Karachi’s buildings vulnerable?
Experts say buildings in Karachi are endangered by even mild earthquakes due to their unregulated construction, with instability being exacerbated by land subsidence.
Rapid urban development and construction are key reasons for the subsidence, notes Seema Naz Siddiqui, a retired professor of geology.
Before construction commences, groundwater, which supports the underground layers of soil and rock by filling the spaces between them, is pumped out to make the excavation area dry and stable.
Much of Karachi’s soils are already weak, being water-saturated and compressible sediments prone to liquefaction, noted Moin Raza Khan in an opinion piece for the Business Recorder. The excavation and piling from the subsequent construction disturb subsurface layers, explains hydrogeologist Haziq Khan.
In such conditions, soil compaction intensifies, leading to uneven settlement and structural instability, notes Haziq.
He adds that neighbourhoods in Karachi built on soft clays or alluvial deposits – material deposited by rivers, such as silt, mud or sand – are most vulnerable as their typically shallow water tables amplify soil weakness. A 2022 study noted that much of the Karachi metropolis has been built above alluvium deposits.
Unregulated high-rise construction accelerates subsidence by adding heavy loads to the weak soil, he says.
These fragile soils and unchecked groundwater withdrawal, when combined with weak building-code compliance, could make even moderate seismic events into disasters, says Haziq.
He notes that areas lacking proper planning codes and foundation design face disproportionate risks, particularly dense urban zones with poor drainage. This includes areas such as North Karachi and parts of the Old City.
The poor drainage prevents water from escaping, saturating loose soil and making it vulnerable to liquefaction, thereby contributing to subsidence.
Smaller constructions face risks too, notes Zahid Farooq, an urban-planning expert and board member of the Karachi non-profit Urban Resource Centre. He highlights that houses are typically built on small plots, with extra floors added to the building as the family expands. Throughout this process, “no one checks how old or strong the foundation is”.
A 2023 study estimates subsidence in key areas of the city at up to about 17 mm annually and notes that the rate is steadily increasing. It stated that in some areas, subsidence may be partly caused by damaged infrastructure such as broken sewer and water lines. These have been noted as the cause of “variations in localised subsidence patterns where leaking water may cause liquefaction and subsidence over time”.
The study also established that the city has an active fault, meaning it is likely to result in an earthquake in future. The authors note that the data demonstrates a “clear displacement along the fault, most notably along a 10 km-long section”. This poses an “alarming risk” to the city due to a lack of studies on the strain accumulation – the storing of energy that, when eventually released, leads to an earthquake – of this fault. The lack of data leaves the city “unprepared to forecast and plan for the potential of a large seismic event”.
Talking solutions
Amid these risks, experts say Karachi’s safety can be improved through a combination of managing subsidence, enforcing building codes and doing geophysical surveys.
Haziq says subsidence risks can be mitigated by enforcing “geotechnical-based” building codes [meaning grounded in the realities of the soil and subsurface] and restricting high-rise construction in vulnerable zones.
Urban planning should integrate drainage improvements and land-use zoning, Haziq adds.
Rainwater harvesting and aquifer recharge can also help stabilise soil by maintaining groundwater levels and reducing compaction, he notes.
But while these measures slow further subsidence, they cannot reverse permanent soil settlement, he says, making early prevention essential. To do this, groundwater extraction would need to be seriously curtailed. “We would need to enforce bans or strict limits on unregulated borewells and tanker [companies] drilling [for water]”, he says. Pakistan’s National Water Conservation Strategy for 2023-2027 has called for monitoring and controlling of groundwater extraction.
Haziq suggests a few solutions the government could implement: expanding piped-water networks to avoid the need for unregulated borewells; establishing recharge schemes to balance extraction and replenishment; curbing water overuse through public and industrial awareness on conservation, and by encouraging reporting of illegal borewells.
Karachi also needs to undertake regular earthquake drills, he says.
Rana notes that Pakistan’s building code – adopted in 2007 after the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake that killed at least 79,000 people – takes important steps toward addressing earthquake risks. But, he said, “there’s still a long road ahead in terms of enforcement and adaptation”. While the building code is a solid framework, many local bylaws in Karachi do not fully enforce it, he adds.
Siddiqui stresses the importance of increasing awareness about disaster preparedness, lamenting the lack of any dedicated avenues to talk about approaches. “We need forums where scientific and practical solutions are discussed, and governance policies are developed to face the potential disasters that earthquakes in Karachi can cause.”
Farooq says authorities also have a responsibility to conduct surveys to “ensure that the land [being built on] is not on or near a fault line”.
Haziq said conducting detailed geophysical surveys via satellite InSAR, which measures ground deformation using radar images, and seismic monitoring in the tremor zones can help map subsidence and fault behaviour.
While the earthquake’s magnitudes have been low, their frequency raises enough cause for concern about the city’s tectonic drivers, subsidence and urban vulnerability, wrote Moin Raza Khan. “History reminds us – from the 1935 Quetta earthquake to the 1945 Makran tsunami-generating quake – that our risks are not theoretical.”
He stresses: “This is not alarmism – it is a call for preparedness, policy reform, and urgent resilience measures”.

A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.
Per the statement, the operation was conducted in DHA Phase 1 and Phase 6, where several foreign nationals were taken into custody during the action.
“Important and sensitive data was recovered from the suspects, which is now being examined as part of the investigation,” the statement said.
Preliminary inquiries suggest the detained individuals were allegedly running a “well-organised network through a Ponzi scheme,” the statement said, adding that the fraud had affected thousands of people, causing them “serious financial losses”.
However, the further details about the extent of the crime and the people involved were not confirmed.
Authorities said further legal action will be initiated against the network, while investigations are ongoing to determine the full scope of the operation and identify additional suspects.
In July, the NCCIA had also captured a Ponzi ring by raiding a factory in Faisalabad, arresting 149 suspects, including 48 Chinese nationals.
In Feb, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Lahore had launched a crackdown against several entities for their involvement in financial scandals, drawing thousands of people to invest in fraudulent schemes.
The term ‘Ponzi’ scheme came from Charles Ponzi, who in the 1920s promised high returns through a fake investment system involving international postal vouchers. Instead of making legitimate investments, he paid returns to earlier investors with the money from new ones. This fraudulent model continues to thrive online today.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18182041089126e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961852/protests-in-bangladesh-for-repatriation-of-all-killers-as-india-cites-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Protests in Bangladesh ‘for repatriation of all killers’ as India cites security concerns</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh police on Thursday stopped protesters from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission, a day after India’s foreign ministry conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country.
Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year.
Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests.
On Thursday, dozens of demonstrators began marching towards the assistant Indian high commissioner office in Rajshahi district, which borders India.
Miftahul Jannat, one of the protesters, said the plan was to carry out a sit-in, demanding the “repatriation of all the killers including Sheikh Hasina”.
The protest was stalled by the police, who said they “listened to their demands and promised to forward them to the authorities”.
“We are not aware of any further plans (for demonstrations) and hope the issue will be resolved peacefully,” Nashid Farhad, a senior officer with the Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, told AFP.
On Wednesday, a group of protesters tried to march towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
India’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Bangladesh’s top diplomat in New Delhi to convey its concerns about the actions of some “extremist elements”.
In a statement, the ministry also said it expected the interim government under Muhammad Yunus to “ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations”.
Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia by a Bangladesh court last month for crimes against humanity.
The country of 170 million people goes to the polls on February 12, with Hasina’s former ruling party, the Awami League, banned from running.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18174248f308e4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961847/germany-to-take-in-more-than-500-stranded-afghans-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Germany to take in more than 500 stranded Afghans from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The German government said on Thursday that it would take in 535 Afghans who had been promised refuge in Germany but have been stuck in limbo in Pakistan.
Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the RND media network that Berlin wanted to complete the processing of the cases “in December, as far as possible” to allow them to enter Germany.
The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government, but have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
Those on the scheme either worked with German armed forces in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban, or were judged to be at particular risk from the Taliban after its return to power in 2021 — for example, rights activists and journalists, as well as their families.
Pakistan had set a deadline for the end of the year for the Afghans’ cases to be settled, after which they would be deported back to their homeland.
Dobrindt said that “we are in touch with the Pakistani authorities about this,” adding: “It could be that there are a few cases which we will have to work on in the new year.”
Last week, the interior ministry said it had informed 650 people on the programme they would not be admitted, as the new government deemed it was no longer in Germany’s “interest”.
The government has offered those still in Pakistan money to give up their claim of settling in Germany, but as of mid-November, only 62 people had taken up the offer.
Earlier this month, more than 250 organisations in Germany, including Amnesty International, Save the Children and Human Rights Watch, said there were around 1,800 Afghans from the programme in limbo in Pakistan, and urged the government to let them in.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18170347bc0e25a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961844/gb-general-elections-local-body-polls-delayed-due-to-harsh-weather-conditions-cec-khan' target='_blank'><strong>GB general elections, local body polls delayed due to harsh weather conditions: CEC Khan</strong></a><br><p>Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Raja Shehbaz Khan on Thursday announced a delay of general elections and local bodies polls due to harsh weather conditions in the region, after a multiparty conference held to consult political parties on the holding of the elections.
General Elections of the Assembly and local government (LG) elections were scheduled for January 24 and February 14, 2026, respectively. The LG polls are going to be conducted in the region after a gap of 20 years.
“The new polling dates for both elections will be announced later,” Khan said.
After the GB Assembly completed its five-year tenure on November 24, President Asif Ali Zardari announced the general elections date as it is mandatory to conduct elections within 60 days, while the GB election commissioner also announced the date of local body elections.
Meanwhile, the GB Election Commission convened a multiparty conference (MPC), including leaders of PML-N, PPP, PTI and JUI, today at its secretariat to consult political parties on the holding of elections in January and February.
After the meeting, the GB CEC said the meeting was convened to seek views of the political parties, their suggestions and guidance on key electoral matters to make the process effective, transparent and in line with democratic principles.
Representatives of the political parties attended the consultative meeting and shared their views and suggestions with the election commission, he said,
While 14 political parties opposed the holding of elections in January and February due to harsh weather conditions in the region that cut off many areas from the rest of the region, six party leaders favoured the polling day, he said.
The leaders, who opposed the election dates, argued that people in the region couldn’t use their right to vote due to the weather conditions, they argued.
Meanwhile, 14 petitions were submitted with the GB Election Commission challenging the polling day of the general elections and demanding the postponement of the polls, he said.
Khan agreed with the majority opinions and announced to withdraw the general elections and local bodies polls on January 24 and February 14, respectively.
According to a source, the commission was considering holding the general and local body elections simultaneously in the month of May 2026.</p><small>2025-12-18 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1816422565a2b03.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961842/uk-teachers-to-tackle-misogyny-in-classroom-as-govt-deploys-new-strategy' target='_blank'><strong>UK teachers to tackle misogyny in classroom as govt deploys new strategy</strong></a><br><p>UK teachers will be trained to tackle misogyny in the classroom under a new strategy aimed at halving violence against women and girls over the next decade, the government said Thursday.
The new strategy would “deploy the full power of the state to introduce the largest crackdown to stop violence perpetrated against women and girls in British history”, said Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, who is due to unveil details of the new approach in parliament later.







The 20 million plan comes as the latest statistics showed over 40 per cent of young men held a positive view of so-called manosphere influencer Andrew Tate, a government statement said.
And over the last year alone, one in every eight women was a victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking.
“For too long, the scale of violence against women and girls has been treated as a fact of life in our country,” said Phillips.
Under the strategy, all secondary schools in England will have to teach students about healthy relationships.
Teachers will receive specialist training to talk to pupils about issues such as consent and the dangers of sharing intimate images.
“Tackling the most worrying attitudes as early as possible, schools will also send high-risk individuals to get the extra care and support they need, focused on challenging deep-rooted misogynist influences,” the statement added.
A new helpline would also be launched, targeted at pupils concerned about their own behaviour.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the strategy was about “driving forward education and conversation with boys and young men”

In a post on X, the minister wrote that widespread AI adoption is affecting the employment of creative minds in the sector, specifically referring to content creators, graphic designers and editors, creative directors, actors and models and technicians and cameramen.
“I am inviting proposals on how to address this problem and how to save these professions from becoming redundant,” Tarar wrote, urging people to send proposals to an email address linked to the Press Information Department.







An International Labour Organisation (ILO) report published in May found that around “one in four workers across the world are in an occupation with some degree of exposure” to generative AI models’ capabilities.
“Few jobs are currently at high risk of full automation,” the ILO added.
In November, polling firm Ipsos asked 9,000 people to listen to two clips of AI-generated music and one of human-made music in a survey conducted for France-based streaming platform Deezer.
“Ninety-seven per cent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,” said Deezer. The platform added that more than half of the respondents to its survey felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.
Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 per cent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it would lead to a loss of creativity.</p><small>2025-12-18 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/181552016a1feae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961840/pm-shehbaz-approves-halal-meat-export-policy-orders-preparation-of-strategy-to-enhance-exports' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz approves halal meat export policy, orders preparation of strategy to enhance exports</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday approved the halal meat export policy and directed relevant authorities to present a comprehensive, three-year strategy within two weeks, comprising measures to increase exports.
Pakistan barely has a 0.25 per cent share in the global halal food trade of more than $3 trillion, which reflects the need for the government and private sector to take proactive initiatives to explore the true potential of ‘Made in Pakistan’ products and establish a niche for itself.
The decision was made during a meeting of a committee established to enhance Pakistan’s halal meat export market, focusing on the export policy and sector reforms. PM Shehbaz was presiding over the meeting.
“A comprehensive strategy, formulated through coordination among all relevant federal ministries and provincial governments, is essential and significant to make Pakistan’s share in the halal meat market of Muslim countries as well as the global market,” PM Shehbaz said.
He asked officials to present proposals for improving production, cold storage, and other related aspects of the initiative.
He also directed the relevant authorities to take special measures for increasing halal meat production in livestock in accordance with international standards and for remaining competitive with regional production volumes.
Organised centres, developed through cooperation between relevant federal ministries and provincial governments, were urgently needed to enhance the production and nutritional value of halal meat, the prime minister stressed.
“There is considerable potential to increase Pakistan’s export share in Muslim countries as well as in the global halal meat market,” he said, assuring the industry that the government would provide full support for international certification of slaughterhouses and bilateral registrations with other countries.
The premier also directed relevant authorities to take special measures for ensuring disease-free conditions and international-standard hygiene arrangements in slaughterhouses across the country.
During the briefing, the prime minister was informed that Pakistan’s total halal meat production stood at six million metric tons, and after fulfilling domestic requirements, a substantial quantity was available for export.
Special measures are being undertaken to increase halal meat production and ensure international standard packaging, the prime minister was informed by the committee.
The meeting was attended by Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar, and other relevant government officials.
In October, Malaysia expressed interest in importing $200 million worth of Halal meat from Pakistan. The following month, Jam Kamal directed all relevant stakeholders to coordinate with the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to achieve the target in meat exports to the Southeast Asian country.</p><small>2025-12-18 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18145053b5dfad2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961835/passengers-offloaded-restrained-from-travelling-must-be-provided-with-written-reasons-lhc-reminds-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Passengers offloaded, restrained from travelling must be provided with written reasons, LHC reminds authorities</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday issued a stern reminder to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other authorities concerned, saying that any person offloaded or restrained from travelling must be provided with written reasons at the time of the action being taken.
LHC’s Justice Ali Zia Bajwa made the observations in an order issued after a hearing held at the Multan Bench. On Wednesday, the judge had heard a petition filed by a citizen, Shaheryar Qandeel, against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other authorities following his offloading from a flight despite being in possession of valid travel documents.
In the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Justice Bajwa said, “Let this court take a moment to remind the FIA and all concerned authorities that every exercise of power that infringes upon the fundamental rights of an individual must find its firm and unambiguous foundation in law.”
He said that no administrative discretion, however broad, could justify curbing the liberty of citizens unless “it is traceable to a clear statutory provision or legal mandate”.
Justice Bajwa held that the rule of law demanded that no person be deprived of their right to move freely or leave the country except through due process and fair procedure.
“The rule of law demands that no person should be deprived of their right to travel, move freely, or leave the country, particularly when in possession of valid travel documents, except in accordance with law, due process, and fair procedure,” he said.
The judge also noted that during the proceedings, the law officers and FIA officials again sought additional time to identify the specific statutory provisions or rules that empowered them to restrain passengers at the “eleventh hour”.
The judge also expressed concern after learning from the law officers that no written reasons for the petitioner’s offloading were available on the record. The judge directed the FIA to provide the petitioner with written reasons for his offloading well before the next hearing.
Justice Bajwa ruled that this requirement was not a mere formality, but a “substantive safeguard to uphold transparency, accountability, and the individual’s right to seek redress”.
“The failure to provide such reasons not only contravenes the principles of natural justice and due process but also constitutes a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of movement,” the judge maintained.
The case has been relisted at a future date, when law officers are expected to assist the court by citing the specific legal provisions that allow for such travel restrictions.
The development comes as, over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.</p><small>2025-12-18 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18135229fd3d2be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961833/complaint-filed-against-bihar-cm-for-pulling-down-womans-niqab-indian-media' target='_blank'><strong>Complaint filed against Bihar CM for pulling down woman’s niqab: Indian media</strong></a><br><p>A complaint has been filed with police against the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, and Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Sanjay Nishad in relation to an incident involving the former pulling a woman’s face veil (niqab), according to Indian media.
Kumar has been facing criticism after he pulled off a woman doctor’s niqab at a graduation ceremony. A clip of the incident was widely shared on social media, showing the 74-year-old politician handing a certificate to a woman doctor during the event on Monday and motioning to her to remove her niqab.
Before the woman could react, Kumar reached out and pulled down the niqab, exposing her mouth and chin.
While the clip has sparked widespread outrage across India and Pakistan, with social media users, activists and commentators demanding an apology and resignation of the chief minister, Nishad made remarks belittling the gravity of the incident, questioning the outrage over “mere removal of a burqa”.
Indian news agency ANI reported on Wednesday that Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Sumaiya Rana had lodged a complaint with police in Lucknow, seeking “strict legal action” and the registration of a first information report against the two leaders.
Speaking to ANI, the SP leader criticised the chief minister for his actions.
“A video of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar is going viral on social media in which he is seen pulling down a woman’s hijab … For a person holding a constitutional position to behave in this manner means he is encouraging his other workers to engage in similar acts”, she was quoted as saying.
According to ANI, Rana also objected to Nishad’s remarks and recalled that the minister had commented that “why is there so much controversy over removing a burqa. His hand only touched her face. If his hand had touched somewhere else, what would have happened then?”
“Based on this, I have filed a complaint,” she said.
Advocate Misham Zaidi, who was one of the lawyers present with Rana, said that Kumar’s act and the remarks by Nishad had “hurt the modesty of a woman”, ANI reported.
“What Sanjay Nishad has done incites religious sentiments,” he was quoted as saying. “This is a clear-cut case under Section 153A, as you are knowingly engaging in such acts that could instigate riots, create unrest, and disturb the law and order of the state.”
Meanwhile, he added, “Section 354 will be applied to him (Nitish Kumar) directly for grabbing and pulling it (the niqab).”
According to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Section 153A pertains to the incitement of “enmity between different groups on [grounds] of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language,” while Section 354 of IPC deals with “assault or use of criminal force on a woman with intent to “outrage her modesty”.
For his part, Nishad has maintained that his remarks have been “misinterpreted”.
Speaking to the Indian news agency Press Trust of India (PTI), he alleged that his comment “was lost in translation and carried no ill intent.”
“My remark was tweaked and twisted, misinterpreted, its spirit lost in cacophony and translation,“ Nishad was quoted as saying.</p><small>2025-12-18 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18130410d356760.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961829/cdf-field-marshal-munir-reaffirms-commitment-to-strengthening-defence-ties-with-libya' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirms commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
In a statement, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the field marshal was currently on an official visit to Libya, where he called on the Libyan Armed Forces’ commander in chief, Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, and deputy commander in chief, Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar.
“On arrival, the field marshal was accorded a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Libyan Armed Forces,” the ISPR said.







In a meeting with the Libyan Armed Forces’ commander in chief, CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya, “based on shared interests”, it said.
It added that during the meeting, the two discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence and military-to-military cooperation.
“Both sides underscored the importance of collaboration in training, capacity building, and counter-terrorism domains,” it said.
“Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and expressed his desire to further expand defence cooperation between the two countries,” the ISPR statement added.
In July, Lt Gen Saddam Khalifa had called on Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, where the two had agreed on their countries’ collaboration in the defence industry.
“Both leaders agreed to undertake defence industrial collaboration and exchange of technical expertise to address contemporary security challenges,” an ISPR statement said at the time.</p><small>2025-12-18 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1813414149312bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961832/trump-administration-intends-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-revoke-citizenship-of-some-naturalised-americans-report' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration intends to ramp up efforts to revoke citizenship of some naturalised Americans: report</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration intends to increase its efforts to strip some naturalised Americans of their US citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times.
The move comes as US President Donald Trump, in a prime-time address, pledged to further intensify his hard-line immigration policies, signalling a broader crackdown on migrants and stricter enforcement measures across the country.
Internal instructions issued this week to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field offices direct them to “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100–200 denaturalisation cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year, the Times reported.
That would mark a dramatic increase in denaturalisation cases, which, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Centre, stood at about 11 per year between 1990 and 2017.
A USCIS spokesperson told Reuters that the agency’s focus was on individuals who “unlawfully obtained US citizenship”, asserting that the expanded denaturalisation push forms part of efforts to combat immigration fraud.
In the US, the government can revoke the US citizenship of a naturalised citizen for various criminal and security issues.
Denaturalisation cases are civil actions filed in federal court and historically have been pursued sparingly.
Under US law, denaturalisation can occur only in specific circumstances — principally when citizenship was “illegally procured” or gained by fraud or misrepresentation during the naturalisation process.
The timeline for denaturalisation cases varies, but they can take years to resolve.
Trump’s remarks on immigration
In his rapid-fire address at the White House, Trump reinforced his administration’s broader immigration agenda, touching on economic and other policy themes, with immigration a recurring emphasis.
While not unveiling new immigration measures during the speech itself, he continued longstanding attacks on US border policy and blamed his predecessors for what he described as national security and social challenges.
In early December, Trump told reporters that he would “absolutely” denaturalise some US citizens if he had the authority to do so — specifically citing what he characterised as “criminals that came into our country and … were naturalised maybe through [Joe] Biden or somebody that didn’t know what they were doing”.
Trump also has used strong language about current and prospective immigrants, saying “we don’t want those people” when discussing certain asylum seekers and signalling that asylum decisions could be paused “for a long time”.
These comments come in the wake of a deadly shooting in Washington involving an Afghan national who had been granted asylum earlier this year, which the administration has cited in defence of tightening immigration controls.
Earlier this month, Trump announced on social media that his administration would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and promised measures to remove immigrants he labelled as security risks or burdens on federal benefits systems.
Earlier this week, Trump also added seven additional countries to a full travel ban list and imposed partial restrictions on several more, continuing a broader crackdown on entry from nations it deems to have deficient vetting systems.
Broader immigration enforcement
The expanded denaturalisation guidance arrives amid a broader suite of immigration policies implemented by the Trump administration.
These include expanded travel bans affecting citizens of multiple countries, a halt or severe curtailment of asylum processing, and a review of green cards and immigration status for nationals from countries the administration designates as “countries of concern”.
Critics of the denaturalisation push warn that applying numerical targets to citizenship revocation — a process historically reserved for clear fraud in the naturalisation process — could politicise what should be a narrowly applied enforcement tool and inject fear into immigrant communities.
Trump’s supporters, however, argue that safeguarding the integrity of the naturalisation system is essential and that fraud should be pursued vigorously within the bounds of law.
As implementation begins, federal courts will be the ultimate arbiter of individual denaturalisation actions, and the legal and social ramifications of the policy shift are likely to be subjects of intense debate in legal, immigrant advocacy, and policy circles.

Haw, look at him! Doesn’t know Basant even. He’s become a foreigner. I tau fully blame Kick Cock and all this social media shedia. He’s so busy looking at hurry canes in Thailand and football matches in Milan that he’s forgotten about our own culture. Next, he’ll be asking me kay what is Holloween?
So, I said to him, very gently, very sweetly, “Beta, Basant is kite flying festival in February. In not so olden days, Lahore was famous for it. On that day, everyone wore yellow and climbed on to rooftops to fly kites. Lots of rooftop parties happened and gaana bajana also and much halla gulla. Foreigners used to come from Isloo to take part and Karachiites who, poor things, never had anything like it, used to come from Karachi. Even some Indians from India came. When there was still aana jaana and uthna baithna between us. Whole weekend was non-stop fun.”
“Before my time,” said Kulchoo. “So, what happened to it?”
“It was band.”
“Why?”
“Because people, some people fell off rooftops and guvmunt said kite strings cut people’s throats.”
“So why don’t they ban driving then? I’m sure more people die in car and motorcycle crashes all year round. Or better still, ban Kalashnikovs.”

Butterfly’s excitement over the return of Lahore’s beloved kite-flying festival is undermined by people determined to jump on her head…

“Baba, driving vaghera, tau, is majboori, naa. Kite flying and Basant, tau, was just hundred percent fun. Maybe that’s why they band it because people were having too much fun. I think so, having fun is not allowed.”
“You can say that again!” Kulchoo scowled. “That’s why we don’t have night clubs and bars and concerts and comedy nights or puppet shows and big sporting events and even bloody New Year’s Eve parties. In case someone, somewhere, God forbid, ends up having fun.”
“But Kulchoo beta,” I said, “we are, by God’s grace, Muslim nation naa.”
“And Dubai and Malaysia and Turkey and Morocco and Indonesia are not? They all have fun. And guess what? Saudi has also allowed non-Muslim premium visa holders to buy alcohol in Riyadh. So, they’re selling sharaab in Saudi.”
“Yes, but only to non-Muslims, beta. And that also just the khaata peeta types. Poors are not allowed because, becharas, not being sophisty and all, they get very drunk, naa.”
“And if it was really about protecting people, then why not ban smog, haan?” he shouted. “It kills more people than kite string.”
“Smog, tau, is from Allah Mian.”
“No, it’s not. Beijing used to have the worst smog in the world but they cleaned it up. And ban child marriages? And cousin marriage? And ban companies from throwing industrial waste into rivers and the sea? And why not...”
“Kulch darling,” I said, ‘I think so your father wants you in the other room. You must go now only.”



 
Dekho zara, here was I trying to give him good news and he just jumped on my head. As if I was Shabaz Sharif and Asim Munir and Maulana Fazlur all rolled into one powerful being, who can unroll smog and ban old men from marrying little girls and young men from beating their wives and big, big companies from throwing their gund bala into rivers.
Iss kay baad tau, I think so, I should better not tell to him kay even though Basant is being allowed again, you can’t fly a kite if you’re a child and you can’t do it here and you can’t do it there and you can’t laugh while doing it and you can’t use dor and you can’t shout ‘bo kata!’ and you can’t do baazis and you can’t chase a loose kite or loose woman or loose man.
Haan. And you also mustn’t have fun. On no account must you have fun. Otherwise, you will be arrested. And no ifs and buts. Even if you are six years old and you are flying a kite on your grandfather’s rooftop with a dor and smiling, you will be arrested and get a criminal record.
Talking of arrests, thanks God all the rumours about the Prisoner of Zenda’s deaths are fake news. I said so to Mulloo, thinking she would say ‘Haan, lakh lakh shukars, baba’, but she also jumped on my head.
“How do you know it’s fake news?” she demanded, her eyes bulging like a toad’s. Aik tau everyone is jumping on my head these days. As if it was a trampoling. I said, “Bhai, his sister has seen him.”
“That’s not now. That was then.”
Kehti tau vaisay theek hai. “Okay Mulloo, I think so Janoo is calling me from the next room.” And I hung up the phone.
Honestly, best is kay I should keep my mouth shut only. In case I also start laughing and smiling and get arrested for having fun.
