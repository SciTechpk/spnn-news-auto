Amid heightened tensions along the Pak-Afghan border, a high-level Pakistani delegation led by Asif travelled to Doha on Saturday for talks with Afghan Taliban officials, aimed at ending cross-border hostilities and addressing Pakistan’s security concerns.  Facilitated by Qatar, the talks followed days of clashes and Pakistani strikes on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, after a 48-hour ceasefire was extended to allow negotiations.
In a post on X, the minister announced, “A ceasefire agreement has been finalised. The terrorist attacks from Afghanistan on Pakistan’s soil will cease immediately. Both neighbouring countries will respect each other’s territory,” adding that delegations will meet again in Istanbul on October 25 to discuss matters in detail.
“We are sincerely grateful to both brotherly countries, Qatar and Turkiye,” the minister said.
 






Earlier, a post on the X account of PTV News, citing the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had also confirmed the development.
 






“During the talks, both countries not only agreed on an immediate ceasefire but also decided to establish a permanent mechanism for bilateral peace and stability,” the post said.
The post further noted that both countries will hold follow-up meetings in the coming days to ensure the implementation and sustained continuity of the ceasefire.
“These measures will prove beneficial in promoting security and stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan,” it said.
According to the post, the negotiations, hosted by the State of Qatar with Turkiye acting as mediator, continued for 13 hours.
On Saturday, as talks were underway between the two sides, Pakistan had reiterated that it did not seek escalation. However, it urged the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities, a statement from the Foreign Office (FO) had said.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,“ it had added.
Cross-border escalation
On the night of October 11, Afghan forces launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, sparking a series of clashes that left 23 Pakistani soldiers martyred and over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants dead, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The Pakistan military responded with precision strikes inside Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul, targeting militant camps and border positions, while urging Kabul to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Clashes broke out again on Tuesday (Oct.14), with the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij exchanging fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO on Wednesday announced that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was extended, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
Deteriorating ties
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have remained strained since 2023, with Pakistan repeatedly raising concerns over the use of Afghan soil by militants carrying out cross-border attacks. The security situation has deteriorated further in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan following the outlawed TTP’s decision to end its ceasefire with Islamabad in November 2022.
While the two sides have attempted to hold dialogue from time to time, tensions have persisted. Kabul, while insisting that it does not permit its territory to be used against any country, continues to face criticism from Islamabad as TTP-led assaults continue in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-19 03:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f41b6c08f25.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949812/no-kings-protesters-rally-across-us-against-trump-policies' target='_blank'><strong>‘No Kings’ protesters rally across US against Trump policies</strong></a><br><p>• Participants express concern over ‘authoritarianism’, immigration crackdowns and threats to democracy
• Republican leaders criticise the events as ‘Hate America’ rallies; US president offers muted response, says ‘I’m not a king’
WASHINGTON: Huge crowds took to the streets Saturday in all 50 US states to vent their anger over President Donald Trump’s hardline policies at “No Kings” protests that top Republicans ridiculed as “Hate America” rallies.
From New York and Washington to smaller cities in Michigan, more than 2,700 protests were planned coast to coast, with organisers saying they expected millions to attend what could be one of the largest protest turnouts in modern US history.
The mass mobilisation, the second of its kind after similar events in June, is aimed at what opponents say is an agenda pushing the country toward autocracy.
“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands at a protest in Washington near the National Mall. Many carried American flags while others shouted, “Hey hey ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!”
Demonstrators are up in arms over what they see as strongarm tactics since the Republican billionaire returned to the White House in January. Grievances include attacks on the media, the prosecution of political opponents and a vast immigration crackdown that has seen National Guard troops ordered into cities such as Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis.
The protests also come as a US government shutdown entered its third week, with the Trump administration firing thousands of federal workers amid a legislative impasse.
Thousands flooded New York’s Times Square, Boston Common and Chicago’s Grant Park. In Los Angeles, where organisers said they expected 100,000 people to attend, plans were made to float a giant balloon of Trump depicted in a diaper.
“I never thought I would live to see the death of my country as a democracy,” Colleen Hoffman, a 69-year-old retiree, told AFP in New York. “We are in a crisis — the cruelty of this regime, the authoritarianism. I just feel like I cannot sit home and do nothing.”
While Trump’s response to Saturday’s events was muted, his top surrogates were in more fighting form. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the day of protest the “Hate America rally”. 
“You’re going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,” Johnson told reporters. 
Republican lawmaker Tom Emmer also used the “Hate America” phrase and referred to participants as the “terrorist wing” of the Democratic Party. 
Other Republicans have voiced concerns that the marches could motivate political violence, especially following the September assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk, a close confidant of Trump. 
In an interview with the Fox News show “Sunday Morning Futures”, Trump addressed the “No Kings” moniker directly. “They’re saying they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” he said. 
The movement’s organisers, a coalition of more than 300 grassroots groups led by the progressive organisation Indivisible Project, framed the day as a defence of democratic principles. 
“There is nothing more American than saying we don’t have kings and exercising our right to peacefully protest,” said Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible. 
Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said protesters wanted to convey that “we are a country of equals.” The ACLU said it had given legal and de-escalation training to tens of thousands of people acting as marshals at the marches. 
Support for the demonstrations came from top Democrats, including Sen Chuck Schumer, Sen Bernie Sanders and Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
“I say to my fellow Americans this No Kings Day: Do not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence,” Schumer wrote Saturday on X. “Speak out, use your voice, and exercise your right to free speech.”



 
Beyond the United States, small protests took place Saturday in London, Madrid, Malaga, Spain and Malmo, Sweden. 
Dana Fisher, a professor at American University and an author of several books on American activism, said the day’s main point was to build solidarity. 
“The main point of this day of action is to create a sense of collective identity amongst all the people who are feeling like they are being persecuted or are anxious due to the Trump administration and its policies,” Fisher said.  
“It’s not going to change Trump’s policies. But it might embolden elected officials at all levels who are in opposition to Trump."

Globally, 27.6 per cent of jobs held by women are potentially exposed to automation or major changes from generative AI (GenAI), compared to 21.1pc of jobs held by men, the report from the UN Department of Social Affairs (DESA) found.  
These risks stem from structural inequalities, gender biases embedded in technology, and uneven access to digital resources.  
The impact is expected to be felt most acutely in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, where women are concentrated in clerical jobs, education, and public administration — sectors with high exposure to GenAI.  

Urges govts to close digital gender gap by ensuring affordable internet and digital skills training for women

This trend follows a historical pattern. Earlier stages of digitalisation, which focused on automating routine and manual tasks, also disproportionately affected women.



 
Between 2000 and 2019 in the United States, 3.5 million administrative support and assembly-line jobs held by women of prime working age were lost, compared to one million such jobs held by men.
“Job displacement is one of the primary challenges,” the UN report says, noting that while earlier automation affected low-skill tasks, GenAI “is expected to have more wide-ranging effects” by automating tasks across various skill levels.
A critical factor compounding the problem is the under-representation of women in the technology sector itself.  
The report highlights that women’s low participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields can “significantly intensify gender inequalities”. The share of women with skills in STEM remains below one-third across a sample of 73 countries.  
This gap is concerning not only for current employment but also for the future, as AI systems trained on biased datasets risk “perpetuating and amplifying discrimination in hiring processes and other critical decisions”, the report warns.  
While greater diversity in tech teams is not a complete solution, the analysis suggests more diverse teams are better positioned to identify and mitigate the risks of biased technology.  
Despite the significant risks, digitalisation also presents new opportunities for women’s economic inclusion.  
New work models like remote work, teleworking, and the gig economy can help women work around traditional barriers such as rigid schedules and caregiving responsibilities.  
The UN macro-analysis says that by “enabling more flexible and innovative employment options, digitalisation can drive greater economic inclusion and empowerment for women”.



 
In developing countries, many women have benefited from digital platforms and e-commerce, but a persistent digital gender gap continues to exclude many from these opportunities.  
To counter the risks and leverage the opportunities, the UN urges governments to prioritise closing the digital gender divide by expanding affordable internet access, providing digital skills training for women and girls, and promoting women’s employment and leadership in the tech sector.

District Judge Phyllis Hamilton ruled on Friday that NSO Group’s behaviour fell short of a “particularly egregious” standard needed to support the jury’s calculations on a financial penalty.
But in the ruling, she said the court “concluded that defendants’ conduct causes irreparable harm, and there being no dispute that the conduct is ongoing” the judge granted WhatsApp owner Meta an injunction to stop NSO Group’s snooping tactics at the messaging service.
“We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting civil society members,” WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart said in a statement.
Evidence at trial showed that NSO Group reverse-engineered WhatsApp code to stealthily install spyware targeting users, according to the ruling.
The spyware was repeatedly redesigned to escape detection and bypass security fixes at WhatsApp, the court concluded.
The lawsuit, filed in late 2019, accused NSO Group of cyberespionage targeting journalists, lawyers, human rights activists and others using the encrypted messaging service.
Hamilton ruled however that the $168m damages verdict awarded to Meta earlier this year was excessive.
“There have simply not yet been enough cases involving unlawful electronic surveillance in the smartphone era for the court to be able to conclude that defendants’ conduct was ‘particularly egregious’,” Hamilton wrote in the ruling.

• Red Zone area briefly opened to repatriate Afghan refugees
QUETTA: Calm prevailed on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border on Saturday after the extension of a ceasefire between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban forces, with no untoward incident reported from any area of the Chaman sector, where heavy clashes had erupted in the early hours of Tuesday last week.
 
 

Although the border crossings at Chaman and other entry points have closed for the past six days, Pakistan partially reopened the border in the Red Zone area to facilitate the repatriation of undocumented Afghan refugees.
“Under tight security, several hundred Afghan refugee families, including women and children, along with their belongings crossed into the Afghanistan over the past three days, a senior official said.
The border was opened for three days, while it remained closed for the other three due to intense fighting at four locations in the Chaman sector,” he added.
Following the ceasefire, no firing or attack was reported from either side. “Forces equipped with heavy weapons remain on high alert to respond to any situation,” the official said. The Friendship Gate at the Pak-Afghan border remains intact on the Pakistani side, while the Afghan Taliban damaged the gate on their side.
The Inspector General of Fron­t­ier Corps (North) Balochistan re­­c­e­ntly visited the Chaman border, where he was briefed by senior Frontier Corps commanders on the situation following the armed cla­shes. He also visited Pakistani border posts and the Friendship Gate.
The border, however, remains completely closed for all other purposes — including Afghan transit trade, imports, exports, and cross-border business — for the past six days.
Hundreds of loaded trucks and trailers carrying Afghan transit goods, fresh fruits, vegetables, and other commodities have been stranded on both sides of the border. “Around 140 trucks loaded with grapes and pomegranates are waiting in the Vesh Mandi area of Afghanistan to transport consignments to Quetta and other Pakistani cities,” officials said.
Similarly, over 500 loaded trucks carrying Afghan transit goods and import-export items have been stranded on the Pakistani side of the border in Chaman since the clashes began.
The business community engaged in cross-border trade has reported heavy financial losses, as perishable goods — particularly fruits and vegetables — are spoiling due to the prolonged closure.
Traders’ organisations, including the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed serious concern over the situation and urged authorities to reopen the border to prevent further economic losses.

• Justice Arbab Tahir to hear petition along with office’s objections on Monday
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has raised objections to a petition filed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala jail.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir is scheduled to hear the petition, along with the registrar office’s objections, on Monday.
The petition was submitted by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal through Advocate Ali Bukhari on behalf of the provincial chief minister. The petition argued that a meeting with the PTI founder was essential to discuss matters pertaining to provincial governance and the formation of a new cabinet.
However, the IHC registrar’s office objected to the maintainability of the plea, noting that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
The move came after CM Afridi was denied a meeting with PTI founder at Adiala jail. Following the refusal, the KP government approached the IHC, naming the federal and Punjab interior secretaries, the inspector general of Punjab Police, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
 
 

According to the petition, the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow the meeting, but no approval was granted. The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Advocate General Shah Faisal, who verified his biometrics at the IHC under a special power of attorney, told reporters that CM Afridi had personally attempted to meet the PTI founder but was denied access despite having sought the prime minister’s permission. He added that the chief minister also intended to raise the matter before the Chief Justice of Pakistan on the administrative side and might approach the Supreme Court if necessary.
PTI leader and counsel Ali Bukhari said the ban on political meetings, imposed on November 26 last year, was contrary to the Pakistan Prisons Rules and violated visitation rights. He argued that even court directions regarding such rights were being disregarded, asserting that “meetings with inmates are a right, not a privilege.”
The petition requested the court to direct the jail authorities to immediately allow a meeting between the KP chief minister and the PTI founder, and to issue guidelines for future consultations as part of routine governance communication. The IHC will take up the petition, along with objections, for hearing on Monday.

• Says govt ‘close to deciding’ fate of Roosevelt Hotel
• Backs global financial reforms to ease climate burden
• Briefs World Bank president on govt’s flood response
WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Saturday that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot impose any conditions on Pakistan that go against the country’s national interests.
Speaking at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, the minister said that all the reforms undertaken so far under IMF programmes were consistent with Pakistan’s own economic priorities and had contributed to improving the national economy.
“Please name any IMF-suggested reform that is not aligned with our national interest,” he asked in response to a question.
Mr Aurangzeb announced that the IMF is expected to release the $1.2 billion tranche pledged under last week’s staff-level agreement by Dec 31.
“The Fund’s executive board will soon meet to review the agreement, and the amount will be released shortly thereafter,” he added.
At the conclusion of his six-day visit to Washington, the minister also expressed optimism about finalising a trade and tariff agreement with the United States “within a week or two”.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb, who attended 65 meetings during the World Bank Group’s annual autumn session, said the government was also “close to deciding” the fate of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, a property owned by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
Seven international consortia, including Citigroup, have submitted bids to advise Pakistan on the privatisation of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York — a century-old Manhattan landmark considered one of the country’s most valuable foreign assets.
According to media reports, Islamabad is pursuing a joint venture model rather than an outright sale, seeking a redevelopment partner to maximise the property’s long-term value as part of a privatisation effort agreed under its $7bn IMF programme.
Pakistan backs V20 agenda
Separately, Pakistan joined 68 other nations on Saturday in calling for reforms to the global financial system to help vulnerable economies cope with the mounting impacts of climate change.
The appeal was made at a meeting of the Vulnerable 20 (V20) — a coalition of finance ministers from 68 countries most exposed to climate risks — held on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings in Washington.
 






The group seeks fairer access to climate finance and changes in global lending rules to support adaptation and recovery efforts.
“Pakistan strongly supports the V20 agenda to reform the global financial architecture, ensuring that climate finance is more accessible and affordable,” Mr Aurangzeb said while addressing the meeting.
He emphasised the need to align climate financing with the requirements of vulnerable economies to “ensure resilient growth”.
Ranked first on the Climate Risk Index 2025 despite contributing less than 0.9 per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan continues to bear disproportionate losses.
Experts warn that the country now requires $40-50bn annually to effectively mitigate and adapt to climate risks.
Mr Aurangzeb informed the V20 gathering that the government was pursuing its own reforms to align national policies with the group’s call for equitable climate finance. These efforts include developing creditworthy project pipelines, issuing green bonds and creating carbon market mechanisms to attract investment, he added.
Flood response
In a related development, the finance minister met World Bank President Ajay Banga in Washington on Friday and briefed him on the government’s flood response efforts. This meeting also took place on the sidelines of the plenary sessions of the IMF and World Bank, which Mr Aurangzeb attended during his six-day visit to Washington from Oct 13 to 18.
An official statement said Mr Aurangzeb briefed Mr Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the bank’s timely support following the post-flood damage assessment.
The minister also endorsed the proposal to leverage technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience,” the statement read.
The minister requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach to reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency.
The minister highlighted Pakistan’s Climate Prosperity Plan, which aims to shift the country from vulnerability to resilience and from risk to investment.
Separately, in a meeting with Turkiye’s Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Simsek, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted Islamabad’s ongoing reform efforts in key sectors, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), privatisation, and public finance.

• Taliban regime seeks confirmed coordinates of TTP hideouts; pledge to address concern
• FO says govt to press Afghan Taliban to honour commitments
• Tarar rebukes ICC over ‘biased, premature’ comment on ‘airstrike deaths’
ISLAMABAD: Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan were held on Saturday amid cautious optimism on both sides for de-escalation following a week of deadly cross-border clashes, though a breakthrough remained uncertain in the absence of concrete Taliban commitments on ending terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil.
The meeting, held in a cordial atmosphere, continued well into the night behind closed doors in Doha.
Participants of the Doha dialogue reportedly kept shifting their stance on the continuation of talks. Initially, both sides considered adjourning the negotiations for a week, but later agreed to reconvene on Sunday.
However, the latest word from sources familiar with the closely guarded proceedings suggested that the discussions, held in deep secrecy, continued late into the night, with a joint communique expected to be issued.
The talks were opened by a senior Qatari intelligence official before the Pakistani and Afghan delegations began direct discussions on outstanding issues.
The Pakistani side was led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, accompanied by National Security Adviser and ISI Chief Lt Gen Asim Malik. The Afghan side was represented by Acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid and Inte­lligence Chief Maulvi Abdul Haq Wasiq.
According to diplomatic sources, Pakistan pressed that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Afghan soil was “not acceptable” and urged verifiable action against the group.
The Taliban delegation, while signalling willingness to cooperate, reportedly asked Pakistan to provide verified details of TTP hideouts and promised to address the concerns “to Pakistan’s satisfaction”.
However, Taliban representatives also cautioned that it was “unrealistic” to expect Kabul to entirely stop TTP operations inside Pakistan.
 
 

Afghan negotiators further complained that Pakistan’s public narrative had negatively impacted the Taliban’s international recognition prospects and alleged that militants of the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K) captured in Afghanistan had claimed to have received training in Pakistan.
Taliban negotiators, during the course of the meeting, kept consulting their leadership in Afghanistan, according to a source.
In a statement issued earlier in the day, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the high-level delegation would “urge the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities”, including the Fitna Al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna Al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army).
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been high for the past two years over what Islamabad calls Kabul’s failure to curb cross-border terrorism. The situation escalated sharply on Oct 9 when Pakistan launched airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan, and reportedly sent fighter jets over Kabul after which explosions were heard.
The Taliban then launched attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11 in which at least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred. Pakistan’s counter-response left about 200 Taliban fighters dead, according to security officials.
The two sides afterwards agreed on a 48-hour ceasefire and to hold dialogue during that break. The ceasefire was later extended.
Friday night’s cross-border exchange, in which Pakistani forces targeted Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group positions across the border, briefly threatened to derail the Doha dialogue. However, both sides decided to proceed with the talks as planned.
 
 

The Afghan government spokesperson claimed that Pakistan had conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan hours after the ceasefire was extended on Friday for as long as the talks continued.
He claimed that the attacks targeted civilians. Afghanistan withdrew from the Twenty20 international tri-series in Pakistan next month following the alleged death of three local cricketers that the Afghanistan Cricket Board claimed were due to military strikes in Paktika.
Govt rebukes ICC
However, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistan has targeted verified camps of the “Khawarij-affiliated” Gul Bahadur group in the border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border.
In a post on X, the minister stated that during a 48-hour ceasefire, militants affiliated with the group and operating from Afghanistan attempted multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. He said all such attempts were effectively thwarted by the security forces. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan, he said.
In a later post, the minister said that Pakistan rejected the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) “selective, biased and premature comment that advances a disputed allegation, as established, that three ‘Afghan cricketers’ died in an ‘airstrike’. The ICC has cited no independent verification to substantiate these claims.”
“Pakistan strongly rejects the characterisation and contests the ICC’s claim and call for immediate correction,” he added. “Pakistan has consistently held that politics must not contaminate the sport, especially cricket, and urges the ICC to uphold its independence and the spirit of the game… Pakistan expects the ICC, led by its current Chair (Jay Shah), who happens to belong to India, to restore its neutrality, international standards of fair play and unbiased conduct.”
Amid the ongoing discussions, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim spoke separately with both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Afghan Prime Minister Muhammad Hasan Akhund, offering Malaysia’s assistance in mediating the conflict.

• Relief stalled as Israel insists Rafah crossing to stay shut until Hamas returns remains of all prisoners
• Nine members of a family killed when Israeli forces fired at bus
JERUSALEM: The United Nations aid chief on Saturday took stock of the monumental task of restoring dignity and hygiene for Palestinians struggling to survive amid Gaza’s devastation, as he witnessed residents digging latrines among the ruins, while Israel and Hamas exchanged more bodies.
A convoy of white UN jeeps carried relief coordinator Tom Fletcher and his team through the twisted rubble of shattered homes to see a wastewater treatment plant in Sheikh Radwan, north of Gaza City.
“I drove through here seven to eight months ago when most of these buildings were still standing and, to see the devastation — this is a vast part of the city, just a wasteland — and it’s absolutely devastating to see,” he told AFP.
The densely populated cities of the Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, have largely been reduced to ruins by two years of bombardment and intense fighting between Hamas and the Israeli army.
Digging latrines
Surveying the damaged pumping equ­i­pment and a grim lake of sewage at the Sheikh Radwan wastewater plant, Fle­t­cher said the task ahead for the UN and aid agencies was a “massive, massive job”.
The British diplomat said he had met residents returning to destroyed homes trying to dig latrines in the ruins.
“They’re telling me most of all they want dignity,” he said.
“We’ve got to get the power back on so we can start to get the sanitation system back in place. Fletcher outlined an ambitious relief plan. “We have a massive 60-day plan now to surge in food, get a million meals out there a day, start to rebuild the health sector, bring in tents for the winter, get hundreds of thousands of kids back into school.”
Bodies exchange and Rafah crossing
Meanwhile, Hamas has returned the final 20 surviving prisoners it was holding and has begun to hand over the remains of another 28 who died.
On Saturday, in line with the terms of the ceasefire deal, Israel returned the bodies of 15 more Palestinians to Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said.
As aid trickles in, the situation surrounding the Rafah border crossing remains disputed.
On Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the crossing would remain closed until Hamas hands over the bodies of all deceased prisoners still held in Gaza.
This contradicted an earlier announcement by the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo that the crossing would reopen on Monday. Israeli authorities, who had multiple times over the past few days delayed the border’s opening, said that when the crossing does reopen, it will permit only the movement of people, not aid.
The Gaza health ministry said that some of the bodies returned on Saturday bore signs of “abuse, beatings, handcuffing and blindfolding”.
Nine family members killed
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed nine members of a single Palestinian family when they shelled a bus on Friday, after the military confirmed it had targeted a vehicle that crossed the so-called “yellow line”.
“Our teams recovered the bodies of nine martyrs, including four children and two women, after Israeli occupation forces directly targeted the vehicle they were travelling in,” Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for the Gaza Civil Defence agency, said in a statement to AFP on Saturday.
Bassal said Israeli forces fired “two tank shells at the vehicle,” and noted that the bodies of two children remained missing, as their “remains were scattered due to the intensity of the bombardment”.
He said recovering the rem­­­­­ains has been particularly challenging because of the “difficult field and environmental conditions” in the area.

• Sets protocol on allegations, places limits on foreign invites
• Reviews 74 complaints; 70 closed, three to proceed
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Saturday approved far-reaching amendments to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges, barring them from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar, while Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
 
 

Under a substituted Article V, judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
Judges are not to interact with the media, especially on issues liable to spark public debate or undermine institutional collegiality and discipline.
Where allegations are made public against a judge, the matter may be placed in writing before a committee comprising the CJP and four senior Supreme Court judges, through the registrar, for an institutional response. Judges may not publicly discuss judicial or administrative matters, nor disclose communications relating to personal or official affairs.
The council, acting on a decision first taken on July 12, deliberated on amendments proposed by the CJP. With some modifications, these were approved by the majority and ordered to be notified in the official gazette, circulated to all superior court judges and posted on the Supreme Court’s website.
The previous 2009 code had required judges to avoid publicity and political controversy, but did not contain the new media-interaction bar or response mechanism.
 
 

A new Article XII directs judges to abstain from presiding over or attending social, cultural and diplomatic functions.
Article XIII treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct; any such invitations received personally must be routed via the relevant chief justice. Article XIV bars judges from accepting dinners or receptions hosted in their honour by individual members of the bar.
Article XV says that judges must decide cases on merit alone, possess the moral integrity and intellectual capacity to resist internal or external influence, and, where legal powers are lacking, seek an immediate institutional response.
Judges must promptly inform, in writing, the CJP and the four most senior Supreme Court judges (via the registrar) of any such attempts; high court judges must also inform their respective chief justices.
High court chief justices are to place such reports before a three-judge committee within two days, with a decision due within a fortnight.
Matters sent for judicial determination are to be decided as early as possible by adhering to the principles of fair trial and due process. If a high court chief justice or committee fails to act within time, the CJP, with four senior Supreme Court judges, will take up the matter.
The code, originally framed by the SJC in 1962 and amended up to Oct 18, 2025, under Article 209 of the Constitution, is binding on all superior court judges.
Articles I to IV and VI to XI — covering personal conduct, recusals, financial dealings, extra-judicial roles, gifts, collegiality, timely judgements and fidelity to the constitutional oath — remain in place.
SJC on misconduct
Meanwhile, the SJC examined 67 complaints under Article 209 filed by different individuals, of which 65 were unanimously closed, one was deferred, and one was ordered to be processed further by the majority.
The council was later reconstituted under Article 209(3b) with the inclusion of Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah joining, after the Islamabad High Court chief justice expressed an inability to attend for certain agenda items.
The reconstituted council reviewed seven more complaints, closing five unanimously and deciding by majority to proceed further on two.
According to an informed source, the SJC deferred the complaint against Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri until Nov 20 and issued notice to another judge of the Islamabad High Court over allegations of delayed judgement.
After decisions on the 74 complaints taken up at Saturday’s sitting, 87 cases remain pending initial consideration. The SJC has dealt with 155 matters since October 2024.

The two parties are partners in the federation, though the PPP does not have a presence in the cabinet. The disagreement between the ruling allies first surfaced last month, soon after heavy monsoon rains and flooding devastated parts of Punjab and other provinces. The PPP pushed for using the BISP to deliver immediate relief to flood-affected families, a demand resisted by the Punjab government.
Tensions deepened when PPP leaders publicly criticised the Punjab government, accusing it of politicising relief and sidelining the federal mechanism for assistance. On the other hand, PML-N ministers also voiced frustration, with Rana Sanaullah calling for a complete overhaul of BISP and arguing that its current structure was unfit.
The technical disagreement soon turned into a political confrontation, with both the ruling allies issuing counter-accusations almost on a daily basis. Earlier in October, PPP walked out of Senate and National Assembly sessions to protest what it called insults from Punjab’s PML-N leadership over the controversial Cholistan canal project and criticism of the PPP’s Sindh administration.
 
 

Today’s CEC meeting was held on the 18th anniversary of the 2007 Karsaz bombing when twin blasts ripped through the homecoming procession of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, killing over 180 people.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and PPP leader Nadeem Afzal Chan addressed a press conference after the meeting, where Rehman said the PPP chairman discussed the use of BISP to disburse flood relief funds to those affected by flooding.
“The world recognises BISP and knows that those affected by flooding need immediate assistance at their doorstep,” the senator said. “If their doorstep has been washed away, then the aid can be directly disbursed into their account.”
“We have demanded that the first tranche of aid be disbursed. Rather than engaging in political mudslinging, the government should review how we immediately distributed aid through BISP during the 2022 floods,” she added.
“We want the federal government to take notice of Chairman Bilawal’s demands and disburse aid to affected areas.”
 






Chan added that the party has decided to give the federal government more time to fulfil its demands, including the use of BISP to provide flood relief funds to those affected by the deluge in Punjab.
Other demands included changes to the system for electing local government bodies in Punjab, addressing rising energy costs and the import of crops.
“There are some promises that the prime minister promised to fulfil during our last meeting,” Chan stated. “He said, ‘these are the people’s issues’ and requested time. Today, at the CEC, the president and chairman delivered a full briefing and the meeting decided to give the [PML-N] leadership more time.”
However, our demands, which are those of the public, still stand,“ he added. “When we have our next CEC, hopefully in a few months, then we will review the situation.”
On Thursday, the PPP leadership met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other PML-N leaders, with the ruling party saying it valued and respected its coalition ally.
“The prime minister has agreed to utilise BISP for helping flood victims and that the PPP will be taken on board while decision-making about flood victims and farmers,” Chan told Dawn after Thursday’s meeting.
Chan said the PM had agr­eed to all the PPP’s demands “as they were justified and logical”.</p><small>2025-10-18 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18175531f190ea0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949734/flights-resume-at-dhaka-airport-after-fire-forced-operations-to-halt' target='_blank'><strong>Flights resume at Dhaka airport after fire forced operations to halt</strong></a><br><p>Flights have resumed at Bangladesh’s main airport in Dhaka, airport officials said, six hours after a fire in the cargo section delayed flights and halted operations on Saturday.
The first flight departed at 9:06pm, officials told reporters.
The fire has been completely brought under control, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism said in a statement.
“Steps will be taken to identify the source of the fire and implement measures to prevent such incidents in the future,” the ministry added.
Operations at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport were suspended after the fire broke out in the cargo section of the airport, with around 37 firefighting units working to douse the flames.
The army, navy, and air force also joined the fire service in efforts to bring the blaze under control.
Kabir Ahmed, president of the International Air Express Association of Bangladesh, said it was too early to estimate the exact losses, but that the overall impact - direct and indirect - on imports and exports could exceed $1 billion.
Both domestic and international flights were affected.
An IndiGo flight from Delhi to Dhaka was diverted to Kolkata, and an Air Arabia flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates was directed to Chittagong, about 250 km (155 miles) southeast of Dhaka.
This is the third major fire reported in Bangladesh this week. A fire on Tuesday at a garment factory and an adjacent chemical warehouse in Dhaka killed at least 16 people and injured others. On Thursday, another fire burned down a seven-storey garment factory building in an export processing zone in Chittagong.
The interim government said all recent fires across the country are under thorough investigation, with security forces working to protect lives and property.
It said any evidence of sabotage or arson would be met with a swift and decisive response and that no criminal act or provocation would be allowed to disrupt public life or the political process.</p><small>2025-10-18 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/182205136b8b411.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949749/pakistan-seeks-peace-stability-in-afghanistan-pm-shehbaz-tells-malaysian-counterpart' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks peace, stability in Afghanistan: PM Shehbaz tells Malaysian counterpart</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif informed his Malaysian counterpart on Saturday that Pakistan seeks peace and stability in Afghanistan but continues to face “cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”.
In a phone call with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the premier emphasised that Afghan authorities must take immediate and effective steps to dismantle terror networks operating on Afghan soil, said a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
During a state visit by the premier earlier in October, the two leaders resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc.
 






“He reaffirmed that Pakistan had agreed to a temporary ceasefire at the request of the Afghan authorities to facilitate dialogue in Doha, and stressed the importance of tangible action against all terrorist entities, including Fitna-al-Khwarij, Fitna-al-Hindustan, TTP, and BLA, to restore peace and stability along the border,” added the PMO.
Ibrahim, expressing concern at the developments, offered to play a constructive role in “reducing tensions and restoring peace and stability in the region”.
The two leaders also discussed other regional developments and PM Shehbaz briefed the Indonesian prime minister on his participation in the signing ceremony of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm-el-Sheikh. The two leaders expressed home that “it would help bring an immediate end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, ensure unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and pave the way for lasting peace and stability in the region”.
Concluding the call, both leaders agreed to remain in touch.
During a state visit by the premier earlier in October, the two leaders resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc.
In a joint statement issued following their bilateral meeting in Indonesia during Shehbaz’s visit, both prime ministers expressed satisfaction with the strong and ongoing defence collaboration under the Joint Committee on Defence Cooperation (JCDC) established in 1997.
Anwar and Shehbaz also agreed to explore collaboration in healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices with the aim of enhancing public health and commercial exchanges in these sectors.
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-18 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18225651ba65f54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949748/only-positive-way-forward-is-for-afghanistan-to-abide-by-doha-agreement-talal-chaudhry' target='_blank'><strong>Only positive way forward is for Afghanistan to abide by Doha Agreement: Talal Chaudhry</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Saturday that the only constructive solution to tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan is for Kabul to fully abide by the Doha Agreement, which bars the use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities.
Amid ongoing hostilities with Afghanistan, a high-level delegation — led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — is holding discussions with a delegation from Kabul today in the Qatari capital Doha, the Foreign Office said today.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister noted that Pakistan has tried to resolve the issue through diplomatic channels and the military’s connections to Afghanistan, but so far these attempts have failed.
“For the first time, a third country is getting involved to convey that Afghanistan has to abide by the Doha agreement, whereby they will not allow the use of their territory for acts of terrorism by anyone,” he said.
“Through a third country, a conversation is ongoing. The only positive way forward is that Afghanistan prohibits the use of its soil to all actors using it to stage acts of terror, as laid out in the Doha agreement.”
When asked if Pakistan would respond to attacks by targeting terrorists on Afghan soil, Chaudhry replied: “Why don’t things improve? It’s because they (Afghans) lack resolve and commitment. Khawarij are trained and sponsored there before they enter Pakistan.”
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
“Now, Afghanistan is shaking hands with India and recognising [occupied] Kashmir as Indian territory. We kept saying ‘they are proxies’ and now they have proven it.”
The state minister said that “proxy forces” need to remember that Pakistan will maintain its stance and do whatever is necessary to defend its people and territorial integrity.
“If terrorism is Pakistan’s internal issue, then why do they [terrorists] come from Afghanistan?” he asked, referring to recent remarks from Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating that terrorism is a country’s internal issue.
“We have identified their camps and hideouts and how they enter Pakistan. We have sent them multiple dossiers with this information, but nothing has been done,” he emphasised.
Since last weekend, Islamabad and Kabul have been engaged in a series of border clashes.
Last Sunday, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a statement.
Afghanistan claims it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Clashes broke out again earlier this week on Tuesday, with the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij exchanging fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
The FO on Wednesday announced that a temporary ceasefire was agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities, due to expire at 6pm PKT on Friday. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was extended, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-18 16:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18184232b3a4752.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949724/rain-plays-spoilsport-yet-again-as-pakistan-new-zealand-world-cup-encounter-ends-in-washout' target='_blank'><strong>Rain plays spoilsport yet again as Pakistan-New Zealand World Cup encounter ends in washout</strong></a><br><p>Rain played spoilsport yet again as Pakistan-New Zealand ICC Women’s World Cup encounter in Colombo in a washout on Saturday.
In a must-win clash to keep alive their faint semi-final hopes, Pakistan were 92-5 after 25 overs when showers forced the players off the pitch at the R. Premadasa Stadium, with the match being curtailed to 36 overs per innings before eventually being called off after 8:30pm.
An earlier stoppage in play due to the rain had reduced the innings to 46 overs a side with a 9-over play as Pakistan returned to continue their batting from 52-3.
 






Pakistan and New Zealand share a point each after tonight’s no-result as South Africa became the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament — with the Green Shirts still searching for their first win.
Speaking after the match, Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana said: “As a bowling unit, all are happy. But we need to improve our batting. We have a couple of matches. We would like to play good cricket in the next few matches.
She added that her side would try to win the next two matches and end their tournament on a high note.
Earlier, Pakistan were put into bat after losing the toss and were unchanged from their last encounter against England on Wednesday.
Opener Muneeba Ali got off to a great start — hitting a boundary off the first ball of the innings by clipping a wayward delivery to get off the mark.
She also got a reprieve when wicket-keeper Isabella Gaze dropped her in the second over of the bowling of Jess Kerr.
However, she could not capitalise on that chance with a big score as she fell for just 22, shortly after Pakistan lost Omaima Sohail.
Muneeba got out courtesy of an excellent catch by Suzie Bates at short mid-wicket, while Omaima fell victim to Lea Tahuhu’s pace — getting trapped lbw on one that skidded on.
Tahuhu continued to trouble the Pakistani batters with her brisk bowling, and the in-form Sidra Amin was her next scalp.
Sidra got out while cutting one straight to point after getting a boundary in the previous over by Sophie Devine.
That was the last delivery bowled before the heavens opened up yet again in the Sri Lankan capital — which has already seen two washouts this week and is in the midst of the monsoon season.
After the first rain-induced break, Pakistan managed only 40 more runs while losing both their captain, Fatima Sana and the set batter in Natalia Pervaiz.
Natalia fell while trying to up the rate against spinner Eden Carson while the captain continued her lean patch with the bat — getting bowled by a Amelia Kerr googly.
 






On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain, with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo. The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.
Teams:
Pakistan: Omaima Sohail, Muneeba Ali, Sidra Amin, Aliya Riaz, Natalia Pervaiz, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper), Fatima Sana (captain), Rameen Shamim, Diana Baig, Nashra Sandhu, and Sadia Iqbal.
New Zealand: Suzie Bates, Georgia Plimmer, Amelia Kerr, Sophie Devine (capt), Brooke Halliday, Maddy Green, Isabella Gaze,  Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Eden Carson, and Lea Tahuhu.</p><small>2025-10-18 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/182114578dc0f43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949695/zimbabwe-roped-in-after-afghanistan-pulls-out-of-upcoming-tri-nation-series' target='_blank'><strong>Zimbabwe roped in after Afghanistan pulls out of upcoming tri-nation series</strong></a><br><p>Zimbabwe Cricket on Saturday accepted the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) invitation to participate in a T20I tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka, following the withdrawal of the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB).

Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire.
“Zimbabwe Cricket has accepted the Pakistan Cricket Board’s invitation to participate in a T20I tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka,” a statement from the PCB said.
The maiden tri-series on Pakistan soil has been scheduled to provide all three sides with preparation ahead of next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the cricket board added.
ICC ‘appalled’ by deaths of three Afghan cricketers
The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday night issued a statement on the deaths of three Afghan cricketers in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, stating it was “deeply saddened and appalled”.
“The three young men had returned home after participating in a friendly cricket match when they were killed in an attack that also claimed the lives of several civilians,” the governing body said.
“The ICC strongly condemns this act of violence that has robbed families, communities, and the cricketing world of three bright talents whose only ambition was to play the sport they loved,” it added.
“The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief.”
Afghanistan pulls out of series
In a post on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike.
It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match.
“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November.
Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a post on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan.
Pakistan was set to host the series from November 17 to 29.
Earlier, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Spokesperson Amir Mir told Dawn.com that the tri-series was still on and the third team would be finalised shortly.
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan against the outlawed Gul Bahadur group last night.
“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said on X.
 






Cricket icon Shahid Afridi took to X and said that Afghanistan, in its acts of aggression, had forgotten Pakistan’s hospitality and “favours”.
“Pakistan has always stood by its Afghan brothers, considering the troubles of Afghans as its own trouble,” the former all-rounder wrote. “It opened its borders for its brothers. It accommodated 4 million refugees on its land.
“I have to say that in recent days, Afghanistan, forgetting all these favours, committed open aggression on the borders, to which our forces gave a full response,” he added.
Afridi wrote that Afghanistan should think of Pakistan as a brotherly Islamic country and should not allow its land to be used to aid acts of terrorism.
 






Pak Afghan tensions
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP.
Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.
On Tuesday night, fighting flared up again on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Meanwhile, in a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past.
 






“There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.</p><small>2025-10-18 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18142445c66bbfe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949718/delegation-led-by-defence-minister-holds-talks-with-taliban-representatives-in-doha' target='_blank'><strong>Delegation led by defence minister holds talks with Taliban representatives in Doha</strong></a><br><p>Amid ongoing hostilities with Afghanistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday that a high-level delegation — led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — is holding discussions with a delegation from the neighbouring country today in Doha.
“The talks will focus on immediate measures to end cross-border terrorism against Pakistan emanating from Afghanistan and restore peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border,” it said.
 






“Pakistan does not seek escalation but urges the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities,” it said.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said.
It was not immediately clear how long the talks would last. Officials on both sides have said they could be extended from Saturday, adding senior intelligence officials from both countries were part of the talks.
Earlier, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesperson for the Taliban government, had also confirmed that talks between the two countries would take place in the Qatari capital.
In a post on social media platform X, Mujahid said, “As it was promised that negotiations would be held with the Pakistani side, a high-level delegation of the Islamic Emirate, led by the Minister of Defence Maulvi Sahib Muhammad Yaqub Mujahid, left for Doha today.”
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would also include intelligence chief, Mullah Wasiq, besides the defence minister.
Minister says Pakistan carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan last night
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan struck verified camps of the outlawed Gul Bahadur group in border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border.
In a post on X, he said that during the 48-hour ceasefire, terrorists operating from Afghanistan attempted to launch multiple terrorists attacks inside Pakistan, which were effectively countered by security forces.
“During the effective responses by security forces, more than 100 kharjis were sent to hell,” he said. He said that terrorist also carried out an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in North Waziristan in which civilians and a soldier were martyred while multiple others were injured.
“Against kharjis of Gul Bahadur Group, precision strikes were undertaken last night. In these precision strikes, [a] minimum [of] 60-70 kharjis and their leadership have been sent to hell based on confirmed intelligence reports,” the minister said.
“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said.
“Pakistan sincerely believes that [the] path forward lies in resolving this complex issue of Indian-sponsored terrorism emanating from Afghan soil through talks and control of non-state actors by Afghan authorities. However, Pakistan has all the rights to safeguard its territorial integrity and the lives of the people of Pakistan, and we shall not allow terrorists operating from inside Afghanistan to live in peace,” he said.
 






Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended a two-day ceasefire.
The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) also said that it was pulling out of a T20I tri-nations series scheduled to be held in Pakistan next month after alleging that three cricketers were killed in a strike.
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night had cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.</p><small>2025-10-18 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18103905bc35b5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949711/no-space-for-war-in-nuclearised-environment-coas-munir-cautions-india' target='_blank'><strong>No space for war in nuclearised environment, COAS Munir cautions India</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on 7 May, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.
“The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.”
“Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned.

“With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace.
“The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said.
“The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the conventional domain, as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said.
 
 

“Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride.
“The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq [and] Operation Bunyan um Marsoos has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May conflict with India.

“Downing advanced […] Rafales, targeting multiple bases including S-400s, and showcasing multi-domain warfare capabilities, Pakistan has displayed its capabilities and will to defend,” COAS Munir asserted.
 
 

He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”.
“Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions.
“India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to neutral investigations and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added.
 
 

COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary.
“Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,” he said, assuring the nation that “we will not lose an inch of this sacred land”.
He commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”.
“The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added.
The army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting investments from across the world.
“The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.”
 
 

He also reiterated his cautions about social media, calling on people to be cognisant of threats “proliferating via digital media, populist anarchism and social subversion”.
“Unfortunately, in the post-truth era in which we live, perceptions bear more weight than reality and half-truths spread faster than facts. Your strength will lie in thinking critically and discerning fact from fiction,” he said, urging them to not become “tools of disinformation”.
Choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS tells Kabul
The army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Our adversary’s use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Urging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
 
 

“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Speaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” in the valley will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the dispute in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions.

‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’
During his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”.
“Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.
He also mentioned the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”.
COAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate.
Hailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.”
He lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”.
“We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.”
 
 

COAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the diplomatic efforts to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the ceasefire to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza.
“Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he reaffirmed.
‘Enemies hell-bent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’
Addressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”.
“This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored.
“Remember, our enemies are hell-bent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted.
He told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country.
“The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said.
Underscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, life-long learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”.
At the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”.
He also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”.
“This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said.
He highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.</p><small>2025-10-18 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/181745139ec8a91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949732/punjab-extends-province-wide-section-144-for-another-week-citing-security-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab extends province-wide Section 144 for another week citing security threats</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Home Department on Saturday extended the imposition of Section 144 across the province for another week, citing security threats amid continuing tensions with the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. It was imposed on Thursday till today amid the government’s crackdown on the TLP following its violent protests.
A complete, province-wide ban was imposed on the display of all kinds of weapons, use of loudspeakers, and publication and distribution of inflammatory, hateful or sectarian material. The ban did not apply to wedding ceremonies, funerals and burials, and loudspeakers could only be used to deliver sermons in mosques and call for prayers.
The Home Department’s order issued today said it was evident that the “threat perception to public peace, tranquillity and law and order has not abated” upon review of the latest reports and threat assessments discussed by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
A statement from the Home Department spokesperson said the order was issued in view of concerns regarding terrorism and public safety.
“Due to security threats, public processions and sit-ins could become soft targets for terrorists. Miscreants could exploit public protests to carry out anti-state activities to fulfil their nefarious objectives,” it added.
“The continuance of the restrictions is deemed essential to prevent any potential disturbance to public order, sectarian strife, or commission of any offence, and to ensure the safety and security of the lives and property of the general public,” the order reads.
 






After tensions, violence and chaos prevailing for several days, Punjab remained largely peaceful on Friday as no incident of violence or hostile gatherings was reported in any part of the province in response to the call given by the TLP to its workers to take out rallies in protest against the police action at Muridke.
The TLP even failed to bring its workers onto the roads in Lahore, where it had been holding violent protests during the last few days. Reports suggest that the Punjab police successfully established the writ of law in the provincial capital and other cities where traffic and businesses remained running, while students attended their educational institutions as per routine on Friday.
People were witnessed shopping in the city markets, while the outlets of multinational companies, especially the fast food joints, also remained open.
A large-scale pre-dawn operation by law enforcement agencies on Monday to dismantle TLP’s protest camp in Muridke had sparked violent clashes, widespread chaos, and multiple arrests. The party had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
As per the official figures, as many as 2,716 people were arrested after the Muridke operation. Out of these, some 251 were taken into custody by Lahore police and 178 by Sheikhpura police.
Even as police intensify their crackdown on the group following the events that transpired in Muridke, the authorities have decided to take a series of measures to “neutralise” the threat the TLP has posed to the law enforcers and non-Muslim communities since its inception.
The decision to limit the activities of the party are being linked to some crucial meetings, where the TLP’s tainted record of violent agitations, fatal attacks on the law enforcers, as well as ransacking of Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship, came under discussion.
Tallal Chaudhry, the minister of state for interior, has said action against the TLP protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of those involved in the May 9, 2023, riots, which led to a country-wide crackdown on the PTI.
The federal government had previously imposed a ban on the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march to Islamabad.
Restrictions were also briefly imposed on the TLP in June 2023, when the party was carrying out a long march from Lahore to Islamabad. Restrictions lifted under an agreement reached on June 17, 2023, included a ban on the party’s coverage on electronic and social media.</p><small>2025-10-18 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18161247ad5c646.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949726/24-transgender-persons-hospitalised-in-indias-indore-after-mass-suicide-bid-reports' target='_blank'><strong>24 transgender persons hospitalised in India’s Indore after ‘mass suicide’ bid: reports</strong></a><br><p>At least twenty-four people from the transgender community were hospitalised in the city of Indore in India’s Madhya Pradesh state after consuming disinfectant in a “mass suicide” bid related to a dispute with a rival group, multiple Indian media outlets reported.
NDTV reported that the incident occurred on Wednesday night and they were hospitalised soon after.
“They have claimed to have consumed phenyl together, but this cannot be immediately confirmed,” the report quoted Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital  Superintendent-in-Charge  Dr Basant Kumar Ningwal as saying, adding that none of them were in a critical condition.
“What triggered the mass act by the transgender persons was not immediately clear,” the report said. Meanwhile, The Hindu reported that the incident occurred “following an altercation with … a rival group leader and her associates”.
Indore Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajesh Dandotiya told the outlet that the rival group leader was arrested on Thursday and a case was registered against her and three associates for alleged assault and extortion.
“As per the FIR (first information report), there was a dispute between the two factions of the community and that [the rival group leader] and her associates allegedly threatened and assaulted the 24 persons when they demanded some money from a deposit collected for a community conference, prompting them to try to harm themselves,” the report added.
It further said that a previous FIR had been lodged on Tuesday against one of the associates after a trans woman accused him and another of the three men of “posing as journalists” and issuing threats, along with blackmailing and raping her.
The Print reported that Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said the two used to blackmail the victim by feigning to be journalists and going to the transgender community’s gathering in Nandlalpura in June 2025.
“The victim belongs to the Kinnar society. The victim has said that the two … claimed to be journalists, used to threaten her that they would defame her and an FIR would be registered against her, as happened in the case of her gurus. On June 12, the accused went to the dera. The accused … assaulted the victim, sexually and physically,” the report quoted him as telling reporters.
It added that they were booked under Section 18 of the Transgender Protection Act 2019 and for intimidation.
The report further said that other members of the community had reached the hospital and demanded that the suspects be arrested, with one member threatening to end her life if the group’s demands were not met. “They also attempted suicide in the hospital by pouring kerosene, which was foiled by the police,” the report added.
Despite being legally recognised as a third gender in a historic 2014 apex court ruling, the transgender community in India often lives on the extreme fringes of Indian society, with many forced into prostitution, begging or menial jobs.</p><small>2025-10-18 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18140946c5582d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949723/iran-says-no-longer-bound-by-restrictions-on-its-nuclear-programme' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says no longer bound by ‘restrictions’ on its nuclear programme</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Saturday that it was no longer bound by restrictions on its nuclear programme as a landmark 10-year deal between it and world powers expired, though Tehran reiterated its “commitment to diplomacy”.
The 2015 deal — signed in Vienna by Iran, China, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — saw the lifting of international sanctions against the Islamic Republic in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear programme.
But the pact had already been in tatters after Washington unilaterally withdrew during President Donald Trump’s first term, with Iran later pulling back from its commitments.
The reimposition last month of UN sanctions at the urging of three of the deal’s European signatories rendered the accord effectively moot.
From now on, “all of the provisions (of the deal), including the restrictions on the Iranian nuclear programme and the related mechanisms are considered terminated”, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement on the day of the pact’s expiration.
“Iran firmly expresses its commitment to diplomacy,” it added.
Western powers have long accused Iran of secretly seeking nuclear weapons — something it has repeatedly denied, insisting its nuclear programme is solely for civilian purposes such as energy production.
The deal’s “termination day” was set for October 18, 2025, exactly 10 years after it was enshrined in the UN’s Security Council resolution 2231.
The accord capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent in exchange for sanctions relief and provided for strict supervision of its nuclear activities by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
But Washington left the deal in 2018 and reinstated sanctions, after which Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme.
According to the IAEA, Iran is the only country without a nuclear weapons programme to enrich uranium to 60pc That is close to the threshold of 90pc required for a bomb, and well above the level needed for civilian nuclear use.
‘Irresponsible actions’
In July, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA following the war with Israel, with Tehran pointing to the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities.
The unprecedented bombing campaign by Israel and the retaliation by Iran during the 12-day war derailed ongoing nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
At the initiative of France, Britain and Germany, widespread UN sanctions against Iran returned into force in late September for the first time in a decade.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a letter addressed to the United Nations on Saturday that the expiration of the 2015 deal renders the sanctions “null and void”.
Britain, France and Germany accuse Iran of not cooperating with the IAEA and would like it to return to negotiations with the United States.
“Iran’s efforts to revive the exchanges (with the IAEA) that led to the agreement in Cairo were also sabotaged by the irresponsible actions of the three European countries,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in Saturday’s statement, referring to a recent framework to resume cooperation.</p><small>2025-10-18 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18121805cd4cc36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949717/3-terrorists-killed-as-bannu-police-thwart-attack-on-checkpost' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists killed as Bannu police thwart attack on checkpost</strong></a><br><p>Three terrorists were killed after they attempted to attack a police checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu late last night, police said in a statement on Saturday.
KP police said that three terrorists belonging to the Fitna-al-Khawarij had made an unsuccessful attempt to target the Mazanga police checkpost last night.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Police said the terrorists were attempting to attack the Mazanga police checkpost using a rickshaw loaded with explosive material. During this attempt, they were intercepted by police officials who tried to stop them due to their suspicious activity, the police said.
When they did not stop, officials opened fire which caused the rickshaw to explode, the statement said, adding that all three terrorists were killed while police personnel remained safe.
The explosion caused minor damage to nearby houses, it added.
According to the statement, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan and Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kalachi lauded the prompt and courageous response of the policemen, saying they had “set an exemplary standard of duty, bravery, and professionalism“.
The statement said that Bannu police was “fully committed to protecting the lives and property of the people at all costs”. The statement added that the DIG and the DPO had also announced cash rewards and certificates for the officers stationed at the checkpoint.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Thursday, the military said security forces had killed 34 “India-backed” terrorists during multiple operations that took place across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the span of three days.</p><small>2025-10-18 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18111045ee44978.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949716/finance-minister-briefs-world-bank-president-on-govts-flood-response' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister briefs World Bank president on govt’s flood response</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with World Bank (WB) President Ajay Banga in Washington and briefed him on the government’s flood response efforts, the finance ministry said on Saturday.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC, where Aurangzeb had arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip from Oct 13 to 18.
In a statement issued today, the ministry said that Aurangzeb briefed Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the Bank’s timely support following the completion of the post-flood damage assessment.
 






The minister also endorsed the proposal of leveraging technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience”, the statement read. Aurangzeb also thanked the WB for “its technical assistance” in developing Pakistan’s tariff policy, it added.
The statement said that Aurangzeb informed Banga about the memorandums of understanding signed with the provinces for the implementation of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF).
He also recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s engagement with Banga during the UN General Assembly (UNGA) session and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to “deepening its partnership” with the WB.
“The minister also requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach towards reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency,” the statement said.
Fitch ratings
In a separate meeting, Aurangzeb sat with officials from Fitch Ratings, thanking the agency for upgrading Pakistan’s credit rating to B- with a stable outlook.
The minister expressed satisfaction that all three major international rating agencies were now aligned in their assessments of Pakistan’s economy, the ministry said.
 






He also briefed the Fitch team on the recently announced Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) with the Fund.
Aurangzeb outlined “Pakistan’s progress on key structural reforms in taxation, energy, privatisation, and state-owned enterprises”.
The statement added that the minister reiterated the government’s commitment to accelerating the privatisation process to enhance efficiency and ensure fiscal sustainability.
Aurangzeb also apprised the Fitch delegation of the government’s ongoing efforts to issue Panda Bonds in the Chinese market and highlighted successful trade and tariff negotiations with the US administration, which he said had led to more competitive tariff rates for Pakistan.
Aurangzeb meets UK minister
The finance minister also met with United Kingdoms Minister for International Development and Africa Baroness Jenny Chapman in Washington.
“The finance minister appreciated the UK’s longstanding development partnership and support for Pakistan’s reform and growth agenda. He particularly acknowledged the continued collaboration on the development of the Digital Dashboard initiative aimed at improving transparency and efficiency in project monitoring,” the ministry said.
 






Aurangzeb also underscored the importance of enhanced consultation with relevant stakeholders in the selection and implementation of development projects to “ensure alignment with national priorities”.
“He emphasised the need for greater visibility and coordination on off-budget projects to improve oversight and outcomes,” it said, adding that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to “further strengthening Pakistan–UK development cooperation”.
Roundtable discussion
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb also participated in a roundtable discussion titled ‘Challenges and Opportunities for the Pakistani Economy through 2025 and Beyond’ that was organised by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).
He briefed participants on Pakistan’s recent macroeconomic progress, including the staff-level agreement reached with the Fund and subsequent credit rating upgrades by major international rating agencies.
 






He highlighted the ongoing transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
“The minister also provided an update on the pace of privatisation and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to sustaining reform momentum,” the ministry said.
Aurangzeb also noted that recent geopolitical developments were “favourable for Pakistan” and had opened new avenues for economic cooperation and investment, it added.</p><small>2025-10-18 06:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1811031374ccd2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949713/china-and-us-agree-to-fresh-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>China and US agree to fresh trade talks</strong></a><br><p>China and the United States agreed on Saturday to conduct another round of trade negotiations in the coming week, as the world’s two biggest economies seek to avoid another damaging tit-for-tat tariff battle.
Beijing last week announced sweeping controls on the critical rare earths industry, prompting US President Donald Trump to threaten 100 percent tariffs on imports from China in retaliation.
Trump had also threatened to cancel his expected meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.
In the latest indication of efforts to resolve their dispute, Chinese state media reported that Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges” during a Saturday morning call, and that both sides agreed to hold a new round of trade talks “as soon as possible”.
On social media, Bessent described the call as “frank and detailed”, and said they would meet “in-person next week to continue our discussions”.
 






Bessent had previously accused China of seeking to harm the rest of the world by tightening restrictions rare earths, which are critical to everything from smartphones to guided missiles.
 
 

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also participated in the call, according to the report by Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Hours before the call, Fox News released excerpts of an interview with Trump in which he said he would meet Xi at the APEC summit after all.
Trump told the outlet that the 100 per cent tariff on goods from China was not sustainable.
“It’s not sustainable, but that’s what the number is… They forced me to do that,” he said.
Coordinated response
The high-level video call came as Washington worked to rally Group of Seven finance ministers in response to the latest Chinese export controls.
For now, the G7 ministers have agreed to coordinate a short-term response and diversify suppliers, the EU’s economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Washington.
Speaking after the grouping met this week, Dombrovskis noted the vast majority of rare earth supplies come from China, meaning that diversification could take years.
“We agreed, both bilaterally with the US and at the G7 level, to coordinate our approach,” he said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s fall meetings.
Countries would also exchange information on their contacts with Chinese counterparts as they work out short-term solutions, he added.
German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil told journalists he hopes that Trump and Xi’s meeting can help to resolve much of the US-China trade conflict.
“We have made it clear within the G7 that we do not agree with China’s approach,” he added, referring to the group of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva also expressed hope Friday for an agreement between the countries to cool tensions.
The US-China trade war reignited this year as Trump promised sweeping tariffs on imports soon after returning to office.
At one point, US-China tariffs escalated to triple-digit levels, effectively halting some trade as businesses waited for a resolution.
The two countries have since lowered their respective levies but their truce has remained shaky.</p><small>2025-10-18 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18094536fd3011d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949604/kp-cm-afridi-refuses-to-attend-pms-huddle-on-afghan-refugees' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi refuses to attend PM’s huddle on Afghan refugees</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi on Friday declined to attend a top-level huddle chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to chalk out a course of action regarding the future of Afghan refugees.
However, Mr Afridi was represented by Muzzamil Aslam, former adviser to the chief minister on finance, in the meeting.
In a statement on X, the chief minister said that he had declined to attend a federal government’s meeting about agriculture and Afghan refugees on the ground that attending such meetings without policy guidelines from detained PTI founder Imran Khan would be an insult to people’s mandate.
He hoped that the federal government would resolve the issue of his meeting with Mr Khan and direct relevant authorities to arrange his regular meetings with the party’s founder.
Mr Afridi said that his legal team was approaching the Islamabad High Court and other forums on the matter.
 







Hopes Centre will ensure his meeting with Imran in jail

Earlier in the day, he was denied a meeting with Mr Imran in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. He returned after waiting for permission for over two hours.
Mr Afridi has approached Supreme Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi through the registrar of the apex court, requesting him to direct the federal government and other relevant authorities to arrange his meeting with Mr Imran.
 
 

The letter, sent by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, said that following his election as the chief minister, Mr Afridi was under constitutional and moral obligation to consult Imran Khan for guidance and instruction on urgent and sensitive matters concerning governance and cabinet formation in the province.
“I have already approached the secretary of the ministry of interior and secretary home department Punjab for arranging a meeting Mr Khan; however, despite repeated communications follow-ups, the said meeting has not yet been confirmed,” the letter noted.
It added that Mr Afridi was responsible for the governance and securing the fundamental rights and matters relating to the security situation, formation of provincial cabinet, and critical economic challenges faced by the people of the province.
“There is a pressing need to seek direction from Mr [Imran] Khan regarding these matters and others related to the federation and other provinces,” the letter said. It said that seeking the PTI founder’s directions was extremely essential as the Punjab government had stopped inter-provincial trade of flour and wheat.
Mr Afridi, who took oath of office on Wednesday after several days of deadlock, has yet not to form his cabinet.
Talking to reporters on the Peshawar High Court’s premises here on Thursday, he said that he would announce his cabinet after getting its approval from Mr Imran.
Meanwhile, former adviser to the chief minister Muzzammil Aslam told Dawn that in the meeting with PM, he raised the province’s concerns over the hasty closure of 28 refugee camps in the province, as ordered by the federal government on Monday.
 
 

He said that KP had 38 refugee camps compared to 10 in Punjab and one in Balochistan, so the Centre shouldn’t take any hasty decision on the matter.
Mr Aslam said he also raised the issue of dignified return of refugees as well as business visa policy for Afghan businessmen.
He said that the meeting agreed that KP and the interior ministry would hold a meeting over the repatriation of refugees.

However, his father, Assistant Commissioner Ziarat Muhammad Afzal Baqi, is still missing, and authorities are making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Police officials said that after his recovery, Mustansar Bilal, the son of assistant commissioner, reached the Zardalo area of Harnai, from where he was taken into protective custody and handed over to the Deputy Commissioner Harnai.
It may be recalled that the assistant commissioner and his son were abducted about two months ago by unidentified armed men while returning to Ziarat after a picnic along with their family. The kidnappers allowed the family members, security guard and driver to go home after setting the official vehicle on fire.
 
 

On Sept 21, reports circulated that the kidnappers had killed AC Ziarat and dumped his body in a mountainous area of Harnai district. An official of Ziarat administration also confirmed that Afzal Baqi had been killed by the kidnappers and even released a photograph purported to be his body.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti later informed the provincial assembly that the killing of the assistant commissioner was not confirmed, assuring that the government was making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Officials said that Mustansar Bilal reached the Zardalo area of Harnai district and informed local authorities about his presence in the area. “Mustansar is safe and sound in the custody of Deputy Commissioner Harnai,” police officials said.
Authorities, however, said that AC Ziarat remains missing and efforts were underway for his safe recovery. They did not disclose how Mustansar Bilal managed to reach Harnai.

In addition, security forces claimed to have foiled a terror bid in Bajaur after a large cache of explosives, loaded into a non-Customs paid vehicle, was destroyed in Lowi Mamund tehsil.
In Lakki Marwat, officials said an operation was launched on reports about the presence of militants in the rural area located on the border with Punjab, near Mianwali.
Security forces spotted the terrorist hideout in the forest between Kaichi Kamar and Sultankhel, which was reportedly targeted through a unmanned drone.

Forces foil major terror bid in Bajaur by disabling explosive-laden vehicle

During the operation, eight militants were eliminated and their hideouts were destroyed, while security forces seized a large quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives and launched a sanitisation operation to neutralise any other threats in the area.
 
 

Separately, TTP ‘commander’ Tariq Kochi, who hails from Toi Khula tehsil of Lower South Waziristan, was reportedly killed near the border with Balochistan by unidentified gunmen.
Sources said the incident occurred near the Tesh mountain range, where Kochi and other militants were ambushed by unidentified individuals.
Police said that Kochi had been involved for the past year in multiple incidents of attacks, shootings, and target killings targeting security forces, police personnel, and civilians in the area.
Security forces also claimed to have foiled a terrorism bid by destroying a huge cache of explosives loaded in a car in Bajaur.
A senior police official said that the sabotage bid was foiled in Thangai area at around 11:15 am, when the security personnel targeted a suspected vehicle laden with explosives.
DPO Waqas Rafique said the explosives-laden vehicle was disabled by firing at it, adding that no loss of life was reported.
The official, however, said that an investigation was underway to ascertain who was behind the failed sabotage bid.

Speaking at a signing ceremony, the prime minister described the transaction as “the first drop of rain” in a broader effort to deepen economic collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.
 






The event marked the official transfer of a majority stake in FWBL to IHC under a government-to-government (G2G) framework. The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.
The federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.

Buyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements

In addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.
Privatisation momentum
PM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.
He added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.
IHC sees long-term growth
IHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.
“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.
According to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act 2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.
