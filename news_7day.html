Trump, while repeating his false claim that Mamdani is a “communist,” said on his Truth Social platform that the meeting “will take place at the Oval Office on Friday”.
Mamdani’s spokesperson Dora Pekec confirmed the meeting in a statement.
 






“As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago,” Pekec said on Wednesday.
Trump’s meeting with Mamdani marks the coming together of two men raised in the Queens borough of New York, but their similarities may end there.
 
 

While Trump frequently touts the record-breaking gains on Wall Street during his presidency, Mamdani’s view on the economy extends beyond the bullish financial markets in downtown Manhattan to an affordability crisis facing a city of over 8 million people.
As the first mayoral candidate to surpass the one-million-vote mark in New York since 1969, Mamdani campaigned on pledges of affordable housing and childcare, as well as free rides on city buses and city-run grocery stores.
Experts have questioned Mamdani’s ability to deliver on his idealistic and broad-reaching platform.
Virulently anti-immigrant Trump has derided Mamdani’s South Asian name, and threatened to cut federal funding for New York upon the Muslim’s election to run America’s largest city.
“Mandami, whatever the hell his name is,” Trump said recently — deliberately mispronouncing the Uganda-born politician’s surname.
Mamdani has not backed down from Trump, calling out the 79-year-old Republican during his victory rally earlier this month.
“Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you — turn the volume up!” he said to his cheering supporters.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed the president had indeed watched Mamdani speak.</p><small>2025-11-20 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20093240c59e53a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956110/karachi-to-become-5th-largest-city-in-world-by-2050-un' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to become 5th largest city in world by 2050: UN</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The city of Karachi is expected to become one of the 10 largest cities in the world between 2025 and 2030 with a rapid population growth, which is expected to continue through mid-century.
According to the summary results of the ‘World Urbanisation Prospects  2025’, released by the United Nations, Karachi could rise to fifth place with a projected population of almost 33 million in 2050, overtaking Cairo (32 million), Tokyo (31 million), Guangzhou, China (29 million), Manila, Philippines (27 million), and Kolkata, India (24 million).
The report says the number of megacities quadrupled from eight in 1975 to 33 in 2025 — over half in Asia with 19 megacities, and projections indicate that there will be 37 megacities globally by 2050.
 
 

Fast-growing Dhaka is expected to become the world’s largest city by mid-century.
Meanwhile, Tokyo is projected to fall in rank from third in 2025 to seventh in 2050, as its population shrinks to around 31 million.
In 2025, the world’s most densely populated cities have more than 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. Many of these densely populated cities are also among the world’s most populous, including Karachi with 25,000 people per square kilometre.
The global rural population is expected to peak sometime during the 2040s and then begin to gradually decline.
The two most populous countries, India and China, will also have the largest populations residing in towns between now and 2050.
From 2000 to 2025, the global population living in cities increased by 1.25 billion, but over half of this growth came from only a few countries.
India, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States have collectively contributed over 500 million people to the global city population.
The world has become increasingly urban; more people live in cities today than in towns or rural areas.
In 1950, city living was relatively unusual: just 20 per cent of the world’s 2.5 billion people lived in cities, defined as population centres. Following many decades of urbanisation, cities are now (in 2025) home to 45 per cent of the world’s 8.2 billion people, more than double the proportion in 1950.
Rural communities are less densely populated than cities and towns.
Worldwide, more than 3,000 cities experienced population decline between 2015 and 2025, according to the report.

This dismissal is fundamentally flawed. It misses the unprecedented transformation unfolding across the global economy.
The Conference of the Parties process under the UNFCCC is the most consequential engine for a paradigm shift in global development. It has created an irreversible ecosystem of change that is accelerating transformation across every major sector. The process has succeeded not through mandate but by embedding innovations in science, economics, ecology, and legal accountability into the global policy bloodstream. COP has effectively rewired the global development trajectory.
UNFCCC’s uniqueness: The climate convention that works through annual COPs is uniquely anchored in robust, consensus-driven science from the IPCC, whose First Assessment Report in 1990 confirmed that human activities were substantially increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and causing global warming, directly catalysing the UNFCCC’s adoption in 1992. No other environmental convention has such a powerful, independent scientific body constantly updating evidence. The IPCC reports are formally accepted by governments and directly shape ambition for subsequent negotiations, creating a built-in ratchet mechanism through the UNFCCC’s five-yearly Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that compels countries to progressively increase climate ambition backed by latest science.
The UNFCCC has superseded virtually all other global development frameworks. SDG-13 on climate action has become the organising lens through which all other development goals are interpreted. Climate finance rivals traditional development assistance. The NDCs under the Paris Agreement often command more resources than national SDG implementation plans. The COP process has catalysed new fields of intellectual inquiry: climate finance architecture, just transition, climate litigation, net-zero pathways, adaptation economics, climate-triggered displacement, migration, and conflicts.

Three decades of COP negotiations have transformed climate action.

Climate change poses an existential planetary threat measurable by single, universally understood metrics: GHG emissions and global average temperature rise, with the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold serving as a clear danger line. In contrast, the sister Rio conventions on biodiversity and desertification grapple with multifaceted, localised variables that lack such universal, disruptive metrics. Similarly, climate adaptation and resilience, despite being critical for vulnerable countries like Pakistan, lack standardised global metrics, making it harder to mobilise international finance and political attention compared to mitigation efforts.
Transformations & barriers: The world has not succeeded in limiting global warming to the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C threshold, and this failure carries consequences. Yet to dismiss the past decade as wasted would be to ignore substantial accomplishments. Ten years ago, scientific models projected warming of up to 3.8°C by century’s end. Today, that projection has improved to between 2.5 and 2.9°C — still dangerous but representing nearly one degree of warming averted through collective action.
 
 

Three decades of COP negotiations have transformed climate action from diplomatic aspiration into structural economic reality, driven mostly by economic imperatives. Solar power costs have plummeted, making renewable energy the cheapest option for new power generation worldwide. E-vehicles have moved from luxury novelty to market reality as one in five cars sold globally is now electric. Clean energy investment has reached unprecedented levels. Financial markets have reoriented, with climate risk now recognised as fiduciary risk. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero represents over $130 trillion in assets.
These transformations occurred during the hottest decade on record — a reminder that progress and peril coexist. The world is still failing to meet the 1.5°C benchmark. More troubling is the inability to finance adaptation. While mitigation finance flows relatively freely, especially private sector investments, adaptation finance remains insufficient.
This gap reflects a fundamental asymmetry in the global climate architecture where those least responsible for the crisis bear its heaviest burdens. At COP29, countries acknowledged developing nations require $1.3tr annually by 2035 to manage climate impacts, including $300 billion yearly for adaptation in public finance from developed countries. The commitment falls short of actual need, and where this money will come from remains uncertain. Global warming already inflicts some $1.4tr in annual economic damage worldwide. These costs fall disproportionately on those least responsible yet most vulnerable. The adaptation finance promised represents less than what the world already loses each year, underscoring the inadequacy of international response.
The question is no longer whether transition is possible but whether it can accelerate sufficiently to avert catastrophe. Infrastructure, technology, and economic logic for decarbonisation now exist. What is uncertain is whether national political systems can translate the momentum to adopt their ecosystems of change.
Pakistan’s dilemmas: Pakistan’s experience reflects both promise and challenge. We have witnessed an explosive rooftop solar revolution while official energy planning paradoxically pursues coal projects that global markets have deemed stranded assets. The farm sector responds, but only to international pressure. Major cities remain absent from global transformative networks like C40. While PSDP has not leapt forward, major infrastructure projects face climate risk screening from international lenders. The SECP has begun to push for sustainability reporting standards, but these market-driven shifts have not translated into a coherent national reform agenda.
Pakistan’s adaptation needs are estimated at 10 to 18 times larger than current public finance flows, creating a dangerous situation where crucial domestic reforms are delayed pending promised climate finance that may not arrive. The structural asymmetry compounds this: international funding for mitigation flows as a global public good, while adaptation remains unattended and underfunded.
The UNFCCC has spurred global transformation with undeniable economic benefits. Countries that have embraced this shift report more jobs and stronger growth rates. China’s experience is striking: it now earns more from green technologies than the US does from fossil fuels. Yet we must be clear about what COPs can and cannot do. They set direction and global ambition only within the bounds of consensus. National ambition, reform agendas, and delivery mechanisms remain the responsibility of each country. The COP is not an alternative to domestic action.

The visit, marked by pageantry and frequent displays of mutual admiration, reaffirms the nearly nine-decade-old relationship between the kingdom and the US. There was talk of investment, while the US president declared that the kingdom was now a major non-Nato ally.
This may have fallen short of the crown prince’s expectations, who wanted stronger defence commitments, and the designation is likely a consolation prize. When the issue of the so-called Abraham Accords, and the associated recognition of Israel — Mr Trump has long tried to sell the idea to the Saudis — came up, the prince answered diplomatically. “We want to be part” of the accords, “but”, he added, there needs to be “a clear path [to the] two-state solution”.
 
 

If Saudi Arabia were to join the accords, and recognise Israel, it would open the pathway for the Zionist state’s normalisation with most of the Muslim world, considering that the kingdom hosts Islam’s holiest cities. Yet Mohammed Bin Salman surely realises that embracing Israel just after it has paused the Gaza genocide, and while the Zionist regime refuses to accept even the possibility of a Palestinian state, may not go down well with his own people and the Muslim/Arab street. Israel is in no mood to consider a Palestinian state, and talk of the two-state solution currently is pure fantasy. If Mr Trump is serious about the Abraham Accords, he needs to tell his friends in Tel Aviv that without Palestinian self-determination, there can be no normalisation.
Rumours have also swirled of Pakistan being ‘pressurised’ to accept the Zionist state. So serious had the chatter become that the foreign minister had to deny speculation that Pakistan was about to normalise ties with Israel. Pakistan’s UN representative also recently reiterated that the country was committed to the establishment of the state of Palestine.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have had enough of hollow promises. Unless the promise of a sovereign, contiguous and viable Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital, is realised, the people of Palestine cannot be expected to give up resisting their occupiers, and struggling for the freedom of their homeland. Until Palestine is free, Muslim states must not reward Israel with recognition.

Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared earlier this year when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was blamed on Islamabad, which denied the accusations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump in May, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries.
Addressing the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday, the US president said, “I’m good at settling disputes, and I’ve always been — I’ve done very well with that over the years.
“India, Pakistan — they were going to go at it, nuclear weapons. I said that’s okay, you can go at it, but I’m putting a 350pc tariff on each country. No more trade with the United States,” he said.
“No, no you can’t do that,” Trump said, doing an impression.
“I said I am going to do it. Come back to me and I’ll take it down, but I’m not going to have you guys shooting nuclear weapons at each other, killing millions of people and having the nuclear dust floating over Los Angeles. I’m not going to do it,” he said, reiterating that it took the threat of a 350pc tariff to settle the conflict.
“No other president would have done that. Joe Biden doesn’t even know what countries we are talking about. He wouldn’t have any idea,” Trump said as laughter rang out.
The US president said that he settled five out of eight wars he has taken credit for ending by threatening tariffs.
“I tell you what, the prime minister of Pakistan called me … he actually said I saved millions — and he said in front of Susie. He said, ‘President Trump saved millions and millions of lives. He doesn’t even know that, but he saved millions of lives’.”
The person the US president was referring to appeared to be White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.
Trump also said he had received a call from Indian PM Narendra Modi, recounting the exchange between the two, where the latter said that “we’re not going to go to war”.
“I said, ‘Thank you very much. Let’s make a deal’.”
Trump also recounted his role in ending other conflicts, including brokering a peace plan for Gaza in October, saying, “I’ve settled eight wars. I have one to go.”
However, he expressed disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin for his resistance to ending Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
“I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin,” he said. “But I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that.”
The US president also said that the Saudi crown prince wanted him “to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan” and expressed his resolve to turn his attention there, although it had not previously been “on his charts”.
“I just see how important that is to you … and we’re going to start working in Sudan,” he said to applause. “I didn’t think that that was one that was going to be so easy to do, but we’re going to start working.”
The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to eight planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.</p><small>2025-11-20 04:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20085925fbd292d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956143/ndma-warns-of-even-stronger-monsoon-next-year' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA warns of even stronger monsoon next year</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned that the co­­untry is likely to experience 22-26 per cent above-normal rain­fall during the 2026 monsoon season, stressing that wea­ther ext­r­e­­mes are intensifying and urg­ent preparations are req­uired to minimise potential losses.
Speaking to the media alongside Minister for Climate Change Dr Musadiq Malik on Wednesday, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik revealed that 3.1 million people had been relocated to safe areas during this year’s monsoon.
He emphasised that both federal and provincial governments carry significant responsibilities in disaster management, noting that recommendations have already been pre­­pared for regulating river flows.
He said tourism activities would remain restricted during the months of June and July to prevent losses. He highlighted the role of the early warning system, under which provinces are alerted six to eight months in advance. He added that timely weekly alerts would enable the provincial authorities to adopt more effective precautionary measures.
 
 

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the authorities concerned to begin early preparations to mitigate the impacts of climate change and prevent any loss of life or property during next year’s monsoon season, and ordered immediate implementation of the short-term plan presented by the Ministry of Climate Change.
While chairing a meeting to review measures to prevent monsoon-related damages,  the PM approved the ministry’s short-term plan and stressed its urgent execution.
He asked the ministries of climate change and planning, and NDMA to work in close coordination with the provincial governments for integrated planning on climate change. He also called for preparations to convene a meeting of the National Water Council to carry out national-level planning.

• Washington asks Yemen to contribute to international force
• EU eyes training Palestinian police personnel on West Bank model
WASHINGTON: The Board of Peace (BOP), which is slated to administer Gaza under the newly-approved US peace plan, may include the heads of many major world powers, President Donald Trump indicated.
“I hope your highness will be on the board,” Trump says to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a dinner the president is hosting for him at the White House.
 
 

“Everybody wants to be on the board, and it’ll end up being quite a large board because it’ll be the heads of every major country,” the US president said, a day aft­er the UN Security Council adopted a resolution giving the US-led BOP a broad mandate to manage Gaza until the end of 2027.
Trump also thanked MBS for the role he played in securing last month’s Gaza ceasefire, without elaborating. During his remarks, the US president also had words of praise for Hamas, saying: “A lot of work has been done by Hamas, and a lot of a lot of people said they wouldn’t be doing that”.
He also said that there was a lot more safety in Gaza now than before the ceasefire.
Yemen asked to join ISF
Meanwhile, the government of Yemen has been approached to join the international force that would be deployed at the war-torn Palestinian territory, it emerged on Wednesday.
Several Yemeni government sources told AFP that Washington had approached Aden to participate in the new International Stabilisation Force (ISF), although they insisted that a final decision is yet to be made.
However, officials insisted that any Yemeni contribution to the force would be largely symbolic. “If we do participate, it will be just a few officers or soldiers in the operations room and the contacts room for logistical purposes. They will not be involved in other operations under this scheme,” a diplomat said.
Asked about the request, a US State Department spokesperson told AFP “we’re not going to detail private diplomatic conversations,” adding that Trump himself had said “there will be many exciting announcements in the coming weeks”.
Yemen’s internationally-recognised government is largely fractured and weakened after being kicked out of the capital Sanaa by the Houthi rebels in 2014, who now control most of the country’s population centres. The Houthis are fierce allies of Hamas, and are likely to be infuriated by Yemeni participation in the proposed international force, which the Palestinian group has largely decried.
The government largely relies on backing by US ally Saudi Arabia, which led an international coalition from early 2015 that failed to dislodge the Houthis.
Asked about Yemen’s incentives to join the force, the diplomat told AFP: “The issue is we cannot say no”.
EU training
Meanwhile, the European Union wants to train up to 3,000 Palestinian police officers in the Gaza Strip under a scheme similar to one it already runs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, an official said on Wednesday.
The UN-approved peace plan envisions the international force would work with Israel, Egypt and newly-trained Palestinian police to help secure border areas and de-militarise Gaza.
There will be a “need to stabilise Gaza with an important police force” if the current ceasefire endures, said the official.
The issue is likely to be discussed at a Palestinian donor conference, being held in Brussels today (Thursday).

India last month upgraded its ties with the Taliban by reopening its embassy in Kabul that was shut in 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces. New Delhi is also ramping up its aid to the country as it competes with China for influence.
Minister Alhaj Noor­uddin Azizi will hold talks with his Indian counterpart and the foreign minister, as well as with traders and investors, Afgha­nistan’s commerce ministry said in a statement.
“These meetings will focus on expanding economic cooperation, facilitating trade relations, creating joint investment opportunities, and stren­g­thening Afgh­anis­tan’s role in regional transit routes,” it added.
Landlocked Afgh­a­nis­tan is seeking access to grains, medicines and industrial goods following the closure of its border with Pakistan in recent weeks after armed clashes last month between the neighbours over cross-border terrorism.
In the past six months, Afghanistan’s trade through Iran has reached $1.6 billion, higher than the $1.1 billion exchanged with Pakistan, Afgha­ni­stan’s commerce ministry told Reuters.
“Advancing bilateral trade and investment ties are the key focus of the visit,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, wrote on X along with a photograph of Azizi’s arrival in Delhi.

They said an intelligence-based operation was carried out on the reported presence of nearly two dozen terrorists in Kurram district’s  Manato and Marzai areas, sources said, adding that they were hiding in a residential area and planted explosives in a house. During the operation, they said, 22 militants were killed, while there were reports about some security personnel being injured due to an explosion, though locals remained unhurt.
No official statement was issued by the ISPR on developments in Kurram.
However, the military’s media wing, in a post on X, stated on Wednesday night that in a failed attempt to target innocent civilians in Bannu, an Indian-sponsored terrorist got eliminated while planting an improvised explosive device.
The ISPR said: “The incident highlights the growing desperation of the khwarij, who, due to sustained and effective pressure from security forces and law enforcement agencies, were increasingly resorting to cowardly attempts against soft targets. Their failed actions reflect their diminishing capabilities and frustration in the face of ongoing counter terrorism efforts.”
 






Earlier, the military’s media wing said that security forces carried out intelligence-based operations (IBO) on the reported presence of, what the official statement said Fitna al Khwarij, in Bajaur, North Waziristan and Dera Ismail Khan disttricts on Nov 17 and 18.
 
 

It said troops effectively engaged a terrorist’s location in Bajaur. After an intense exchange of fire, one terrorist was killed. It read that more militants were neutralised in an IBO conducted in the Spinwam and Zakir Khel areas of North Waziristan district, while another terrorist was killed in Dera Ismail Khan.
In Lakki Marwat, two militants were killed in an exchange of fire with counterterrorism department (CTD) personnel, police said.
A statement issued by CTD said the militants were killed during an intelligence-based operation carried out in Sraye Norang area of the district. It explained the militants opened fire on the CTD team as soon as they saw them. The CTD team retaliated and killed two militants, later identified as Mohammad Sohail and Azmatullah alias Hafiz.

• IHCBA chief claims high court won’t be dislodged from current location, for now
ISLAMABAD: The Federal Cons­titutional Court (FCC), in a full court meeting, unanimously resolved to adopt the Supreme Court Rules 2025, mutatis mutandis, for its practice and procedure until it frames its own rules.
The decisions taken at the full court meeting, which was held on Nov 17 and approved by the FCC chief justice, have also been notified for implementation.
In pursuance of the decisions taken, it has been decided that every case, appeal, petition, or matter would be heard and disposed of by a bench consisting of no fewer than two judges, to be nominated by the FCC CJ.
 
 

Likewise, appeals arising out of judgements passed by a division bench will be heard by a bench comprising no fewer than three FCC judges, to be nominated by its chief justice.
The decisions also indicated that members of the bar enrolled as senior advocates of the Supreme Court, advocates of the SC, and advocates-on-record were entitled to appear before the FCC as senior advocates, advocates, and advocates-on-record, respectively, on a provisional basis until further orders.
The notification will take effect immediately and remain operative until modified or superseded. It has also been dispatched to the attorney general of Pakistan (AGP), the registrar of the SC and other courts, the law ministry, etc.
‘No relocation for now’
Meanwhile, a top office-bearer of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) said on Wednesday that the Islamabad High Court (IHC) would not be relocated from its prestigious Constitution Avenue site for now — temporarily ending a period of uncertainty that has gripped the capital’s legal community.
Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, president of the association, made the announcement after meeting Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.
“The law minister assured us that the IHC would stay at the Constitution Avenue at least for the time being,” Gillani told Dawn, a statement he said was echoed by IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar.
The announcement comes amid a backdrop of significant upheaval, as the newly established FCC begins operations within the IHC building, a move that has triggered internal reshuffling and rumours of dissent among the high court’s judges.
The issue kicked off when the government decided to establish FCC at the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building. The FSC judges were asked to move into courtrooms on the third floor of the IHC.
When the FSC judges resisted their shifting, the FCC was temporarily set up in the premises of the IHC.
However, sources said that the judges of the FCC wanted permanent premises and for this purpose, the IHC building was also among the options under consideration.
FCC CJ meets law minister, AGP
The situation reached a critical point on Tuesday night, leading to a series of high-level meetings.
FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan met the law minister and Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan in his chamber on Wed­nesday to discuss the issue.
This was preceded by a late-night meeting between the FCC CJ and IHC CJ Dogar to sort out the functioning of both courts sharing the same premises.
The tension was visibly on display during the recent oath-taking ceremonies for FCC judges.
While Justice K. K. Agha took his oath on Saturday in a “congested conference room”, his ceremony, and one held the day prior, were notably boycotted by a group of IHC judges.
Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz were absent from both events, a move that has drawn intense speculation within the legal circles.
Their collective absence fuelled widespread rumors throughout Saturday that several IHC judges were preparing to resign.
Although the staff of Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan denied rumors of his resignation after they circulated on social media, insiders suggest that the speculation may not be entirely unfounded.
Some sources indicate that a couple of resignations from the IHC are expected by the end of next month.
To accommodate the new apex court, the IHC administration has allocated seven courtrooms to the FCC.
This has necessitated a major reshuffle, including vacating the offices of the AGP and the advocate general of Islamabad.

Over 30 people were killed when his home was struck, he recalled, among them “my wife, my children, my mother, my father”.
“I’m the only one who survived,” he said, pointing to the pile of broken concrete and twisted metal that was once a five-storey building in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood.
The building was destroyed on Dec 24 last year and he has been waiting ever since to retrieve their bodies and give them a proper burial.
 
 

“The only thing that matters to me is to be able to bury them,” the 43-year-old said. Thousands of other Palestinians are in a similar situation.
According to UN data, the Israeli military had damaged or destroyed around 83 per cent of the buildings in Gaza that stood before the conflict started in Oct 2023.
The densely-populated Palestinian territory is covered in 61.5 million tonnes of debris: nearly 170 times the weight of New York City’s Empire State Building.
Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency, estimates that about 10,000 bodies are buried under the rubble.
“We cannot extract thousands of bodies without heavy machinery. We need the means to lift the roofs and the tonnes of cement,” said Bassal, whose organisation conducts search and rescue operations in Gaza.
‘Help me retrieve them’
Iyad Rayan holds out the same hope as Salim: burying his wife and children with dignity.
“My wife, my son Samir and my daughter Lana are still here under the rubble,” he said by the wreckage of his Gaza City home, which he said was destroyed in early October this year.
“I want to send an appeal to the whole world: help me retrieve them,” the 55-year-old said.
 
 

Amal Abdel Aal is waiting for heavy equipment to enter the Gaza Strip so the bodies of her son and brother can be recovered.
They have been under the rubble in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City since the early days of the two-year conflict.
“They never leave my thoughts. My heart aches at the thought of dogs reaching their bodies and eating them,” said the 57-year-old woman now living in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter.
“I will only find relief when I have buried them, even if only a single bone remains.”
After the ceasefire began on Oct 10, Israel allowed Egyptian bulldozers to enter Gaza to help recover the remains of prisoners, to be returned under the US-brokered truce deal.
“The world is unfair. We see bulldozers digging to retrieve the Israeli prisoners, while no one cares about the thousands of our martyrs,” said Abdel Aal.
Sadness, loss and pain
Since the ceasefire, Palestinians have been able to recover around 500 bodies in areas that emergency workers could access following the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, Bassal said.
The halt in fighting allowed Amer Abu al Tarabish to return to Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, he said, to extract the bodies of his parents from the ruins of their family home “with my bare hands”.
“My parents, my brother and his children, his wife, my uncle, his wife and their children… Thirty people remained under the rubble for more than a year,” he said.
“I pulled out their bodies intact; they were not decomposed,” he recounted, adding that he was  “overwhelmed by sadness, loss and pain”.
“I was able to bring them out one by one, say goodbye to them, and imprint their faces in my memory before burying them.”
For other Gaza residents, even this small consolation may never come.
Bassal noted that thousands of people had been reported missing, especially during major population displacements as the fighting shifted.
“We don’t know whether they were killed or arrested” by Israeli forces, he said.
As for families who buried their loved ones hastily during the conflict, many consider those graves to be temporary, or feel that proper rites have not yet been obse­rved.
Mohammed Naim, 47, said his family had to bury 43 relatives in just seven graves.
“We placed the remains of each family in a single grave,” he said.
“But we swore over their graves that we would exhume them and rebury them, with dignity, in Gaza City.”

But amid judges’ grumbling, a proposal to resign en masse to protest the amendment was met with mere silence.
The Nov 14 full court meeting, chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, coincided with the elevation of four top court judges to the Federal Constitutional Court, and was convened a day after the resignation of two judges — Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah.
Prior to this, the CJP had also received letters from the two aforementioned judges, as well as Justice Salahuddin Panwhar, requesting a full court meeting for deliberation on the 27th Amendment to discharge their solemn duty to the Constitution.

Fly-on-the-wall account of judges’ conclave on judiciary’s response to 27th Amendment reveals misgivings over parliamentary powers

A source privy to proceedings said that the meeting was held in a tense atmosphere in the CJP’s chambers, as superior judges described the development as “a very sad day”.
The mood at the meeting became even more sombre when one of the judges questioned whether the Supreme Court was vested with any constitutional authority to restrain parliament from passing laws or constitutional amendments.
 
 

As judges debated the ramifications of the amendment, the CJP observed that instead of writing letters to him, the judges should have reached out to him directly, since his doors were always open, a source privy to the meeting revealed.
The full court meeting was attended by at least 13 judges: Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ayesha A. Malik did not attend the meeting, whereas Justice Musarrat Hilali was indisposed.
Four other judges, namely Amin­uddin Khan, Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi, had already been nominated as FCC judges.
‘Strong institutional response’
In the meeting, the judges noted with regret the resignation of their two colleagues and emphasised that the judiciary must come up with a strong institutional response.
When a few judges suggested sending a formal letter to the government, the CJP reminded them that judges should have approached him directly instead of writing letters.
As per the source, the CJP further said that the Supreme Court retained the power of judicial review to assess the constitutionality of legislation, but only after the passage of the law, not before it. Thus the court cannot stop parliament from making laws.
Upon insistence for a strong institutional response, one of the participants floated the idea that all of them, including the CJP, should tender their resignations if they wished to register a meaningful institutional protest beyond constitutional mechanisms, the source claimed.
The proposal, however, was met with silence, indicating a lack of agreement on part of the members attending the meeting. Subsequently, the meeting ended without a consensus.

Arshad was in a league of his own headed into the seven-man event; his personal best of 92.97m — which won him gold and the games record at the Paris 2024 Olympics, was head and shoulders above the rest of the field.
Predictably, he had the lead from the start and was the only competitor to throw more than 80m — prompting hearty Arabic praise from the commentators — though he looked disappointed after most of his throws.
The 28-year-old took home gold with a modest 83.05m throw on his second attempt, well below his 88.55m throw at the previous edition that won gold broke the games record.

Meanwhile, Yasir shifted gears in the sixth and final throw to win silver in 76.04m after overtaking Nigeria’s Samuel Adams Kure, who bronze in 76.01m.
The duo’s medals took Pakistan’s tally at the games to four; boxers Fatima Zahra and Qudrat Ullah both won bronze medals in their respective categories.
A sparse audience at the Prince Faisal Bin Stadium was seen clustered behind the javelin throwing sector, waving Pakistani flags and holding up their mobile phones to get a picture of the javelin superstars in action.
Arshad opened his campaign with a low 75.44m first throw before breaching the 80m mark on his second and third throws. However, by his fourth throw he had come back to 77.06m and had a no throw on his fifth attempt.
Javelin in hand, he turned to the crowd before his sixth and final throw and orchestrated the audience with rhythmic claps above his head.
The 77.98m final throw was inconsequential to his standings; he bent to the floor in prostration as he secured his gold medal before shaking hands with the other throwers zipping up their tracksuit jackets in the cool 20 degree weather that the capital offered them.
Eager fans thronged the six foot two inch star athlete to take selfies with him as he made his way to coach Salman Butt in the stands.

Yasir’s desire for an 80m plus throw will have to wait till next year; the 27-year-old registered modest throws of 70.32m, 74.43m, 72.82m, 73.78m and 71.79m to seal a bronze medal right from the first throw.
However, he snatched a comfortable silver from Nigeria’s Kure with a final throw of 76.04m to give Pakistan a one-two finish in the event.
Other competitors of the night included Guyana’s Leslain Alvino Baird, Sarvar Ismoilov of Uzbekistan, Abdulrahman Alazemi of Jordan, and Ali Al Abdulghani of the host nation, who finished seventh.
Speaking after the event, Arshad said it was the nation’s prayers that won him tonight’s gold medal.
“I’m quite happy because I won this accolade right after my injury. My focus now is on preparing for competitions in 2026, because prior to this I was consumed with my injury, surgery and recovery.
“I thank God for letting me get back to this level of fitness, and I congratulate the nation on this win.”
Yasir was not too far off from his personal and season’s best throw of 77.43m that won him a bronze medal at the Asian Throwing Championships in South Korea this August.
The duo last competed together in May at the Asian Athletic Championships in Gumi, South Korea, where Arshad won gold in 86.40m while Yasir finished eighth with a 75.39m throw.
This was Arshad’s third international outing of the year. His run at the Tokyo World Athletics Championships ended in 10th place owing to calf pain, for which he had surgery over the summer.
The games in Riyadh were an anomaly for most track and field athletes whose season ended in Tokyo. The Diamond League circuit was adjusted this year to end before the world championships.</p><small>2025-11-20 03:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20080500271a2b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956184/pml-n-grouse-with-balochistan-cm-bugti-out-in-the-open' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N grouse with Balochistan CM Bugti ‘out in the open’</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The simmering differences between the PML-N and the PPP in Balochistan finally came to the fore, with members of both parties making conflicting claims about the fate of the provincial chief executive.
PML-N Senator Mir Dostain Khan Domki claimed on Wednesday that Mir Sarfraz Bugti would be removed as chief minister in the next few days, and that a new CM would be elected by the PPP — an assertion that was rejected by the party’s top leaders in Balochistan.
“The decision to change [the] chief minister has been taken and consultations among the political partner, the PPP, are underway for the selection of new candidate for this slot,” Senator Domki told an Urdu-language news agency.
Mr Domki claimed that CM Bugti has disappointed the central leadership of the PPP, PM Shehbaz Sharif, the federal government as well as the establishment, as he had failed to live up to their expectations.
He continued that the security forces were rendering sacrifices for restoring peace and order in the province, while the chief minister was involved in corruption and failing to govern effectively.
“According to my knowledge, the government-sharing formula of two and half years between the PPP and the PML-N would be completed in August next year. It was decided to bring a new chief minister from the PPP to complete the two-and-a-half-year term,” he said.
‘Baseless’
However, PPP Balochistan President Sardar Umar Gorgaij and provincial assembly parliamentary leader Mir Sadiq Umrani rejected the claim of the PML-N senator, saying that Mr Bugti enjoyed the complete support of all the coalition partners.
All speculations in this regard are “baseless and desire of a PML-N senator”, they noted in a statement issued on late Wednesday night. 
“The PPP central leadership has made no decision about changing the chief minister in Balochistan,” they noted. 
They said PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had already said the party did not believe in changing the chief ministers of the party.
“All coalition partners are with [CM] Sarfraz Bugti and they have no intention to change the PPP’s chief minister.” They said if Senator Domki had some reservations or complaints, he should take them up with CM Bugti.
“I reject all such claims and rumours,” Mr Gorgaij said.

• Calls for tighter limits on govt’s financial powers
• Demands first public annual report of SIFC, concessions granted
• Points to opaque tax system, intrusive regulations, weak independent regulators
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its long-awaited Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), has highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
The report, publication of which is a precondition for the IMF executive board’s approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement next month, estimates that Pakistan could boost economic growth by about 5 to 6.5 per cent over five years if it implements a package of governance reforms beginning within the next three to six months.
The GCDA seeks an end to special treatment for a few influential public sector entities in direct government contracts and transparency in the affairs and decision-making of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). It also recommends tighter limits on the government’s financial powers without greater parliamentary oversight and streamlining of anti-corruption agencies. The government had been delaying the publication of the report since August.
“A unifying theme is the emphasis on increasing transparency and accountability in policy formulation, implementation and monitoring. This involves improving access to information and strengthening the capacity of state and non-state stakeholders to participate effectively in governance and economic decision-making,” the report said, calling for advancing rule-based governance.
It said Pakistan would obtain substantial economic benefits from improving governance, accountability and integrity along the lines recommended in the GCDA.
“Pakistan could generate between a 5pc to 6.5pc increase in GDP by implementing a package of governance reforms over the course of five years” beginning in three to six months, it said. The key areas include improvements in governance and anti-corruption, business regulation and regulation of foreign trade.
 
 

It said both the IMF and the government agreed that confronting and reducing corruption vulnerabilities was necessary for sustainable reform and that anti-corruption efforts are most successful when they combine initiatives to strengthen governance with initiatives to directly confront corruption and enhance integrity.
Indicators showed weak control of corruption over time with negative consequences for public spending effectiveness, revenue collection, and trust in the legal system.
The GCDA revealed systemic governance weaknesses across state functions and noted that the country was exposed to corruption risk generated by weaknesses in budgeting and reporting of fiscal information, and management of public financial and non-financial resources, particularly in capital spending, public procurement and the management and oversight of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
It also identified an overly complex and opaque tax system administered by tax and customs authorities operating with insufficient capacity, management and oversight.
On top of this was a judicial sector that is organisationally complex, is unable to reliably enforce contracts or protect property rights due to problems with efficiency, antiquated laws, and the integrity of judges and judicial personnel.
Procurement, SIFC
The IMF demanded that all public sector procurements should eliminate preferences for SOEs, including special provisions for direct contracting and mandatory use of e-governance procurement for all state transactions within 12 months.
It called for immediately producing and making public the first annual report of the SIFC, including information on all investments it facilitated, including concessions provided (tax, policy, regulatory and legislative), along with detailed rationale and the outcomes.
It said that given its broad and disparate organisational functions and authority, it was essential for the SIFC to develop explicit protocols for undertaking its activities and enhanced transparency arrangements to enable effective oversight and accountability.
It also questioned the SIFC’s creation in the first place and the immunity its staff enjoyed in decision-making. It said the council was created by amendment in the Board of Investment (BoI) law to accelerate investment and privatisation efforts, but the BoI continued to exist.
 
 

It noted that corruption vulnerabilities also have a significant impact on the fiscal performance of the public sector. While other factors also contribute to public sector performance, Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio is low and falling, mainly due to the complexity of the tax system, frequent changes in rules, and low public trust in the government.
It also noted that the government retained significant discretionary power over how public money was spent, given significant differences between enacted budgets and how public money was actually spent, in an environment with limited public transparency or parliamentary engagement in budgetary matters.
Discretionary allocations are skewed towards districts represented in the government or the senior bureaucracy, reflecting the vulnerability of the system to political influence. This resulted in low return on public investment.

• Omar Ayub’s seat among 13 up for grabs on November 23
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Secretariat maintains that the disqualification of Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub is a sub-judice matter, even as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has announced by-elections in 13 constituencies, including Mr Ayub’s, on Nov 23.
The NA stance came in response to PTI leader Amir Dogar’s request, drawing the NA speaker’s attention to rules 39 and  9-B of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the NA, 2007,  which outline the procedure for the submission of names and the declaration of the opposition leader.
As stipulated under Rule 39(2), the speaker announces the date, time, and place for members of the National Assembly to submit their duly signed proposals for the appointment of opposition leader.
According to a response released by the NA Secretariat on Wednesday, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq has already made it clear that in line with parliamentary practice, such announcements were made on the floor of the house, allowing all members an equal opportunity to propose a candidate for the position.
He stated as he had not yet made any announcement regarding the schedule for submitting proposals for the opposition leader, no request or proposal could be entertained at this stage.
“The secretariat will proceed only once the requisite announcement is made by the speaker in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business 2007,” the speaker said.
Also, the NA secretariat referenced the Oct 29 order of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on the pleas (Omer Ayub Khan and others vs. FOP & Syed Shibli Faraz vs. FOP). Through this order, the SC set aside the earlier decision of the Peshawar High Court that had adjourned writ petitions sine die, and directed the high court to determine the maintainability of those petitions and dispose of them accordingly.
The NA spokesperson confirmed that as highlighted in the response letter, the matter concerning the disqualification of Mr Ayub, former opposition leader, was presently sub judice before the Peshawar High Court.
On the other hand, the ECP has drawn the attention of contesting candidates for by-elections in 13 constituencies of the National and the Punjab assemblies, announcing that no person shall convene, hold or attend any public meeting and no person shall promote or join in any procession within the area of the constituency during a period of 48 hours ending at midnight following the conclusion of the poll.
“Any person who contravenes these provisions of law shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with a fine which may extend to Rs100,000 or with both,” the ECP announcement said.
The constituencies are: NA-18 Haripur, PP-73 Sargodha-III, NA-96 Faisalabad-II, PP-87 Mianwali-III, NA-104 Faisalabad-X, PP-98 Faisalabad, NA-129 Lahore-XIII, PP-115 Faisalabad-XVIII, NA-143 Sahiwal-III 5, PP-116 Faisalabad-XIX, NA-185 D.G. Khan-ll, PP-203 Sahiwal-VI, PP-269 Muzaffargarh-ll.
Accordingly, the election campaign for by-elections in the above constituencies shall come to an end at midnight between Nov 21 and 22. The political parties and the candidates were requested to follow the provisions of law and exercise self-restraint so that the poll is held in an orderly and peaceful manner on Nov 23.
When contacted, political analyst Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who is also president of Pildat, said if the matter of appointment of the leader of the opposition was sub judice as claimed by the NA speaker, then there was no harm in holding a by-election of any constituency including the one from which former leader of the opposition Omar Ayub had won.
However, he added, if the sub-judice matter was Mr Ayub’s election rather than his appointment as leader of the opposition, then the ECP should not have announced the schedule for the by-election in his constituency.

The pledge came during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance where lawmakers also learnt of a plan by tax authorities to install artificial intelligence-based cameras across 17 major industrial sectors to combat widespread tax evasion. 
The discussion on dress codes was initiated by Senator Zarqa Suharwardy, who informed the committee that some Islamic banks were forcing female staff to wear abayas. 
“Pakistani women already use decent clothing and should not be forced to wear abayas at Islamic bank counters to give a religious look,” she said. 
The committee, presided over by Senator Saleem Mandviwala, concluded that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should intervene. A representative of the SBP present at the meeting clarified that official dress code policies currently varied from bank to bank. 
Other committee members voiced strong opinions on the matter. Mr Mandviwalla noted that Islamic banks often charge higher interest rates than conventional banks under the guise of Islamic financing. Senator Farooq Naik called the reported mandate a violation of personal freedom. 
Compelling a female banker to wear an abaya, Mr Naik said, was like “forcing somebody to grow beard against his will”, but he questioned how the central bank could effectively police such internal bank policies. 
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani, stating he was unaware of “such an odd compulsion”, assured the committee he would raise the matter directly with the SBP governor.  
The committee members recommended the SBP issue a regulatory notification requiring banks to enforce a “modest, professional dress” code rather than a specific religious garment. 
In a separate matter, the committee was briefed on a major anti-tax evasion initiative. Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Rashid Langrial announced the agency would install AI-based video analytical cameras at production facilities in 17 major sectors after uncovering a significant tax theft. 
Mr Langrial told the committee the move was prompted by the discovery of an annual tax theft worth over Rs 30 billion in the tiles and ceramics sector alone. “AI based video analytical cameras were being installed at production units of 17 major sectors to control tax evasion,” he said. 
The chairman recounted facing opposition from a private Chinese firm that offered to increase its tax payments if it could be exempt from the camera vigilance, citing concerns over trade secrets.  
Mr Langrial said he rejected the offer, telling the committee that such a suggestion was a “breach of the parliamentary panel’s privilege”. 
He said the AI-based cameras would be deployed across all targeted sectors, including cement, sugar, tobacco and tiles.  
He reported the initiative was already showing success, with the sugar and cement sectors expected to contribute an additional Rs76 billion and Rs102bn in revenue this year, respectively. 
The committee also addressed a staggering Rs 375 trillion figure for financial irregularities reported by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP).  
AGP representative Tafakhir Ali explained the sum was a “typographical error” in an executive summary and had been corrected to Rs9tr. He said a fact-finding inquiry into the error was underway.

The status was granted by the EU in 2014, which led to a 108 per cent hike in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
The upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission was delayed from June because of the Iran-Israel conflict and will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme, which grants duty-free access to most Pakistani exports.
The Foreign Office (FO) said that FM Dar called on Costa for a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in which they “exchanged views on various areas of mutual interest, including GSP+, trade and economic cooperation expansion, and regional and global security developments”.
The two also reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to multilateralism.
The FO said both sides noted with satisfaction the “positive trajectory” of the Pakistan-EU relationship and agreed to further strengthen the “mutually beneficial partnership” across various domains.
FM Dar also acknowledged and appreciated the EU’s support to Pakistan, both bilaterally and on multilateral platforms.
The FO added that both sides agreed to continue working together to advance common priorities and deepen cooperation across key sectors.
 






FM Dar reached Belgium earlier today after attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Moscow. During the three-day visit, he will attend the seventh strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the European Union (EU).
 






The Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue is the highest level of institutionalised interaction between the two sides, the FO said in a press release today. FM Dar was in Moscow to lead the Pakistani delegation at the SCO summit.
According to the FO, Dar will co-chair the seventh session of Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue at the invitation of Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.
The dialogue will review cooperation between Pakistan and the EU in all sectors under the Pakistan-EU Strategic Engagement Plan 2019, it said.
 






In Brussels, the deputy premier will also participate in the fourth EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum, which will be held over the next two days and will be chaired by Kallas.
Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts and engagements with senior EU officials, according to the FO.
Dar’s visit to Brussels marks a “significant milestone in Pakistan-EU relations”, the statement highlighted, affirming that Islamabad remains committed to developing a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership” with the EU.
Separately, after arrival in Brussels, Dar posted on X that he “look[s] forward to engaging with the president of the European Council, EU high representative/ vice-president, EU commissioners, members of the European Parliament, and other leaders attending the IMPF”.
 






When departing from Russia, Dar expressed his gratitude to the host government for its “warm hospitality and the successful organisation” of the SCO moot, the FO said on social media platform X.
He also appreciated the support extended by the embassy of Pakistan in Moscow and the teams at the FO for facilitating his visit.
 






Dar meets Russian FM, Qatari PM on sidelines of SCO summit
Earlier today, the FO said that Dar met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the 24th summit of the SCO’s Council of Heads of Governments (CHG).
In a statement, the FO said both sides “reviewed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed deep satisfaction at the current positive trajectory of relations”.
Dar congratulated Lavrov on the successful hosting of the meeting, noting the “vital role of both countries’ leadership […] as well as bilateral institutional mechanisms in further strengthening bilateral relations”, according to the statement.
“The leaders also exchanged views on regional and international issues. Taking into account the excellent coordination at multilateral fora, including the United Nations and the SCO, they pledged to deepen them further in the interest of both countries,” the FO added.
 






Dar also held an “informal discussion” with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on the sidelines of the CHG meeting, according to the FO.
The two ministers exchanged views on “bilateral relations and priorities for regional cooperation”, it added.
 






Interactions with Chinese premier, Central Asian leaders
Among a string of posts, the FO also posted pictures of Dar meeting Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the margins of the summit, where they discussed enhancing collaboration among the member states of the SCO.
 






He also met Adylbek Kasymaliev, chairman of the cabinet of ministers and head of the presidential administration of the Kyrgyz Republic, and congratulated him on assuming chairmanship of the SCO Heads of State.
“Highlighting the importance of regional collaboration, the two leaders exchanged views on SCO initiatives and Kyrgyzstan’s assumption of the rotating presidency,” the FO said.
 






Meeting Uzbekistan’s PM Abdulla Aripov, Dar “appreciated the positive momentum in Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations and underscored the importance of high-level interactions and cooperation at multilateral fora”.
 






Dar also met with Tajikistan’s PM Kokhir Rasulzoda, congratulating him on his assumption of the chairmanship of the next CHG meeting. He reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries across diverse areas, the FO said.

Medics said 10 people were killed in the Gaza City suburb of Zeitoun, two in the Shujaiya suburb to the east and the rest in two separate attacks in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military claimed its forces struck Hamas targets across Gaza after members of the Palestinian group fired on its troops in violation of the nearly six-week-old ceasefire. No Israeli forces were injured.
Multiple air strikes have pointed to the fragility of the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have traded blame for what both call violations of the US-brokered truce, the first stage of President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for a post-war Gaza.
All three attacks were far beyond an agreed-upon imaginary “yellow line” separating the areas under Israeli and Palestinian control, according to medics, witnesses and Palestinian media.
The Zeitoun attack was on a building belonging to Muslim religious authorities and the Khan Younis attack was on a UN-run club, both of which house displaced families.
The October 10 ceasefire in the two-year Gaza war has eased the conflict, enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza’s ruins. Israel has pulled troops back from city positions, and aid flows have increased.
But violence has not completely halted. Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed at least 305 people in strikes on Gaza since the truce, nearly half of them in one day last week when Israel retaliated for an attack on its troops.
Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began and claimed it has targeted scores of fighters.</p><small>2025-11-19 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19221149964e669.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956090/saudi-crown-prince-heads-to-a-friendlier-us-congress' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi crown prince heads to a friendlier US Congress</strong></a><br><p>Lawmakers are set to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at the United States Capitol on Wednesday on the second day of a visit to the US that has aimed to tout stronger-than-ever economic and security ties with Washington while brushing off scrutiny of his human rights record.
President Donald Trump gave bin Salman a lavish welcome at the White House on Tuesday and defended him over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, which US intelligence agencies have concluded the crown prince approved.
 
 

A handful of Republican members of Congress, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast attended a black-tie dinner at the White House for bin Salman on Tuesday, according to a White House official.
MBS was considered an outcast by Washington in the aftermath of the Khashoggi killing, but his rehabilitation was rubber-stamped this week.
In one example of this, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who as a US senator in 2019 denounced the crown prince as a “gangster”, sat a few steps away during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting. Trump repeatedly said it was “an honour” to be friends with the Saudi leader.
This was in sharp contrast to Washington’s view of the Saudi leader during Trump’s first term, as members of Congress became angry with Riyadh’s role in the civil war in Yemen and its human rights record, fueled by Khashoggi’s murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkiye.
“He is reckless, he’s ruthless, he has a penchant for escalation, for taking high risks, confrontational in his foreign policy approach and I think increasingly willing to test the limits of what he can get away with the United States,” Rubio said at the time.
There were multiple and persistent calls from members of Congress for accountability.
The crown prince has denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
In 2019, Congress passed a resolution demanding an end to military support for the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen, although there were too few votes to overturn Trump’s veto.
Subdued reception
Although memories of that time may have faded, MBS’s reception on Capitol Hill on Wednesday was likely to be far more subdued than the welcomes given to other world leaders.
The crown prince arrived at the Capitol building on Wednesday morning, where congressional aides said Johnson was holding a reception for him attended by some Democratic as well as Republican members of Congress.
The meeting was not announced and the speaker’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Neither Johnson nor Republican Senate Leader John Thune planned the type of press opportunity, with photos and brief remarks, that is often held when world leaders visit the Capitol.
A handful of lawmakers criticised MBS this time around.
Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, where Khashoggi lived, blasted Trump after the Oval Office meeting with MBS.
“Instead of rolling out the red carpet for MBS and leveraging the presidency for private hotel deals, Trump should be demanding accountability on behalf of Khashoggi’s Virginia-based family and pressing Saudi Arabia to advance US security interests. Unfortunately, this is just the most recent example of Trump placing his personal financial interests above the interest of the American people,” he said in a statement.
MBS, who agreed in the meeting to increase the kingdom’s planned investments in the US to $1 trillion from $600 billion, is also attending an investment conference in Washington on Wednesday that will include CEOs from major US companies.
The two sides also announced new agreements on arms sales, civil nuclear cooperation and artificial intelligence after the meeting.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel, said she was concerned about some of the initiatives announced during the visit, and called on Trump and his administration to brief the committee on every commitment.</p><small>2025-11-19 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/192150193ae7f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956088/4-terrorists-killed-in-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed four terrorists in separate engagements across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Wednesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), multiple intelligence-based operations (IBO) were carried out between November 17 and 18, with the dead terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“On [the] reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the security forces in Bajaur district,” the statement read. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, one kharji was sent to hell.”
The ISPR said that two more terrorists were killed in IBOs conducted in the areas of Spinwam and Zakir Khel in North Waziristan, while another terrorist was killed in an IBO in Dera Ismail Khan District.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Yesterday, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists had been killed in counter-terrorism operations carried out from November 15-17 in KP.
The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively. It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-19 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/192124406eadac8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956087/pti-denounces-brutal-attack-on-imrans-sisters-will-observe-countrywide-black-day-on-friday' target='_blank'><strong>PTI denounces ‘brutal’ attack on Imran’s sisters, will observe countrywide ‘black day’ on Friday</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the Punjab government for unleashing “a reign of terror” on party founder Imran Khan’s sisters, party leaders, lawyers, and workers outside Adiala Jail, describing the act as utterly intolerable and completely unacceptable.
The party announced that the opposition alliance would observe a countrywide ‘black day’ on Friday to demand the restoration of the Constitution, the rule of law and ‘real freedom’, as Imran repeatedly stated that the nation was left with no choice but to choose between freedom and death.
Speaking at a press conference alongside Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi — as well as Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and other party leaders, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja condemned the acts carried out on Tuesday night and issued a stern warning to the authorities.
He stated that the PTI continued to urge those in power to abandon their “reckless arrogance” and act responsibly before it was too late. Raja emphasised that it was the undeniable constitutional right of Imran’s sisters to meet their brother — a right no authority could take away.
The PTI secretary general warned that no society could survive, let alone progress, without the freedom of speech, press, conscience and an independent judiciary.
“We are confronting a power structure intoxicated by its own might, blind to morality and law,” he said, vowing, “We will expose this tyranny, for God’s justice may be silent but is relentless — no oppressor will escape it.”
Speaking on the occasion, Aleema denounced the alleged assault on her sister and others by police units.
She alleged that a female officer openly directed male personnel to beat the protesters.
“Yesterday, our people, including MPAs and MNAs, were subjected to violence,” Aleema said.
Imran’s sister claimed that the PTI founder was placed in solitary confinement while party members peacefully exercised their court-approved right to demand justice.
She recalled that police allegedly threw 71-year-old Noreen to the ground, dragged her, forcibly pulled women’s dupattas, slapped them and beat young girls, locking them in vans with male detainees.
“Women officers, armed with batons, acted as Gullu Buttnis, and one even directed the others, shouting: ‘Beat them,’” she added.
“Do you think that by beating us you can silence us? We will return and you cannot intimidate us,” Aleema vowed.
She further asked, “Is this country now ruled by gangsters?”
Imran’s sister affirmed that the family would continue to stand outside the jail for her brother, exposing oppressors and injustice.
Aleema recalled that on August 4, 2023, a day before his arrest, Imran was asked to leave the country.
“But he made it clear: I will not abandon my country,” she said, highlighting his 500-day-long trial without personal demands.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram condemned the treatment and manhandling of Imran’s sisters, stating that such coercive and arbitrary tactics could not break the courage of the family, party leaders or workers.
He vowed that the party would continue to strive for the country’s real independence, true democracy, constitutional supremacy and judicial independence come what may.
Noreen vowed that the nation would never forget the tragedies of May 9 and November 26.
“Those who have played with the lives of innocent people will never find peace,” she said, expressing gratitude to those on social media who continued “exposing the truth despite immense pressure”.
“Every act of oppression will be accounted for,” she declared. Noreen stated that the authorities had crossed all limits — assaulting citizens, demolishing homes and smashing mobile phones to silence the people.
“This brutality will not erase the truth, nor break the resolve of the people,” she asserted.
She noted that her son, Hassan Niazi, remained imprisoned, yet the “oppression outside jail is even more frightening”.
Recounting her own ordeal, Noreen said, “I still do not know where they took the woman who grabbed me. She pulled me by my hair, threw me to the ground and dragged me across the road.”
Noreen praised those facing military trials for their bravery and unwavering resolve despite intimidation.
Uzma expressed deep concern over her brother’s condition, stating that he had been in solitary confinement for the past two weeks.
“Yesterday, we simply requested permission to see him to ensure his well-being,” she said. She added that Imran urged the nation to prepare, declaring that the time had come to choose between freedom or death.
“If they want to beat us, let them. If they want to throw us in jail, let them. We are not afraid.“
Abbas too condemned the treatment of women outside Adiala Jail, calling the manhandling and snatching of headscarves an “unforgivable national disgrace”.
“No civilised society, culture, or moral framework — legal, religious or traditional — permits violence against women. What happened yesterday stains our collective conscience,” he said.
“What crime has the PTI founder committed? His sole ‘offence’ is speaking the truth and standing fearlessly with the people,” he remarked.
Abbas described the movement as unstoppable, highlighting this Friday’s countrywide ‘black day’, symbolised by black flags and ribbons, as a “decisive moment”.
“All notions of lifetime immunity violate the Holy Quran, Sunnah and Constitution — a false idol born of fear,” he added, urging critics of Imran to emulate his “integrity, courage, and commitment to justice” rather than harbouring hatred.
KP Minister Meena Khan Afridi said that after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the path to justice had become extremely difficult, yet the judiciary must at least ensure the implementation of its own orders.
He noted that Imran’s sisters and elected representatives reached Adiala Jail in full accordance with court directives, yet in the freezing cold, they were assaulted with water and police unleashed further violence.
Afridi warned the station house officer involved in the events that “only your uniform shields you” and asked Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nwaz how she could authorise violence against women. He said KP would seek action and vowed they would return until allowed to meet Imran.</p><small>2025-11-19 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19191613822dbb2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956083/pakistan-needs-to-do-more-on-fulfilling-gsp-plus-conventions-ahead-of-review-eu-envoy-says' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan needs to ‘do more’ on fulfilling GSP Plus conventions ahead of review, EU envoy says</strong></a><br><p>European Union (EU) Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis on Wednesday said that the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) ahead of a review.
The status was granted by the EU in 2014, which led to a 108 per cent hike in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
The upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission was delayed from June because of the Iran-Israel conflict and will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme, which grants duty-free access to most Pakistani exports.
In an interview on DawnNewstv show ‘Doosra Rukh’ today, the EU ambassador was asked about whether Pakistan needed to do more to fulfil the requirements of the scheme, to which he said: “Yes, we are saying that. We are saying that it should be, well, needs to be, to do more.”
He said it would be a periodic monitoring mission that would assess the implementation of all necessary United Nations conventions for the scheme’s application.
“There are human rights, labour rights, environmental issues as well, and good governance. Quite a lot of meetings will be with state institutions, but also with civil society organisations, with human rights defenders, but also with the companies and actually with people who are working in the companies.”
He said a report would subsequently be issued with further recommendations based on the findings of United Nations bodies, since they were responsible for monitoring the conventions.
Karoblis stressed that implementation of the conventions was “really important”.
Outlining areas of concern, he pointed to human rights, the death penalty, blasphemy, forced disappearances, minority rights, women’s rights, child labour and forced labour.
“It will probably be the last monitoring mission of the present GSP+ scheme, because the new scheme will enter into force soon, probably from 2027, and Pakistan will need to reapply in order if it would like to continue with the GSP+ preferences. So it means that the report of the monitoring mission will be one of the most important sources assessing the progress and compliance with Pakistani commitments vis-à-vis the UN.”
The ambassador highlighted that the EU had already identified the main issues that it was asking Pakistan to address.
He said that the EU did see “certain progress”.
 
 

Karoblis said that the issue of forced disappearances in particular was one of the EU’s “priorities”, saying it was one of the issues on which “we have questions and we see the problems in the context of the GSP+”.
“Of course, we understand that some structures were established, such as the Commission of [Inquiry on Enforced] Disappearances. Of course, we will look into whether it is enough, whether it is sufficient, but of course, we will have a lot of questions on that for the institutions.”
Questioned about his thoughts on the recently enacted contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, he said it was an “internal issue”.
 
 

However, he did say on the issue of the judiciary’s independence that “we have different views” and different opinions and thoughts were being solicited from the opposition, think tanks, civil society organisations, and international organisations working in Pakistan.
The envoy also said that there was a need to discuss the issue of recent military trials of civilians.
“Maybe during discussions we will have some justifications. So, well, of course, the security situation is problematic. There are a lot of challenges which we really see.”
Noting a deteriorating human rights climate, former EU ambassador Riina Kionka had called on Pakistan in August to show ‘credible’ and ‘visible progress’ on human rights and labour reforms, signalling that the EU’s next trade preference scheme will demand stronger compliance.
“Pakistan needs to show more visible progress, especially ahead of the upcoming GSP Plus monitoring mission in November,” she said.
“Governance is looking pretty good, (progress on) environment also positive. But labour rights need more work, and human rights remain the most challenging area.”
On human rights, she was blunt: “If you talk to many human rights defenders, civil society activists —and even just live here, like I have for three years — you often see … a clear degradation. Our monitors read the newspapers. They have networks, they know what’s going on. So, they’re in a position to judge whether things are moving in the right direction or not.”
European lawmakers and civil society, she added, were increasingly vocal about conditioning trade support on rights performance: “Why should we continue to offer this level of support if there’s no reciprocal progress on the values side?”
Similarly, in January, the EU had warned Pakistan not to take its GSP+ status for granted. Olof Skoog, the EU Special Rep­resentative for Human Rights, had urged the government not to use military courts to pursue cases against citizens, and opposed recent moves to restrict freedom of expression.
Talking to Dawn, he said he had conveyed these messages in separate meetings with top government functionaries, including the army chief, the chief justice and members of the federal cabinet.
The focus of his visit was to engage with the government on pressing human rights issues and learn about Pakistan’s plans to address them ahead of the GSP+ monitoring mission.</p><small>2025-11-19 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/192046255683a0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956086/pakistan-to-build-island-to-boost-oil-exploration-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to build island to boost oil exploration: report</strong></a><br><p>State-owned energy company Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) is reclaiming land from the sea to create a launchpad to ramp up oil and gas exploration, US outlet Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
Citing PPL’s General Manager Exploration and Core Business Development, Arshad Palekar, Bloomberg reported that the artificial island will be created about 30 kilometres off the coast of Sindh, near Sujawal. He said this on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference in Islamabad.
“Planned with a height of six feet, the platform will prevent high tides from interrupting round-the-clock exploration work,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan’s drilling efforts are gaining fresh momentum after United States President Donald Trump indicated an interest in the country’s “massive oil reserves” in a social media post in July.
Since then, Islamabad has awarded offshore exploration licenses to local companies PPL, Mari Energies Ltd and Prime International Oil and Gas Company.
“The project, a first for Pakistan, builds on Abu Dhabi’s experience, where artificial islands for drilling have been successfully built,” Palekar said.
Construction of the island will be completed in February, and operation will start immediately after, according to Palekar. The company aims to drill around 25 wells.
Vitol and Cnergyico, Pakistan’s largest oil refiner, delivered the country’s biggest single shipment of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) for ship refuelling, the global trading firm said in a statement late Monday.
This shipment came from Cnergyico’s first large-scale batch of fuel that meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) low-sulphur rules. The company began producing it after importing its first US crude oil cargoes earlier this year.
The move will enable large vessels refuelling in Pakistan to now sail longer routes from east to west without needing to stop elsewhere, while also giving the country a stronger local supply of environmentally compliant marine fuel.</p><small>2025-11-19 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1920212261e1142.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956084/japans-biggest-fire-in-nearly-50-years-ravages-170-buildings-kills-one' target='_blank'><strong>Japan’s biggest fire in nearly 50 years ravages 170 buildings, kills one</strong></a><br><p>A fire ripped through more than 170 buildings and killed one person in a southern Japanese coastal city on Wednesday, with military and firefighting helicopters scrambling to extinguish the country’s largest urban blaze in almost half a century.
Aerial footage from broadcasters showed houses reduced to rubble and thick plumes of smoke rising from the hilly Saganoseki district of Oita city, which overlooks a fishing harbour renowned for its premium Seki-brand mackerel.
The flames had also spread to nearby forested slopes and an uninhabited island more than one kilometre off the coast, likely due to strong winds, local media reported.
The blaze started on Tuesday evening and has burned 48,900 square metres — roughly the size of seven soccer fields — forcing 175 residents in the district, some 770 kilometres southwest of Tokyo, to flee to an emergency shelter, Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.
The cause of the fire was under investigation, the agency added.
One person has been found dead, local media reported, citing police sources, while a woman in her 50s was reported to be hospitalised for mild burns.
“I extend my heartfelt condolences to all residents who are evacuating in the cold,” Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in a post on X.
“The government will provide the maximum possible support in collaboration with local authorities,” she wrote.
 


The fire has caused power outages at around 300 houses in the district, according to Kyushu Electric Power.
The number of buildings and size of the area engulfed in flames make it the largest urban fire in Japan since a 1976 blaze in Sakata, excluding incidents caused by earthquakes.
In 2016, a fire in Itoigawa burned 147 buildings and about 40,000 square metres. No one was killed.</p><small>2025-11-19 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19175928d853585.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956079/pakistan-navy-seizes-over-2000kg-of-crystal-meth-worth-nearly-130m-in-arabian-sea-drug-bust' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy seizes over 2,000kg of crystal meth worth nearly $130m in Arabian Sea drug bust</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy (PN) seized over 2,000 kilogrammes of methamphetamine, commonly known as ice, in a drug bust worth $130 million in the Arabian Sea, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.
The statement from the navy’s Directorate-General Public Relations (DG PR) said the PN Tabuk was conducting a regional maritime security patrol in support of the Saudi-led Combined Task Force 150 under the Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, when it intercepted a “suspicious dhow” operating in the Arabian Sea.
“Subsequently, the ship successfully conducted a major counter-narcotics operation onboard stateless dhow, resulting in the seizure of over 2000kg of ice,” the statement said, adding that the capture was the third consecutive successful interdiction conducted in the last two months by PN ships.
The navy said these successful operations demonstrated its “enduring resolve and unwavering commitment” against illicit trafficking at sea.
“The scale of the operation, coupled with its flawless execution, underscores not only PN’s professionalism but also the effectiveness of multinational coordination under CMF.”
“PN remains steadfast in its resolve to safeguard national maritime interests and uphold principles of the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea while contributing to the global commons through maritime security efforts,” the statement concluded.
 






Last month, PN Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972m from sailboats in the Arabian Sea.
In August, the navy and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) had seized about 1,250kg of illicit drugs worth $38m from smugglers near Balochistan’s Pasni coast.</p><small>2025-11-19 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19182056d287833.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956077/cm-maryam-announces-allocation-of-80-e-buses-for-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam announces allocation of 80 e-buses for Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday announced the allocation of 80 electric buses for Rawalpindi, aiming to improve public transportation and reduce congestion.
The chief minister was scheduled to inaugurate the new transport system in the garrison city on October 15, but the ceremony was cancelled due to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan protest in Islamabad.
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the electric bus initiative in Rawalpindi today, CM Maryam said, “The electric buses are equipped with modern amenities, including air conditioning, free Wi-Fi, and charging ports.”
The initiative, the chief minister highlighted, is part of a broader effort to enhance infrastructure and public services in Rawalpindi. Other projects include signal-free corridors, flyovers, and hospitals.
“The government has allocated significant funds for road construction and improvement,” she said, adding that the electric buses are part of a larger plan to promote sustainable transportation and reduce pollution.
“The buses are wheelchair accessible and have dedicated compartments for women,” CM Maryam pointed out.
She detailed that the fare for the buses is Rs20, with free travel for women, the elderly, and children with special needs.
“The government has also launched initiatives to improve healthcare, education, and social welfare,” CM Maryam said. “New hospitals and schools are being built, and existing ones are being upgraded.”
“Crime has reduced by 70 per cent in Punjab, and efforts are being made to further improve public safety,” she claimed. “The initiatives are part of a broader effort to promote development and improve the quality of life for citizens.”
Earlier today, Dawn reported that in the first phase, 45 e-buses will be operated on four routes and the number of buses will be expanded in the coming days.

“Pakistan’s military success over India in its four-day clash showcased Chinese weaponry,” said a report submitted to the US Congress on Tuesday by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, formed to report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the US and China.
Pakistan initially said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat during the conflict, but later raised the tally to seven. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and says it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted. US President Donald Trump, who continues to comment on the conflict, most recently said that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
In its annual report, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission referred to the May conflict and said that China used it to “test and promote its own defence capabilities”.
The report submitted to Congress also highlighted China’s role in the conflict, saying that it drew global attention as “Pakistan’s military relied upon Chinese weaponry and reportedly leveraged Chinese intelligence”.
It also cited New Delhi’s claims of China helping Pakistan with “live inputs on Indian military positions throughout the crisis”, adding that “Pakistan denied these allegations, and China neither confirmed nor denied its degree of involvement”.
According to the report, China expanded its military cooperation with Pakistan in 2025, “compounding its own security tensions with India”.
In November and December 2024, China and Pakistan held the three-week Warrior-VIII counter-terrorism drills, and in February this year, China’s navy participated in Pakistan’s multinational AMAN drills, the report recalled, adding that these exercises highlighted “growing defence cooperation” between the two countries.
“India’s commentators viewed the drills as losses in their relationship with
China and as direct security threats to its territorial positions,” the report said.
Referring to the May conflict, the report said, “While [the] characterisation of this conflict as a ‘proxy war’ may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the context of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defence industry goals.”
The report also mentioned that as Pakistan’s largest defence supplier, China provided approximately 82 per cent of the country’s arms imports from 2019 to 2023.
The May clash was the first time China’s modern weapons systems, including the HQ-9 air defence system, PL-15 air-to-air missiles and J-10 fighter aircraft, were used in active combat, serving as a real-world field experiment, the report added.
It also stated that China reportedly offered to sell 40 J-35 fifth-generation fighter jets, KJ-500 aircraft and ballistic missile defence systems to Pakistan in June. “That same month, Pakistan announced a 20pc increase in its 2025–2026 defence budget, raising planned expenditures to $9 billion despite an overall budget decrease.”
“In the weeks after the conflict, Chinese embassies hailed the successes of its systems in the India-Pakistan clash, seeking to bolster weapons sales,” the report alleged.
It also mentioned allegations by the French intelligence of China initiating a
“disinformation campaign to hinder sales of French Rafales in favour of its own J-35s” and using “fake social media accounts to propagate AI and video game images of supposed ‘debris’ from the planes China’s weaponry destroyed”.
 
 

The conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-11-19 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19143238d834fb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956039/court-finds-sania-zehras-husband-guilty-of-her-murder-sentences-him-to-death' target='_blank'><strong>Court finds Sania Zehra’s husband guilty of her murder, sentences him to death</strong></a><br><p>An additional district and sessions judge in Multan has sentenced to death the husband of the 20-year-old pregnant woman who was killed last year in Multan, it emerged on Wednesday.
Sania Zehra — a mother of two — was found dead in her room on July 9 2024, hanging from a ceiling fan. Her father, Syed Asad Abbas, had claimed that her sudden death was not a suicide but an alleged murder. He said his daughter’s in-laws were disguising the murder as a suicide.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at the New Multan police station on his complaint under Sections 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In a one-page court order, dated November 18 — a copy of which is available with Dawn — Additional Sessions judge Mohsin Ali Khan ruled that Syed Muhammad Ali Raza has been “duly convicted of the Qatal-i-Amd of Sania Zehra deceased,” and sentenced the convict to “death as Ta’zir under Section 302 (b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).”
“Syed Muhammad Ali Raza convict, shall be hanged by neck till his death is pronounced,” the court order read.
According to Section 302(b) of the PPC, “whoever commits Qatal-i-Amd shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life as ta’zir.”
The court also directed the convict to pay Rs500,000 to the victim’s family as compensation under Section 554-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,“ adding that “in case of default he (the convict) shall undergo imprisonment for six months.”
In two separate court orders — both seen by Dawn — the brother of the main convict, Syed Haider Raza, and his mother, Syeda Azra Parveen, were also found guilty of the murder of Zehra.
The court sentenced them both to life imprisonment and directed each of them to pay Rs500,00 to the family of the victims.
Sania Zehra case
In July 2024, a 20-year-old pregnant mother of two was found dead in Multan. The FIR, which narrated the victim’s father’s complaint, stated that he received a call from a police official, who asked him to head to his daughter’s residence.
The complaint said that after the family reached the scene, they found the victim hanging from a ceiling fan. It said that when the forensic specialist arrived at the scene and tried to untie the noose around the victim’s neck, it opened up quite easily. It said that a doctor present at the scene said that the victim had died at 6pm that day.
The police registered a case under sections 302, 148, and 149 of the PPC against the husband of the deceased, Ali Raza, his brother Ali Haider, father Jeevan Shah, mother Azra Bibi, sister Kanwal Bibi, and sister-in-law Syeda Dua on the complaint of the deceased’s father.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19152549b4f7bf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956037/ajks-18-new-ministers-take-oath-of-office-2-advisers-appointed' target='_blank'><strong>AJK’s 18 new ministers take oath of office; 2 advisers appointed</strong></a><br><p>A day after newly-elected Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore’s oath-taking, 18 legislators from the PPP were sworn in as ministers for his cabinet on Wednesday.
The oath to the 18 ministers was administered at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Muzaffarabad by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was substituting as the acting president due to the illness of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood. Mahmood reportedly could not travel to the regional capital due to health issues.
PM Rathore, as well as former AJK premiers Sardar Tanveer Ilyas and Haji Yaqoob Khan, were also present on the occasion. A large number of PPP workers and supporters, as well as several senior civil servants, also attended the ceremony.
The newly-appointed ministers are Mian Abdul Waheed, Sardar Javed Ayoub, Javed Iqbal Budhanvi, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Amar Yasin, Sardar Ziaul Qamar, Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi, Nabila Ayub Khan, Deevan Ali Chughtai, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Chaudhry Arshad, Chaudhry Muhammad Rasheed, Yasir Sultan, Sardar Muhammad Hussain, Chaudhry Akhlaq, Faheem Akhtar Rabbani, Rafique Nayyar and Ali Shan Soni.
Of them, the first eight were elected on the PPP ticket in 2021. The rest had contested the elections on the PTI ticket and recently joined the PPP.
Nabila Ayub Khan is the only female minister in the cabinet who was elected on a reserved seat. No MLA elected on refugee seats has been inducted in the cabinet.
The portfolios of cabinet members were not immediately announced. A notification issued later in the day said  Mian Abdul Waheed was designated as the most senior minister.
At the oath-taking ceremony, a notification of the appointment of two advisers to the government was read by the secretary of services and general administration. Sardar Ahmad Saghir, whose mother Shahida Saghir is a directly elected MLA, and Sardar Fahad Yaqoob, son of Haji Yaqoob, have been appointed as the advisers.
Shahida was also elected on a PTI ticket but deserted the party afterwards and joined the PPP recently.
The AJK Constitution legitimises the appointment of advisers to the government, but it is silent on their oath-taking. Nevertheless, an oath was administered to the two new advisers by PM Rathore.
Rathore was sworn in as the new AJK premier on Tuesday, a day after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. He is the fourth PM elected in AJK in as many years.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:34</small></div><hr>
