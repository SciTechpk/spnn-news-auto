During the three-day visit, he will attend the seventh strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the European Union (EU).
 






The Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue is the highest level of institutionalised interaction between the two sides, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release today. FM Dar was in Moscow to lead the Pakistani delegation at the SCO summit.
According to the FO, Dar  co-chair the seventh session of Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue at the invitation of Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.
The dialogue will review cooperation between Pakistan and the EU in all sectors under the Pakistan-EU Strategic Engagement Plan 2019, it said.
 






In Brussels, the deputy premier will also participate in the fourth EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum, which will be held over the next two days and will be chaired by Kallas.
Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts and engagements with senior EU officials, according to the FO.
Dar’s visit to Brussels marks a “significant milestone in Pakistan-EU relations”, the statement highlighted, affirming that Islamabad remains committed to developing a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership” with the EU.
Separately, after arrival in Brussels, Dar posted on X that he “look[s] forward to engaging with the president of the European Council, EU high representative/ vice-president, EU commissioners, members of the European Parliament, and other leaders attending the IMPF”.
 






When departing from Russia, Dar expressed his gratitude to the host government for its “warm hospitality and the successful organisation” of the SCO moot, the FO said on social media platform X.
He also appreciated the support extended by the embassy of Pakistan in Moscow and the teams at the Foreign Office for facilitating his visit.
 






Dar meets Russian FM, Qatari PM on sidelines of SCO summit
Earlier today, the FO said that Dar met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the 24th summit of the SCO’s Council of Heads of Governments (CHG) in Moscow.
In a statement, the FO said both sides “reviewed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed deep satisfaction at the current positive trajectory of relations”.
Dar congratulated Lavrov on the successful hosting of the meeting, noting the “vital role of both countries’ leadership […] as well as bilateral institutional mechanisms in further strengthening bilateral relations”, according to the statement.
“The leaders also exchanged views on regional and international issues. Taking into account the excellent coordination at multilateral fora, including the United Nations and the SCO, they pledged to deepen them further in the interest of both countries,” the FO added.
 






Dar also held an “informal discussion” with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on the sidelines of the CHG meeting, according to the FO.
The two ministers exchanged views on “bilateral relations and priorities for regional cooperation”, it added.
 






Interactions with Chinese premier, Central Asian leaders
Among a string of posts, the FO also posted pictures of Dar meeting Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the margins of the summit, where they discussed enhancing collaboration among the member states of the SCO.
 






He also met Adylbek Kasymaliev, chairman of the cabinet of ministers and head of the presidential administration of the Kyrgyz Republic, and congratulated him on assuming chairmanship of the SCO Heads of State.
“Highlighting the importance of regional collaboration, the two leaders exchanged views on SCO initiatives and Kyrgyzstan’s assumption of the rotating presidency,” the FO said.
 






Meeting Uzbekistan’s PM Abdulla Aripov, Dar “appreciated the positive momentum in Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations and underscored the importance of high-level interactions and cooperation at multilateral fora”.
 






Dar also met with Tajikistan’s PM Kokhir Rasulzoda, congratulating him on his assumption of the chairmanship of the next CHG meeting. He reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries across diverse areas, the FO said.

“Pakistan’s military success over India in its four-day clash showcased Chinese weaponry,” said a report submitted to the US Congress on Tuesday by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, formed to report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the US and China.
Pakistan initially said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat during the conflict, but later raised the tally to seven. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and says it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted. US President Donald Trump, who continues to comment on the conflict, most recently said that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
In its annual report, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission referred to the May conflict and said that China used it to “test and promote its own defence capabilities”.
The report submitted to Congress also highlighted China’s role in the conflict, saying that it drew global attention as “Pakistan’s military relied upon Chinese weaponry and reportedly leveraged Chinese intelligence”.
It also cited New Delhi’s claims of China helping Pakistan with “live inputs on Indian military positions throughout the crisis”, adding that “Pakistan denied these allegations, and China neither confirmed nor denied its degree of involvement”.
According to the report, China expanded its military cooperation with Pakistan in 2025, “compounding its own security tensions with India”.
In November and December 2024, China and Pakistan held the three-week Warrior-VIII counter-terrorism drills, and in February this year, China’s navy participated in Pakistan’s multinational AMAN drills, the report recalled, adding that these exercises highlighted “growing defence cooperation” between the two countries.
“India’s commentators viewed the drills as losses in their relationship with
China and as direct security threats to its territorial positions,” the report said.
Referring to the May conflict, the report said, “While [the] characterisation of this conflict as a ‘proxy war’ may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the context of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defence industry goals.”
The report also mentioned that as Pakistan’s largest defence supplier, China provided approximately 82 per cent of the country’s arms imports from 2019 to 2023.
The May clash was the first time China’s modern weapons systems, including the HQ-9 air defence system, PL-15 air-to-air missiles and J-10 fighter aircraft, were used in active combat, serving as a real-world field experiment, the report added.
It also stated that China reportedly offered to sell 40 J-35 fifth-generation fighter jets, KJ-500 aircraft and ballistic missile defence systems to Pakistan in June. “That same month, Pakistan announced a 20pc increase in its 2025–2026 defence budget, raising planned expenditures to $9 billion despite an overall budget decrease.”
“In the weeks after the conflict, Chinese embassies hailed the successes of its systems in the India-Pakistan clash, seeking to bolster weapons sales,” the report alleged.
It also mentioned allegations by the French intelligence of China initiating a
“disinformation campaign to hinder sales of French Rafales in favour of its own J-35s” and using “fake social media accounts to propagate AI and video game images of supposed ‘debris’ from the planes China’s weaponry destroyed”.
 
 

The conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-11-19 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19143238d834fb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956039/court-finds-sania-zehras-husband-guilty-of-her-murder-sentences-him-to-death' target='_blank'><strong>Court finds Sania Zehra’s husband guilty of her murder, sentences him to death</strong></a><br><p>An additional district and sessions judge in Multan has sentenced to death the husband of the 20-year-old pregnant woman who was killed last year in Multan, it emerged on Wednesday.
Sania Zehra — a mother of two — was found dead in her room on July 9 2024, hanging from a ceiling fan. Her father, Syed Asad Abbas, had claimed that her sudden death was not a suicide but an alleged murder. He said his daughter’s in-laws were disguising the murder as a suicide.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at the New Multan police station on his complaint under Sections 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In a one-page court order, dated November 18 — a copy of which is available with Dawn — Additional Sessions judge Mohsin Ali Khan ruled that Syed Muhammad Ali Raza has been “duly convicted of the Qatal-i-Amd of Sania Zehra deceased,” and sentenced the convict to “death as Ta’zir under Section 302 (b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).”
“Syed Muhammad Ali Raza convict, shall be hanged by neck till his death is pronounced,” the court order read.
According to Section 302(b) of the PPC, “whoever commits Qatal-i-Amd shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life as ta’zir.”
The court also directed the convict to pay Rs500,000 to the victim’s family as compensation under Section 554-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,“ adding that “in case of default he (the convict) shall undergo imprisonment for six months.”
In two separate court orders — both seen by Dawn — the brother of the main convict, Syed Haider Raza, and his mother, Syeda Azra Parveen, were also found guilty of the murder of Zehra.
The court sentenced them both to life imprisonment and directed each of them to pay Rs500,00 to the family of the victims.
Sania Zehra case
In July 2024, a 20-year-old pregnant mother of two was found dead in Multan. The FIR, which narrated the victim’s father’s complaint, stated that he received a call from a police official, who asked him to head to his daughter’s residence.
The complaint said that after the family reached the scene, they found the victim hanging from a ceiling fan. It said that when the forensic specialist arrived at the scene and tried to untie the noose around the victim’s neck, it opened up quite easily. It said that a doctor present at the scene said that the victim had died at 6pm that day.
The police registered a case under sections 302, 148, and 149 of the PPC against the husband of the deceased, Ali Raza, his brother Ali Haider, father Jeevan Shah, mother Azra Bibi, sister Kanwal Bibi, and sister-in-law Syeda Dua on the complaint of the deceased’s father.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19153652ca5122b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956036/reserved-seats-case-justice-mandokhail-says-ros-rightly-showed-41-candidates-as-independents' target='_blank'><strong>Reserved seats case: Justice Mandokhail says ROs rightly showed 41 candidates as independents</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court’s Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has observed that returning officers (ROs) correctly prepared lists of 41 candidates during the 2024 general elections, as it was PTI’s decision-makers who compelled them to contest independently.
Justice Mandokhail, a member of the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB), made the observation in his additional note in the reserved seats review case. In its June 27 ruling, the CB, by a majority of seven judges, had overturned the earlier SC judgment of July 12, 2024 that had granted reserved seats to the PTI.
While seven judges had accepted all review petitions filed by the ruling coalition parties, three others — including Justice Mandokhail — had partially allowed them, and two had rejected the pleas outright on the first day of the hearing.
Justice Mandokhail had maintained his original July 2024 order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats. In his note uploaded on the SC website on Tuesday, the judge detailed the reasoning for his ruling and how the CB could not include all judges who were part of the original bench due to the post-26th Amendment scenario.
“Apparently, it was the PTI’s decision-makers’ decision, which compelled the 41 candidates and others to submit their nomination papers independently,” Justice Mandokhail wrote, adding that the majority of the original SC bench did not “consider this important aspect of the case”.
The judge noted that to the extent of those 41 candidates, the ROs “correctly prepared [a] list of contesting candidates while drawing Form-33, showing them as independents” and those 41 individuals then joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) by exercising their right provided under Article 51 (6d) of the Constitution.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail pointed out that the 41 candidates had declared themselves as independents in their nomination papers submitted by Dec 24, 2023, which was before the January 2024 SC verdict that revoked the PTI’s bat symbol — the same judgment that PTI argued led to “peculiar circumstances” and therefore the independent declarations.
PTI’s Salman Akram Raja said that the party “administration had decided that the candidates should submit their nomination papers independently to avoid any unwarranted situation”, the note recalled.
“They did not claim to be affiliated with PTI nor showed their intention to leave SIC and join any other party. Under such circumstances, how could it be presumed that their declaration as independent candidates was on account of that judgment?” Justice Mandokhail said.
He added that if Raja’s contention about peculiar circumstances was “believed to be correct, a question arises as to how those 39 returned candidates and the number of others who lost elections, submitted their nomination papers declaring themselves as PTI’s candidates?”
However, about the 39 PTI-backed people who had submitted their party nomination papers, Justice Mandokhail maintained that the ROs and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had “mis-exercised their jurisdiction by declaring the PTI’s 39 affiliated candidates as independents [and] by refusing to allot reserved seats to PTI on the strength of its affiliated returned candidates”.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan then, the CB, through a short order on June 27, had overturned the July 12, 2024 majority judgment that declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies.
Majority of CB refused ‘best solution’ on way to include original bench judges
In his additional note, Justice Mandokhail also touched upon the matter of not being able to include judges from the SC bench that gave the original July 2024 verdict.
He noted that after the 26th Amendment, the CB was specifically authorised to hear constitutional matters and hence, a 13-member CB was formed out of the 15 judges nominated by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). The bench excluded Justices Shakeel Ahmad and Ishtiaq Ibrahim as they were part of the Peshawar High Court bench whose order had been challenged.
While the judge stated it was “not practicable” to fix the petitions before the same bench that had delivered the judgment under review, he noted that the purpose of fixing the review pleas before the same judges was “to ensure judicial continuity and consistency”.
“There is no bar upon the JCP to nominate all judges of the Supreme Court,” Justice Mandokhail maintained.
“In order to make it practicable to fix these CRPs (civil review petitions) before the same bench, I proposed that the matter be referred to the JCP to nominate the rest of the members of the original bench,” he wrote, as that would allow the constitutional committee to reconstitute the CB and include the original bench’s judges.
 
 

“Had the matter been referred to the JCP, the [Supreme Court Rules] of 1980
could have been implemented within the parameters of the Constitution. It was the best solution to resolve the problem, which would have fostered
public trust and confidence in the judiciary.
“However, the majority members of the CB did not agree and decided to proceed with the matter through the available members nominated by the JCP,” Justice Mandokhail revealed.
‘Presumption that 41 were PTI candidates not supported by any evidence’
In its detailed judgment released last month, the CB ruled that the original SC verdict was not justified in granting relief to PTI by invoking Article 187 of the Constitution — which empowers the court to do complete justice — when no issue regarding the grant of reserved seats to the party was pending before it.
In the detailed verdict, 10 judges of the 12-judge CB held that there was no justification in giving relief to the PTI under Article 187, especially when appeals were filed and pursued by the SIC under Article 185(3) (appeal against high court order) of the Constitution.
 
 

Now, in his additional note, Justice Mandokhail explained that the majority members of the original bench declared 41 MNAs as independents and gave them an option to join any political party within 15 days, “despite the fact that the matter of 41 candidates was never pending before the Supreme Court as well as before any of the fora below”.
“The decision of the majority members proves the fact that those 41 candidates were actually independents,” the judge observed.
“By now, it is well settled that a candidate who is elected with an affiliation of a particular political party or after being elected independently, joins any political party, cannot leave that particular party nor can join another,” Justice Mandokhail observed, adding if the candidate does so, he will face the consequences of losing his seat, as provided by Article 63A(1) of the Constitution.
“We have already held that no authority including the Supreme Court has the power to declare a candidate independent or change his status contrary to his declaration,” Justice Mandokhail emphasised.
He added that while there was no doubt on the SC’s jurisdiction under Article 187 to do complete justice in a matter pending before it, such power was not unlimited and hence, “cannot be expanded in any circumstance”.
 
 

Noting that pendency of a matter was a condition precedent under Article 187, the judge pointed out that “there was no matter pending before the Supreme Court with regard to declaring 41 candidates as independents nor did they claim such relief”.
Justice Mandokhail further said the majority members of July 2024 order “overlooked Article 51(6)(d) and consequences of Article 63A(1) of the Constitution” in declaring the 41 MNAs as independents.
“The presumption of majority members that those 41 candidates belonged to PTI has not been supported by any evidence or material available before them,” he wrote.
The labelling of those 41 lawmakers as independents and the option given to them to join a party in 15 days was “an error of the Constitution and law, as well as an error of facts floating on the surface of the record”, the judge declared.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail also acknowledged, “Judges are humans and humans are bound to make mistakes, which is a normal human psyche.
“The Supreme Court is the ultimate forum having inherent powers,” he added, noting that it had the power under Article 188 to review any judgment “only when serious injustice could be seen in its judgment or order on account of clear and evident mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record”.
“A mistake or an error in the judgment under review can only be corrected when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character, leading to a miscarriage of justice make it necessary to revisit the matter with a view to correction or improvement in the judgment, not to substitute its view,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19152549b4f7bf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956037/ajks-18-new-ministers-take-oath-of-office-2-advisers-appointed' target='_blank'><strong>AJK’s 18 new ministers take oath of office; 2 advisers appointed</strong></a><br><p>A day after newly-elected Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore’s oath-taking, 18 legislators from the PPP were sworn in as ministers for his cabinet on Wednesday.
The oath to the 18 ministers was administered at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Muzaffarabad by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was substituting as the acting president due to the illness of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood. Mahmood reportedly could not travel to the regional capital due to health issues.
PM Rathore, as well as former AJK premiers Sardar Tanveer Ilyas and Haji Yaqoob Khan, were also present on the occasion. A large number of PPP workers and supporters, as well as several senior civil servants, also attended the ceremony.
The newly-appointed ministers are Mian Abdul Waheed, Sardar Javed Ayoub, Javed Iqbal Budhanvi, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Amar Yasin, Sardar Ziaul Qamar, Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi, Nabila Ayub Khan, Deevan Ali Chughtai, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Chaudhry Arshad, Chaudhry Muhammad Rasheed, Yasir Sultan, Sardar Muhammad Hussain, Chaudhry Akhlaq, Faheem Akhtar Rabbani, Rafique Nayyar and Ali Shan Soni.
Of them, the first eight were elected on the PPP ticket in 2021. The rest had contested the elections on the PTI ticket and recently joined the PPP.
Nabila Ayub Khan is the only female minister in the cabinet who was elected on a reserved seat. No MLA elected on refugee seats has been inducted in the cabinet.
The portfolios of cabinet members were not immediately announced. A notification issued later in the day said  Mian Abdul Waheed was designated as the most senior minister.
At the oath-taking ceremony, a notification of the appointment of two advisers to the government was read by the secretary of services and general administration. Sardar Ahmad Saghir, whose mother Shahida Saghir is a directly elected MLA, and Sardar Fahad Yaqoob, son of Haji Yaqoob, have been appointed as the advisers.
Shahida was also elected on a PTI ticket but deserted the party afterwards and joined the PPP recently.
The AJK Constitution legitimises the appointment of advisers to the government, but it is silent on their oath-taking. Nevertheless, an oath was administered to the two new advisers by PM Rathore.
Rathore was sworn in as the new AJK premier on Tuesday, a day after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. He is the fourth PM elected in AJK in as many years.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19072416ca82d66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955967/pti-says-imrans-sisters-manhandled-violently-detained-by-police-while-camped-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says Imran’s sisters manhandled, ‘violently detained’ by police while camped outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>The PTI said late on Tuesday that police manhandled and “violently detained” the sisters of ex-premier Imran Khan from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder.
The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside the jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard.
In a post on social media platform X after midnight, the party said Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when the police action happened.
It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”.
“What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said.
 






Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail.
 






Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said.
She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.”
Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”.
 






In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night.
“By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said.
 






It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”.
“The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added.
It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”.
“This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said.
Meanwhile, a senior Rawalpindi police official told Dawn that no action was taken against the PTI protesters. He said that they were only removed from the road they were occupying.
Later, in the afternoon today, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja held a press conference along with Imran’s sisters and party leaders.
He said the PTI would approach the Supreme Court with the appeal that when Imran’s family and party workers were barred from meeting the PTI founder, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) “remained silent”.
The PTI had previously moved the IHC, seeking meetings with Imran. The IHC had issued a verbal order, directing the relevant authorities to allow the meetings. Yet, there has been a restriction on meetings.
Aleema also addressed the press conference, maintaining all their protests outside Adiala Jail had been peaceful. She alleged that one of her sisters, who is a doctor, was “detained by police for hours last week” and police personnel stationed outside the jail had been “misbehaving” with them.
“Yesterday, too, we weren’t allowed to meet [Imran] and were protesting peacefully,” she said.
‘Our collective humiliation’
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet.
“The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return.
 






“This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi.
 






“With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir.
He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate.
“It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said.
 






Senior journalist Hamid Mir said that the current regime was not realising that the “inhumane and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family was tarnishing the country’s image globally.
“It’s becoming difficult for our diplomats serving in the West to defend at public forums,” he said.
 






Journalist Shahzad Iqbal termed the “dragging and manhandling [of] Imran Khan’s elderly sisters” a “shameless act of oppression”.
A day ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz “was saying we don’t indulge in politics or revenge and victimisation, and then imagine this happening in her provincial jurisdiction,” Iqbal added.
 






“Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”.
“Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said.
 






PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat condemned the treatment meted out to Noreen.
“Such brutality against a citizen — let alone a woman — is unacceptable. The state has reached a new low, and this abuse of power must end!” he said.
 






PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters.
“We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenish water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Data from Punjab’s disaster management authority shows this year’s floods affected at least 4.7 million people across 4,700 villages.
Speaking at a press conference with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik in Islamabad today, the climate change minister stated that “climate-induced disasters must be treated as a political priority,” noting that the 2022 floods alone caused losses exceeding 9 per cent of the GDP.
“Since 2010, there have been four to five floods. The most recent one, which has passed, its [damage] is still being assessed,” Dr Malik pointed out. “[Over 4,500] people have died in these floods. This many people don’t die in wars.”
He said the country’s political discourse ignores those most affected by extreme weather, describing climate vulnerability as the “core” around which national politics should revolve.
He said the prime minister chaired a detailed meeting earlier in the day where and was presented with assessments of riverine flooding, mountain torrents, urban flooding, coastal risks and glacial lake outburst floods.
 






According to Dr Malik, the government will ensure a three-tier approach: a 240 to 250-day “fix what is broken” phase focused on repairing damaged dykes and floodgates; a one-to-three-year expansion phase to upgrade undersized infrastructure such as Karachi’s drainage; and a three-to-five-year programme to build resilient systems.
The minister said the prime minister has also directed the integration of early warning systems at the tehsil and district levels, shifting alerts away from Islamabad so that local administrations receive the initial alarms.
Temporary schooling for displaced children, mobile healthcare units for injured survivors, and community-level training in vulnerable districts are also part of the short-term plan.
The NDMA chairman highlighted that Pakistan remains among the world’s most climate-affected countries. He said NDMA’s forecast indicates that the 2026 monsoon could bring 22pc to 26pc more intense weather compared to this year.
“Disaster management is a devolved subject, but provinces and the federation have to work together [to combat losses],” he said, adding that tourism and movement would be controlled in June and July to mitigate damage.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19104655deef3c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956019/air-india-lobbies-to-use-airspace-over-chinas-xinjiang-as-financial-woes-from-pakistan-ban-mount' target='_blank'><strong>Air India lobbies to use airspace over China’s Xinjiang as financial woes from Pakistan ban mount</strong></a><br><p>Air India is lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes as the financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan mounts, a company document shows.
The unusual request comes just weeks after direct India-China flights resumed after a five-year hiatus following a Himalayan border clash between the nations.
Air India has been seeking to rebuild its reputation and international network after a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed in Gujarat in June, killing 260 people and forcing it to briefly cut flights for safety checks.
But that effort is being complicated by the closure of Pakistan airspace to Indian carriers since diplomatic tensions erupted in late April.
For Air India, the country’s only carrier with a major international network, fuel costs have risen by as much as 29 per cent and journey times by up to three hours on some long-haul routes, according to the previously unreported document submitted to Indian officials in late October and reviewed by Reuters.
The Indian government is reviewing Air India’s plea to diplomatically ask China to allow an alternative routing and emergency access to airports in case of diversions at Hotan, Kashgar and Urumqi in Xinjiang, aiming to reach US, Canada and Europe faster, the document said.
“Air India’s long-haul network is under severe operational and financial strain … Securing Hotan route will be a strategic option,” it added.
The airline, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, estimated the Pakistan airspace closure’s impact on its profit before tax at $455 million annually — a significant amount given its fiscal 2024-25 loss stood at $439m.
The Chinese foreign ministry said it was not aware of the situation and referred Reuters to the “relevant authorities”.
Air India and civil aviation authorities in India, China and Pakistan did not respond to Reuters’ queries.
Without Hotan, some routes becoming ‘unviable’
The Chinese airspace Air India is seeking to access is ringed by some of the world’s highest mountains of 20,000 feet or more, and is avoided by international airlines due to potential safety risks in case of a decompression incident.
More critically, it also falls within People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theatre Command, which is equipped with extensive missile, drone and air-defence assets and shares some airports with civilian aircraft, military analysts say.
The Pentagon’s December report on China’s military said the command’s responsibilities include responding to any conflict with India.
China’s military has much greater control of the country’s airspace than in most other aviation markets, restricting flight paths. Open-source intelligence tracker Damien Symon said China’s military has recently expanded an airbase at Hotan.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Data from AirNav Radar shows no non-Chinese airlines departed or arrived at Hotan airport in the last 12 months.
Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said: “Air India can try, but it’s doubtful China will accede” to access given the region’s terrain, lack of emergency airports and possibility of security issues.
Airspace globally has been constricted due to proliferating conflict zones.
 
 

US carriers have been banned from flying over Russia since the Ukraine war began in 2022 and pulled out of many US-India routes. That gave Air India a near-monopoly on non-stop flights from India.
But after the Pakistan airspace closure, Air India’s Delhi-Washington route was suspended in August. Now other routes are under review, with the direct Mumbai- and Bengaluru to San Francisco routes “becoming unviable” due to an additional three hours of travel time, including a technical stop in Kolkata, the document said.
A flight from San Francisco to Mumbai on Lufthansa via Munich is now only five minutes longer than on Air India.
“Passengers (are) shifting to foreign carriers due to shorter flight time as they have the benefit of Pakistan overflight,” the document said.
Air India estimates the requested Hotan route in China could substantially cut extra fuel requirements and flight times, help restore passenger and cargo capacity it trimmed by as much as 15pc on routes like New York- and Vancouver-Delhi, and reduce losses by an estimated $1.13m per week.
Cash flow burden deepens finance woes
With no signs of airspace ban easing, Air India also wants “temporary subsidy till Pakistan airspace opens”, the document said.
Air India, which has placed $70 billion of aircraft orders, is seeking help resolving legacy tax issues.
India’s government indemnified the airline against claims payable before selling it to Tata in 2022, but several notices have been received related to old tax liabilities of $725m, raising legal and reputation risks, the document said.
A confidential government notice from March, seen by Reuters, showed tax authorities warned of “coercive steps” — which can include freezing of assets — to recover dues of $58m in one case.
Contesting such tax demands has led to “additional cashflow burden … despite assurances during disinvestment”, the airline said.</p><small>2025-11-19 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191128557dc5377.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956017/2026-fifa-world-cup-draw-picture-gets-clearer-after-dramatic-night-of-action' target='_blank'><strong>2026 FIFA World Cup draw picture gets clearer after dramatic night of action</strong></a><br><p>A dramatic night of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup across the globe ended with joy and heartbreak in equal measure, and with 42 of the 48 teams at next year’s showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico now known.
Scotland, in hair-raising fashion, and Austria, after snatching a late equaliser, ensured they will be appearing at the World Cup for the first time since 1998, joining Spain, Belgium and Switzerland as the final five of the 12 automatic qualifiers from Europe.
Across the Atlantic, Curacao became the smallest country to ever win a berth at the finals, joining Haiti and Panama in locking up the three automatic berths from the North and Central American region.
In Asia, Iraq kept their World Cup qualification dream alive with a penalty in the 17th minute of injury time to secure a place in the six-team inter-confederation play-off tournament in March.
Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, New Caledonia, Suriname and Jamaica are the other teams in the playoff with two spots up for grabs.
The remaining four berths at the World Cup will be filled from Europe, through UEFA’s 16-team playoffs.
The draw for the World Cup is set for December 5 in Washington, DC.

Scotland’s stunning late show
At a rocking Hampden Park in Glasgow, injury-time wonder-goals by Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean handed Scotland a stunning 4-2 win over Denmark that secured top spot in Group ‘C’.
Level at 2-2 as the clock ticked past 90, Denmark were set to advance to the World Cup as group winners until Tierney curled in an exquisite finish from distance three minutes into injury time.
McLean then put the match beyond doubt as he lifted the ball over Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who was well off his line, from the halfway line on 98 minutes.
“That just sums up this squad,” captain Andy Robertson told the BBC. “Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games.
“We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup.”

Earlier, Napoli midfielder Scott McTominay had given the hosts a third-minute lead with a towering overhead kick.
McTominay’s clubmate Rasmus Hojlund levelled for Denmark from the spot just shy of the hour, before his side went down to 10 as Rasmus Kristensen picked up a second booking.
An anxious Hampden Park let out a roar of ecstasy and relief in the 78th minute as Lawrence Shankland turned in from close range.
But Denmark struck back again through Patrick Dorgu four minutes later before Tierney and McLean stole the headlines.
Denmark, who only needed to avoid defeat to make sure of their third successive World Cup finals appearance, were left crestfallen.
From a position of control in the group they managed only one point from their last two games, including the home draw with Belarus on Saturday, which opened the door for Scotland to seal an automatic place with victory on Tuesday.
The Danes were the better side for most of the night too but must now face last-chance saloon in the playoffs.
“I thought we were pretty rubbish to be honest, but who cares?” Scotland talisman John McGinn said.
Austria’s late leveller
Michael Gregoritsch’s 77th-minute equaliser snatched Austria a 1-1 draw against visitors Bosnia that sealed top spot in Group ‘H’. Bosnia finished second in the group and go into the playoffs.
“I can’t believe it; we made it! I have been trying to reach the World Cup for 18 years. Finally now, at the end of my career, we got there. I can’t wait,” 36-year-old Austrian forward Marko Arnautovic said.
Needing a win to top the group and secure automatic qualification to their second World Cup after their maiden appearance in 2014, Bosnia stunned the home crowd when Haris Tabakovic headed in from close range to give them a 12th-minute lead.
The forward has now scored in each of their last three qualifiers, including in Saturday’s 3-1 win over Romania.

Ralf Rangnick’s Austria bounced back, retook control and put the ball in the net on the stroke of halftime but Konrad Laimer’s effort was overruled for a foul after a lengthy VAR review.
The visitors were content to sit back and soak up the pressure in the second half, hoping to catch Austria on the break.
But the hosts’ pressure eventually paid off when Gregoritsch saw Marcel Sabitzer’s cross sail past the Bosnian keeper before bouncing off the post and into his path for a powerful finish and his 23rd and most memorable international goal.
“It was difficult. It was really difficult,” Rangnick said. “Conceding a goal naturally made it even more difficult. But then we threw everything into it and were eventually rewarded. If Bosnia play like this, they will progress too.”
Spain, Switzerland qualify

Switzerland will appear in a sixth successive World Cup finals after drawing 1-1 in Pristina against Kosovo.
With the Swiss needing to avoid a defeat by six goals to seal top spot in Group ‘B’, they rarely looked troubled as Ruben Vargas handed them the lead in the 47th minute before Florent Muslija equalised.
Spain secured their place after a nervy 2-2 draw with Turkey in Seville, finishing unbeaten at the top of Group ‘E’ despite being given a genuine scare by their resilient visitors.
The European champions took an early lead through Dani Olmo in the fourth minute but Turkey, who needed an almost impossible seven-goal victory to claim the group, managed to equalise through Deniz Gul in the 42nd minute.
Turkey then stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Salih Ozcan strike from the edge of the box.
However, Mikel Oyarzabal levelled the match eight minutes later to avoid what would have been Spain’s first home defeat in a qualifier and Turkey had to settle for a place in the playoffs for next year’s finals in North America.

“We wanted to finish with a win and a clean sheet, so it’s bitter-sweet…
but we’re happy to qualify for the World Cup,” Olmo told TVE.
Belgium, semi-finalists in 2018, cruised into the draw for the World Cup with a Jeremy Doku-inspired 7-0 hammering of Liechtenstein.
The Manchester City winger grabbed a brace in Liege as Charles De Ketelaere also netted twice and Hans Vanaken, Brandon Mechele and Alexis Saelemaekers completed the rout.
In the other Group ‘J’ match, second-placed Wales also ran up seven goals as they beat North Macedonia 7-1 with Harry Wilson scoring a hat-trick of set-piece goals.
North Macedonia can, nonetheless, look forward to a play-off place courtesy of their Nations League performance.
Romania, who beat San Marino by the same scoreline, will also have the chance to reach the World Cup thanks to the Nations League after finishing third in Group ‘H’.
Sweden, who picked up just their second point of the qualifying campaign with a 1-1 home draw against Slovenia, advanced in the same manner.
Curacao seal fairytale
A nerve-shredding finale to the CONCACAF qualifying campaign saw Curacao — with a population of just 156,000 — squeeze into next year’s finals with a 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston.
The team known as the ‘Blue Wave’ finished top of Group ‘B’ with 12 points from six games, one point clear of Jamaica.
Curacao, whose veteran Dutch coach Dick Advocaat was forced to miss the game due to a family issue in the Netherlands, are by far the smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup.
 






The previous smallest country to qualify for the tournament were Iceland in 2018, with a population of around 350,000.
Curacao finally booked their place after an extraordinary finale at Kingston’s National Stadium, where Jamaica — coached by former England manager Steve McClaren — launched a furious onslaught as they chased the win which would guarantee them a World Cup place at their opponent’s expense.
The Jamaicans hit the the woodwork three times in the second half, with substitute Bailey-Tye Cadamarteri going agonizingly close with a header that crashed off the post in the 87th minute.
There was more drama in store in stoppage time, when Jamaica were awarded a penalty after substitute Jeremy Antonisse’s sliding tackle brought down Dujuan Richards in the area.
Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton pointed to the spot to leave Curacao facing the prospect of a heartbreaking defeat.
But as Curacao’s players protested, the decision went to VAR and was dramatically overturned to leave the Caribbean islanders on course for the World Cup.
Haiti defy the odds
Haiti defied the odds to book their place, beating Nicaragua 2-0 in Curacao, where they have been forced to play their home fixtures because of the strife in their country, to finish top of Group ‘C’.
Haiti’s qualification was remarkable given that armed gangs have taken control of almost all of the capital, Port-au-Prince, in a conflict that has forced some 1.3 million people from their homes and fuelled famine-level hunger.
The levels of danger in Haiti are such that their coach, Sbastien Migne, has not been there since being appointed 18 months ago but the Frenchman has nevertheless managed to engineer a fairytale qualification their second after a first appearance in 1974.

Haiti started the final round of fixtures on Tuesday behind Honduras on goal difference, but goals from Louicious Deedson and Ruben Providence lifted them to 11 points, while Honduras drew 0-0 away at Costa Rica and finished on nine, missing out on a place in next year’s inter-continental playoffs on goal difference from Suriname.
Panama, meanwhile, grabbed the other automatic qualification spot on offer with a 3-0 win over El Salvador at home that saw them end up as winners of Group ‘A’.
Panama romped through their game, ahead early after a thunderous strike from wingback Cesar Blackman, with their second coming from the penalty spot courtesy of Eric Davis, who was in the squad when Panama made their only previous World Cup appearance in 2018.
Substitute Jose Luis Rodriguez added a third late in the game.
Suriname had been ahead of Panama on goal difference before the start of Tuesday’s games but lost 3-1 in Guatemala.
However, a late own goal kept them in World Cup contention as they will go, along with Jamaica, to the inter-confederation playoff tournament.
Iraq down UAE

In front of a packed-out Basra International Stadium, Iraq’s Amir Al-Ammari struck from the spot to claim a dramatic 2-1 home win over the United Arab Emirates and secure a 3-2 aggregate victory that took Graham Arnold’s side into March’s intercontinental playoffs.
After last week’s 1-1 first-leg draw, the UAE broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute on Tuesday, as Yahia Nader slipped the ball through for Brazilian-born forward Caio Lucas to fire the ball past Iraq goalkeeper Jalal Hachim.
Iraq, who are trying to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since their debut appearance in 1986, were second-best for much of the game but a set piece allowed Arnold’s side to pull level.
Al-Ammari swung his free kick from the left flank towards the six-yard box and Mohanad Ali’s header took a deflection off Nader that ensured goalkeeper Khalid Eisa had little chance of preventing the ball from crossing the line.
The home side piled on the pressure late on, with Ali missing two good chances to score a winner.
But VAR awarded Iraq the latest of penalties for a handball, and Al-Ammari stepped up to net the spot-kick and keep alive his nation’s hopes of ending their 40-year wait to play in a World Cup.

“Tonight, I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” Trump said during a formal black-tie dinner at the White House.
“And I’m just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” Trump said of the designation, which only 19 other countries have previously received.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

According to Politico, the other countries in that category include Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar.
The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June had made Saudi Arabia safer, Trump added.
Meanwhile, bin Salman had earlier promised to increase his country’s US investment to $1 trillion from a $600 billion pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But offered no details or timetable.
In his remarks at the dinner, the Saudi crown prince thanked Trump for the “warm welcome” accorded to him.
“This relationship started close to nine decades ago,” he said, adding that the two countries had worked together during this period.
“But today is a special day. We think the horizon of economic cooperation between US and Saudi Arabia, it’s bigger and wider,” he said, adding that the two were also signing agreements that would lead to deeper ties.
Defence agreement
Separately, a White House fact sheet said the two sides signed a Strategic Defence Agreement, which “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East,” makes it easier for US defense firms to operate in the country and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”.
The agreement appeared to fall short of the congressionally ratified Nato-style treaty Saudi Arabia initially sought.
The White House announced Trump had approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets and the Saudis had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks.
The sale of the stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft, would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter jets to Riyadh, a significant policy shift.
The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35.
The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership.
Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran.
But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.</p><small>2025-11-19 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191202506d6e4c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956025/punjab-prosecutor-general-seeks-mechanism-for-verification-of-school-staff-faculty-using-sex-offender-database' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab prosecutor general seeks mechanism for verification of school staff, faculty using sex offender database</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab prosecutor general has sought a mechanism to check existing and future faculty and staff for any sex offender records in an effort to combat sexual violence at educational institutions, it emerged on Wednesday.
The proposal was made in a letter written on Tuesday by Punjab Prosecutor General Syed Farhad Ali Shah to the provincial Public Prosecution Department’s secretary, who will then forward the request to the federal law ministry.
The letter noted that the Sex Offenders Register, a countrywide database maintained by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), was a “powerful tool in the fight against sexual violence and for the protection of the most vulnerable in our society”.
However, Shah highlighted, there was a “critical gap in the safeguarding of educational institutions”.
 
 

He contended that the full potential of the database for preventative measures remained “largely untapped, particularly in environments where children and young adults are most susceptible”.
Therefore, the prosecutor general requested the Ministry of Law and Justice to develop and notify a formal mechanism that allowed “hiring authorities of all public and private educational institutions to request a character verification check specifically provided in the Sex Offenders Register maintained by Nadra, before completing the recruitment process”.
The mechanism should also enable the verification of “existing faculty members/teaching and non-teaching staff of educational institutions”, the letter added.
Shah further urged the law ministry to make this verification mandatory and a “non-negotiable part of the recruitment process for all staff, both teaching and non-teaching”. Clear guidelines be issued to all federal and provincial education departments, as well as to the administrations of universities, colleges and schools, the official requested.
Shah commended the promulgation of the Anti-Rape (Sex Offenders Register) Rules 2023 under the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021.
After various reforms in Pakistan’s anti-rape laws over the past decades, the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021 was hailed as a major milestone for victims. It expanded the definition of rape, introduced measures for time-bound trials for speedy justice for rape survivors and incorporated provisions for witness protection.
 
 

“Educational institutions-schools, colleges, and universities are meant to be safe havens for learning and growth,” the prosecutor general wrote.
He noted that the recruitment of faculty members, teaching staff, and non-teaching staff was currently based on academic credentials, professional experience, and background checks, “which cannot reveal a history of sexual offences”.
“This leaves a dangerous loophole through which a convicted sex offender could potentially gain employment in a position of trust and authority over students, thereby putting an entire student body at risk,” the official warned.
If implemented, the verification against the Sex Offenders Register “would serve as a robust deterrence and a proactive child protection measure”, the prosecutor general asserted.
“It would empower educational institutions to make informed hiring decisions and, most importantly, create a significantly safer environment for students, aligning perfectly with the spirit and objective of the anti-rape laws.”
During 2024, 1,828 out of 3,364 child abuse cases reported from all four provinces were cases of child sexual abuse, according to a report by Sahil.</p><small>2025-11-19 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191102424500f05.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956023/punjab-govt-forms-12-jits-to-probe-cases-against-tlp' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt forms 12 JITs to probe cases against TLP</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has formed 12 joint investigation teams (JITs) to probe several cases registered against the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Lahore and Sheikhupura districts, it emerged on Wednesday.
The teams were notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31.
According to the notifications, seen by Dawn, the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil.
Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the  Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area.
For the cases registered in Sheikhupura, each JIT will comprise six members, including a superintendent of police (SP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), station house officer (SHO), investigating officer (IO), a representative from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and any co-opted member.
For the cases lodged in Lahore, each JIT is to have five members, including SP Investigation, DSP Investigation, IO, a representative from CTD in the rank of DSP and any co-opted member.
The notifications further added that the “convener of the JIT shall depute one of the members of the JIT, for the purpose of submission of the report,” as required by Section 19(1) of the ATA 1997.
Crackdown on TLP
In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month.
The now-banned group had launched a protest march in support of Gaza and Palestine, planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration outside the US embassy. However, the group’s movement was thwarted as violent clashes erupted, with reports of party workers attacking law enforcement agencies.
Subsequently, the federal government imposed a ban on the party at the request of the Punjab government, concluding that TLP was “involved in terrorism and violent acts”.
 
 

Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies.
The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them.
On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad.
A senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told Dawn on Nov 13 that so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases.
The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party.
So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore.
A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs.
The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily.
As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes.
A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown.
On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.</p><small>2025-11-19 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191240297cbe588.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954862/pakistan-and-the-paris-promise-on-the-wrong-side-of-15c' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and the Paris promise: On the wrong side of 1.5°C</strong></a><br><p>Ten years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, Pakistan faces an uncomfortable truth: we are steadily moving towards a climate future we were meant to avoid.

Our success or failure at these negotiations has thus been measured by the size of the financial commitments pledged by developed countries to developing ones.
The fight for climate safety
When COP27 established the Loss and Damage Fund, Pakistan — then chairing the G77 — rightly celebrated it as a diplomatic victory. Yet, our climate diplomacy remains trapped within a narrow frame of finance and compensation, while paying little attention to the far greater challenge of halting the emissions that are driving the crisis itself.
This imbalance carries grave, devastating stakes. Pakistan is one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. At the current level of global warming — estimated at about 1.34 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures — the country is already witnessing a cascade of climate-induced disasters. Floods, droughts, and prolonged heatwaves have become recurring events, glaciers in the north are retreating at alarming rates, and rising sea levels are encroaching upon coastal settlements.
One does not need to be a climate scientist to imagine what lies ahead if global temperatures exceed the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree limit. For a country as exposed as Pakistan, every fraction of a degree translates into tangible loss of livelihoods, ecosystems, and lives. The path to safety therefore lies not in compensation alone, but in mitigation and the collective effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The decade since the Paris Agreement presents a mixed picture of progress and failure. On one hand, there are reasons for cautious optimism. A recent report by the international think tank Climate Analytics notes that since 2015, many countries have moved from fragmented and sector-specific targets to comprehensive, economy-wide emission reduction goals.
As a result, projections for this century show a marked decline in expected emissions, with anticipated warming by the year 2100 falling from roughly 3.6°C before the Paris Agreement to about 2.7°C under current policies. Avoiding that one extra degree means fewer heatwaves, less sea-level rise, and a lower risk of crossing dangerous climate tipping points.
The Paris Agreement has also triggered a historic shift in global investment trends. Clean energy technologies now attract more than two trillion dollars in investment each year, which is more than double the amount still directed towards fossil fuels. For every dollar spent on oil, coal, or gas, nearly two dollars are now being invested in renewables.
Following the landmark advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, the 1.5°C target has become both the moral and scientific foundation of global climate policy. Meanwhile, the Loss and Damage Fund is being operationalised, climate litigation is expanding across jurisdictions, and cities, regions, and civil society networks are advancing Paris-aligned actions where national governments have been slow to act.
Yet despite these developments, global ambition continues to fall short of what is required. Even if all existing national pledges, like the Nationally Determined Contributions, are fully implemented, the planet remains on course for between 2.3 and 2.5°C of warming by the end of the century. Years of delayed action have already added about 0.1°C of additional warming since 2015, making it increasingly unlikely that we can limit the rise to 1.5 degrees without overshoot.
Because global emissions failed to peak during the past decade, scientists now consider a temporary breach of the 1.5°C threshold to be almost inevitable. The extent of that overshoot will determine how much irreversible damage the world suffers. A sustained rise of even 0.4 degrees beyond the target could push many glaciers past the point of recovery and unleash losses that no amount of future adaptation can undo.
Survival demands more than diplomacy
For Pakistan, this global trajectory is deeply worrying.
Given the country’s extreme vulnerability, one would expect Pakistan to be among the most vocal defenders of the 1.5°C target. Instead, its position has remained ambiguous and subdued, shaped less by scientific urgency and more by geopolitical alignment.
As a member of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group — a bloc that includes China, India, and Saudi Arabia — Pakistan has tended to echo the priorities of economies that remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels. These countries publicly endorse the Paris goals, yet often invoke the principles of “equity” and “historical responsibility” to justify a slower transition away from carbon. In doing so, they weaken collective ambition, and Pakistan has followed the same path.
Our domestic choices tell a similar story. Over the past decade, Pakistan has continued to invest in coal and imported liquefied natural gas, locking its energy system into dependence on expensive and polluting fuels. At the same time, ordinary citizens have begun their own quiet transition.
With the falling price of solar technology, more and more households are turning to rooftop solar systems and batteries, reducing their reliance on the national grid. Instead of supporting this encouraging trend, policymakers have sought to slow it down, citing the rising circular debt in the power sector, a problem rooted not in solar power but in years of mismanagement and short-sighted planning.
Today, Pakistan stands at the intersection of three converging crises: escalating temperatures, geopolitical inertia, and a fragile power sector. To continue treating climate action as a bargaining chip in international negotiations is no longer sustainable.
As a democratic republic, our foremost responsibility is to safeguard our people from the worsening impact of climate change. That requires reclaiming our climate leadership, not merely as a victim seeking aid, but as a country willing to act, a nation that defends the 1.5 degree goal as a matter of survival and aligns its domestic energy policies with that vision.
Whether Pakistan chooses that path at the next COP remains to be seen. But time is running out.
The world will not wait for us to find our footing. We can either remain on the wrong side of the Paris promise or recognise, before it is too late, that keeping the 1.5 degree goal alive is not a diplomatic preference, but an existential necessity.

In the Indo-Pacific region, only Australia and Indonesia now operate the system, three of which the US said last year Taiwan would receive as part of a $2-billion weapons sale.
The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) medium-range air defence solutions, as they are called, are made by RTX. They have been battle-tested in Ukraine, but are a new weapon for Taiwan.
The Pentagon said the company was given a firm fixed-price contract for procurement of the NASAMS units, with work estimated to be completed in February 2031.
“Fiscal 2026 foreign military sales (Taiwan) funds in the amount of $698,948,760 were obligated,” it said in a statement on Monday.
RTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Used in Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion, the NASAMS system offers a sharp boost in air defence capabilities that the US is exporting to Taiwan as demand for it surges.
‘Rock solid’ US support
“It should be clear today and will remain clear into the future that America’s commitments to Taiwan are rock solid,” Raymond Greene, the de facto US ambassador in Taipei, told an event of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan on Tuesday.
“We are backing these words with actions, with a focus on supporting Taiwan’s efforts to achieve peace through strength. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our growing defence industrial cooperation.”
Thursday’s US approval of the sale of fighter jet and other aircraft parts to Taiwan for $330m was its first such deal since US President Donald Trump took office in January, prompting thanks from Taipei and anger in Beijing.
 
 

The arms sales news comes amid a worsening diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, although Taipei’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims.
On Sunday, Chinese coast guard ships sailed through waters around a group of East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China.
Japan said it also scrambled fighter jets on Saturday, after China flew a drone between Taiwan and Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni.
Asked about the tension on Wednesday, Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said China should not resort to force to resolve disputes.
“China should abandon its thinking of using force to resolve things,” he told reporters.
 
 

Taiwan’s military is beefing up its armaments to better tackle any attack from China, through efforts such as building its own submarines to defend vital maritime supply lines.
China’s military operates around Taiwan on an almost daily basis in what Taipei views as a “grey zone” strategy to test and exhaust Taiwan’s forces.
Despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, the US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to the constant anger of Beijing.</p><small>2025-11-19 06:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/190953501178cda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955983/confusion-deepens-over-relocation-of-islamabad-high-court-to-its-former-premises-at-g-10' target='_blank'><strong>Confusion deepens over relocation of Islamabad High Court to its former premises at G-10</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Confusion surrounding the supposed relocation of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to its former premises in G-10 has deepened after reports cited a November 7 letter that directed the shifting of official records to the old building.
The circulation of the letter on social media quickly gave rise to speculation that the high court itself was being moved, a claim denied by IHC senior hierarchy and the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA).
According to officials familiar with the development, the order to shift the record was issued solely to clear four courtrooms previously occupied by judges of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).
These courtrooms were urgently needed for the shifting of the FSC judges as the authorities had planned establishment of the newly-formed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) in the building meant for FSC.

High court bar says administrative letter wrongly interpreted as relocation order

Under the initial plan, the FCC was to be housed in the FSC building, but judges of the Shariat Court resisted the unplanned relocation and refused to vacate their premises.
Their firm stance forced the authorities to make alternative arrangements, resulting in the temporary accommodation of FCC judges inside the IHC building.
 
 

So far, seven of the FCC’s sanctioned strength of 13 judges have been appointed through presidential orders, all of whom have taken oath and been allotted separate courtrooms within the IHC.
Court insiders however clarified that this arrangement was temporary and should not be misconstrued as a signal that the IHC was being moved out of its current Shahrah-i-Dastur premises.
IHC’s senior officials denied the rumours saying that ample space had been given to the FCC where it could easily perform its functions.
However, the FCC judges are not comfortable as they are still using their chambers in the Supreme Court building because of the paucity of space in the IHC.
At a press conference, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja dismissed the speculation as “misleading and baseless”, stating that the administrative letter was wrongly interpreted as a relocation order.
Recalling the long struggle for a permanent high court building in the federal capital, he noted that the judiciary in Islamabad began in a rented structure in Aabpara in 1980. The Islamabad High Court was established in 2007, abolished in 2009, and re-established in 2010. The current building was secured largely through the efforts of former IHC judge Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, and it took more than a decade to shift the court to Shahrah-i-Dastur. “The High Court is not going anywhere,” he reaffirmed.
Jajja also said while the FCC was welcomed by the bar after its creation under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, disagreements within the judiciary should be resolved by judges themselves. “The judges resigned from their jobs; they have to fight their own battles. We stand with the institution, not individual conflicts,” he added.
In contrast, the Islamabad District Bar Association has expressed support for shifting the high court back to G-10. In a letter to Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Bar President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar and Secretary Abdul Halim described the relocation as a step that would enhance convenience for lawyers and litigants while improving judicial efficiency and reducing delays. They assured full cooperation with the Law Ministry and the IHC administration should the government decide to proceed with the move.
Meanwhile, sources confirmed that a high-level meeting was expected soon to decide the final seating arrangements for the IHC and FCC.
The meeting will determine whether the IHC will remain at Shahrah-i-Dastur, whether the FCC will shift elsewhere, or whether a mutual exchange of premises will be considered. Until then, officials stress that no decision has been taken regarding the relocation of IHC.

• Police say prior to launch of e-challan system, citywide speed limit for cars, motorcycles, etc was 30km/h
• In first phase, 60km/h limit set for cars, bikes and LTVs on Sharea Faisal
• Many believe top speed on city’s main artery is ‘ok for bikers but too slow for cars’
KARACHI: The newly introduced automated e-ticketing system appears to have been launched in haste as traffic authorities have issued hundreds of challans for speeding, but they are yet to set the speed limit for vehicles on major thoroughfares, it emerged on Tuesday.
Last week, authorities had installed speed limit signs on Sharea Faisal, despite the fact that the traffic police had already issued 1,967 tickets for speeding within the first week (from Oct 27 to Nov 3) of the launch of the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (Tracs).
The traffic police said they are in the process of fixing speed limits for vehicles on different arteries in the metropolis and in the first phase they set 60 kilometres per hour (km/h) on Sharea Faisal for all cars, motorbikes and light transport vehicles (LTVs) and 30 km/h for heavy transport vehicles (HTVs).
DIG Traffic Pir Mohammed Shah conceded that at present “road-specific speed limits” were not notified.
“A comprehensive road safety and engineering audit including assessment of road geometry, access points, pedestrian activity, and traffic flow is under way,” he told Dawn. “Once the audit is completed, revised and road-specific speed limits will be notified.”
He said that currently a uniform, but interim, speed limit is in place for all roads in the metropolis.
“At present, the citywide speed limit for HTVs is 60 km/h, while for cars, motorcycles and LTV it is 30 km/h,” he said. However, he did not know when this speed limit had been fixed or whether it had ever been revised.
Asked as to how fines were imposed over speeding violation, the DIG claims: “Limits were displayed from the day 1 through digital boards on all digital streamers across the city.”
 
 

DIG defends speed limit on signal-free Sharea Faisal
People using Sharea Faisal for their daily commute are expressing their surprise over the speed limit of 60 km/h, saying the road is almost signal free from Hotel Metropole traffic intersection to Karachi Airport.
Many people are of the view that the speed limit makes sense for motorcyclists, but for cars, 60 km/h is too slow on a signal-free road.
A senior official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that Sharea Faisal is used for VVIP traffic and vehicles part of their motorcade drive at the minimum speed of 100 km/h.
“The speed limit should have been 80 km/h for LTVs and cars and 60 km/h for motorbikes,” he said.
However, the DIG Traffic told Dawn the speed limit was fixed keeping in view road safety, and not traffic flow alone.
He said although Sharea Faisal now functions as a signal-free corridor, “it remains a mixed-traffic urban artery, with multiple entry/exit points, pedestrian activity at certain locations, service lanes, and merging traffic from side roads”.
“Higher speed will significantly increase the likelihood and severity of accidents,” he said.
He believed that the 60 km/h limit was in line with “international standards for urban expressways where pedestrian and mixed-use interactions still exist”.
“Our goal is to maintain smooth traffic movement while prioritising the safety of commuters, motorcyclists and pedestrians,” DIG Shah said.
He said that the 30 km/h speed limit for heavy vehicles was due to their “size, braking distance and impact force”, which posed a significantly higher risk at high speeds.
“Even at night, Sharea Faisal continues to have private traffic, motorcyclists, and ride-hailing vehicles, and any high-speed accident involving a heavy vehicle can be catastrophic,” he said.

At its meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on IT and Telecom directed the Pakistan Telecommu­nica­tion Authority (PTA) to conduct comprehensive nationwide surveys and take im­­­mediate practical steps to ensure fast and reliable internet services across the country.
Committee chairman Syed Amin ul Haq instructed the relevant officials to conduct special surveys through PTA teams to assess the quality of internet services being provided to the public, and to present a detailed report at the committee’s next meeting.
Briefing the committee, PTA officials said that 273 MHz spectrum was currently available in the country, but it was insufficient to meet the rising demand for high-speed internet. They added that the government plans to auction 600 MHz of spectrum across various bands, with the process now moving towards the rollout of 5G.

Telecom sector regulator ordered to conduct comprehensive surveys and present a detailed report

While reviewing progress of the Islamabad IT Park project, the committee was informed that the consultant’s contract had expired on Oct 31. The contractor has initiated the renewal process, which is expected to be finalised shortly.
The NA panel emphasised that the project must meet the timeline set by the prime minister — Dec 31, 2025.
Regarding the Karachi IT Park, the committee noted that the project remains in its initial stages and that the contract is expected to be awarded soon.
A delegation from South Korea is scheduled to visit on December 2 to finalise the remaining matters related to the contract award.
The committee directed officials to award the contract without further delay so that work can begin promptly, emphasising that the project must be completed within the stipulated two-year period.
The panel was also briefed by the managing director of the National Tele­com­munication Corporation (NTC) on the company’s future initiatives, including secure mobile connectivity for government officials and the establishment of new data centres in Karachi and Quetta.
The panel was told that these initiatives are part of a broader strategic plan aimed at enhancing cybersecurity and expanding reliable IT and telecom services for public sector institutions.
The committee appreciated NTC’s performance and acknowledged that the organisation’s ongoing projects were satisfactory. It advised NTC to refrain from downsizing and instead adopt a rightsizing approach to ensure no employee is laid off, and that staff members are appropriately adjusted and placed where their services are genuinely required.
The committee deferred the Preven­tion of Obscenity and Indecency in Digi­tal Media Bill, 2025, to the next meeting due to the absence of the bill’s mover.

In an appeal moved under Article 185 of the Constitution, Salman Akram Raja, who is also PTI’s Secretary General, stated that the IHC while disposing of his contempt petition relied solely on oral assertion of the Adiala jail superintendent regarding alleged compliance with previous judicial directions.
The petitioner pleaded that the IHC failed to call for the relevant re­­cord to verify with the jail authorities about the implementation of ea­­r­­lier directions for making arran­g­e­ments for regular meetings with Imran Khan at the Adiala jail. This constitutes a miscarriage of justice and a failure to exercise constitutio­nal jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, the petition contended.
The petitioner argued that IHC failed to appreciate that its own previous judgment of March 24 had conferred a clear and unambiguous direction regarding visitation rights of the founding PTI chairman with his legal team and nominated coordinators, and that executive authorities were legally bound to comply with judicial orders unless modified or set aside by a superior forum.

IHC erred by disposing of case without looking at record, says Salman Akram Raja

The right of a prisoner to consult and communicate with his legal counsel is an integral part of Articles 4, 9, 10, and 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantee protection of law, liberty, fair trial, and due process, the petitioner stated, adding the high court while disposing of the matter on administrative grounds failed to safeguard these fundamental and inviolable rights.
The high court misapplied Rule 265 of the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978, without examining whether its rigid application is consistent with constitutional guarantees. These rules, being subordinate legislation, cannot override or restrict fundamental rights or judicial orders issued under Article 199 of the Constitution, the appeal argued.
Moreover, the high court also failed to appreciate that the administrative discretion of jail authorities is subject to judicial supervision, the petition argued, adding by directing strict adherence to the jail manual without enforcing previous judicial orders, the high court effectively allowed executive non-compliance to override judicial authority, contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers.
The petition contended that the high court erred in law as it dispo­s­­ed of the petition summarily, without examining the record of multip­le prior instances of non-compliance brought on the file, thereby failing to apply judicial mind and rendering the order mechanical, per­­functory, and devoid of reasoning.
Thus, the high court order resul­ted in a grave miscarriage of justice, as it deprived the petitioner and PTI founder of their rights to effective legal representation, consultation, and coordination in ongoing legal proceedings across the country.
The order also frustrates the principle of judicial supremacy, as it allows executive authorities to neutralize the effect of court orders through oral statements, the petitioner regretted.
The high court also failed to exercise its supervisory and coercive jurisdiction vested under Article 204 of the Constitution to ensure implementation of its previous orders and to hold the respondents accountable for continued defiance. Instead, it chose to dispose of the petition, and rendering the earlier judicial directions ineffective.
The Supreme Court has consistently held that when the high court declines to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law, or misinterprets the scope of its powers under Article 199, such refusal constitutes an error of law justifying the grant of leave to appeal, the petition maintained.

He said that Pakistan was home to numerous sacred religious sites for the Sikhs, where members of the Sikh community from all over the world came to perform their religious rituals and Pakistan ensured their hospitality.
The prime minister met President of Sikhs of America Jasdeep Singh who called on him, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was also attended by Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar and Pakistani-American businessman Sajid Tarar.
 
 

The prime minister said that it was a matter of pride that Pakistan was ensuring the maintenance of Sikh community’s sacred sites and Gurdwaras, as well as providing all possible facilities to them.
He said the government would provide more facilities to Sikh pilgrims from around the world.
 
 

While referring to the Pakistani diaspora, the prime minister said that they were playing a vital role in the country’s development, prosperity and bringing global recognition to Pakistan.
Jasdeep Singh thanked the prime minister and the government of Pakistan for their hospitality and the warm reception extended to Sikh pilgrims in Pakistan.

The draft includes a sweep of options on the most difficult issues, reflecting the gulf between the nearly 200 nations in Belem and the work still ahead to refine a final compromise.
The nine-page “Global Mutirao” document — a reference to an Indigenous concept of uniting toward a common goal — came after Brazil on Monday urged delegates to work day and night to produce an agreement by midweek.
 
 

The text leaves open a wide range of possibilities on the flashpoint issues in Belem — trade measures, finance for poorer nations, and the global inadequacy of carbon-cutting goals.
But the quick turnaround of a draft on these thorny points suggested the COP30 presidency was confident it could soon have an outcome, observers said.
“It represents a steady progression from the previous iteration and is likely one of the earliest releases of such a clean text in recent COP history,” said Li Shuo, a climate analyst at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
 
 

The draft reflects the stark division between a coalition wanting a “roadmap” on a fossil fuel phase-out, and a bloc led by oil-producing countries opposing any such effort.
It proposes an optional “workshop” to discuss “low carbon solutions,” or a high-level ministerial roundtable on pathways to help countries “progressively overcome their dependency on fossil fuels.” A third option proposes no text at all.
The draft also raises the possibility of assessing national climate pledges annually, instead of every five years, to assess global progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions more frequently.

“Solar generation is increasing, but this does not have a significant impact on the grid,” Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) CEO Rehan Akhtar said while testifying before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Working under the Power Division, the CPPA is the key player responsible for the procurement of electricity from various sources and delivering to all distribution companies and handling their commercial affairs.
He said the energy costs had led to a shift to solar power. “They are now consuming more due to solar availability but their offtake from the national grid has not changed. Their withdrawal from the grid is almost stable. They are drawing the same quantities they were drawing earlier,” he said, adding, however, that the same could not be predicted about the future.

Net metering contribution jumped 173pc to 726m units in 2024

These comments came during the course of a public hearing on CPPA’s request for rebasing of power purchase price (PPP) with effect from January 2026 under the government’s policy directives.
The CPPA presented five different assumptions about the tariff revisions with effect from Jan 1, 2026. These assumptions presented a total average PPP price ranging between Rs25.95 per unit in the best case and Rs26.53 per unit in the worst case of currency devaluation to Rs300-310 from the existing Rs280-290 per dollar.
The existing PPP for FY26 stands at Rs25.98 per unit, showing a general sign of stability.
It was reported that net metering contribution had increased by 173pc to 726 million units in 2024 compared to 266m units in 2023, even though power distribution companies (Discos) showed 1pc growth. On the other hand, K-Electric offtake from the grid increased by 9.4pc as it started drawing the full 2,050MW.
 
 

Nepra was told that fuel costs were expected to remain generally stable with a minor risk of a 5pc increase in global prices in a worst-case scenario. Likewise, given foreign exchange reserve vulnerabilities, local currency had been estimated to increase by Rs10 in the first six months and Rs10 in the second half of the next calendar year in one case only. Interest rates were projected at 11pc for the first half and 10.5pc for the second half.
Industrial consumers bemoaned expensive energy costs, making their products uncompetitive. They said the industry was still cross-subsidising other consumers to the tune of Rs131bn, and all tariff reductions announced by the government had already vanished.
They said the CPPA’s calculation that demand will increase was inconsistent with ground realities, because consumption was going down because of high energy prices, the closing of industries and the shift to solar power.

Bunkering at a port is the process of supplying ships with fuel (such as marine gas oil, heavy fuel oil, or alternative fuels like LNG) for propulsion and onboard machinery.
It is a critical, tightly regulated operation that involves transferring fuel from land-based facilities, tanker trucks, or bunker vessels to the receiving ship’s fuel tanks.
Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday said the initiative was launched to accelerate the modernisation of port services and a broader upgrade of Pakistan’s maritime infrastructure.
He said the introduction of regulated bunkering would fill a long-standing gap in Karachi Port’s service offering, enabling it to compete more effectively with established bunkering hubs in the region and beyond.

The minister said the availability of safe, reliable, and efficiently managed bunkering facilities is expected to attract more international shipping lines to Karachi, particularly those seeking streamlined port calls and predictable service standards.
Earlier, there was no refuelling facility for commercial shipping in the country, and ships had to obtain fuel from Fujairah or Singapore.
The fuel supply and bunkering facility will be executed by Vitol, a Swiss-based Dutch multinational energy and commodity trading company, through its barge.
Meanwhile, the Karachi-based Cnergyico refinery has started producing world-class ‘very low sulphur fuel oil’ (VLSFO) for ship refuelling.
The facility has also become essential as India has banned ships that enter or leave its ports from calling at any Pakistani port.
Sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) said that the availability of bunkering facilities would increase vessel traffic at the port, thereby improving revenue too.
Meanwhile, the maritime minister said that the move would translate into higher foreign-exchange earnings through port fees, marine services, and ancillary commercial activity such as repairs, supplies and maritime logistics.
Mr Chaudhry added that the new service would enhance Pakistan’s visibility in the international maritime market by demonstrating the country’s commitment to modern, environmentally responsible and globally competitive port management.
He said compliance with international standards covering fuel quality, safety procedures, documentation and transparency was essential for building confidence among ship-owners and global trading companies.
The minister said the first phase of operations would begin in collaboration with one of the world’s leading energy trading houses, which will conduct bunkering at Karachi Port in accordance with internationally certified practices.
He said the venture is expected to expand as domestic refineries supply larger quantities of refined fuel meeting global specifications, a development he described as a direct benefit to the national exchequer.
The minister noted that KPT had assessed existing bunkering practices, reviewed global procedures, drafted new documentation and engaged stakeholders to bring the service online.
He said the milestone reinforces KPT’s ambition to operate as a leading regional hub and signals the government’s intention to continue expanding port capabilities in line with international benchmarks.

“A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,” said an update from the CDN, whose network handles around a fifth of web traffic, posted at 7:42pm.
It later said that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. “We are working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues,” it added.
In a subsequent statement, Cloudfare said services were currently operating normally and it was no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network.
“Our engineering teams continue to closely monitor the platform and perform a deeper investigation into the earlier disruption, but no configuration changes are being made at this time.
“At this point, it is considered safe to re-enable any Cloudflare services that were temporarily disabled during the incident. We will provide a final update once our investigation is complete,” it said.
“Earlier today, we failed our customers and the broader internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us,” chief technology officer Dane Knecht wrote on X, adding that the problem had since been resolved.
“In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made.” The company said earlier there had been “a spike in unusual traffic” to one of its services.
 






The incident marked the latest hit to major online services. An outage of Amazon’s cloud service last month caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.
Cloudflare — whose shares were down about five per cent in premarket trading — runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks.
Earlier today, disruptions in internet access were widely reported as Cloudflare reported experiencing issues in its global network.
In an update on the situation posted at 6:09pm, it said: “We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London. We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.”
It later said it was continuing to work on restoring service for application services customers.
Earlier, the service provider said it was “aware of and investigating an issue” that was impacting multiple customers with widespread 500 errors, along with the Cloudflare dashboard and API application programming interface also failing.
NetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, also said that a wide range of online services were experiencing disruptions due to a technical issue affecting Cloudflare’s global network. It added that the incident was not related to “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
 






Downdetector showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10 pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services and Facebook.
Social media platform X was also down for thousands of users in the United States and worldwide, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.
There were more than 11,500 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 6:41am ET, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.
It was not immediately clear whether the outages were related.
X and Cloudflare did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said it was monitoring the global outage and was in contact with global platforms and local operators. It added that it would continue to observe the situation until services were fully restored.
Cloudflare had also reported a “widespread outage” in June 2022 and several popular websites were unreachable.
A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast.

The SCO is holding its Council of Heads of Government summit in Moscow from November 17 to 18. Taking place under Russia’s rotating presidency, the high-level meeting follows the landmark Tianjin summit three months earlier and comes at a pivotal moment for Eurasian economic connectivity in a shifting global order.
At the heads of government gathering, Dar met Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with other SCO heads of state and senior officials. In a post on X, the FO said that Putin welcomed leaders to the summit in the Russian capital.
He also “emphasised the importance of strengthening regional economic cooperation under the SCO, highlighting its role as a key platform for connectivity, stability, and mutually beneficial development across the region”.
 






Dar also met Chinese Premier Li Qiang, where the pair “reaffirmed the ‘all-weather’ Pakistan-China strategic partnership, reviewed bilateral and multilateral cooperation — especially within the SCO — and praised the Shanghai Spirit principles guiding regional collaboration”.
The post added that the FMs exchanged views on global issues and agreed to “maintain real-time engagement moving forward.”
 






Dar also had a bilateral meeting with Russian Deputy PM Alexei Overchuk on the sidelines of the summit, the FO said in another social media post.
“The two leaders undertook a substantive review of the full gamut of Pakistan–Russia relations, with a focus on strengthening cooperation across political, economic, energy, connectivity, agricultural, industrial, educational and people-to-people areas through institutionalised mechanisms,” the FO wrote.
“DPM Overchuk recalled his recent visits and noted Pakistan’s potential as a regional hub for transit and connectivity,” the post added. “Both leaders also exchanged views on key regional & global developments and reaffirmed their commitment to enhanced cooperation at bilateral and multilateral fora, including the UN and SCO.”
 






Additionally, Dar met Russian FM Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Moscow summit, with photographs showing the pair hugging each other upon meeting.

During his address earlier today, Dar said the SCO was “well-placed” to promote regional cooperation in the humanitarian field to deal with emergencies.
“Excellencies, the agenda before us, spanning trade, economy, culture and humanitarian cooperation, is the basis of a mature, future-oriented SCO,” FM Dar said during his speech in Moscow. “Pakistan views them as interconnected threads in a single, stronger fabric of regional partnership.”
 






He said that the Tianjin summit was a clear signal that “our organisation is evolving with the resolve to harness the full spectrum of our collective potential by focusing on economic integration through expanded trade collaboration, improved infrastructure connectivity, investment partnerships, advancement of cross-border trade corridors, and the promotion of digital economic development”.
The SCO, Dar highlighted, has established a foundation for sustainable economic progress throughout the SCO space.
“Pakistan has developed a technology-driven, proactive disaster management system,” the FM pointed out, adding that the country is “keen” to organise simulation exercises with SCO partners to bolster disaster preparedness across the region.
“Excellencies, our discussions at Tianjin underscored the need to modernise our outreach. The value of our observer and partner states is immense,” Dar said.
He added, “Let us move from a model of passive observation to one of real engagement. Let us invite them to participate not as guests on the periphery but as stakeholders in specific project-based initiatives that align with their expertise and our collective goals.
This way, Dar emphasised, “we can create a flexible, multi-tiered model of cooperation that would benefit all”.
“An important feature of the modernisation of the SCO is the introduction of English as a working language,” FM Dar pointed out. “Let us move forward from political declarations and establish a translation unit. The SCO can attract more partners and achieve wider goal influence with this only one step.”
“Excellencies, to translate the momentum of Tianjin into tangible progress, we suggest greater focus on practical, cross-cutting initiatives,” Dar said.
 






‘Youth empowerment of foremost importance’
Pakistan, according to Dar’s address, has two proposals: operationalise financial tools for the promotion of trade and economy, and build human capital.
“While our efforts continue to make available diversified financial tools such as the SCO Development Bank and development and investment funds for our economies and businesses, we must aggressively utilise the tools already at our disposal, like the SCO Interbank Consortium, to finance connectivity and technical collaboration projects,” he said.
With respect to building human capital, Dar said the ultimate resource of the SCO is “our people”.
“The empowerment of our youth is of foremost importance,” he stressed.
 
 

“We must invest in them directly. Pakistan, therefore, advocates for a significant expansion of the SCO university network into a consortium for applied knowledge,” the minister said.
He added that this would facilitate not just student exchanges but also joint research programmes in critical fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence, water resource management, agriculture, and telemedicine while addressing common challenges with shared intellect.
“Excellencies, Pakistan is committed to being a proactive and creative partner in the journey,” Dar highlighted. “Let us build an SCO that is a launchpad for shared success, where every connection made, commercial, cultural, or intellectual, strengthens the whole. Let us ensure that the legacy of our work is a region more innovative, more interconnected, and more integrated.”
A day earlier, FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers on his arrival to Moscow.
 






Earlier this year, the SCO Council of Heads of State summit was held in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif raised the Indus Waters Treaty issue.
He also announced in September that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date for it. Pakistan last hosted the SCO in 2024 for the Council of Heads of Government summit.</p><small>2025-11-18 17:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18095705985e07b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955818/38-terrorists-killed-in-four-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>38 terrorists killed in four separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively.
It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO.
The ISPR said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian-sponsored” terrorists found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus.
He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
“We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:54</small></div><hr>
