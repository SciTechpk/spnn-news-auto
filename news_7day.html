<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69362478b603f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959865/an-unsettled-world-in-2026' target='_blank'><strong>An unsettled world in 2026</strong></a><br><p>THE world faces heightened uncertainty in 2026 as geopolitical and geo-economic tensions intensify and conflicts persist. With the world appearing more unsettled than at any time since the end of the Cold War, President Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ unilateralism will inject more instability into global affairs. The rules-based order, in precipitous decline, will fragment further. Multilateralism will come under greater stress. Western dominance will decline even though the US-led West will continue to exert significant influence in the international system. China’s global power and role will increase. Volatility will be a pronounced feature of the fractured international landscape. A more multipolar world will see middle powers play a growing role in shaping geopolitics and acting assertively.
Six major trends will shape world affairs in the coming year, although this of course is not an exhaustive list. The first is a shifting geopolitical landscape with changing alignments, eroding rules and a high degree of unpredictability. Geopolitical shifts will principally be determined by how the situation evolves in the Middle East and Ukraine, the course of US-China relations and adjustments countries make in response to the trade war unleashed by Trump.
With global norms being upended by Trump’s disruptive policies and other powers showing similar disregard, the drift to what some call a ‘no-rules world’ will become more evident. In its assessment of top risks for 2026, Control Risks, a London-based consultancy firm, forecasts a world in which established rules will fade and even break down. This will make international relatio­nships more transactional and situational. Int­e­rests, it argues, will become the “new values”.
The second trend continuing into the coming year is greater use of hard power that characterised international politics in 2025. This is apparent in military or economic coercion rather than dialogue and diplomacy becoming the preferred policy choice of powerful countries and regional powers to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force in defiance of international law has become more frequent in this new era of conflict. Israel’s war on Gaza, attacks on Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force. It means a fraying global order will fragment further.

Trends point to heightened geopolitical tensions, persisting conflicts and fragmenting world order.

In its annual publication ‘The World Ahead’, The Economist poses the question whether the world is headed towards a new Cold War between blocs led by the US and China or will Trump’s deal-driven approach divide the world into American, Chinese and Russian “spheres of influence” where each of them will decide rules of the game in their domain. It notes foreign policy experts are conflicted on this and there is little certainty which of the two will materialise.
Three, the course of relations between the US and China will be the most significant strategic dynamic in the year ahead as it has been in recent years. This remains the world’s most consequential relationship with far-reaching global impact. Trump’s tariff offensive against China set relations onto a turbulent course. Nevertheless, Trump has repeatedly said he wants a deal with Beijing and he did reach a trade agreement with President Xi Jinping in their October 2025 meeting. But this only marks a temporary truce in the trade war as the one-year sunset clause indicates difficult negotiations later next year. Other issues of discord that drive tensions also remain unresolved.

 

China’s effective pushback against US tariffs by using its leverage on critical rare-earth minerals, on which it has a near-monopoly, showed two things — that it can also inflict pain on America and is not hesitant to flex its muscles. China is set to emerge as the largest economy in 2026 and is already the largest trading partner of around 70 countries. Its global influence is therefore expected to grow especially as it projects itself as a stable partner in contrast to Trump’s whimsical conduct. While both countries have a mutual interest to de-escalate, 2026 will determine how durable the temporary calm in their relations will be.
Four, efforts for peace in the Middle East will continue to dominate the international agenda. Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution, hangs in the balance as obstacles to its implementation have yet to be surmounted. Hamas rejected the resolution on several counts. Israeli violations of the ceasefire continue. So does its occupation of over half of Gaza and violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. In these circumstances, Hamas will not disarm. Muslim countries that earlier indicated their intention to join the international stabilisation force are now getting cold feet because of their reluctance to undertake Hamas’s disarmament. The fate of the peace plan will be decided in 2026. The coming year will also determine whether a US-Russia agreement can be forged to end the Ukraine war. For now, uncertainties abound on both fronts.
The fifth trend is the growing importance of middle powers. Structural changes and dispersal of power in the international system have created a favourable environment for middle power diplomatic activism and for them to wield influence. US-China competition has offered opportunities and leeway to countries to increase their leverage by playing off that rivalry and strengthen their bargaining power. The reinforcement of this trend in 2026 will oblige the two global superpowers to spend more diplomatic capital to engage middle power countries.
The sixth trend is fast-paced advances in AI but with rising concerns about its unintended adverse consequences. AI-powered tools in business, workplaces, entertainment, media and healthcare have transformed the way we live, learn and work. But among areas of concern are its impact on jobs and risks for cybersecurity. The military uses of AI also pose a challenge. There is also the question that is being widely raised and debated about whether the AI boom, fuelled by heavy investments in infrastructure, will burst.
The year ahead offers an unsettled global outlook. Geopolitical tensions, superpower rivalry, continuing conflicts and pressures on the global economy mean the world will continue to be in an unpredictable and unstable state.

According to sources close to the ruling family, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab Chief Min­ister Maryam Nawaz and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif had a detailed discussion on the current political situation.
During the meeting, which lasted more than two hours, they reviewed the PTI’s likely strategy in the coming days and how the federal and Punjab governments could respond effectively.
The conversation also touched upon Imran Khan’s status within his party and whether the PTI leadership would continue relying on guidance from its incarcerated founder, or distance itself from him following the establishment’s strongest-ever reaction against the former prime minister.
Sources said the Sharifs also examined the establishment’s perspective on various political and economic measures being undertaken by the PML-N governments.
They added that Maryam Nawaz briefed her father and uncle on the recently prepared performance review of the Punjab cabinet, highlighting key shortcomings identified in the audit.
According to the sou­rces, the chief minister also expressed her intention to reshuffle her cabinet and induct new ministers to improve the government’s overall functioning.

The recently-released Amnesty Inter­n­ational report, ‘Stitched Up: Denial of Freedom of Association for Garment Workers in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka’, contains shocking revelations related to workplace harassment, repression and other sorts of maltreatment allegedly experienced by workers, particularly women.
The garment industry is a trillion-dollar global business employing almost 100 million people, the majority of them women. In South Asia, workers in the garment industry account for an estimated 40pc of employment in manufacturing. The industry has long been challenged over human rights abuses, with complaints of the denial of the right to decent work, a living wage, and social protection. The systemic repression of the right to freedom of association, particularly the forming and joining of independent trade unions, is commonplace.
Repercussions
Workers, especially women, face almost insurmountable challenges when organising. In Pakistan, their biggest obstacle is the fear of repercussions from employers — dismissal, harassment at work, and even violence. Women workers are often the most at risk from reprisals and sexualized repercussions for union activity, a breach of ILO Convention 98, which guarantees workers “adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.”

Amnesty report finds widespread harassment, exploitation, and threats of violence amid management structures dominated by men

“When I joined this factory 15 years ago, after some time had passed, I observed the working environment was tough for the women workers. When I witnessed many bad things (sexual harassment) happening to the women, I changed my attitude from smiley to serious-faced, reflecting anger during my duty. I did this just to warn (through body language) the managers, supervisors, etc., of a forceful reaction if they tried to harass me,” Nazia, a worker in a Lahore-based garment factory, tells Dawn. “I have seen many workers, especially women, losing their jobs when they tried to make unions or refused to fulfill the ‘desires’ of their seniors,” she claimed. However, she praised the factory owners for their good attitude towards everyone. “But the problem is that we are not given access to the factory owners to whom we can tell about the situation we are going through. I also tried to organise workers for the purpose of forming a union, but stopped later, fearing termination of my job.”
“Not a single workers’ union is registered with the departments concerned in the entire four districts of Lahore division,” says Mutahidda Labour Federation General Secretary Hanif Ramay. “And if anyone tries to unite, he or she is shown the door with immediate effect.”
‘Yellow unions’
Most factories operate without genuine unions, as owners have established pro-management “yellow unions” instead.
The Amnesty report documented case studies revealing the severity of workplace abuse. “When I started the job in the garment industry, I saw that women workers were harassed a lot and asked for dinners and dates. I was being harassed and blamed falsely by my supervisors. Overtime was forced upon women, and that was also being used as a harassment tool. I was touched physically and abused verbally. No one in the management would listen to me,” revealed a female worker. “The union at this factory was a yellow union [pro-management]. That is why I did not join that union and tried to form an independent union.” She was harassed for talking about her rights and asking workers to organise.
When she complained about sexual harassment, CCTV cameras were installed, but retaliation followed. “They forced me to do more overtime and put a lot of pressure on her. They finally served notice on her for talking about false things regarding factory matters.” At another factory where she was the only female worker in her department, harassment continued. “I went to the HR department to complain, but they did not allow me to launch a complaint and said that this would not happen there. I tried to inform the union leader at the factory also, but as that was a yellow union, they did not listen to me.”
Another worker accused factory owners of keeping workers in fear: “I know many workers who have been sacked from jobs due to union organising.”
Textile Power Looms and Gar­ments Workers Union/Federation General Secretary Niaz Khan confirmed that complaints of sexual harassment and abuse of labour laws are common in garments and textile mills. “Most such complaints come from small and unregistered factories ranging from 150 to 200 workers. But I am not giving a clean chit to big factories, as similar incidents are also reported there,” he said. According to him, refusal to follow orders simply meant dismissal, and women workers are called disgusting and derogatory names.
With 1,000 garment factories operating in Punjab, mostly in Lahore and Faisalabad, “all these factories have paper unions [yellow unions] that take care of the benefits of the factory owners and not the workers,” he regretted.
Sohail Pasha, chairman of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, however, disputed these claims for the home textile sector.
“We are very strict on such issues and try hard to ensure provision of the best working environment to all workers,” he said, claiming that harassment and discrimination exists in apparel and knitting factories where more women work.

Unfortunately, we have seen our politicians — and now even security circles — indulge in the very opposite. While in this day and age of short tempers and deep polarisation, no one expects criticism or verbal exchanges to be polite, the parameters of incivility should not be stretched to include the harshest of invectives.
In this context, the ISPR presser on Friday was disappointing. The ISPR chief’s strong remarks targeting the PTI and its founder Imran Khan — without naming him — reflected the deep mistrust that exists between the military and the main opposition party, but the words used to label the former prime minister were unusually harsh. Mr Khan was dubbed ‘mentally ill’ and a ‘security risk’, and his party accused of colluding with India and the TTP. The civilian rulers appeared to have fallen in line, with the information minister endorsing “every word”, while the defence minister, too, defended the presser.

 

Targeting the opposition — something which should be exclusively between politicians without the military involving itself — has a long history in the country, as elsewhere. But in Pakistan, besides the usual criticism of political rivals, politicians, such as Fatima Jinnah during the Ayub era, have had their patriotic credentials questioned as well by military strongmen — who have also politically rehabilitated the same politicians they have had a hand in removing from power.
Politicians, too, have not missed any opportunity to throw mud at each other. A slew of them from Ghaffar Khan and Wali Khan to Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have been labelled corrupt or anti-state. Mr Khan himself, the target of Friday’s presser, has arguably taken coarse language against opponents — the military included — to new heights.
But this cycle of toxicity must end. In particular, those who represent national institutions and are public office-holders should be measured in their words and keep within their constitutional bounds to secure the country from the many challenges it faces — including terrorism and border hostilities. In such a situation, there is a dire need to close ranks and stop labelling opponents as ‘enemies of the state’.
For all its missteps and internal turmoil, the PTI continues to enjoy significant popular support, and criticism of it should not go so far as to equate it with anti-state inclinations.

Speaking at a press conference, PESS President retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum said the misleading campaign, fuelled by internal political elements and external forces, posed a direct threat to national security, unity, and institutional stability.
Gen Qayyum said that after suffering a humiliating defeat in the four-day war, India declared that Operation Sindoor would continue. “Today, India is pursuing this operation through a hybrid warfare, orchestrating terrorist attacks from Afghan soil”, he remarked.
He said Pakistan was currently in a state of undeclared war, where attacks on security forces were being carried out by terrorists guided by Indian agencies, with the tacit approval of the Afghan Taliban government.

Demand stern action against those involved in crimes against national security

The PESS president praised the bravery, professionalism, and sacrifices of Pakistan Army officers and soldiers, who he said were thwarting every terrorist attack with full force.
Lt Gen Qayyum noted that the enemy’s second major tactic was propaganda warfare, largely targeting the armed forces, particularly CDF, on social media. He deplored that some political elements in Pakistan, along with their external backers, were using this campaign for political motives, an act he termed highly condemnable.
Referring to a recent statement by the DG ISPR, Gen Qayyum said certain PTI leaders and their “rogue elements” at home and abroad were deliberately amplifying India’s propaganda.
“PESS strongly condemns this trend and demands strict action against all elements involved in crimes against national security”, he asserted.
Underlining the need for complete national unity, Gen Qayyum appealed to the nation to adhere to Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s golden principles of faith, unity, and discipline. He said political leadership, media, state institutions, and the public must rise above personal and group interests to protect Pakistan’s long-term security interests.
The PESS president welcomed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov to use Pakistani ports. He said Pakistan was ready to open trade routes for all Central Asian states, with a population of about 80 million, provided the Afghan Taliban fully disarm and dismantle terrorist groups.
He also expressed concern over Russia’s plan to increase trade with India from $68 billion to $100bn.
He said that while trade was a bilateral matter, supplying SU-57 stealth fighter jets or additional S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile systems to India would heighten security risks for Pakistan and other regional countries, as it would strengthen India’s ambitions for regional dominance.
PESS also welcomed the review of the NFC Award and said the burden of defence requirements, debt servicing, development plans, and the impacts of climate change should be fairly shared by all provinces.

In their separate message on the 40th anniversary of Saarc Charter Day falling on Monday, they said that Pakistan is committed to a cooperative, inclusive and forward-looking regional order that can unlock South Asia’s vast potential and ensure a better tomorrow for all.
President Zardari said that Pakistan is ready to work with all willing states in South Asia to promote trade, transit, energy linkages and people-to-people relations that benefit the entire region.
“Pakistan remains committed to a cooperative, inclusive and forward-looking regional order. Our geography places us at the meeting point of South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. We are ready to work with all willing states to promote trade, transit, energy linkages and people-to-people ties that benefit the entire region,” the President said.

PM Shehbaz says Islamabad firmly committed to principles, objectives of Saarc Charter on 40th anniversary

He said: “On this Charter Day, I encourage South Asian nations to approach the future with clarity and sincerity. The region’s challenges are shared and so must be the solutions. With a spirit of respect and practical cooperation, we can shape a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia for our future generations”.
PM Shehbaz’s message
In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan remained firmly committed to principles and objectives of the Saarc Charter as it believed that genuine cooperation, guided by sovereign equality, mutual respect and constructive engagement, can unlock South Asia’s vast potential and ensure a better tomorrow for all.
He said that in an era of growing regional cooperation, the necessity of economic, digital, and people-to-people connectivity in South Asia could hardly be over emphasised.
“Together, we must work to enhance linkages that facilitate trade, investment, innovation, and cultural exchange in our region,” the prime minister said.
“Our region also faces common challenges such as poverty, climate induced natural disasters, food and energy insecurity and public health issues. These challenges transcend borders and require collective responses based on mutual trust, goodwill, and a spirit of mutual cooperation. It is only by acting together that we can build a resilient and inclusive future for our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.

According to a report iss­ued by the Meteo­ro­logical Department, the province received only 8.6 mm of rainfall during Sep­tember, October and Nove­mber, significantly lower than the normal 14.8 mm.
Temperatures during this period also remained 0.9°C above the average.
The Met Office’s dro­ught advisory (pre-alert) stated that from May to November, western and southwestern Balo­chistan witnessed a decline in rainfall, along with a rise in the num­ber of consecutive dry days.
Forecasts indicate rainfall in the affected regions below normal till February 2026, while temperatures higher than usual, thus aggr­avating drought conditions in Quetta, Chagai, Gwadar, Kech, Kharan, Mastung, Nushki, Pishin, Panjgur, Qilla Abdullah and Washuk. However, the Met Office also expects partial relief due to a weather system that may bring rainfall to some areas later this month.

KARACHI: Leaders from political spectrum on Sunday rallied behind the country’s armed forces, accusing the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of driving a coordinated campaign to malign state institutions and sow instability.
However, the party remained defiant, and in a show of strength in Pesha­war, claiming that attempts to discredit them or their leader would only increase their popularity.
A day earlier, the PTI had lashed out at a press briefing by the military’s media wing, calling it “inappropriate and unfortunate” after the spokesperson accused incarcerated Imran Khan of being a “narcissist” and a “mentally ill person” who was edging into “security threat” territory through his persistent anti-army rhetoric.
Taking to X (formerly Twitter), PML-N leader and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal called Imran’s political rhetoric “a deeply irresponsible and dangerous trend that seeks to undermine Pakistan’s state institutions, weaken national cohesion, and erode public trust in the armed forces who defend our borders with courage and sacrifice.”
“Political differences are part of any democracy — but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and uni­ty of the country,” he wrote. Mr Iqbal added that no leader had the right to wea­ponise divisive rhetoric for personal gain at the cost of Pakistan’s national security.







‘Choose state over leader’
Offering PTI what he described as a lesson from his own party’s history, Mu­t­tahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) convener Dr Khalid Maq­bool Siddiqui on Sunday said that just as his party had once chosen the state over the narrative of its own founder, PTI now faced the same choice.
Addressing a press conference along with senior leaders Mustafa Kamal, Dr Farooq Sattar, Anis Qaim­khani, Aminul Haque and others, he warned that Pakistan stood at one of the most critical crossroads in its history and could no longer afford prolonged political instability.
The political turbulence, he said, continued to haunt the country, while foreign interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs had become increasingly evident.
Dr Siddiqui declared that Pakistan had already “defeated India decisively this year” and would now defeat “its proxies as well”.
“We never claimed that our leader was bigger than Pakistan. We detached ourselves from him for the sake of the state. If PTI believes its leader is greater than the country, then it must make a choice,” said the MQM-P leader.
Federal health minister and senior deputy convener of the party Mustafa Kamal alleged that PTI and its leadership were actively maligning Paki­tan’s military and its commanders internationally.
“These attitudes are shameful,” he said. “Thank them that the army is only holding press conferences to expose your actions. Karachi’s missing persons’ families knocked on every door in search of justice. You are still fortunate that dialogue is ongoing.”
‘Hostile agencies’ agenda’
Balochistan Chief Minister and PPP leader Sarfraz Bugti also assailed Imran Khan for “spreading propaganda against the army and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies”.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, he said that today, the nation needed to stand with its security forces more than ever before, as two provinces were facing a serious insurgency.
“In this situation, the nation has to choose, and the nation has chosen to stand with its forces,” he asserted, adding that there was an urgent need to “abandon the narrative which was weakening the state”.
Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi also assailed Imran Khan during a press conference in Rawalpindi, saying that had his claims about the former premier receiving funding from India and Israel been taken seriously, Pakistan would not be in the state it is now.
“I had said that the PTI was receiving Indian and Israeli money. This was proven. I took the foreign funding case to the Supreme Court,” he added. “Had the decision been made then and had he (Imran Khan) been disqualified, then there would not be anarchy or terrorism.”
Reacting to Mr Abbasi’s presser, PTI, in a statement, said that “it would be difficult for individuals like Abbasi to understand that Imran always stood firm for his country, its institutions, and the people of Pakistan at every forum.”
PTI demands apology
Meanwhile, through a resolution adopted at a large protest rally in Peshawar on Sunday, the PTI demanded an apology for what it called derogatory language used against its patron-in-chief Imran Khan and accountability of those responsible to prevent such statements in future.
Leaders of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP), addressing the gathering, strongly condemned Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry for his remarks about Mr Khan and Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa Chief Minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi in a media briefing, and urged the institution to “remain within its constitutional limits”.
Most speakers at the rally, held at the Sports Complex in Peshawar, argued that attempts to malign Mr Khan in order to weaken his political standing only served to increase his popularity. A large number of PTI workers attended the event as the party continued to contest the ISPR presser on social media as well.
Head of the Pashto­onkhwa Milli Awami Party and TTAP leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, TTAP’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, provincial ministers, MNAs and MPAs were among those who addressed the rally.
A resolution moved by MNA Sher Ali Arbab said: “We, the people of Pakistan, consider Imran Khan a national hero and the elected and genuine prime minister of Pakistan, who was elected by the people on Feb 8, 2024. We categorically reject that he or his associates are in any way a threat to national security.”
The resolution said an unelected military spokesperson had used “derogatory language” towards elected leadership, and termed this behaviour contrary to the principles of civilian supremacy espo­used by Quaid-i-Azam.
The party also rejected any talk of imposing governor’s rule in KP, saying the people of the province had given a clear mandate to Imran Khan and PTI “despite all obstacles and rigging”.
“Any government formed as a result of the governor’s rule will be illegal and unconstitutional in the eyes of the people,” the resolution stated.
Addressing the rally, Mr Achakzai said “undemocratic elements” had become panicked by the struggle of TTAP and PTI, which was why they had begun using “derogatory and improper language”.
Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said the DG ISPR had alleged that the KP government was not serious about security. “You are not serious, as many military operations have been launched in the previous 21 years,” he retorted.
The young chief minister said PTI could not be held responsible if peace had not returned to the region “because of your security policies”.
PTI leaders also announ­ced another rally in Kohat on Dec 14.

Rehman was arrested in August at Lahore Airport by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling and betting applications through his platform. He was granted bail in the case by the Lahore High Court on November 25, but was not released from official custody.
Meanwhile, in September, NCCIA Lahore Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry was removed from his post, reportedly over different controversies, including allegedly beating Rehman.
In the video uploaded on Sunday, Rehman outlined the timeline of events from his arrest and being remanded into the NCCIA’s custody. He described meeting Chaudhry, alleging that he was verbally and physically abusive.
“He stood up from his chair and verbally abused me,” Rehman alleged. “He asked me, ’Where does your money come from?’ I replied that it comes from YouTube. I have eight million subscribers. He accused me of corrupting the minds of children.
“He kept verbally abusing me and slapped me so much I lost count.”



Rehman further alleged that officials tried to bribe him, offering to resolve the issue for Rs70-80 million, which he said he did not have.
“When I was in NCCIA custody, you probably heard about $326,000 during a podcast with the assistant director. He said that they seized this money from me … the investigating officer (IO) ordered me to open my Binance account,” Rehman alleged.
“He closed all my trades and tokens at a loss and converted them to US dollars. He then ordered me to transfer it.”
The YouTuber further accused the IO of transferring the sum to his own personal account.
Rehman said that he felt “very helpless” during the first day of custody, further alleging that he was beaten by authorities despite cooperating with the investigation.
He added that when he met with someone he knew, he asked them to request that the guards “beat him less”.
An NCCIA Lahore spokesperson responded to Dawn’s request for comment on the allegations, replying that it is individuals who engage in corrupt practices, not institutions.
“The NCCIA maintains an uncompromising zero-tolerance policy toward any form of corrupt conduct by its officials,” the spokesperson said.
“All proceedings in this matter are being pursued strictly on merit and in full accordance with due process, and an investigation is already underway with FIA Anti-Corruption,“ he added.
On October 28, six NCCIA personnel were arrested and remanded on allegations of misusing their authority and taking bribes.
Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery” and would be produced in district court, where he would represent them.
Ashfaq said the six staffers were Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered against nine people, including eight NCCIA personnel, with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Rehman’s wife, Aroob Jatoi.</p><small>2025-12-08 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08071700f2279c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959875/bulk-of-nab-recoveries-in-form-of-assets-land' target='_blank'><strong>Bulk of NAB recoveries in form of assets, land</strong></a><br><p>• Anti-graft body claims to have retrieved Rs9tr since 2023• Instead of clipping its wings, changes to NAB law expanded scope of its work, says chairman
ISLAMABAD: Claims by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) of recovering almost Rs9 trillion in just two years (2023–25) may seem unbelievable, but the data reveals that most of the anti-graft watchdog’s recoveries are not in cash.
Instead, they consist of non-monetary assets such as land and properties belonging to various state institutions that had been illegally occupied by individuals and groups.
After the ouster of the PTI-led federal government in April 2022, the PML-N-led coalition amended the National Acc­o­untability Ordinance 1999 so that NAB could only take up cases involving Rs500 million or more.
These new laws, which seemingly curtailed its powers, actually ended up expanding the anti-graft body’s scope and led to remarkable recoveries, according to its chief.
“Since passage of the legislation, everybody assumed NAB had become redundant. but in fact, it was a blessing in disguise as we approached many government institutions, offering them help in recovering their illegally occupied land worth trillions,” NAB Chairman retired Lt Gen Nazir Ahmed Butt said in a recent media briefing.
“This has made NAB’s job more demanding but also more useful for the state and its institutions,” he added.
This was the maiden formal media interaction for Lt Gen Butt, who took charge in March 2023.
Comparing his performance with NAB’s past record, he recalled that from its creation in 1999 to March 2023, the bureau recovered $3.15 billion. However, the two-and-a-half-years that he has been in charge, he said the bureau had recovered a staggering of $29.99bn.
These include cash recoveries of Rs1.124tr (roughly $4bn), with the rest coming in the form of assets.
In his remarks, the chairman said that over the past 26 years, the government provided Rs62bn to NAB, while the bureau had recovered Rs9tr, making its performance unmatched by any anti-corruption agency in the world.
New measures
According to NAB documents seen by Dawn, the 2022 reforms made affidavits and undertakings from complainants a mandatory process, and the term “accused” was replaced with “defendant”.
The bureau also developed a mechanism for handling cardinal consideration-complaints against parliamentarians, government officials and businessmen.
In addition, Accountability Fac­ilitation Cells were set up in Nat­ional and provincial assemblies, the Establishment Division and the offices of chief secretaries.
“We don’t approach any lawmaker or businessman directly, but through their respective speaker and chamber of commerce,” the chairman said.
He said this approach had restored bureaucrats’ confidence, as many had earlier stopped signing important files.
Under its new strategy, NAB has been now focusing on recovering several categories of state land, including misappropriated, underutilised, illegally possessed and hidden land, as well as land not registered with revenue authorities.
Meanwhile, the bureau has geared up its efforts to curb money laundering, trace illegal foreign assets, freeze bank accounts and properties, make immediate arrests and ensure swift recovery of crime proceeds.

Pakistan, for better or worse, is a different story, though. Its banks have fared much better than the country’s economy as a whole.
But they lend more to the government than the real economy, and there seems to be a compelling reason why banks avoid private-sector lending and prefer safer government securities: the nation’s loan recovery laws and inefficient judicial system reward default rather than punish it. You can borrow money from banks and avoid or delay repayment for years — even decades — because litigation would drag on endlessly.
“Weak enforcement, legal loopholes and slow courts collectively make loan recovery extremely difficult,” says a senior executive of a foreign bank speaking on condition of anonymity. “As a result, banks are reluctant to lend to the private sector, especially where default risk is higher. They know that if a loan goes bad, they would be stuck in legal limbo.”

 

The case with public-sector banks is different, he says. “They can afford default and write-off losses. But private banks cannot afford this because they don’t have government support or guarantees to absorb their losses like the state-owned lenders.”

The economic fallout of a weak loan-recovery framework is huge, with SMEs and farmers struggling to access finance

The consequences of delays in recovery case decisions are evident in Pakistan’s exceptionally high loan infection ratio, with the current non-performing loan (NPL) ratio well above global trends.
In the US, the NPL ratio stands at 1.5 per cent and in the UK at only 1pc. Even emerging markets like Indonesia and Malaysia have impaired-loan ratios of 2.25pc and a 1.6pc, respectively. In contrast, Pakistan’s NPL ratio remains significantly higher at 7.4pc, underscoring persistent asset-quality challenges and weaker recovery systems relative to regional and global peers.
The State Bank data shows that the country’s top 13 banks, which carry a high volume of bad loans, hold a very large portfolio of Rs622.84 billion in domestic NPLs, with the industry’s total NPL standing at Rs964bn as of September. National Bank of Pakistan tops the list with bad loans of Rs158.3bn followed by United Bank with roughly Rs76bn and Habib Bank with Rs70.6bn. Bank of Punjab ranks fourth with NPLs of Rs54.3bn and Bank Alfalah holds fifth place with Rs42.4bn.
The law — Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 — that is supposed to fix this situation falls short of its purpose, says a corporate lawyer who has represented various banks during the last couple of decades. The law creates special banking courts, promises speedy decisions, and gives lenders a clearer path to repossessions.
“The law allows lenders to sell mortgaged property like land, houses, and equipment through a public auction without the intervention of any court after serving a final notice and following the prescribed legal procedure and timeframes. Suits are expected to be disposed of within 90 days. The court may also require defaulters to deposit cash or provide security equal to the claim amount if proceedings extend beyond this period due to their conduct.

‘Borrowers routinely obtain stay orders, file parallel suits, drag out appeals, and exploit every procedural loophole the system offers to avoid repaying loans’

“The Ordinance includes penalties, including imprisonment and fines, for deliberate default, fraudulent activities, or intentionally destroying or removing secured property,” he says.
But in practice, the system still favours delays.
“Borrowers routinely obtain stay orders, file parallel suits, drag out appeals, and exploit every procedural loophole the system offers. Even when a decree is issued, repossession remains a political, administrative and logistical nightmare. Police hesitate, revenue officials duck responsibility, and borrowers simply refuse to hand over pledged assets.
“Vehicles vanish, equipment goes missing, and properties remain stuck in litigation. Banks either spend heavily to trace and seize assets or simply write-off the loss,” maintains the lawyer, who says some of the cases he is pursuing date back to 2009.
The State Bank regularly collects data on all pending court cases from banks, but it does not publicise this information for good reasons, as per global practices. However, data obtained by Dawn privately from five of the 13 banks mentioned above on recovery suits pending with high courts across Pakistan, shows that recovery suits involving an aggregate amount of Rs75bn are pending decision at various stages.
Additionally, cases involving a cumulative amount of Rs43bn decided or decreed in their favour are at different stages of execution. This represents only the tip of the iceberg, as it does not include details of litigation pending in banking courts, nor does it capture the total volume of appeals and petitions filed by borrowers or banks against high court decisions.
“When a borrower defaults, our whole recovery system turns into a labyrinth of court cases and delays. Even after a decree, actual recovery drags on for years. Banks suffer losses. They will lend to what you call underserved or unserved segments of the economy only when they are confident that they will get their money back,” the foreign bank executive says.
The banking industry has regularly taken up this issue with both the previous and incumbent governments, urging reforms to Pakistan’s weak loan recovery laws and procedures. It has repeatedly been pointed out that Pakistani courts operate at a painfully slow pace, and recovery suits often take years to resolve, calling for the implementation of Sri Lanka’s Parate Execution mechanism in the country to expedite the recovery of bad loans.
Sri Lanka solved its chronic delays in loan recovery decades ago through this mechanism. Under it, banks can seize and auction mortgaged assets without first going through courts. Courts intervene only when a borrower can show a clear legal violation. The process is swift: after default, the bank issues a notice; if no payment is made within 14 days, a board resolution allows the bank to auction the property.

 

Auctions are publicly advertised, and recovery is completed within weeks rather than years. If an auction fails, the bank may temporarily take the property onto its books but must resell it and return any surplus to the borrower. This non-judicial foreclosure system has transformed Sri Lanka’s credit market by giving banks confidence to lend to small and medium enterprises, homebuyers, and consumers.
Another banking sector lawyer says the country’s loan recovery law itself is straightforward; the flaw lies in its weak implementation. “The core problem is the lack of competent judges who understand banking and recovery laws. Those judges who do have the expertise are overworked.
“This is a specialised area, and without the right judicial capacity, cases cannot be decided correctly or on time. Banking courts perform somewhat better because they handle only these matters, but high court judges are overwhelmed and simply do not have the time to hear our cases. The systemic delays have made the foreclosure process ineffective despite what the law promises.”
The economic fallout of a weak loan-recovery framework is huge. Small and medium enterprises and farmers struggle to access finance. The mortgage market is virtually non-existent, as no lender can offer long-term housing finance without the assurance of repossession in the event of default. Even consumer credit — personal loans and credit cards — remains underdeveloped.
These segments pay the price for a legal system that is unable to enforce contracts while banks retreat to the safer options of lending to government or large corporations, leaving the broader economy starved of credit.

ISLAMABAD: The government’s expenditure on civil administration and pension payouts has continually climbed over the last five years, with the first quarter of the current fiscal year seeing a double-digit increase despite a strict official austerity policy and an aggressive downsizing exercise.
Fiscal data released by the Ministry of Finance indicates a 13pc increase in ‘Running of the Civil Government’ expenditure in the first quarter, which runs from July to September. The costs rose to Rs161.2bn in the current fiscal year, compared to Rs142.5bn during the same period last year.
This rise in expenses comes as the government claims to be tightening its belt through significant staffing and structural reforms.
The increase is notable as the government abolished more than 150,000 posts last year and has been “rightsizing” various ministries, divisions and their subordinate departments through mergers and closures.
Additionally, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb anno­unced about a week ago that the government had abolished an additional 54,000 vacant posts across various departments, resulting in an annual saving of more than Rs56bn to the exchequer.
He added that the process of merging and restructuring several ministries and divisions was also underway as part of fiscal reforms.
The trend of rising costs is not new. Civil government expenses in the first quarter of last year saw an 8pc increase compared to the same period of FY24, which itself had posted a 29pc surge over FY23.
The data showed that the running of civil government expenses has jumped by almost 80pc since the first quarter of FY22 when the expenditure amounted to Rs89.5bn. The full-year bill for running the civil government had crossed Rs892bn.
Similarly, pension expenditures continue to climb. In the first quarter of the current year, pension payments amounted to Rs249.5bn, a 10pc increase over the Rs223bn spent in the comparable period of FY25.
A year earlier, pension payments had witnessed a 9pc increase. Over the past five years, pension expenditure has surged by almost 125pc, up from the Rs111bn reported for the first quarter of FY22. The total pension bill at the conclusion of the last fiscal year reached Rs911bn.
In contrast to the rigid and monthly due expenses of pensions and civil administration, the official data showed large var­iations in subsidy payments, which the government can postpone. These payments saw a six-time surge in the first quarter of the current year, reaching Rs120bn compared to Rs20bn last year.
The government had disbursed only Rs2.5bn for subsidies in the first quarter of FY24, while payments in the preceding two years were Rs93bn and Rs74bn, respectively. The subsidy bill last year reached Rs1.298 trillion.
On paper, the government has adhered to an austerity policy across all sectors since 2021, driven by stringent fiscal oversight mandated by successive IMF programmes.
In June, the government ann­ounced the continuation of austerity measures for FY26, which included a complete ban on the purchase of all types of vehicles, the procurement of machinery and equipment, and the creation of new posts throughout the federal government.
However, various ministries, divisions and entities kept on fi­n­d­ing ways to bypass such banks on one pretext or another.

Key stakeholders now hope the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will recognise the centrality of economic expansion to durable stabilisation and ease pressure on the government, allowing it fiscal space to recalibrate its tax policy.
They contend that only such flexibility can unshackle the country’s economic potential and unlock its vast productive capacity.
Under the IMF oversight and a strict focus on fiscal stabilisation, Pakistan’s tax collection has risen sharply over the past two years.
According to the State Bank, tax revenue grew by a notable 12.5 per cent year-on-year in Q1FY26. However, despite repeated claims of broadening the tax base, tangible progress remains elusive.

‘Out of the proposed Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief may go to companies, with super tax potentially cut from 10pc to 5pc’

Large sectors, including agriculture, wholesale, retail trade, real estate, and high-earning service providers such as lawyers, doctors, architects, artists, consultants, etc, continue to operate largely outside the tax net. As a result, the burden of additional revenue mobilisation has fallen disproportionately on those already within the tax system.
This pattern is also reflected in official publications. According to the ‘21st Edition of the Revenue Division Year Book 2025’, the share of direct taxes in total taxes rose from 37.2pc in FY22 to 49.3pc in FY25. A review of the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 and related publications confirms that the government does not regularly publish a clean breakdown of the share of categories of direct taxpayers, such as corporations or salaried individuals, in total direct tax collection.
However, the corporate sector is understood to account for around 65pc of direct tax collections. The salaried individuals, presumed to be captive taxpayers, whose taxes are deducted at source and who constitute less than 8pc of the labour force, are believed to be contributing far more than their proportional share to the tax take.
Acknowledging that Pakistan’s unusually high tax burden has become a drag on growth, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif reportedly directed his economic team last week to engage the IMF on a proposed Rs975 billion tax-relief package as a part of a strategy to spur job creation and capital formation.

‘High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package’

The package was crafted by one of the government’s working groups, which included representatives from civil society and the private sector, to recommend tax structure reforms. The private-sector-led group on taxation, chaired by Shahzad Saleem, proposed phasing the relief over three years, with an estimated immediate cost of Rs600bn. The government, however, opted to seek the IMF’s endorsement before proceeding with implementation.
Senior members of the economic team were approached for comment, but no response was received by the time of filing. However, a source familiar with the deliberations said the prime minister’s close advisors broadly support the tax panel’s proposals, viewing them as critical for kick-starting growth.
“High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package,” a senior official noted privately. “We have some fiscal space, with the fiscal deficit down from over 8pc to around 5pc, but we need the Fund’s relaxation on the primary-surplus target to move ahead.”
Responding to a question on how much of the proposed relief targets the salaried class, former FBR chairman Shabbar Zaidi noted, “The maximum salary tax rate is proposed to be reduced by five percentage points. The impact will be no more than Rs30–40bn. So, out of a Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief would go to companies. Super Tax is to be cut from 10pc to 5pc.” He pointed out that the proposal contains no concrete measures to offset the resulting revenue shortfall.
Business leaders serving on government working groups declined to comment under their engagement terms. However, former Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik endorsed the proposed tax relief, arguing that Pakistan’s tax regime renders businesses uncompetitive and punishes the most tax-compliant. “Salaried employees and formal-sector firms bear a crushing tax burden while large segments of the economy remain untaxed.”
He warned that the high-tax approach under the 24th IMF programme is stifling investment, destroying jobs and accelerating skilled emigration, while repeated pledges to tax retailers, wholesalers, transporters, doctors, lawyers and salon operators have produced little progress.
“In this context, tax cuts are not just desirable but essential. Proposed measures include lowering the corporate tax rate from 29pc to 25pc; bringing maximum individual and AOP rates down from 38–49pc to a rational 25pc; abolishing the super tax; removing taxes on inter-corporate dividends; cutting sales tax from 18pc to 15pc; and withdrawing the Capital Value Tax. The real challenge, as always, will be closing the fiscal gap and securing IMF approval,” Mr Malik remarked.
“That requires political will. The government must cut expenditure, fast-track privatisation, and phase in tax reductions over three years. Evidence shows that lower, predictable taxes stimulate investment, create jobs, and ultimately raise revenue. Pakistan cannot grow while choking its most productive sectors.
“Above all, personal income tax rates need an immediate cut. Salaried workers have become the easiest target, taxed far beyond economic reality. Easing this burden is vital to restore confidence, stem the brain drain, and put the country on a sustainable growth path,” he concluded.
Abdul Aleem, Secretary General, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, supported a calibrated reduction in tax rates for both the corporate and salaried groups. He noted that publicly available details do not explain how the Rs975bn figure was derived or what share is intended for salaried taxpayers.
He believed that the IMF is broadly aligned with the proposed relief but urged the Ministry of Finance to clarify how the resulting revenue shortfall would be addressed.

With teams arriving and no court to play on, the event itself was in jeopardy.
“We arranged everything in almost two days,” PBBF secretary Yaqoob Qadri told Dawn, revealing a significant off-court challenge. “There were some people who don’t want the event to happen.”
Yet, on Sunday, the roar of a packed crowd for the Army-Sindh clash at the North Nazimabad Gymkhana in Karachi was the definitive answer. Against a backdrop of administrative hurdles, the players delivered a classic on the hardwood: a tale of Army’s clinical system slowly dismantling Sindh’s passionate home stand, culminating in a 97-62 victory.
The roar in the arena was for Sindh. Every steal, every basket by the home team sent waves of noise crashing onto the court. But standing across from that passion was the cold, tall geometry of the Pakistan Army team. What unfolded was a classic clash of heart versus system.
The start was all Sindh. Feeding off the overwhelming home support, they edged a tight first quarter 6-4. Army’s towering presence, anchored by the 7’3“ frame of Taglub Ammar, was a problem.
“We took our competition lightly that’s why Sindh edged us in the first quarter,” Taglub admitted to Dawn.
Army’s top-scorer Shiraz Aslam, who initially missed some of his three-point shots struggled in start found his rhythm.
Sindh’s in-game leader, Ans Azhar, pinpointed the turning point.
“In the first quarter we started brilliantly and I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” he told Dawn. “In the second quarter when that wave passed we couldn’t keep the same intensity and that’s where they hurt us.”
That hurt was methodical. Army began dominating the second balls, converting rebounds into points and punishing every seldom mistake.
The tall player was no longer just a threat; he became the central piece of an unsolvable equation.
“We were to some extent not able to overpower them in some exchanges,” Ans conceded. “I wouldn’t say that it was a total mismatch but Army’s athletes are fittest of our country.”
By halftime, Army led 15-12. By the third quarter, the lead had swelled to 20. The crowd, still raising the roof, willed a comeback, but Army had locked in.
“We came prepared and were always confident of the comeback,” Shiraz said, who revelled in the electric atmosphere. “This is what we play for… The atmosphere today made the match very exciting.”
The final quarter was a formality, the gap insurmountable. Sindh’s physical effort, which saw them “commit too many fouls” and give away nearly 20 points from the line, was a testament to their fight.
“Against a team like Army you can’t shy away from those duels,” Ans stated. “We were very physical in the game… you play to win no matter what.”
Despite the loss, Sindh’s leader found perspective and promise.
“Obviously wasn’t the result we wanted… but we are still a work in progress,” Ans said, already looking ahead. “But one thing that I can ensure is that it will be improved and [we will] beat those professional sides at the top level with the same bunch.”
A theme of dominance
The men’s result echoed through the women’s bracket, where professional department teams showcased their structural advantage. The Army women routed Balochistan 56-6, while Wapda, the most dominant force in women’s basketball, cruised past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
For Wapda’s Kainat Zafar, the win was a controlled step towards the gold.
“We were trying to conserve our energy and avoid injuries,” she explained while talking to Dawn. “We tried to stick to the basics.”
She credits their dynasty to chemistry built over years together as a department — a key edge over provincial sides.
“The chemistry among the players is what I think keeps us on the top,” she said.
Yet, even in dominance, there’s respect. “Our main rivals are always Army,” Kainat noted, setting the stage for the tournament’s likely climax.</p><small>2025-12-07 19:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07235448368f26d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959764/israels-netanyahu-to-discuss-second-phase-of-gaza-plan-with-trump-later-this-month' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s Netanyahu to discuss second phase of Gaza plan with Trump later this month</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the second phase of a US plan to end Tel Aviv’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza was close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed.
Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Jerusalem, said that he would hold important discussions with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan’s second phase was achieved.
The prime minister’s office in November said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House “in the near future”, although a date for the visit has not yet been made public.
Netanyahu said that he would discuss with Trump how to bring an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. Israel and Hamas entered a ceasefire two months ago, but Israel has continued its bombardment of Gaza, killing Palestinians, as the death toll in the besieged enclave reached over 72,300 as of November 19, 2o25. Gaza’s health ministry says 373 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire started. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by Hamas.
Earlier today, Israel’s army killed seven Palestinians in northern Gaza, including a 70-year-old woman and her son. Attacks also wounded a child in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera. Tel Aviv also alleges that Hamas has been violating the ceasefire.
Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on “their commitment” to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised.
Israel retained control of 53 per cent of Gaza under the first phase of Trump’s plan, which involved the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel. The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023, fighting Hamas.
Phase 2 must come out now: German chancellor
According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established in Gaza and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins.
A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled.
“What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” Netanyahu said, describing them as central issues.
Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute, but that phase two “must come now”.
West Bank annexation remains subject of discussion: Netanyahu
Netanyahu said that he would also discuss with Trump “opportunities for peace”, an apparent reference to US efforts for Israel to establish formal ties with Arab and Muslim states.
“We believe there’s a path to advance a broader peace with the Arab states, and a path also to establish a workable peace with our Palestinian neighbours,” Netanyahu said, asserting Israel would always insist on security control of the West Bank.
Trump has said he promised Muslim leaders that Israel would not annex the occupied West Bank, where Netanyahu’s government is backing the development of Jewish settlements.
The “question of political annexation” of the West Bank remains a subject of discussion, Netanyahu said.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0718360742a870d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959752/45-arrested-as-citizens-clash-with-police-during-sindh-culture-day-rally' target='_blank'><strong>45 arrested as citizens clash with police during Sindh Culture Day rally</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police arrested 45 people participating in the Sindh Culture Day rally on Sunday, after people allegedly pelted police personnel with stones.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that upon being attacked by participants, police responded with a baton charge and tear gas shelling.
“We detained 45 people on Sharea Faisal,” DIG Raza said. “The South SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) is at the scene, and the situation is under control.”
The DIG said that since the Red Zone has been closed, alternative traffic routes are being provided for citizens and commuters.
He added that the law enforcers asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the main Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”.
“They allegedly pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he said, adding that it prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.
According to police sources, participants at the rally were arguing with police over being stopped and that dispute escalated into stone-throwing.



Asked as to why the law enforcers blocked the road at the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover, DIG Raza said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the Cultural Day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intend to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal.
“In view of certain past untoward incidents, the law enforcers were asked to ensure that no participant was allowed to move beyond FTC under any circumstances, as the area ahead leads into the Red Zone, which contains sensitive installations.
“Thus, the police and rangers were deployed at the FTC bridge to enforce the diversion and prevent any unauthorised movement.”
Later, the DIG said that 12 of the 45 arrested were released on the surety of the Karachi Bar Association president.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident on Sharea Faisal and ordered immediate action against those involved, according to a statement from his office.
In a phone call with the additional inspector general, Lanjar ordered, “Those damaging police vehicles and citizens’ property should be arrested immediately.”







Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh.



Raza recalled that in 2023, during Sindh Cultural Day celebrations, there were violent confrontations between law enforcers and protesters in which a first information report was also registered.
Similarly, last year, Raza said a police van was damaged, and police personnel were manhandled, while some of the protestors managed to cross into the Red Zone and reached the KPC via Jinnah Bridge.
“Around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached the Fawara Chowk and KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants,” he said.

Their goldrush on Sunday was spearheaded by utter dominance in taekwondo and sharp shooting on the ranges.
The clearest demonstration of authority came in the taekwondo Poomsae events, where Army fighters ruled the roost, clinching eight gold medals across age categories.
Their women set the tone: Sana Sabir (Under-50), Naila (U-30), Mehar-Un-Nisa (U-40) and Zeena Sheraz (Under-20)  all stood atop the podium. The men followed suit with Adil Hussain (U-30), Mohammad Mumtaz (U-40), Irshad Ali (U-50) and Syed Zohaib (U-20) securing their own golds.
On the shooting ranges, Army and Navy engaged in a high-class duel, sharing three gold medals apiece.
Navy swept the 10m air pistol events, with Rabia Kabir (232.2) edging Army’s Rimsha Nadeem (231.6) for individual glory before teaming with Rasam Gul and Hadia Liaquat for team gold.
Army struck back in the 25m rapid fire pistol through Mohammad Shabbir while Navy’s G. M. Bashir, Maqbool Hussain and Abdul Quddus took the team title.
Army also claimed both skeet Olympic titles, with Imam Haroon (score 49) leading the charge.
Sindh’s first gold
The day’s most dramatic narrative unfolded away from the established powers, as the Sindh women’s netball team rose above a feisty, fractious final to secure a domineering 20-12 victory over favourites Wapda, claiming a statement gold — a first for the contingent.
It was a triumph of provincial grit over a departmental side with year-round training access.
“That makes this even better,” Sindh skipper Quratulain told Dawn. Team-mate Huma echoed the hunger for more support: “We’ll go a long way if we get that opportunity.”
The match itself descended into chaos. After Sindh seized a 13-9 half-time lead, the stifling heat seemed to boil over.
A third-quarter collision escalated into a shoving match. In the final quarter, a Wapda player made an expletive gesture, inciting the crowd. Sindh held their nerve, but sportsmanship evaporated at the final buzzer.
Handshakes were skipped, and an hour later, a sullen Wapda and bronze-winning Army drowned out Sindh’s celebrations with chants of “losers, losers!”
“The girls need their own court,” said Sindh coach Humaira Huma, a pioneer of Pakistan’s first national team. “Today was just a month’s practice. Imagine what they could do.”
In stark contrast, the men’s final was a pure sporting contest, with Army staging a last-gasp comeback to clinch gold 27-26 against Navy.
Hosts overwhelmed
On the basketball court, Army’s men showcased their systemic power, overcoming a raucous home crowd to dismantle Sindh 97-62.
Sindh started strong, leading 6-4 early. “We started brilliantly, but I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” Sindh’s leader Ans Azhar told Dawn.
Army’s towering 7’3“ center, Taglub Ammar, proved unsolvable. “We took the competition lightly initially,” Taglub conceded. Once settled, Army took control, leading 15-12 at halftime and stretching it to 20 by the final quarter.
Top-scorer Shiraz Aslam revelled in the atmosphere: “This is what we play for… The crowd made the match very exciting.”
Sindh’s physicality cost them nearly 20 points from free throws.
“We were very physical… you play to win,” said Ans, who vowed improvement: “We will beat those professional sides.”
In women’s basketball, the powerhouses marched on.
Army delivered a merciless 56-6 rout of Balochistan while Wapda, led by Kainat Zafar, powered past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
“We were trying to conserve energy and avoid injuries,” said Kainat, highlighting Wapda’s key advantage. “This chemistry is the advantage we have over provincial teams.”
Crushing win
Other sports saw their opening salvos. In a staggering display, Wapda’s women’s hockey team crushed Balochistan 18-0, with ten players on the scoresheet.
On the badminton courts, stars like Mahoor Shahzad (Wapda) and Palwasha Bashir (Sindh) led their teams comfortably into the semi-finals.
Army and Punjab also ensured progress with dominant wins.
Murad Ali (KP), Pakistan’s number one, led his team into the last-four in the men’s section as his side beat Railways to advance in the semis.
Army and Police also confirmed their berths in the next round.
The fencing mat witnessed a historic gold for the Higher Education Commission (HEC), delivered by Abdul Mussawir, who dashed Balochistan’s title hopes in the final.
Other sports that kicked off on Sunday included, rugby, volleyball, baseball, softball and table tennis.
Action continues across Karachi on Monday, with Army’s golden machine looking to build on a formidable lead, and provincial sides like Sindh aiming to channel their fighting spirit into more podium finishes.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0722580207891a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959760/transporters-press-ahead-with-wheel-jam-strike-in-islamabad-rawalpindi-tomorrow-despite-administrations-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Transporters press ahead with wheel-jam strike in Islamabad, Rawalpindi tomorrow despite administration’s appeal</strong></a><br><p>Local public transporters on Sunday announced a wheel-jam strike for tomorrow (December 8) in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, rejecting the local administration’s request to delay the protest against the new traffic ordinance, which has raised fines for heavy vehicles.
The strike was announced on the call of the Punjab Public Transport Association. Before the announcement, representatives of the association, along with the Goods Transporters Association, met City Traffic Police officer Farhan Aslam and Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi. The administration urged transporters not to observe a wheel-jam strike in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
However, local transporters refused to withdraw their decision, insisting they would go ahead with the strike to pressure the provincial government into repealing the ordinance.
“We tried to convince the transporters not to go for a wheel-jam strike, but they demanded to abolish the new amendments, and it was beyond our authority to do anything about it,” Shirazi said.
He added that the Punjab government had been informed of the demands of the transporters, and it would hold negotiations with the United Transport Association in Lahore.
Mutahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairman Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that “transporters were facing problems due to heavy fines, and it was difficult to manage their household budgets.”
“Heavy fines from Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 had become routine, and it destroyed their business,” Riaz said, adding that the government was trying to recover its financial burdens from transporters, who were already struggling with fuel and spare parts.
He demanded an immediate reduction in fines and an end to policies that “destroyed the sector.”
During the meeting, he said that the traffic police agreed not to impose fines on vehicles having a fitness certificate.
Meanwhile, the President of the Goods Transport Association, Shakeel Qureshi, said that freight vehicles and goods transporters in Rawalpindi would support the wheel-jam strike on Monday.
“We will join them in the decision of the Pakistan United Transporters Committee to strike on December 8,” he said, adding that the Rawalpindi transporters will keep their bases completely closed.
“We strongly condemn the traffic laws passed by the Punjab Assembly and the rate of fines,” he said. “Amendments to the customs laws that will be made are tantamount to economic murder of transporters.”
Qureshi went on to say that the government should take the time to be conscious and make decisions, keeping in mind the interests of the people. “It should not be that decisions are made by listening to one side and making laws without consulting stakeholders,” he said.
On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) Rawalpindi district has announced its full support for the December 8 strike of the Transport Action Committee against heavy traffic fines.
Spokesperson JUI Rawalpindi Hafiz Ziaullah said that heavy fines imposed by the Punjab government have made life difficult for the people of Rawalpindi, especially the poor motorcyclists.
He demanded that the Chief Minister of Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, “adopt a people-friendly policy and reduce the unnecessary and unfair burden of fines.”</p><small>2025-12-07 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07222639a82bbc8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959758/un-calls-on-taliban-to-lift-ban-on-afghan-women-in-its-offices' target='_blank'><strong>UN calls on Taliban to lift ban on Afghan women in its offices</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations called on the Taliban authorities on Sunday to lift its ban on Afghan women working in its offices, saying the restriction puts “life-saving services” at risk.
Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, Afghan women have been barred from doing most jobs, visiting parks and beauty salons, and attending school beyond the age of 12.
In September, the Taliban authorities began prohibiting women staff members from entering UN offices.
“We call for the ban on Afghan women staff and contractors from entering United Nations premises to be reversed, and for their safe access to offices and the field,” Susan Ferguson, the special representative of the UN’s women’s agency in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“The longer these restrictions remain in place, the greater the risk to these life-saving services,” Ferguson said, adding that they violated the UN’s principles of human rights and equality.
The statement did not say how many staff were affected, but UN sources indicated that several hundred women were facing the ban.
Staff have been working remotely for the past three months, notably assisting the victims of deadly earthquakes and Afghan migrants deported from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, Ferguson said.
Describing their work as “indispensable”, she said: “Only through their presence can we reach women and girls safely and provide culturally appropriate assistance.”
The Taliban authorities did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.
In September, the UN’s refugee agency suspended cash aid to returned Afghan migrants, citing the impossibility of interviewing and collecting information on more than 50 per cent of returnees who were women.</p><small>2025-12-07 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07201958f852200.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959753/tearful-norris-takes-f1-title-as-verstappen-wins-abu-dhabi-race' target='_blank'><strong>Tearful Norris takes F1 title as Verstappen wins Abu Dhabi race</strong></a><br><p>McLaren’s Lando Norris sobbed tears of joy and relief as he won the Formula One championship for the first time and ended Max Verstappen’s four-year reign with a nervy third place at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday.
Red Bull’s Verstappen, who ended the campaign with more wins (eight) than any driver, triumphed in the season-ender with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri second and 12.5 seconds behind at the chequered flag.
Norris, Britain’s 11th Formula One world champion, took his points tally to 423 with Verstappen on 421 and Piastri third with 410.

McLaren, who secured the constructors’ championship in October for the second year in a row, won both titles in the same season for the first time since 1998.
“I’ve not cried in a while. I didn’t think I would cry but I did,” said an emotional Norris in a post-race interview, after also shedding tears inside his helmet.

“It feels amazing. I now know what Max feels like a little bit.

“I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It’s been a pleasure to race against both of them. It’s been an honour, I’ve learned a lot from both,” he added.
Norris’s mother Cisca gave Piastri a consoling hug while both Verstappen and the Australian congratulated the new champion in a show of sportsmanship.
The victory denied Verstappen the achievement of five titles in a row, something only Ferrari great Michael Schumacher has managed so far.
Charles Leclerc finished fourth in Sunday’s race for Ferrari with George Russell fifth for Mercedes and Fernando Alonso sixth for Aston Martin.
Esteban Ocon was seventh for Haas, ahead of Ferrari’s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton – who failed to stand on the podium all year in a career low for the 40-year-old who joined the Italian team this year from Mercedes.

According to the statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was conducted on Saturday on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Hindustan”.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement detailed that during the operation yesterday, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 12 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were found in the terrorists’ possession, it said, adding that they had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area as [a] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision [of] ‘Azm-i- Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Yesterday, a statement issued by the ISPR had said that 14 terrorists had been killed in three separate intelligence-based IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Balochistan’s Tank.
Earlier this week, security forces had killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.
President, PM laud forces for successful operation in Kalat
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Kalat, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president, in his statement, said the state of Pakistan was “fully capable of taking enemies of peace to their end at all costs.”
He reiterated that the “resolve of the nation will foil every conspiracy of Fitna al Hindustan.”
In his statement, PM Shehbaz said security forces were “achieving great successes against terrorism under the vision of Azm-e-Istehkam.”
“The nation is united against terrorism and is determined to completely eradicate all forms of this menace from the country,” the report quoted him as saying.

According to a letter dated November 26 and addressed to Barrister Gohar, which is seen by Dawn, the PTI leader had written an application to the commission on November 13 regarding the inclusion of senators into the PTI.
While the letter did not elaborate on the matter raised by Barrister Gohar, he seemed to have sought the inclusion of those senators into his party who were elected to the upper house of Parliament from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in July after much delay.
The ECP said in its letter that “after due deliberation, it was observed that the issue of intra-party election of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is pending before the commission due to the stay order obtained by the party from the Lahore High Court (LHC)”.
“Hence, in the above circumstances, the commission is not in a position to accept you as chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. Therefore, you do not have any locus standi, and you are informed, accordingly,” the letter read.
The PTI has held intra-party elections three times, but the initial two were voided by the commission. Following the third election, the PTI approached the LHC, which restrained the commission from issuing any final order in proceedings related to the intra-party polls.
On Saturday, Barrister Gohar also addressed the matter during a press conference, recalling that the last intra-party election of the PTI was held on March 3, 2024.
“We filed documentation pertaining to it, but there was no [confirmation of] acceptance by the election commission. Today, for the first time, I received the election commission’s letter in which they formally said that ‘we do not recognise you’. It is very unfortunate that they do not recognise the PTI,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-07 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071456517882d89.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959748/fo-rejects-indian-foreign-ministers-inflammatory-misleading-remarks-about-pakistans-armed-forces' target='_blank'><strong>FO rejects Indian foreign minister’s ‘inflammatory, misleading’ remarks about Pakistan’s armed forces</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) rejected and condemned on Sunday the “highly inflammatory, baseless and irresponsible” remarks by Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar about Pakistan’s armed forces, terming them “misleading”.
The FO’s condemnation came a day after Jaishankar alleged that India’s core challenges with its neighbouring country stemmed directly from Pakistan’s military establishment.
In its reaction to his remarks, the FO underscored that Pakistan was a responsible state, and all its institutions, including armed forces, were a pillar of national security, dedicated to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.







The FO’s statement also referred to a brief four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May, saying that it “vividly demonstrated Pakistan armed forces’ professionalism as well as their resolve to defend the motherland and the people of Pakistan against any Indian aggression in a befitting, effective yet responsible manner”.
“No amount of propaganda can belie this truth,” the statement added.
It labelled attempts by the Indian leadership to defame Pakistan’s state institutions and its leadership as “part of a propaganda campaign designed to distract attention from India’s destabilising actions in the region and beyond, as well as state-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan”.
“Such incendiary rhetoric only exemplifies the extent of India’s disregard for amity, peace and stability in our region.”
The statement said that instead of making misleading remarks about the armed forces of Pakistan, “India must investigate the fascist and revisionist Hindutva ideology that has unleashed a reign of mob justice, lynchings, arbitrary detentions and demolition of properties and places of worship”.
Indian state and leadership both had become “hostage of this terror in the name of religion,” it added.
The statement further stressed that “Pakistan believes in co-existence, dialogue and diplomacy. However, it stands united and resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its interests and sovereignty”.</p><small>2025-12-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071431438ed8305.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959746/pakistan-to-sell-excess-gas-in-international-markets-from-january-1-petroleum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to sell excess gas in international markets from January 1: petroleum minister</strong></a><br><p>Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said on Sunday that Pakistan would begin selling excess liquefied natural gas (LNG) in international markets from January 1.
Malik’s statement during a press conference in Lahore came months after it was reported that Pakistan was exploring ways to sell excess LNG cargoes amid a gas supply glut that could cost domestic producers millions in annual losses.
He noted that Pakistan had been importing gas from “our friend” Qatar and Italian energy company Eni. But, he continued, there was an excess of this imported gas as the use of this fuel for power generation had reduced in the country during the past few months.
Resultantly, “we were compelled to divert it to domestic consumers, due to which circular debt was increasing in the gas sector”, he said, adding that it also caused a loss of around Rs1,000 billion to Pakistan from 2018-19 till now.
“From January 1, we will sell this excess fuel in international markets and reduce our burden while limiting the loss caused by it,” he added.
Moreover, he said, the measure would also allow Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises in the sector to operate on their full capacity and generate profit.
Last month, it was reported that Pakistan had struck a deal to cancel 21 LNG cargoes under its long-term contract with Eni as part of a plan to curb excess imports that have flooded its gas network. Meanwhile, sources also said that Pakistan was in talks with Qatar about gas supplies from the Gulf state, with options including deferring some cargoes or reselling them under existing contract clauses.
Foreign investment
During his press conference, Malik also outlined the expected investment in the petroleum sector by foreign companies.
He recalled that Turkiye’s energy minister had visited Pakistan recently and “after 20 years, Turkish Petroleum, in collaboration with Pakistani companies”, would be taking part in onshore and offshore exploration activities.
“Turkish Petroleum will also open its office in Islamabad, where 10 to 15 Turkish nationals will be working,” he said, adding that Pakistanis would also get employment there.
“We are moving towards decreasing our reliance on imported oil and gas,” the minister further stated.
He said a delegation of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) would be visiting Pakistan in the coming week, adding that it was also expected to collaborate with local companies for oil and gas exploration.
The minister said SOCAR was also opening its office in Pakistan. “It will also invest millions of dollars in the construction of an oil pipeline from Machike to Thalian in collaboration with the PSO (Pakistan State Oil) and FWO (Frontier Works Organisation).”
He said the pipeline’s construction would begin in a month or month and a half.
Malik said private fundraising of $3.5 billion for the Reko Diq project had been finalised, and now the banks were finalising the agreements. In addition, he said, local companies and Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold would invest more than $3.5bn in the project.
In total, $6-7bn would be invested in the first phase of the project, following which “you will see the face of Chaghi (the site of the project) changing”, he added.
The minister said Reko Diq’s signing ceremony was expected to take place in a month or two at the Prime Minister’s House.

According to the FO statement, President Subianto will arrive in Islamabad and will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
“This will be President Prabowo’s first visit to Pakistan. The last presidential visit from Indonesia was undertaken by President Joko Widodo in 2018,” the statement said, adding that the upcoming visit carries added significance as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
During his stay, the statement said, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on President Prabowo, it added.
“The two sides will discuss a wide-ranging agenda aimed at further strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia relations and exploring new avenues of cooperation, including trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels.”
The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
It further stated: “Pakistan and Indonesia enjoy close, cordial and long-standing relations, underpinned by shared values and mutual interests. The visit of President Prabowo will provide an important opportunity to deepen bilateral ties and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, contributing to the continued growth and diversification of the partnership between the two countries.”</p><small>2025-12-07 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071134437eb7af5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959738/equipment-weapons-left-behind-by-us-in-afghanistan-now-form-core-of-talibans-security-apparatus-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Equipment, weapons left behind by US in Afghanistan now form core of Taliban’s security apparatus: watchdog</strong></a><br><p>A final report by a US watchdog has confirmed that billions of dollars’ worth of American-supplied weapons, military equipment, and security infrastructure left behind during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan now form the backbone of the Taliban’s security apparatus.
Parallel findings from UN monitoring teams and a Washington Post investigation indicate that some of these weapons have already filtered to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
The 137-page report, released this week by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), recounts the scale of the two-decade American project to rebuild Afghanistan. Congress, it notes, provided roughly $144.7 billion between 2002 and 2021 to reconstruct the country and to support a democratic transition — “yet ultimately delivered neither.”
Recent UN assessments reinforce the regional implications of that failure. A UN panel reported that the Afghan Taliban continue providing logistical and operational support to the TTP, while the Washington Post has documented that dozens of US-origin weapons are now surfacing in Pakistan in the hands of terrorists targeting the state.

 

SIGAR attributes part of this spillover to the abrupt loss of visibility after the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Due to the Taliban takeover, SIGAR was unable to inspect any of the equipment provided to, or facilities constructed for, the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) following the Afghan government’s collapse,” the report states.
The US Department of Defence, however, has confirmed that approximately $7.1bn worth of American-provided equipment was left behind — including thousands of vehicles, hundreds of thousands of small arms, night-vision devices and more than 160 aircraft.
The consequences of this transfer are already manifesting in Pakistan.
According to the Washington Post, serial numbers of at least 63 seized weapons inside Pakistan match those originally supplied by Washington to Afghan forces. The Washington Post report cited Pakistani officials as saying that some of these rifles and carbines are “significantly superior” to the weaponry commonly used by TTP fighters before 2021.
UN monitoring reports echo this concern. The 36th Monitoring Report (2025) estimates that the TTP maintains a force of around 6,000 fighters spread across Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces of Afghanistan, and shares training facilities with Al Qaeda.
Addressing the UN Security Council, Denmark’s deputy permanent representative Sandra Jensen Landi said the TTP continues to receive “logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities” in Kabul.
Earlier UN reports detailed Taliban-provided guesthouses, weapons permits, movement authorisations, and immunity from arrest for TTP leaders — arrangements that have allowed the group to entrench itself deeper in Afghan territory. SIGAR’s own quarterly reports for 2025 cite a string of cross-border attacks, including an assault in South Waziristan that killed 16 Pakistani security personnel.
SIGAR’s final review also revisits the scale — and the futility — of US investment in Afghanistan’s security sector. Between 2002 and June 2025, Washington obligated $31.2bn for ANDSF infrastructure, transportation, and equipment. The US purchased 96,000 ground vehicles, more than 427,000 weapons, 17,400 night-vision devices, and at least 162 aircraft for Afghan forces. As of July 2021, just before the then-Afghan government collapsed, the Afghan Air Force still had 131 operational US-supplied aircraft — virtually all of which are now under Taliban control, according to the report.
Another $11.5bn funded construction of bases, headquarters, and training facilities across Afghanistan, most of which are now either controlled by the Taliban or completely inaccessible to US inspectors, it says.
The report concludes that America’s ambition to build a stable and democratic Afghanistan was hamstrung from the outset by flawed assumptions and misaligned partnerships. Early US decisions to back “corrupt, human-rights-abusing powerbrokers,” SIGAR argues, undermined governance, fuelled insurgent recruitment, and gradually hollowed out the institutions the US was trying to build. The watchdog estimates that $26–29.2bn was lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.
The human cost was far greater. Tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 2,450 US service members were killed, only for the Taliban regime to be restored — and now strengthened by the very equipment the US spent years procuring for its adversaries, it adds.
Despite the collapse, the United States has remained Afghanistan’s single largest donor, having disbursed more than $3.83 billion in humanitarian and development assistance since August 2021 — underscoring Washington’s continued struggle to balance humanitarian obligations with security fears.
As SIGAR ends its mandate after nearly two decades, the final report offers a sobering warning. The Afghanistan experience, it concludes, should serve as a cautionary tale for any future effort to rebuild fragile states on a massive scale — a failure whose ripple effects are now reshaping the security landscape of the wider region.</p><small>2025-12-07 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6934cbb224028.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959683/rupee-to-break-rs280-barrier-against-dollar' target='_blank'><strong>Rupee to break Rs280 barrier against dollar</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Though the rupee has been appreciating against the dollar in what dealers describe as a managed way, the market expects the local currency to break the Rs280 barrier by the end of this month.
At the same time, market players believe it will be difficult for the State Bank to engineer a weaker rupee to boost exports, arguing that past experiences of devaluation failed to deliver a sustained increase in export volumes.
Some currency experts said the scope for further devaluation to support exports was limited, particularly as the US dollar itself has come under pressure against major global currencies.
“There is no mathematical calculation behind this expectation that the dollar may slip below Rs280 by the end of this month. It is the market sentiment and it happens at the end of the year,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He believes the dollar will slip below Rs280 only for a brief period.

Experts warn against devaluation, say past episodes failed to increase exports

Other experts said dollar demand would remain steady but sentiment had improved after a $3 billion rollover from Saudi Arabia, which they expect to support the rupee.
“If anything, the risk right now is that the rupee may trade below 280 per dollar, which could destabilise export-based industries, whereas a mild depreciation would be the right way forward,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
During the current fiscal year, the rupee has appreciated gradually, with more noticeable gains since July 31, when the dollar hit its peak for the year. On July 31, the dollar was traded at Rs284.27, compared to Rs280.42 on the last trading day of the outgoing week.

 

One dealer noted that the US dollar has already lost about 12 per cent against major international currencies, arguing that the rupee had effectively helped the dollar remain relatively strong and stable in the local market.
Exports, however, have been declining. They fell 15.4pc in November, swelling the trade deficit for the first five months of FY26 to $37.2bn and putting pressure on the current account.
The market has been rife with speculation that the government is under pressure to devalue the rupee to support exporters, but the currency’s gradual appreciation has dismissed such perceptions.
“Yes, the calls for a weaker rupee have grown louder. You hear the usual arguments: global demand is soft, INR (the Indian rupee) drifting towards 90 per dollar, exporters cannot price orders due to high costs, and a correction will magically ‘fix competitiveness’,” Mr Mamsa said.
The rupee had collapsed from 180 to 300 against the dollar in just two years — one of the sharpest devaluations in the region. But there was no meaningful export boom, no import compression beyond what the SBP manually enforced and no structural improvement.
“A few publications this week are again glorifying REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) and implying that a weaker rupee is somehow ‘necessary’. It’s a familiar narrative: REER goes above 100, currency is ‘overvalued’, therefore devalue it. It’s an incomplete way to look at a modern FX (foreign exchange) market,” Mr Mamsa said.
Currency experts also pointed out that the IMF has not treated REER as a primary barometer for the exchange rate since 2018, but exporters continue to exert political pressure for devaluation to shore up margins.

Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the officials were involved “in the oppression of women and girls and in undermining good governance or the rule of law” in Afghanistan.
Australia was one of several nations which pulled troops out of Afghanistan in Aug 2021, after being part of a Nato-led international force that trained Afghan security forces and fought the Taliban for two decades after Western-backed forces ousted them from power in 2001.
The Taliban, since regaining power in Afghanistan, have been criticised for deeply restricting the rights and freedom of women and girls through bans on education and work.
The Taliban government says it respects women’s rights, in line with its interpretation of Islamic law and local custom.
Wong, the Australian foreign minister, said in a statement the sanctions targeted three Taliban ministers and the chief justice, accusing them of restricting access for girls and women “to education, employment, freedom of movement and the ability to participate in public life”.
The measures were part of a new Australian government framework that enabled it to “directly impose its own sanctions and travel bans to increase pressure on the Taliban, targeting the oppression of the Afghan people”, Wong said.
Australia took in thousands of evacuees, mostly women and children, from Afghanistan after the Taliban retook power in the country, where much of the population now relies on humanitarian aid to survive.

Judicial Magistrate Mohammad Abbas Shah issued a written order declaring all three accused as absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants. 
The order states that the accused were repeatedly summoned but failed to appear before the court.
According to the written order, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has completed and submitted challans in the respective cases. The FIRs against the three were registered in July and August 2025 under relevant cybercrime and related offences.
The court has instructed that the permanent arrest warrants be executed in accordance with the law to ensure the accused are brought before the court to face trial.
