<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15130853fb89642.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973374/iran-says-potential-energy-mining-and-aircraft-deals-on-table-in-talks-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says potential energy, mining and aircraft deals on table in talks with US</strong></a><br><p>Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the United States that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
“For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the US also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
Iran has threatened retaliation against any US attack, but the official struck a conciliatory note on Sunday.
“Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured US economic interests.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement.
“No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we’re going to try,” Rubio said.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a US delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday.
“Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be travelling, I think they are travelling right now, to have important meetings and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without providing further details.
While talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.
Open to compromise
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signalled Iran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal”.
The senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief’s statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran’s flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.
In June, the US joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites. The US is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran.
At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the US would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80 per cent of Iran’s oil exports, so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran’s oil revenue.</p><small>2026-02-15 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15175003905c848.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973389/shaukat-khanum-hospital-dismisses-claims-over-noc-withdrawal-for-karachi-fundraising-event' target='_blank'><strong>Shaukat Khanum Hospital dismisses claims over NOC withdrawal for Karachi fundraising event</strong></a><br><p>The Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital on Sunday dismissed social media claims regarding the withdrawal of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for a fundraising event for its Karachi facility, clarifying that the purported notification being circulated dates back to December 2023.
Several reports emerged on social media and television platforms claiming that the NOC issued by Islamabad’s administration related to holding a fundraising ceremony for the under-construction SKMCH in Karachi had been withdrawn.







SKMCH issued a formal clarification regarding the purported development, saying, “The news currently circulating on social media about the withdrawal of a NOC by the Islamabad administration is from December 2023.”
“It relates to a fundraising gala dinner planned in Islamabad for December 29, 2023, in support of Shaukat Khanum Hospital Karachi,” it added.
It said that fundraising and construction had continued without interruption since then.
“The Karachi hospital remains on track for opening in December 2026.”
We appreciate the concern shown by our supporters on this matter and would like to assure you that our mission to fight cancer continues with your trust and generosity, it said.
Earlier, the SKMCH administration had said that “approximately 70 per cent” of the nuclear medicine facility had been completed, with the remaining work on track.







The SKMCH and research centres already exist in Lahore and Peshawar. The facilities were established with the aim of providing quality cancer care to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay. Thousands of deser­ving patients have been receiving free treatment every day at these hospitals.</p><small>2026-02-15 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1518311533c8d81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973372/medical-team-leaves-adiala-jail-after-examining-imran-khan-pti-rejects-inspection' target='_blank'><strong>Medical team leaves Adiala Jail after examining Imran Khan, PTI rejects inspection</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors examined PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Sunday and left the premises after around an hour, sources said, as the party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon.
At 3:45pm, however, Imran’s sister Noreen Khanum said on X that an “ambulance has reached Adiala jail to move Khan sahib to a hospital”.







“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib’s personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she added.
According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet.
“The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources.
At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said.
“Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours.
They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”.
“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X.







“This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family.
“And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.”
Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice
Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors.
Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi.

 

“Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”
The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.”
She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors.
“Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered.







Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement, reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.
“In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement.








‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’
Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday.
The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said.
Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House.







A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined.
“Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot.
“[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said.
He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked.
Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon.
He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities.







In a statement, TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”.
“This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added.
The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”.
“Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read.
The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.”
The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”.
The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”.







TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai told Dawn that it has been decided to continue the sit-in till the fulfilment of the demands.
He termed it unfortunate that the police were allegedly not allowing breakfast to be delivered inside Parliament House for the opposition leaders.
“There are a number of leaders who have diabetes, and it becomes difficult for them to maintain their sugar levels. I fear that some may faint,” he said.
He wondered why the government was not showing flexibility and taking confidence-building measures if it was serious.
HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid.
In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”.
“Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed.
It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.”







Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history.
“Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.”
However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”.
“Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.

According to a police statement, a group of terrorists attacked the police station using both light and heavy weapons. They added that personnel deployed at the station quickly acted and repelled the assault.
“The police personnel successfully foiled the overnight attack of militants at the War Mamund station, but Additional SHO Gul Mahmood Din was martyred after fighting bravely,” said a senior police official who visited the area on Sunday morning with his team.
The official told Dawn that all the other station personnel were safe and secure following the attack.
Attacks on police personnel, law enforcement agencies, and security forces have escalated across KP and Balochistan, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022.
Earlier this week, at least four policemen, including an SHO, were martyred as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area in Dera Ismail Khan, police said.
According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. Militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire.
Four policemen were martyred in the attack, and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire.
1 killed, 8 injured as mortar shell explodes
Separately, in the Kardok area of Bajaur’s Salarzai tehsil, an unexploded mortar shell detonated on Sunday afternoon, killing a child and injuring eight other people, including a woman.
According to initial reports and rescue sources, eight children and one woman were injured in the incident and were moved to Khar Hospital for medical treatment.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Riaz Ahmed Khan told Dawn that one of the children succumbed to their injuries, while four of the injured were referred to a Peshawar hospital for “advanced treatment”.
Preliminary information suggested that the children found an unexploded mortar shell and brought it home. The shell later exploded, injuring nine people at the house.
An initial investigation indicated that the incident was accidental in nature, but an investigation was launched. Local administration and security agencies cordoned off the area and began collecting evidence.
Last September, at least four teenagers were killed, and two other people were injured when a mortar shell exploded in a field in Bajaur, according to police officials.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq told Dawn about the incident and said that the dead and injured were transported to Khar Hospital.
“Initial reports suggest that a mortar shell exploded in the field, killing the young men,” he said, adding that the deceased ranged in age between 13 and 18.</p><small>2026-02-15 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1514164292b677c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973377/west-indies-beat-nepal-to-become-first-team-into-t20-world-cup-super-eights' target='_blank'><strong>West Indies beat Nepal to become first team into T20 World Cup Super Eights</strong></a><br><p>The West Indies became the first team to qualify for the Super Eights phase of the T20 World Cup when they cruised to victory against Nepal by nine wickets on Sunday.
After restricting Nepal to 133-8 in their 20 overs, captain Shai Hope’s 61 not out helped his team romp to 134-1 in 15.2 overs in the Group C clash at Mumbai’s Wankhede stadium.
Hope reached his fifty off 38 balls and scored three sixes and five fours in all.







He put on an unbroken 91 with Shimron Hetmyer to reach the 134 target with 28 balls to spare.
Hetmyer was 46 not out at the end from 32 balls, with two sixes and four fours.
Hope said the qualification was “one step, one hurdle that we’ve crossed”.
“Good to contribute to wins,” he added of his own batting, after scores of 19 and nought in his side’s two previous matches at the tournament.







“It’s about continuing how we’ve been playing. Hopefully, we can carry through that.”
Hope won the toss and chose to field and his decision was justified by a magnificent spell by Matthew Forde.
The Nepal batsmen found it almost impossible to score off him as Forde took 1-10 from four overs, and bagged the prize wicket of Nepal captain Rohit Paudel for five.
“You must give him credit, he’s been hitting his areas,” Hope said of Forde. “He really exploits the movement.”
Nepal were in all sorts of trouble at 22-3 at the end of the six-over power play, then 23-4 and 46-5 as Jason Holder also got among the wickets.
It was only Dipendra Singh Airee’s 58 that pushed Nepal past the 100 mark as he shared in a partnership of 54 for the seventh wicket with Sompal Kami, who was there at the end unbeaten on 26.
“I am glad that I got an opportunity to decide what we wanted to do,” Hope said of winning the toss.
“We wanted to limit the flow of runs and keep taking wickets.”
Holder took 4-27 from his four overs and was named player of the match.
“I thought the ball did a little bit more. Probably held in the surface a little bit more up front,” Holder said.
“It became a little bit more difficult to hit through the line of the ball.
We were able to get a little bit of movement as well, too, which was key.
“I thought our bowlers bowled a really tight line.”







The result eliminates Nepal after three defeats. Their final group match is against Scotland in Mumbai on Tuesday.
The West Indies’ final group game will be against Italy in Kolkata on Thursday.
The Caribbean side will then return to Mumbai for their first Super Eights match on February 23, with their opponents still to be decided.</p><small>2026-02-15 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15162419393299a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973385/israeli-strikes-kill-12-in-gaza-since-dawn-civil-defence' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza since dawn: civil defence</strong></a><br><p>Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people since dawn on Sunday, while a military official said the attacks were in response to ceasefire violations.
Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.
Five people were killed and several were injured when an air strike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.
Five more were killed and several were injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the agency said, adding that one more was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City.
The agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in north Gaza.
The Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed they had received the bodies of at least seven people.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
He said the people killed there were hit as they slept.
“We’ve been living under a truce for months, and they’ve still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle — saying one thing and doing another,” Askar told AFP.
Funeral prayers
Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds. Men and women stood in prayer ahead of the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound.
A military official said Israeli forces attacked in response to Hamas violating the ceasefire agreement.
“The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who took cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF (Israeli military) troops, likely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area,” the official said.
“Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed, is an explicit ceasefire violation, and demonstrates how Hamas systematically violates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops,” the official added.
Under the terms of the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-called “Yellow Line”, although they remain in control of more than half of the Palestinian territory.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem, in a statement on Sunday, accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire.
“Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement,” Qassem said.
Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 601 people have been killed since the truce began. The Israeli military says at least four of its soldiers have been killed in the same period.
Media restrictions and limited access to Gaza have prevented AFP and other news organisations from independently verifying casualty figures or freely covering the fighting.</p><small>2026-02-15 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/151037366d7c021.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973369/11-killed-8-injured-in-bus-trailer-collision-on-national-highway-in-khairpur-motorway-police' target='_blank'><strong>11 killed, 8 injured in bus-trailer collision on National Highway in Khairpur: motorway police</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: At least 11 people were killed and eight were injured after a bus collided with a trailer on the National Highway near Tando Masti in Sindh’s Khairpur district on Sunday, motorway police said.
As per a statement issued by National Highways & Motorway Police (NHMP), “11 people have died so far, while another eight remain injured in a collision between a bus and a trailer on the National Highway near Tando Masti”.
The bus was heading from Bahawalpur to Karachi.
In an earlier statement, the motorway police said the accident occurred due to “negligence and recklessness on the bus driver’s part”.
“Rescue teams and motorway police immediately reached the site of the incident,” the statement said, adding that the bodies and injured were rushed to nearby hospitals.
The NHMP inspector general (IG) has taken notice of the incident and sought a report on it, the statement said.
“The motorway police are continuing to restore traffic and clear the road,” the NHMP said.
It added that an emergency control room had also been established, which can be contacted at 0719310878 and 0243640800.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed sorrow at the incident and prayed for the deceased, state broadcaster PTV reported.







The president directed the Sindh government to provide the injured with “the best facilities”, adding that he was in contact with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
“Every possible effort should be made to prevent such tragic incidents,” the president was quoted as saying. He called for a “coordinated strategy” to ensure implementation of traffic rules on national highways.
CM Murad and Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori also offered condolences to the families of the deceased.
CM Sindh directed officials to ensure strict implementation of traffic laws, according to a statement issued via his spokesperson.
The accident comes a few days after 13 people were killed in a traffic accident involving an oil tanker and a passenger bus on the M9 Motorway near Karachi.
In September 2025, at least seven members of a single family, including three women and two children, were killed when a truck crashed into their car on a national highway near Moro.</p><small>2026-02-15 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1513522968a0199.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973375/pm-shehbaz-undertakes-2-day-visit-to-austria' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz undertakes 2-day visit to Austria</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday left for Austria on a two-day official visit, where the premier is expected to hold bilateral and delegation-level meetings.
The government’s official X account shared a video earlier in the day of the premier and his delegation departing for Vienna from PAF Base Lahore.
In its statement, the Foreign Office (FO) noted that the trip marked “the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria in over three decades, the last having been undertaken by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1992”.
PM Shehbaz is undertaking the visit at the invitation of Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker.
The two leaders will hold bilateral meetings at the Federal Chancellery in Vienna and “co-chair a meeting of prominent business leaders aimed at enhancing the volume of investment between the two countries”, the government post said.







“The prime minister’s official visit to Austria will add new dimensions to the bilateral relations between the two countries,” the statement added.
The premier will also attend and address the Pakistan-Austria Business Forum, which will be organised by the Austrian Economic Chamber (WKO).
Additionally, during the two-day visit, PM Shehbaz is also expected to meet International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.
In September 2025, Grossi acknowledged the country’s steady progress and close cooperation with the agency, observing that Pakis­tan’s nuclear power programme was advancing “at a good pace”.
PM Shehbaz will also address a United Nations event on the theme of “Sustainable Development: The Path to Global Peace and Prosperity.”
He is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi.
The visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the FO noted in its press release.







It added that the two leaders “will take stock of the entire gamut of bilateral relations”.
“Pakistan and Austria enjoy cordial and friendly relations, underpinned by shared values of dialogue, cooperation, an international order based on the principles of the UN Charter, multilateralism, and respect for international law,” FO said.</p><small>2026-02-15 11:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15122752501c74c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973373/cm-maryam-wants-grooming-of-punjab-police-to-deal-with-citizens-respectfully' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam wants ‘grooming’ of Punjab Police to deal with citizens respectfully</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Sunday issued directions to the Punjab Police to ensure “grooming” of their personnel as part of police reforms, warning them against violating the “dignity of common people”.
In a high-level televised meeting, the chief minister directed Punjab Inspector General (IG) Abdul Kareem to “groom” the police staff, citing complaints of “intimidating behaviour” exhibited by Punjab Police.
“Teach them how to talk to people, and groom them mentally as well,” CM Maryam stressed, warning that the police officials would “not be permitted to interact with people if they refuse to address them as sir or sahib”.
“Police staff that patrol or interact with the public should directly teach them the appropriate body language,” she directed.







The chief minister noted that police in Punjab often addressed people in public spaces with “oye”, rather than speaking to them respectfully.
“Do not violate the dignity of the public,” CM Maryam stressed.
She further underscored the “need for accountability and unlearning harmful attitudes”.
“Do not deny your wrongdoing,” she said, but “take accountability and work towards rectifying the error”.
“We are here to serve people, not threaten and intimidate them,” she remarked, adding that the monthly evaluations would be conducted for each police officer.
“Whoever is coming to us should be treated in a dignified manner,” she emphasised, issuing strict directions to register complaints immediately when they are reported and to wear body cameras while on duty.







On February 12, in a meeting at the Central Police Officer, newly-appointed IG Kareem reviewed the implementation of reform measures in Punjab Police under the ‘Fast, Fearless, Transparent Justice’ initiative.
During the meeting, it was decided that all Punjab Police and traffic personnel will be provided with body cameras in phases within the next two months.
The Punjab IG said that “panic buttons” were being installed outside police stations so that citizens could immediately lodge complaints in case of any misconduct or lack of hearing.
He also directed that at all police stations, offices, checkpoints and Khidmat Marakaz, citizens should be addressed respectfully as “sir or madam” and “sahib or sahiba”.
He said that counselling and training of officers and personnel would be arranged to improve the overall perception of Punjab Police’s conduct.</p><small>2026-02-15 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1514475183673d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973380/india-plans-ai-data-city-on-staggering-scale-in-andhra-pradesh' target='_blank'><strong>India plans AI ‘data city’ on staggering scale in Andhra Pradesh</strong></a><br><p>As India races to narrow the artificial intelligence gap with the United States and China, it is planning a vast new “data city” to power digital growth on a staggering scale, the man spearheading the project says.
“The AI revolution is here, no second thoughts about it,” said Nara Lokesh, information technology minister for Andhra Pradesh state, which is positioning the city of Visakhapatnam as a cornerstone of India’s AI push.
“And as a nation… we have taken a stand that we’ve got to embrace it,” he told AFP ahead of an international AI summit next week in New Delhi.
Lokesh boasts the state has secured investment agreements of $175 billion involving 760 projects, including a $15bn investment by Google for its largest AI infrastructure hub outside the United States.
And a joint venture between India’s Reliance Industries, Canada’s Brookfield and US firm Digital Realty is investing $11bn to develop an AI data centre in the same city.
Visakhapatnam — home to around two million people and popularly known as “Vizag” — is better known for its cricket ground that hosts international matches than cutting-edge technology.
But the southeastern port city is now being pitched as a landing point for submarine internet cables linking India to Singapore.
“The data city is going to come in one ecosystem… with a 100 kilometre radius,” Lokesh said. For comparison, Taiwan is roughly 100km wide.
‘Whole nine yards’
Lokesh said the plan goes far beyond data connectivity, adding that his state had “received close to 25 per cent of all foreign direct investments” in India in 2025.
“It’s not just about the data centres,” he explained while outlining a sweeping vision of change, with Andhra Pradesh offering land at one US cent per acre (three per hectare) for major investors.
“I’m chasing the companies that make those servers that go sit in those data centres, the companies that make the entire air conditioning, the water-cooling system — the whole nine yards.”
The 43-year-old, Stanford-educated minister is the son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, who helped turn Hyderabad into a major technology hub that is dubbed “Cyberabad”.
They are allies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will host the AI Impact Summit from Monday.
India is now third in a global AI power ranking — sitting above South Korea and Japan — based on more than 40 indicators from patents to private funding calculated by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centred AI.
With more than a billion internet users, India has seen a surge of investment as generative AI players seek inroads to the world’s most populous country.
Microsoft said in December it will invest $17.5bn to help build the country’s artificial intelligence infrastructure, with CEO Satya Nadella calling it the firm’s “largest investment ever in Asia”.
But critics say India lags in access to high-end computing power or commercial AI deployment, and remains more a consumer than creator of the cutting-edge technology.
Some question whether data centres will create meaningful employment when up and running, but Lokesh rejects that.
“Every industrial revolution has always created more jobs than it has displaced,” he said.
“But it has created those jobs in countries that have embraced the industrial revolution.”
‘Learned from China’
Lokesh argues that the jobs and economic benefits would more than compensate for the giveaway cost of land.
He said the state government had accounted for the vast electricity and water demands for the energy-hungry industry, and would tap “surplus water” that drains into the Bay of Bengal to cool the massive data centres.
“It’s a crime that so much water during monsoons goes into our oceans,” he said.
He cited China as an inspiration — admiring how India’s rival had “been able to systematically bring people out of poverty” at speed.
The state’s plan to create industrial clusters was something he had “learned from China”.
With a target of six gigawatts of data centre capacity — three already signed and another three in the pipeline — Andhra Pradesh is betting that speed and scale will give it an edge.
New Delhi last year agreed to “in-principle approval” for six 1.2 GW nuclear power plants at Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh.
“We are on a journey,” Lokesh said. “We will execute these projects at a pace that the country has never seen”.</p><small>2026-02-15 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/151115333d8db42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973370/obama-deplores-lack-of-shame-after-trumps-racist-monkey-clip' target='_blank'><strong>Obama deplores lack of shame after Trump’s racist monkey clip</strong></a><br><p>Former US president Barack Obama criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding on Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys.
In a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama also compared the actions of agents enforcing the president’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to dictatorships.
The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.
Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history — were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.
“The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before…Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” Cohen said in the interview.
“And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?”
Without naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans “find this behaviour deeply troubling”.
“There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.”



‘Rogue behaviour’
Obama predicted that such messaging would hurt Trump’s Republicans in midterm elections, saying, “ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people”.
Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.
Turning to Trump’s policies, Obama criticised his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week.
Obama called the behaviour of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump’s mass crackdown, as the sort that “in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships”.
Thousands of federal agents — including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals.
“The rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,” Obama said.
But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.
“Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way, citizens saying, ‘this is not the America we believe in,’ and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,” he said.
“That kind of heroic, sustained behaviour in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope.
“As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.”
The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.</p><small>2026-02-15 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1509504163a1f85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973366/cdf-munir-discusses-global-and-regional-security-dynamics-with-uss-rubio-in-germany' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir discusses ‘global and regional security dynamics’ with US’s Rubio in Germany</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has discussed “global and regional security dynamics” with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Sunday.
CDF Munir undertook a visit to Germany from February 12 (Thursday) to 14 (Saturday) to attend meetings on the sidelines of the 62nd Munich Security Conference, according to the military’s media affairs wing.
In a press release, ISPR said the army chief met with Rubio and “discussed matters of mutual interest, including global and regional security dynamics and counterterrorism cooperation”.
During his visit, Field Marshal Munir interacted with a number of dignitaries.
These included Germany’s Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, Foreign Policy & Security Policy Adviser to Federal Chancellor of Germany Günter Sautter, and Chief of Defence Carsten Breuer.
“The meetings focused on contemporary security issues, bilateral defence cooperation and the need for promoting global peace and security through bilateral and multilateral dialogue,” ISPR noted.
CDF Munir also held a “productive engagement” with Brazilian Armed Forces Chief of the Joint Staff Admiral Renato Rodrigues de Aguiar Freire, the statement added. The two discussed bilateral military cooperation.
Lebanese Armed Forces Commander Gen Rodolph Haykal also called on Field Marshal Munir. Both leaders discussed “global and regional security situation and measures to enhance bilateral defence collaboration”, according to ISPR.

• Industrial investment in Karachi remains weak; investors shifting to Nooriabad, Jhampir
KARACHI: Property prices in Karachi have increased over the past two years, but the gains have lagged behind the unexpected returns in equities and gold.
Investors have been drawn to bullion amid global uncertainty, including market swings linked to US President Donald Trump’s shifting stance on tariffs and threats of military action against various countries.
Pakistan’s stock market has also posted strong gains over the past two years, repeatedly setting new highs amid political and economic developments, lower interest rates and investor reluctance to hold US dollars.
One tola gold on Jan 1, 2024, was available at Rs219,700 as compared to the current price of Rs526,962 on Saturday, reversing from a record peak of Rs572,862 on Jan 29, 2026.
On Feb 13, the KSE-100 Index closed at 179,603.73 points, almost three times higher than its level of 64,661.78 points on Jan 1, 2024.
Muhammad Shafi Jhakvani, vice president of the Defence and Clifton Association of Real Estate Agents (DEFCLAREA), said the prices of DHA and Clifton residential plots have increased by 25-50 per cent in different blocks and phases in the last two years followed by 25-75pc in commercial plots.
Apartment prices have risen by 10-40pc. For example, the price of a three-bedroom apartment in a good vicinity of Clifton like Bath Island and Civil Lines, which was available at Rs 55-60 million in 2023-24, have now touched Rs75-80m and even higher in some projects.
Similarly in DHA, the 1,500 square feet apartment’s price was Rs20,000 per sq ft (Rs30-32m), and is now around Rs28,000-30,000 per sq ft (Rs40-45m).
The prices of 500- and 1000-square-yard bungalows have also gone up by 10-25pc. Normally in Pakistan and in Karachi, rental returns are 0.25pc per month and 3-4pc per annum. In residential properties, it also increases according to price hike and in some smaller units, it rises more than that because of shortage of rental inventories, he said.
“Bungalow rent also soars according to rising prices but portions are in high demand because of again shortage of inventory,” Mr Shafi said.
He said investors are active in Clifton commercial plots as big plots and prices have become costlier drastically in the last two years. In DHA Phase 8, the price has surged as investors have been very active since 2024.
He expected new benchmarks in 2026, particularly in Phase 8 for both residential and commercial properties.
Abdul Wahab Parekh, owner of Parekh Estate, said new 500-yard and 1,000-yard bungalows were increasingly being built as ground-plus-one units, often with swimming pools in the basement. A 500-yard ground-plus-one bungalow now costs Rs100-250m, depending on location, compared with Rs80-160m two years ago.
A 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalow in DHA cost Rs130-450m, depending on the phase, compared with Rs110-350m two years ago, he said. Flat prices in various DHA phases were now around Rs20,000-35,000 per square foot compared to Rs15,000-20,000 two years ago.

 

In Clifton, he said, a three-bedroom apartment (old or new) cost Rs25-50m, compared with Rs20-40m previously.
Mr Parekh said commercial plot prices had also increased. In PECHS and on Sharea Faisal (left side towards the airport), commercial plots were priced at Rs1.5-2m per square yard, compared with Rs1-1.2m earlier. On the right side, they ranged from Rs1m to Rs1.5m compared to Rs700,000 to Rs1.2m.
On Shaheed-i-Millat Road, he said, commercial plots were around Rs1.5m per square yard, up from Rs800,000 to Rs1m two years ago. He described I.I. Chundrigar Road as a slow market, with rates pegged at Rs400,000 per square foot.
On the industrial side, Mr Parekh said no major new investment had arrived in Karachi in the last 50 years, with many owners dividing premises and land for non-industrial uses.
Investors were shifting towards Nooriabad and Jhampir due to lower rates, he said, adding that 60-70pc of land along the Super Highway was “risky and controversial”.
Mohammad Najeeb, a member of the Supreme Council of the North Nazimabad Association of Real Estate Agents (NNAREA), said the price of a 240-yard ground-plus-one house had remained more or less unchanged at Rs55-65m over the past two years, while a 400-yard ground-plus-one bungalow had risen to Rs60-70m from Rs45-50m.
He said 600-yard ground-plus-one bungalows remained in the Rs70-100m range, while 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalows cost Rs180-200m, up from Rs140-150m two years ago.
In North Nazimabad, he said, an old two-bedroom flat without a lift, generator or parking cost Rs5-7m. New flats with facilities were priced at Rs15-17.5m, up from just over Rs10m.
Old three-bedroom flats were priced at Rs10-12.5m, up from Rs8-9m, while new three-bedroom units with facilities were priced at Rs17.5-35m, compared with Rs15-20m two years ago.

The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere.
Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates.

 

This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the elections and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now.
“We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.”
Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament.
The rise of political Islam
The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam.
Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results.
“The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.”
“While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added.
“What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.”
On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.”
Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.”
He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.”
Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.”
Dr Mohammad Imran Hossain, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy.
“In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” the executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Development and Security Studies said.
“A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.”
Prof. Imran cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.”
Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.”
He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.”
Observations from Washington
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote.
The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.

He was addressing party ticket-holders, office-bearers and workers at Jamaldinwali, 40km from here, on Saturday night.
Without naming PTI leader Imran Khan, the president said they had already started complaining about condition in jail hardly after 18-month detention.

 

“Sometimes they say they have pain in their eyes. Some other time they complain there is no milk.”
He said such a leader could not make sacrifices and lacked courage.
Zardari said he himself spent 14 years in jail, endured hardships but never lost courage.
“Jail is a place for worship, and prayers of those who worship are answered.”
He advised political workers that they should not fear arrests. He pledged that he would work to build and improve Pakistan and would not step down until his mission was fulfilled.
Zardari predicted that one day the Pakistan People’s Party would win with a two-third majority and make Bilawal prime minister.







About privatisation, he said: “The country belongs to people and that national assets should not be sold.”
The president landed at the Shaikh Zayed airport in the afternoon and left for Jamaldinwali, the native area of PPP South Punjab leader Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood, where he will stay for two more days.

But Fukuyama completely ignored the sheer stubbornness of a dead idea. Failed ideologies do not simply pack up and leave. Instead, they enter what the Australian economist John Quiggin calls a “zombie state.” Most become a set of hollow rituals and rhetoric, cut off from reality. 
To visualise this phenomenon, one might look at a modern day Labour Day rally. In these, speakers often rely on ‘zombie rhetoric’, reciting slogans from the early and mid-20th century that no longer align with current reality. For example, this disconnect is evident in the way the once-subversive poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Habib Jalib has been stripped of its sting and reduced to a mere aesthetic. Picture a Faiz couplet used as a caption for an Instagram post featuring a latte, or a Jalib quote slapped on to a tote bag. This was bound to happen.
This is ‘zombie socialism.’ A middle-class favourite. It is no longer about the proletariat or the actual redistribution of wealth, but has become a convenient ‘anti-imperialist’ or ‘anti-colonial’ cloak, used to hide the fact that those draped in it have run out of original ideas. They scurry around digital echo chambers as if attending a fancy dress party, wearing the masks of Marx, Mao, Che or Lenin. Social media serves as their primary playground, where they flaunt a zombie ideology for ‘likes’.

Failed ideologies often enter a “zombie state”, becoming a set of hollow rituals and rhetoric, cut off from reality. But persistent political anxieties express themselves in this void with monsters of their times

So, a zombie ideology is a set of political beliefs proven ineffective by reality but continuing to aimlessly walk the earth. These ideas have been intellectually decapitated by the failure of their predictions, whether it is the promise of trickle-down prosperity or the utopian dream of a worker-led paradise. Or for that matter, the creation of ‘Riyasat-i-Madina.’
Yet, these ideologies refuse to stay in the ground. They persist not because they offer solutions to contemporary crises but due to inertia and muscle memory. Their followers are now just going through the motions, albeit in a theatrical manner. They also use these ideologies to project an image/perception of themselves. 
Liberals are no different in this regard. They too are manifesting a zombie ideology and system in which people are simply emoting rather than voting for substance. They engage in a perpetual performance of outrage and tribal loyalty. As the Irish political scientist Peter Mair argued in Ruling the Void, political parties do not represent social groups anymore but, instead, act as marketing agencies in a hollowed-out democracy.
The American media theorist Neil Postman posited that voters no longer judge candidates on policy but on the images and emotions they project, turning democracy into a branch of the aesthetics industry. In this environment, political discourse is replaced by the grammar of electronic and social media, where a candidate’s perceived image matters more than their platform. 
This is ‘zombie democracy.’ It is a primary driver of global democratic ‘backsliding’, because it creates a vacuum in which democracy’s form remains but the substance has withered. Voters are engaging with politics just as a consumer engages with a commercial brand, selecting leaders based on the lifestyle or identity they represent rather than their ability to govern. The result is a political exercise that looks democratic but is intellectually hollow, driven by optics and carefully curated stagecraft. A ‘democracy’ in which populists thrive. 
On the right, the 2013 fall of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt provided a grim punchline to decades of grandstanding by ‘Islamists’. As American political scientist Shadi Hamid noted, ‘Islamism’ has since shuffled into a zombie state. Islamists, both mainstream and militant, are still haunting politics with the dusty slogans and moth-eaten symbols of the second half of the 20th century. Think Qutb, think Maududi. 



 
Today, if you ask Islamists for a coherent plan for modern governance or a functioning economic policy, you will get nothing but vacant stares. They are, as Turkish scholar Sümeyye Sakarya puts it, “walking but not thinking.” But some still like to explode, though. 
Contemporary right-wing ideologies such as fascism, Islamism, right-wing Zionism, and Hindu and Christian nationalism have all become increasingly clumsy, aggressive and perpetually hungry for a past that never actually existed. They are zombies in the truest sense, having ditched complex state-building theories in favour of a much simpler diet of pure, unadulterated grievance and resentment. Unlike their old-school predecessors, who at least had the stamina to draft some theocratic pathways, these contemporary ghouls have replaced intellectual substance with primal knee-jerk reactions.
They do not offer a map for the future. They just twitch and shout every time a cultural nerve is poked. This cycle goes back and forth between the left and the right, the liberal and the anti-liberal, the woke and the anti-woke. These are all energetic performances designed to mask a total lack of a governing brain. These performers wander around like a B-movie monster that can only react to the latest outrage but cannot remember how to open a door. They are technically active and undeniably loud, yet possess the collective cognitive depth of a shallow puddle.
Ideologies aren’t entirely dead. They have become ‘zombified’. The world has entered an ‘interregnum’ or a void that functions as a historical dead-zone between the old and the new. In the early 1930s, the Italian intellectual Antonio Gramsci famously wrote that the “old is dying and the new cannot be born”, and in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear. 
Gramsci was writing this during a turbulent period of transition from a dying order and the birth of a new one. To him, morbid symptoms in the time’s interregnum included fascism and ultra-nationalism, whereas to others, the symptom was Bolshevism.
Present-day political anxieties are symptoms of our own interregnum. These anxieties have given birth to populism. They are also keeping zombified ideologies in circulation. The best idea to survive such a period is what the American thinker John Dewey called ‘social intelligence’ or ‘real pragmatism.’ 
According to Dewey, people should solve society’s problems the same way a scientist solves a mystery, through experimentation, observation and flexibility. This approach looks for practical solutions that bypass ‘zombie ideologies.’ 
It is the pragmatists, planning their actions after studying real-world results, who are most likely to emerge from the interregnum with a fresh set of ideas that will aid the new to finally be born.

He was addressing a gathering during his visit to the verification counters for claims of losses at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Saturday to review the process and meet the affected traders.
The KCCI, on the instruction of the chief minister, has set up counters to verify claims of losses and ownership or tenancy filed by traders affected by the Gul Plaza incident.
The chief minister was accompanied by provincial ministers Nasir Hussain Shah and Jam Ikram Dharejo, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, and other senior officials.

He met KCCI leaders, including Zubair Motiwala and Javed Bilwani, while a large number of Gul Plaza-affected shopkeepers were present as the verification of losses continued at specially established counters.
The chief minister said that the provincial government had already paid Rs10 million each to 45 families of the 62 martyrs of the tragedy, adding that 1,153 compensation cheques of Rs500,000 each for affected shopkeepers were ready for distribution. “We are determined to ensure the complete rehabilitation of the affected traders and will not rest until they are back on their feet,” he said.
Mr Shah said that the provincial government had resolved to stand with the victims in every possible way, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had also directed that the pain of the affected families be shared and their rehabilitation ensured.
Mr Shah appreciated the Karachi Chamber for conducting the verification process with transparency and said it would be completed by the next day.
He sought a verified list from the commissioner and announced that, once approved, funds would be released within five days. “I will approve the summary today, and compensation cheques will reach the victims within five days,” he assured.
The chief minister said that affected traders were being temporarily accommodated at Parking Plaza, New Jamia Market, and Royal Market on Korangi Road, reiterating that Gul Plaza would be rebuilt. He also stressed that daily-wage workers affected by the incident must not be overlooked.
Highlighting fire safety concerns, the chief minister noted that Karachi required around 200 fire tenders and acknowledged the current shortfall.
He said efforts were underway to arrange the required number within a year and urged the business community to play its role by installing fire safety equipment at commercial premises.
Speaking on the occasion, Zubair Motiwala thanked the Sindh government for its prompt response and said the chamber was honestly carrying out the verification process.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Cou­rt (LHC) has ordered a man to pay Rs1 million as deferred dower and monthly maintenance to his wife after holding that contracting another marriage without prior permission makes the entire dower immediately payable under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.
Justice Abid Hussain Chattha issued the judgement, deciding two cross writ petitions filed by Mehnaz Saleem and her husband Kashif Iqbal, challenging concurrent and appellate findings of a family court and additional district judge (the appellate court), Sialkot.
Ms Saleem had filed a suit seeking recovery of deferred dower (Rs1m), maintenance allowance, and dowry articles. The family court had partially decreed her suit, awarding Rs15,000 per month as maintenance for the Iddat period, Rs1m as deferred dower, and dowry articles or their alternate value of Rs1,000,500. Both parties filed appeals against the decision.
The appellate court dismissed the wife’s appeal and partially allowed the husband’s appeal, setting aside the maintenance and dower awards and reducing the alternate value of dowry articles to Rs400,000.
The matter was subsequently brought before the LHC.
On the issue of deferred dower, the LHC judge ruled that Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance created a statutory exception to the general rule that deferred dower became payable only upon dissolution of marriage.
The provision mandates that if a husband contracts another marriage without prior written permission of existing wife/wives or the Arbitration Council, he becomes immediately liable to pay the entire dower—whether prompt or deferred—to the existing wife.
Justice Chattha noted that the husband, in the present case, had contracted further marriages without obtaining the mandatory permission and had already been convicted on the wife’s complaint. His appeal against conviction had also been dismissed. In these circumstances, the judge held that the entire deferred dower of Rs1m became immediately payable. Justice Chattha observed that the marriage, solemnised on Nov 27, 2021, remained legally intact as no valid divorce had been established on record. The judge noted that there was no “divorce effectiveness certificate,” and mere assertion of oral talaq was insufficient.
Referring to the SC judgement in Ambreen Akram v. Asaullah Khan (2026 SCMR 1), the judge held that a wife’s right to maintenance flows unconditionally from a valid marriage and constitutes a binding legal duty.
The judge found that the wife had been separated within one month of marriage and there was no convincing evidence that she left the house without lawful cause. The husband had also contracted subsequent marriages without prior permission.
The judge, therefore, held the wife entitled to maintenance at the rate of Rs15,000 per month with effect from Dec 27, 2021, with a 10 per cent annual increase, until her lawful entitlement subsists.
Regarding dowry articles, the LHC judge restored the findings of the family court, holding that the appellate court had erred in reducing the quantum on the basis of generalised social assumptions about second marriages.
Judge observed that dowry claims must be determined strictly on the basis of evidence and not on presumed social patterns or conjecture. He maintained that the family court had properly appraised oral and documentary evidence and awarded only those articles that were satisfactorily proved, or their depreciated alternate value. Consequently, the judge dismissed the husband’s petition and partially allowed the wife’s petition, declaring her entitled to deferred dower of Rs1 million, maintenance at Rs15,000 per month and dowry articles as decreed by the family court.

The registrar’s office issued separate notifications effecting changes to the composition of the IHC’s Administration Committee and its Selection Board for officers.
According to the notifications, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, who was transferred from the Sindh High Court along with Justice Dogar in February last year, has been replaced by Justice Muhammad Asif on the Administration Committee that takes key decisions related to the high court. A separate four-member committee, headed by Chief Justice Dogar, has also been notified. It includes Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Justice Azam Khan, and Justice Muhammad Asif.
In a parallel development, the Selection Board responsible for the recruitment and promotion of Grade-16 and above officers of the high court has also been reshuffled. Justice Khadim Soomro has been removed from the board, with Justice Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas named as its new members.
The administrative overhaul comes at a time when the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is expected to formally take up the issue of transferring judges from one high court to another.
Under the substituted Article 200, the president is now empowered to transfer a judge on the recommendation of the JCP, effectively removing the requirement for the consent of the judge being transferred. The amendment also stipulates that a judge who refuses to accept a transfer could face proceedings under Article 209 before the Supreme Judicial Council.
According to sources, at least three IHC judges are likely to be transferred to other high courts. Sources said Justice Soomro himself has sought transfer to his parent high court, the Sindh High Court.
In a separate administrative notification, Noor Muhammad Mirza, who has served under five chief justices, has been assigned a key position at the IHC. Mirza, a BS-21 officer, has been posted to the Chief Justice’s Secretariat. The notification stated that the appointment was made on the recommendation of the newly constituted Selection Board, comprising Justice Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, and was approved by Chief Justice Dogar.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman on Saturday dedicated his party’s landslide election victory to the citizens who “sacrificed for democracy” during the deadly 2024 uprising and pledged to prioritise the restoration of economy and governance.
Rahman, the 60-year-old scion of one of the nation’s most powerful political dynasties, called for national unity as he prepared to lead the South Asian nation of 170 million people following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s sweeping success in Thursday’s vote.
He will take over from an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has steered Bangladesh since a student-led uprising ousted Hasina in August 2024.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” Rahman said in his first speech since the vote. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”
The Election Commission reported the BNP alliance won 212 seats, securing a decisive two-thirds majority compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance. Turnout was reported at 59 per cent across 299 constituencies.
The win marks a remarkable turnaround for Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile in Britain.
However, he emphasised that the new government faces “daunting challenges”, putting the restoration of governance and the stabilisation of the financial sector at the top of his agenda.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions, and destroying law and order,” Rahman said. “We have very serious challenges to face … tackle the economy of the country … to ensure good governance.”
Voters on Thursday also endorsed a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus through a concurrent referendum.
The approved reforms include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence intended to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from participating in the polls. Speaking from hiding in India, the 78-year-old former leader — sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity — issued a statement decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.
Conversely, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, whose party quadrupled its seats in parliament, conceded on Saturday despite initially alleging “inconsistencies”. He pledged to serve as a “vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Rahman urged political rivals to work together following the tumultuous transition. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.
Rahman is the son of former President Ziaur Rahman and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died last year. While rivals have criticised his political career for alleged corruption, charges he has denied, his party’s commanding majority is viewed by analysts as a crucial opportunity to restore political stability.
“The freedom-loving, pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” Rahman said.

In a speech delivered by Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa at the African Union summit in Ethiopia, Abbas emphasised the necessity of enabling the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee daily governance in the enclave.
Removing these barriers is crucial to “ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery,” Abbas said.
Abbas accused Israel of “continuing to violate” the ceasefire agreement with Hamas that took effect in October. He noted that continued violence threatens the truce.

African Union commission chair demands end to ‘extermination’ of Palestinians

“From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed, which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase,” he said.
Despite the truce entering its second phase last month, the Israeli army retains control over more than half of the Gaza Strip. Fifteen experts on the technocratic committee, overseen by a “Board of Peace” set up by US President Donald Trump, remain based in Egypt.
This comes despite a partial reopening on Feb 2 of the Rafah border crossing.
Nickolay Mladenov, a diplomat appointed by Trump as high representative for Gaza, cautioned on Friday that “a number of conditions need to be met” before the committee can enter the territory. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Mladenov said Hamas must transfer civilian control of institutions. “This is not a government coming in after an election. This is far much more complicated,” Mladenov said. “We need to make sure that we have the framework agreed in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza.”
Separately, African Union Commission Chairman Mahmoud Ali Youssouf opened the organisation’s 39th summit by declaring the “extermination” of the Palestinian people must end. “In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop,” Youssouf said.
Youssouf also highlighted multiple conflicts in Africa, noting that from Sudan to the Democratic Republic of Congo, people continue to pay the “heavy price of instability”.
The two-day summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union under the theme of water sanitation.

In December 2025, the group acquired a 75pc stake for Rs135 billion, with the goal of transforming the loss-making airline through operational restructuring, fleet expansion, and improved customer service. To ensure the success of its revival plan, the consortium now seeks to take full control of decision-making.
The acquisition will allow the consortium to implement management changes by the end of April. Shahid Ali Habib, CEO of Arif Habib Ltd, told Dawn that this will enable them to operate as a private entity, free from government-appointed board members.
“The change of sponsors is scheduled for late April or early May,” he added.

Consortium to acquire remaining 25pc stake for Rs45bn

The government has given the consortium a 90-day window to purchase the remaining shares, valued at approximately Rs45bn, with the deadline set for the end of April. The agreement, signed in January, allows a 12-month period to transfer funds, making the acquisition a viable option.
The winning consortium includes Fatima Fertiliser (34.1pc), Fauji Fertiliser (33.9pc), Lake City (16pc), and the City School with AKD (Aqeel Karim Dhedhi) Group (16pc). The new management, supported by Rs125bn, will have the financial flexibility to implement reforms, with the new board tasked with raising capital for PIA’s rebranding.
PIA was established in 1955 and became a public limited company in 2016 through the Pakistan International Airlines (Conversion) Act.
Following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) in May 2024, PIA was delisted from the stock exchange and became a wholly owned subsidiary of PIA Holding Company Ltd (PIAHCL), formed in March 2024 to oversee the airline’s privatisation.

That is precisely why, today on February 15, Pakistan will take on India for the ninth time in T20 World Cup history.
It is a rivalry in which Pakistan has managed only one victory so far. Yet win numbers barely matter when these two teams meet, because this contest has grown far beyond cricket and has become arguably the most anticipated fixture in global sport.
In the build-up to this match, uncertainty loomed large. Until just days before the game, there was no official confirmation that Pakistan would play. This followed a dramatic political intervention when the Government of Pakistan announced that it would not permit the Pakistan team to participate in the World Cup group-stage match against India. Despite the tournament featuring 20 teams, this single lucrative fixture dominated headlines across the cricketing world.
The tension had been sparked when Bangladesh approached the ICC, requesting that their World Cup matches be shifted out of India due to political and security concerns. The ICC rejected this request, citing operational challenges, and eventually removed Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing them with Scotland. This decision sent shockwaves through the cricket community and raised serious questions about fairness and consistency in governance.

The most anticipated match in the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pakistan versus India today, almost didn’t happen. But the issue was always about more than a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket

At that moment, Pakistan emerged as the only major cricketing nation willing to stand publicly in solidarity with Bangladesh. Pakistan’s position was rooted in recent precedent. 
In the 2025 Champions Trophy, India refused to travel to Pakistan and the ICC allowed their matches to be played at a neutral venue in the UAE. Similarly, in the 2026 T20 World Cup, Pakistan was already playing all its matches in Sri Lanka rather than India. Given this background, many believed that Bangladesh deserved the same consideration rather than outright exclusion.
The Pakistan government took a firm stance and instructed the national team not to play India unless the issue was addressed. This moment marked a rare instance of a powerful cricket board openly challenging both the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
On Sky Sports, former England captain and respected commentator Nasser Hussain weighed in on the controversy. He remarked that it was difficult to imagine the ICC treating India the same way if they had refused to play in a host country at short notice. He further stated that Pakistan was speaking to the ICC and BCCI in the only language that truly moves world cricket, financial leverage and commercial reality. 
Hussain also expressed admiration for both Bangladesh and Pakistan, praising Bangladesh for taking a principled stand and Pakistan for defending another full member of the ICC.
The situation reached a turning point on Sunday, February 8, when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president and the ICC deputy chairman travelled to Pakistan for high-level talks with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi. These discussions proved crucial and, by Monday evening, a resolution began to take shape.
Following the meeting, the BCB formally requested Pakistan to proceed with the match against India on February 15. Shortly after, the ICC issued a detailed press release outlining key assurances, including recognition of Bangladesh as a valued full member with a proud cricketing heritage, confirmation that their absence from the 2026 World Cup would not harm their long-term cricketing future and a commitment to continue supporting cricket development in Bangladesh, a nation of over 200 million passionate fans.
Most importantly, the ICC confirmed that no financial, sporting or administrative penalties would be imposed on Bangladesh. The BCB also retained the right to approach the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee if it chose to do so. Additionally, Bangladesh was guaranteed hosting rights for an ICC event between 2028 and 2031, ahead of the 2031 Men’s Cricket World Cup, subject to standard procedures.
Following this resolution, the Government of Pakistan officially announced on social media platform X that Pakistan would indeed play India today. This marked a historic moment in cricket diplomacy, where one board stood up for another in the name of fairness and equality among ICC members.
Despite this positive outcome, a misleading narrative began circulating in the Indian media. Several outlets portrayed Pakistan as backing down or surrendering under pressure. This interpretation was far from the truth.
The reality is that India versus Pakistan matches in ICC tournaments generate immense global viewership and revenue. Broadcasters, sponsors, the ICC, BCCI and PCB all benefit significantly from this rivalry. Even during periods of intense public hostility, such as the 2025 Asia Cup, India ultimately played Pakistan despite political tensions at home. At that time, Indian players refused to shake hands as a symbolic gesture, yet they still participated because a full boycott was simply not commercially viable.
What made this situation different was that Pakistan became the first team to openly risk financial losses and potential ICC sanctions by threatening to withdraw from the biggest match in world cricket. This was not a retreat but a calculated stand based on principles.
At the same time, the ICC was never in a position to simply remove or punish Pakistan the way it did with Bangladesh, even though this was exactly what many in India, particularly sections of Indian media and officials close to the BCCI, were hoping for. 
Kicking Pakistan out of a global event was never going to be straightforward, because Pakistan is one half of the biggest rivalry in world cricket, a rivalry that generates enormous revenue, viewership, sponsorship and broadcast value for every ICC tournament. 
The India versus Pakistan contest is not just another match, it is one of the most commercially powerful fixtures in international sport and the entire financial model of ICC events benefits heavily from its existence. Broadcasters pay premium rights fees largely because of this match-up. Sponsors invest more when these two teams meet. And host countries rely on this game to maximise ticket sales and global engagement. 
Because of this, the ICC had to handle Pakistan’s stance with far greater caution and diplomacy than it did with Bangladesh, as any harsh action against Pakistan would have directly damaged the tournament’s commercial appeal and credibility. Unlike Bangladesh, Pakistan sits at the centre of the most profitable rivalry in cricket.
In truth, all three parties, Pakistan, India and the ICC, ultimately wanted this match to go ahead. However, Pakistan ensured that the ICC and BCCI acknowledged the need for fair treatment of all member nations rather than selective enforcement based on power or politics.
In the end, this episode became a win-win situation. Bangladesh secured a future ICC hosting opportunity without any penalties, while Pakistan demonstrated leadership, solidarity and moral courage. More importantly, Pakistan proved that it is not merely a participant in world cricket but a nation willing to challenge the system when fairness is at stake.
This was not just about a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket. And on that front, Pakistan emerged with its reputation not only intact but strengthened.

• Claims FIR registered against sitting senator over alleged tax evasion
• Says tobacco sector ‘not paying taxes’, involved in smuggling
• Construction relief package ‘in pipeline’, announcement expected soon
• Textile support under review; minister seeks 10-12 days for concrete steps
LAHORE: Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb on Saturday warned that Pakistan could not be run with a rapidly increasing population and stressed that the private sector would have to take the lead and create employment opportunities.
“If this growth rate (2.5pc) continues, our population can reach 400 million in the coming years. So, you tell us who will run this country in such a situation,” he said while speaking at the Pakistan Economic Growth Conference at the regional office of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Lahore. “So please help us on how to control the population,” he added.
On employment, the minister said the government alone could not provide jobs to the entire population of 250 million. “The private sector should lead the country’s economy and provide jobs,” he said, adding that the government’s role was to strengthen and enable the private sector. 
The minister emphasised the need to adopt the strategy that Bangladesh had used to control its population. “When you talk about Bangladesh with reference to taxation, competitiveness, growth, etc, while comparing with Pakistan, why don’t you talk about its journey to control population,” he questioned, requesting the businesspersons to come forward and help the government reduce the population growth.  
Mr Aurangzeb said the government was making efforts to broaden the tax base, claiming that an FIR had been registered against a sitting senator over alleged tax evasion.
“Tobacco and cigarette companies, except for two, are not paying taxes. They are also involved in smuggling. But we are not sparing them. We got an FIR even against a sitting senator,” he said.
He said the government had started monitoring sales tax on goods starting with the sugar industry and would move to other sectors in phases. “The PM has instructed us to start this from the sugar industry since his family is engaged in this [sugar] business,” Mr Aurangzeb claimed.
The finance minister said that after economic stabilisation, industrialisation was essential for sustainable growth and reiterated that the government was pursuing an export-led policy.
He said relief measures for the construction sector were in the pipeline and would soon be announced by the prime minister, while support for the textile sector and possible reductions in taxes linked to the property sector were also under consideration.
He said digitisation would improve transparency and revenue collection and acknowledged that the salaried class bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden. He reiterated the government’s commitment to providing relief to salaried individuals.
Highlighting developments in the construction sector, the finance minister said the work was actively underway and efforts were being made to broaden the tax net.
He clarified that the real estate and construction sectors were being treated separately, adding that construction was linked with multiple allied industries. 
He assured the business community that their issues would be addressed.
Speaking on the textile sector, he said that its issues were currently under review and requested 10 to 12 more days, assuring that concrete steps would be announced shortly.
He further stated that the government was reviewing the possibility of reducing multiple taxes in the property sector while carefully balancing fiscal responsibilities with sectoral demands.
Mr Aurangzeb said that the positive impact of Pakistan’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun to materialise, restoring the confidence of international financial institutions in Pakistan’s economy. 
He said the country was now firmly on the path of stability and growth.
He acknowledged that difficult but necessary decisions were taken to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly when Pakistan faced the risk of default. While the 2022 floods severely affected the economy, he said the country had sufficient capacity to absorb the losses caused by the 2025 floods.
The finance minister described IT exports as the future of Pakistan’s economy, stating that current IT exports stood at $3-4 billion, with the potential to reach $8-10bn.
He stressed that export proceeds must be fully repatriated, as a significant portion — around $4-5bn — was currently retained abroad. He further stated that foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan were increasing consistently.
“Due to prudent government policies, inflation has declined to record lows, providing tangible relief to the general public,” he said, reiterating that the salaried class would continue to receive priority relief measures.
Earlier, former minister Gohar Ejaz expressed concern over heavy taxation on real estate and other sectors, saying it was pushing investment abroad, particularly to Dubai.
“Pakistani people have already purchased properties worth $100bn in Dubai. A property expo for investment in Dubai is also being held in Lahore. And this city, after Karachi and other major cities, will be empty soon,” he deplored, requesting the government to reduce taxes on real estate and other sectors for economic growth.

In a post on X, the minister said, “Imran Khan has been given the facility to talk to his sons on the phone and considering his health, it has also been decided to shift him to the hospital and form a medical board.”







“The government prioritises humanitarianism and legal requirements. It is the government’s responsibility to provide facilities to every prisoner according to the law,” he said.
“There should be no politics on a sensitive issue like health. PTI should avoid baseless propaganda or political point scoring. The government is fulfilling its responsibilities. Instead of politicising this issue, show national seriousness and tolerance,” he said.
Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution.
“Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists.
“A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said.







The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment.
The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party.
The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others.







PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board.
“It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn.
TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance.
“We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated.
However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers.
“They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said.
In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”.







Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital.
“If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers.







‘Parliament turned into a prison’
Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”.
“We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X.
“Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.”
“We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added.
The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health.







In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”.
Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets.







PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House.
“We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”.
“The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed.







TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises.
“On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said.
According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night.
Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in.







PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors.
She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.”
She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye.
Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament.
“Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”.
“Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”.
The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released.
He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked.
Govt told to not escalate situation
Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand.
They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles.
They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled.
Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked.
Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government.
Reporters decry mistreatment
The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises.
A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating.
“Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said.
According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away.
“An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said.
The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.”
It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.”
The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”.
The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”.
KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful
Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful.
“Imran Khan sahib’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X.







He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well.
“Those opposing Imran Khan sahib, who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.”
The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib’s family and party,” Afridi added.
“A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised.







SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema
Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government.
In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC.
“The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted.
Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”.
“The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said.







She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists.
Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!”
“Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”.
“PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded.
“Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.

“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.
On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel’s unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Go-between
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
Renowned for its neutrality, Switzerland has been representing US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
In its role as the so-called protecting power, Switzerland has for decades allowed the two feuding nations to maintain a minimum of diplomatic and consular relations.
The Swiss embassy in Tehran handles all consular affairs between the United States and Iran, including passport requests, altering civil status and consular protection for US citizens in Iran.
Under the protecting power mandate, “Switzerland can either offer to act as a go-between on its own initiative or can fulfil this function at the request of the parties concerned, provided that all those involved agree,” the foreign ministry says on its website.
The United States will be holding separate talks, also in Geneva next week, between Russia and Ukraine.
Moscow and Kyiv will hold US-brokered talks on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Swiss city, both countries have said, announcing the next leg in fraught negotiations seeking to end the four-year war.
Trump is pushing to halt the conflict, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi have not yielded signs of a breakthrough.</p><small>2026-02-14 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1421174624478aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973198/karachi-police-clash-with-jamaat-i-islami-workers-outside-sindh-assembly' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police clash with Jamaat-i-Islami workers outside Sindh Assembly</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Police clashed with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) workers outside the Sindh Assembly on Saturday.
Footage aired on television showed police using tear gas, with workers running while covering their faces.
The JI had announced that it would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly on Feb 14 to protest what it described as the Sindh government’s “failure to address Karachi’s issues” and alleged interference in the city’s institutions.
Speaking on Geo News, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that police and the provincial government were in contact with the party’s administration since 4pm, telling them that they may protest but not enter the Red Zone.
“They were strictly forbidden from entering the Red Zone, but despite that, JI party workers entered the Red Zone, pelted stones at the police, and also tried to enter the assembly,” Memon stated.
He added that police were forced to use tear gas and arrest workers.
“You cannot enter the Red Zone under [Section] 144; the JI entering like this is a violation of the law,” the minister asserted. “No one will be allowed take the law into their own hands.”
Asked about comments by JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, maintaining that the protesters were peaceful, Memon questioned why they had to come to the assembly when it was closed.
The minister claimed that the only reason they wanted to enter the assembly was to vandalise it.
“We’ve been in contact with them since 4pm, but they violated the agreement by entering the Red Zone and then pelted stones at the police. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated from anyone,” Memon said.
In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that it had already been stated that permission would not be given to march toward Sindh Assembly.
“Police were pelted with stones; we were forced to take this step,” he said.
“Nobody is allowed to violate the law … taking the law into your own hands is absolutely not permitted,” he said. The Sindh home minister appealed to the public to remain peaceful and not become an instrument of those who wanted to spread chaos.
Sindh Government Spokesperson Aqraba Fatima issued a statement encouraging the JI and all political parties to protest peacefully and within the ambit of the law.
“Security concerns arise due to crowds in sensitive areas,” she was quoted as saying, adding that the JI need to act responsibly.
The spokesperson added that the authorities have been in contact with the party so that the situation does not drag on.
“Civil life being affected under the guise of protest is not acceptable in any way,” Fatima added. “The government believes in dialogue and the Jamaat-i-Islami is expected to cooperate positively.”
She added that political activities should not affect Karachi’s routine and that peace in the metropolis is a shared responsibility.
‘Police attacked peaceful protesters with batons’
Meanwhile, the JI chief took to X and said that the “entire country is witnessing the fascism” of the PPP, attaching videos and photos of police action against the protesters.
“Using tear gas on peaceful citizens and attempting to stop the sit-in at the Sindh Assembly is proof of the Sindh government’s failure and desperation,” he stated.







JI provincial lawmaker Muhammad Farooq told reporters that police shelled and attacked peaceful protesters with batons, accusing the governing PPP of “fascism”.
“We were coming to demand Karachi’s right to live,” he asserted. “The PPP arrested several Jamaat-i-Islami workers, which is an undemocratic act. Release the missing and arrested workers immediately.”
The MPA said that the demonstrators were not heading towards a “palace” and that the people of Karachi “are not courtiers”.
“When we pay taxes, the rulers enjoy their luxuries. The PPP provincial government is stripping the people of Karachi of their right to live,” Faroq asserted. “The PPP provincial government is not even allowing us to protest in accordance with the Constitution.”
Calling the PPP a “product of authoritarianism which promotes fake democracy”, Farooq alleged that the United Nations had placed a ban on tear gas shells, which the police were using.</p><small>2026-02-14 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/142024357003ba1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199/t20-world-cup-suryakumar-says-india-vs-pakistan-not-just-another-game' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: Suryakumar says India vs Pakistan ‘not just another game’</strong></a><br><p>India captain Suryakumar Yadav admitted on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.
“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo, venue for Sunday’s massive Group A showdown.
“No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”
The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R Premadasa stadium with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.

 

The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government reversed its decision to boycott the blockbuster Group A game.
“We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly,” said the Indian skipper.
“But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.
“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” said Suryakumar.
“According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”
The Indian captain would not say whether his players would shake hands after snubbing the Pakistan team in three Asia Cup meetings in Dubai last year.
“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”
India achieved a hard-fought 29-run win against the United States in the first match of their title defence in Mumbai a week ago, before crushing Namibia by 93 runs in Delhi on Thursday.
But Suryakuma played down the hype around Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq and his unique sling-arm bowling action that has an exaggerated pause in the delivery stride.

 

“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions, so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.
Suryakumar said dashing opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a stomach bug and was likely to play.
Both Pakistan and India have won their opening two Group A matches and the winners will qualify for the Super Eight Stage.</p><small>2026-02-14 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141815459d848a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973191/extremely-happy-to-hear-their-voices-aleema-says-imran-spoke-to-his-sons-for-approximately-20-minutes' target='_blank'><strong>‘Extremely happy to hear their voices’: Aleema says Imran spoke to his sons for approximately 20 minutes</strong></a><br><p>Aleema Khan, the sister of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, said on Saturday that the former premier spoke to his sons for approximately 20 minutes and was “extremely happy to hear their voices”.
The development comes after the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Imran after a report submitted by his lawyer, Salman Safdar, revealed that the former prime minister had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye. The court had also directed that he be allowed to speak to his children.
In a post on X on Saturday, Aleema said, “The chief justice of Pakistan had directed that Imran Khan be allowed to speak with his sons. We can confirm that he was able to speak with them for approximately 20 minutes.
“His sons shared that he was extremely happy to hear their voices after such a long time,” she said.







“We are now awaiting his urgent medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad under the supervision of his personal doctors, where specialist doctors must make every possible effort to restore his eyesight,” she said.
“The intentional delay in providing him timely treatment has already caused damage to his eyesight. We cannot and will not tolerate any further delay, and immediate specialist care is essential to prevent any permanent loss of vision,” she said.
It is worth mentioning that Imran’s sons, Kasim and Sulaiman, have repeatedly said over the past year that they have been unable to meet their father since his arrest.
On Thursday, after the report regarding Imran’s vision loss was submitted to the court, Kasim had termed the development “a direct consequence of solitary confinement and medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” he said.







“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neg­lect (denied blood tests), and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” he stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”.
He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added. He claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.</p><small>2026-02-14 13:58</small></div><hr>
