<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/290814596ae2326.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951888/pakistan-moves-up-investment-ladder' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan moves up investment ladder</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Showing improved business confidence, a vast majority of more than 200 leading foreign investors operating in Pakistan have termed Pakistan a viable destination and better than its peers for foreign investment.
In its biennial Perception and Investment Survey 2025, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) — a business group of more than 200 leading foreign investors — said 73pc of its members recommend Pakistan as a viable destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), a notable rise from 61pc in 2023.
The survey released on Tuesday noted this shift as a reflection of improved macroeconomic stability, reduced inflation — down from 37pc in mid-2023 to 4pc by July 2025 — and a relatively stable rupee, alongside upgraded international credit ratings.
Overall, the survey revealed a cautiously optimistic outlook from foreign investors on Pakistan’s business and investment climate.

OICCI survey shows 73pc of top foreign investors view Islamabad as viable FDI destination

The survey highlighted Pakistan’s improved regional standing on investment viability compared to 2023 versus several peers, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, and the Philippines. “Parent company interest has increased, as 35pc of respondents reported that their headquarters are now considering Pakistan a priority destination for new FDI, compared to 24pc in 2023”.
 
 

Commenting on the Perception Survey 2025, OICCI President Yousaf Hussain said the notable upward shift in investor sentiment demonstrated that economic stability and policy coordination were beginning to deliver results. “Initiatives like the SIFC have provided a structured mechanism for investment facilitation and inter-governmental alignment. In the future, deeper private-sector inclusion and continued reforms in taxation and regulatory efficiency will be key to sustaining this momentum”, he said
The survey also found investor perception of business risk to have shifted favourably, moving from a predominantly high-risk to a medium-risk outlook, reflecting improved macroeconomic management and relative stability. However, the findings also indicated that structural bottlenecks continue to constrain Pakistan’s investment potential. “Among the most critical concerns, federal–provincial coordination received negative feedback from 57pc of respondents”.
 






According to the survey, 96pc of respondents reported higher energy costs, 95pc faced increased wage expenses, and 91pc cited higher domestic raw material costs. Over 80pc expressed concern over delayed tax refunds, which in most cases take more than two years to process. Furthermore, over half of respondents indicated that commercial disputes take over five years to resolve, highlighting the need for judicial reform and more efficient dispute resolution.
Members’ perceptions of Pakistan’s economic outlook have improved noticeably since 2023. When asked about their sector-specific expectations for the next two to three years, 58pc of respondents now foresee global economic growth, a significant rise from 40pc in the previous survey. “This improvement mirrors gains in key macroeconomic indicators, including greater inflation stability, exchange rate management, and stronger capital market performance”, the OICCI said.
 
 

The survey participants also recommended enhancing Pakistan’s digital and regulatory landscape, supported by stronger human capital and a comprehensive, sector-focused investment policy. They emphasised developing non-IT industrial capacity to diversify growth.
Strengthening Pakistan’s global image was also seen as vital to attracting long-term FDI.
On global perception, 82pc of respondents noted that negative international coverage continues to influence investment decisions, highlighting the need for a proactive communications strategy to project Pakistan’s economic recovery and reform progress at global forums.
The survey’s recommendations call for broadening the tax base, ensuring policy consistency, strengthening coordination between federal and provincial governments, and enhancing intellectual property rights enforcement to sustain investor confidence and attract long-term FDI.

The ‘UN Decade on Eco­system Restoration Wor­­ld Restoration Flag­ship Awa­rd’ for the project ‘Rever­s­ing Deforesta­tion and Deg­radation in High Conser­vation Value Chilgoza Pine Forests’ was announced during the 80th anniversary celebrations of the UN Food and Agriculture Org­anisation (FAO) and the World Food Forum held in in Rome, Italy, on Tuesday. 
Implemented between 2018 and 2025 under the Restoration Initiative, the project is a joint effort of the Ministry of Climate Change, provincial forest departments and FAO. It focuses on conserving and restoring the country’s unique Chilgoza pine forests across Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, Baloch­istan, and Gilgit-Baltistan, FAO said. 
Pine nuts generate over $25 million annually for Pakistan. FAO’s approach is now being scaled up with national resources, including $3m from the KP Forestry Department. 
According to FAO, restoration of 20 per cent of degraded Chilgoza forests has been achieved throu­­gh income-generating activities for local communities, such as pine nut processing units. 
Speaking at the award ceremony, PM’s adviser Dr Syed Tauqir Hussain Shah said the initiative had restored 3,800 hectares of degraded forest land.

Officials said that unidentified gunmen riding motorcycles opened indiscriminate fire on a check post of Frontier Corps in the Reko area of Buleda. As a result, one FC man lost his life while three others sustained injuries.
The security personnel deployed at the post retur­ned fire in retaliation, but the attackers managed to escape.
Following the incident, additional security forces rushed to the site and shif­ted the body and injured personnel to a nearby government health facility. 

Security forces launch search operation to trace assailants

Officials said that a search operation has been launched in the area to trace the attackers invol­ved in the incident.
Earlier, police had foiled an attempt by armed militants to storm a police station in Noshki late on Sunday evening.
Officials said that a group of militants hurled a hand grenade at the police station and opened fire with automatic weapons. The grenade exploded near the building, but no casualties were reported.
Police personnel immediately retaliated, returning fire after taking positions. The exchange of fire lasted for more than half an hour.
“A police team successfully foiled the militants’ attempt to enter the station after a fierce gun battle,” a senior police officer said, adding that the attackers fled the area after facing resistance.
Following the attack, security forces rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation to track down the suspects.

Those on the list include TLP chief Saad Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi, and 21 other senior office-bearers, who are wanted in multiple cases registered in Lahore, Sheikhupura and other districts.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other national and provincial authorities have been directed to increase surveillance at notified checkpoints, international border crossings and airports.
 
 

According to reports, authorities are concerned that the TLP chief and his brother could use support networks in Karachi to evade prosecution.
According to a senior Punjab official, the names were forwarded at the province’s request after the individuals were nominated in over 100 FIRs, including about 80 that carry anti-terrorism and other serious charges. Of the 290 absconders, 23 are described as senior leaders involved in finance and agitation planning.
The official said that records of suspected financiers had been compiled through geo-fencing and analysis of transactions made to the TLP via bank accounts and other channels.
Names identified as funders have been shared with relevant police officers to initiate placement on the 4th Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, over suspected links with militant or sectarian outfits.
At a recent high-level meeting, the Punjab police decided to expand the scope of investigations to earlier cases from 2020 and 2021 involving alleged attacks on law enforcers during TLP-led protests, identifying several repeat offenders for renewed proceedings along with cases related to the 2025 unrest.
The meeting also ordered a review of past incidents targeting Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship in Punjab, where the TLP was allegedly involved.
The Punjab police command has also decided to engage former Lahore Investigation DIG Imran Kishwar, currently serving as Admin DIG Lahore, to oversee case preparation. He has been tasked with supervising crime-scene work, fingerprint analysis, DNA testing, geofencing, geomapping, call data analysis, and related forensic work. Mr Kishwar previously led high-profile investigations related to the May 9 violent protests.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has finalised an agreement with a group of moderate Sunni clerics to transfer management of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries previously raised or operated by the TLP.
In Sahiwal, the names of 12 TLP men were placed on the Fourth Schedule via a notification issued by deputy commissioner on the department’s direction.

“Turkish Foreign Mini­ster Hakan Fidan invited the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Turkiye for the forthcoming meeting next week of the eight Foreign Ministers of partner countries who were engaged on the sidelines of UNGA80 in the diplomatic process on Gaza,” the Foreign Office said in a statement on Tuesday.
The FO said Dar and Fidan discussed the evolving situation in Gaza, and the next steps and modalities for achieving lasting peace in Palestine.
 






In September, eight Ar­ab and Muslim-majority countries — Pakistan, Tur­k­­iye, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan — for­m­ed a group to work with US President Donald Tru­mp to end the Israel-Hamas war. Convened on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, the group built on the 2023 Arab-Islamic Contact Group to align with Trump’s 20-point peace plan.
The coalition’s goals included an immediate ceasefire; the exchange of all hostages and remains of those killed; deployment of a multinational stabilisation force to secure and demilitarize Gaza; and Gulf-funded reconstruction of the enclave as a terror-free economic zone. It also supports Gaza–West Bank unification and a two-state solution, while advancing regional normalisation under the Abraham Accords framework.
The upcoming meeting of the group follows weeks of deliberations within the coalition of Muslim and Arab-majority states. Earlier, officials said Pakistan is expected to announce soon whether it will contribute troops to the international stabilisation force being assembled for Gaza, amid indications that the decision is leaning toward participation. Officials had claimed that discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”.
Army chief Gen Asim Munir also visited Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in the past few days to discuss the plan for Gaza and the proposed deployment of an international stabilisation force. With the coalition’s next meeting scheduled for next week in Turkiye, it is expected that a final Pakistani decision is likely to be announced following those discussions.
Besides Pakistan, Indonesia and Azerbaijan are also tipped to contribute troops to the stabilisation force, while Israel has rejected Turkish participation.
The issue was also raised during Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar’s meeting with his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan in Riyadh. “The two leaders discussed bilateral relations, regional and international developments, including the situation in Gaza, and reaffirmed their shared commitment to cooperation at multilateral fora, including the United Nations,” FO said.
Refutation of Indian media report
On the other hand, the Ministry of Information issued clarification regarding a FirstPost report titled “With Munir’s CIA-Mossad deal, Pakistan to send 20,000 troops to Gaza under post-war plan”. The clarification rejected the report’s contents, noting that earlier coverage by Dawn (mentioned as a private newspaper) was quoted out of context and that the so-called intelligence sources cited in the FirstPost story were “misleading and concocted”.
However, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”, Dawn.com added.
Asked whether any such move was in the offing or not, the defence minister told Geo News: “This thing has to be finalised [and] it is in process. The government will take a decision after passing through the process and I don’t want to preempt it.” He said parliament wou­ld be taken onboard and all institutions would be informed about the move.
He said if Muslim countries took a decision to participate in the peace force and Pakistan also had to take part, then it wou­ld be a ‘moment of pride’ for the country to protect Palest­i­n­ians. “This is an opportunity that Paki­st­an should avail if it is available to us,” he said.

• CM vows to file contempt plea over Adiala jail restrictions
• KP opposition says absence of cabinet impacting govt affairs
ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR: After Khyber Pakhtu­n­k­h­wa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was once again barred from meeting his incarcerated party founder, Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
On Tuesday, CM Afridi arrived in Rawalpindi for a third time to meet Imran Khan in the Adiala jail, ostensibly to discuss the KP cabinet formation. However, he was not allowed to meet the party chief despite court orders in this regard.
Meanwhile, KP opposition members in the provincial assembly criticised  the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Last week, CM Afridi was denied the meeting and held a brief sit-in before returning empty-handed. This time, he said he’d move a contempt of court petition to contest the restrictions.
Speaking to media persons outside the prison, CM Afridi said he would file a contempt plea in the Islamabad High Court. He said it was his constitutional right to meet the PTI founder, as he was nominated by Imran Khan and was the representative of the people of KP.
He reiterated that he wanted to seek guidance from the party founder regarding the composition of the provincial cabinet and vowed to nominate ministers after meeting with Mr Khan.
However, Uzma Khanum, who was allowed to meet her brother on Monday, told reporters that Mr Khan wanted Sohail Afridi to go ahead with cabinet formation.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala, Ms Khanum said she had a message for the KP CM, since he could not meet the former premier.
“The CM should form a cabinet of his choice and as per the need of the hour,” the PTI founder was quoted as saying by his sister.
The message called on CM Afridi to “pick a small team”, while Ms Khanum said her brother had not proposed any names for inclusion in the provincial cabinet.
She said Imran Khan had also expressed concerns over the delay in the notification of Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the National Assembly opposition leader. She clarified that only party secretary Salman Akram Raja was empowered to relay messages to the party on Mr Khan’s behalf, to avoid confusion.
Deployment of troops in Gaza
Meanwhile, the PTI demanded clarification from the federal government regarding reports of the proposed deployment of Pakistani troops in Gaza. “The decision to send Pakistan’s armed forces to Gaza is an extremely sensitive national matter which must only be made through transparent consultation and with broad national consensus,” the party said, asking the government to take parliament, the political leadership, and the nation into confidence.

After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital.
In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna al Khwarij and Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
 






“The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” he said.
“Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said.
The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan.
“In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said.
He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”.
He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue.
“Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists.
“Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said.
“The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said.
The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly state for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”.
“The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said.
The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedaled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedaled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul.
“Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he outlined.
“I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedaled from the deal.”
“I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added.
The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Islamabad.
“India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”
When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.
“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.
“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.
Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks
On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”.
A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”.
From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”.
However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement.
“The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening.
Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of the four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.”
The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost were cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said.
Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue.
Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”</p><small>2025-10-29 02:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/290739130549846.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951909/cooperation-not-loans-offers-path-to-recovery-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Cooperation, not loans, offers path to recovery: PM</strong></a><br><p>• Premier says Pakistan has learned from mistakes of the past; rues ‘disaster-recovery-disaster’ cycle country finds itself trapped in
• Islamabad, Riyadh sign Economic Cooperation Framework to launch ‘strategic and high-impact projects’
• Energy, industry, mining, IT, tourism, agriculture and food security sectors to be main focus
ISLAMABAD: Ruling out loans as a driver of economic recovery, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday called for mutual cooperation to support countries like Pakistan that are battered by climate catastrophes.
Speaking during a high-level roundtable discussion at the 9th Future Investment Initiative Conference 2025 in Riyadh, PM Shehbaz said that repeated loans would erode the economic might of such countries, stagnating economic development.
“If humanity had to move forward, it should proceed in unison, share its bounties and grievances together and extend modern technologies with those countries which can use it to grow its production in the areas of agriculture, industry, and employment among others,” he said.
The PM’s remarks came after Pakistan and Saudi Arabia launched the Economic Cooperation Framework, based on shared economic interests.
The decision to launch the framework was taken during a Monday meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
“As part of the framework, several strategic and high-impact projects will be discussed in the economic, trade, investment and development fields that will contribute to strengthening cooperation between the two governments, enhan­cing the pivotal role of the private sector, and increasing trade exchange between the two countries,” the statement read.
It added that the deal would prioritise sectors including energy, industry, mining, information technology, tourism, agriculture and food security. Additionally, Islamabad and Riyadh are studying several joint economic projects, including signing memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for an electricity interconnection project between the two countries, and cooperation in the energy field.
 
 

“This framework represents an extension of both countries’ efforts to strengthen their fraternal relations and reaffirms their shared vision toward building a sustainable partnership across various economic, trade and investment fields in a manner that fulfils the aspirations of their leaderships and the brotherly peoples of both nations and serves their mutual interests,” the statement read.
Celebrating the announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said: “Another historic chapter unfolds in Pakistan-Saudi relations.” He said the developed marked a “high point” in the bilateral partnership in trade, energy and investment.
Investment summit
Participating in a discussion at the 9th Edition of the Future Investment Initiative, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was rich in resources. He said “very honest mistakes” were made in the country’s history but it had learnt from them. “Important thing is to learn from your mistakes and that is what we are doing. At this point in time, we are undertaking most robust changes and deeprooted reforms which are deeply required,” the premier said, pointing to the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to tackle corruption.
The prime minister said Pakistan was among the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change through no fault of theirs, adding that the country’s carbon emissions were “less than a fraction of one per cent”.
He said Pakistan was stuck in a loop of climbing the ladder and coming back down due to repeat climate disasters such as the 2022 and 2025 floods. “This is not acceptable. This is not where humanity should be directed towards.” If humanity was to move forward, it would have to do so in unison while sharing its “bounties and grievances together”, he added.
He said Pakistan was fast moving towards the inc­r­e­asing adoption of technology and artificial intelligence, though he did also warn about the risks of the latter. He said the global north and the global south should sit down and come to an agreement on the equitable distribution of resources for an egalitarian economy for all.

• Faryal Talpur meets AJK president to seek forward bloc’s support
• PTI to file disqualification references against defecting lawmakers
ISLAMABAD: The PPP is likely to announce its nominee for the office of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) prime minister on Wednesday (today), following a meeting between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif upon the latter’s return from Saudi Arabia.
Sources told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Faisal Rathore and Sardar Yaqub are under consideration for the top slot.
Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister. The no-trust motion will be submitted soon after the PPP finalises its candidate.
A PPP source said there was ‘no hurry’ to form the new government, adding that the PML-N’s decision not to join the treasury benches was “its democratic right”. The party insists it will move ahead “with consensus”.
According to sources, a detailed charge sheet highlighting the AJK prime minister’s alleged governance failures has been prepared.
These complaints include his failure to consult cabinet members, his harsh attitude toward bureaucracy, and cuts to development funds for ministers and assembly members. His unilateral decisions and weak handling of public protests have reportedly deepened dissatisfaction within the coalition.
In a related development, Faryal Talpur, head of the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, called on AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry to seek support from six members of the forward bloc belonging to his group. She discussed matters pertaining to formation of the new government in Azad Kashmir during the meeting.
Speaking to Dawn, PML-N leader Mushtaq Minhas clarified that if the Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister resigns, the party will not vote for the PPP candidate, though it will support a no-confidence motion, if tabled.
He said the PML-N had been seeking Anwarul Haq’s removal for the past six months over governance concerns.
PTI to file references
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has decided to file references against its defected members who have joined other parties or plan to support the no-confidence motion.
PTI AJK President Abdul Qayyum Niazi held consultations with Opposition Leader Khawaja Farooq Ahmed and summoned the party’s legal team.
According to sources, references will be filed under Section 30 of the Elections Act 2020, which allows the disqualification of members who switch parties.
PTI had earlier sent a reference to the speaker against four members — Akmal Sargala, Rafiq Nayyar, and Ali Shan Soni among them.
Now, 12 members of the PTI forward bloc who have joined the PPP could face disqualification if they vote for the no-confidence motion.

The vessel “capsized only a few hours into its journey due to high waves”, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said in a statement, adding that the accident had occurred off the coast of Surman, Libya.
“Among the survivors are 29 Sudanese men, one Sudanese woman, and one Sudanese child; 18 Bangladeshi men; 12 Pakistani men; and three Somali men,” it said.
No information was yet available about the nationalities of those who died.
“This latest shipwreck is a stark reminder of the grave dangers faced by people undertaking perilous sea journeys in search of safety and opportunity,” the IOM said.
It said the central Mediterranean route from northern Africa across to Europe remained “one of the world’s deadliest migration corridors”.
The agency said its Missing Migrants Project has documented 1,046 deaths and disappearances along that route so far this year, including 527 off the coast of Libya.
Tuesday’s accident came after 40 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa were found dead following a shipwreck off Tunisia last week.
The IOM said it was working with local partners to ensure survivors of Tuesday’s shipwreck received health assistance and access to essential services. It appealed for “urgent action to prevent further tragedies at sea”.</p><small>2025-10-28 19:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/282339481111d8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951796/what-you-need-to-know-about-karachis-new-e-challan-traffic-system' target='_blank'><strong>What you need to know about Karachi’s new e-challan traffic system</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government has introduced a new e-challan system that aims to improve the city’s traffic while minimising the traffic police’s interaction with the public.
Under the new system inaugurated recently, at least 5,500 challans have already been issued to traffic rule violators throughout the city. Here is what you need to know about the system.
What is the e-challan system?
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Admin Karachi Traffic Police Kashif explained that the system has been introduced as part of the Karachi Safe City Project.
A total of 1,076 cameras have been installed on main thoroughfares in the first phase.
When phase 2 and 3 of the initiative are completed, up to 12,000 cameras will have been installed in all areas of Karachi as well as on toll plazas.
Once a challan is initiated, it will be sent via Pakistan Post to an address linked to the number plate issued by the Sindh Excise and Taxation Department.
While the total time to pay off the challan is 21 days, if it is paid within 14 days, the violator would get a 50 per cent waiver on the amount.
However, failure to pay within 21 days will result in the total amount being doubled on the 22nd day.
How can you appeal?
If you believe you’ve been fined unfairly, there’s a system to file an appeal as well.
Desks have been established across 11 police stations across the city in case you believe you’ve been charged with a challan despite not breaking any traffic rules. The addresses of the said stations can be found on the back of the challan itself.
Once you file a complaint, a token will be issued while a committee of three members will review the appeal.
The committee, established in every district, is led by a senior superintendent of police (SSP) and includes a senior police official and one offcial from the Citizen-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC).
The CPLC is a non-political statutory organisation that provides community safety and crime prevention services in Sindh.
If your appeal is successful — the processing of which will take three to four days — the challan will be removed from the system. During the process, the timer of 21 days for challan payment remains on pause.
What if you don’t pay the challan?
Failure to pay the challan in three months can result in suspension of one’s driving license.
If the traffic tickets remain unpaid for 6 months, the National Database and Registration Authority will be approached, for blocking of Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC). Nadra will notify the traffic rule violator, and if the challan still remains unpaid, the CNIC can be blocked by the authority.
Moreover, a demerit points system has been built into the e-challan process to further discourage transgression of traffic laws. Every violation a vehicle driver commits will have a demerit point, with 30 demerit points in a year resulting in driving license suspension.
While the mechanism is currently only operational for number plates registered in Sindh, discussions are underway to include vehicles from other provinces.
‘Fear, responsibility, accountability’
Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Traffic Karachi Pir Mohammed Shah told Dawn.com, “This system represents a significant milestone in ensuring compliance with traffic laws and enhancing effective monitoring.”
He said the e-challan system is built on the principles of fear, responsibility, and accountability — fear of being captured by cameras, the responsibility that arises from that awareness, and the accountability that comes with knowing that any violation will be recorded and acted upon.
Unlike the previous manual system, where discretion rested with individual officers on the road, the new digital process ensures complete transparency and uniform enforcement, added the traffic police chief.
In addition, citizens can make use of the Trax4Citizens App, available on the Sindh Police website.
The app can be found on the main page (bottom right corner). To download and access it, users simply need to enter their CNIC, mobile number, and e-mail address.
Once registered, the app displays all vehicles registered under the CNIC, along with details of violations and warnings issued against them.
“The application not only allows users to track the status of their challans but also serves as an educational tool, helping citizens understand their driving patterns and avoid future violations,” said the senior traffic cop.
By studying the warnings generated by the system, users can become more aware and responsible drivers, contributing to safer roads for all, said DIG Shah.
“With public cooperation, this system will continue to improve further,” he said, urging citizens to follow traffic rules strictly so that the city’s traffic flow can be improved and road accidents reduced.</p><small>2025-10-28 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28234314aec5233.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951795/pakistans-brittle-batting-implodes-again-as-south-africa-romp-to-55-run-win-in-first-t20i' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s brittle batting implodes again as South Africa romp to 55-run win in first T20I</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s brittle batting line-up imploded once again as South Africa romped to a comprehensive 55-run victory in the first Twenty20 International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday night, bowling the hosts out for a paltry 139 in 18.1 overs while chasing 195.
Corbin Bosch, the 30-year-old seamer, produced a masterclass in death bowling to finish with career-best figures of 4-14, while left-arm spinner George Linde chipped in with 3-31 as Pakistan lost their last seven wickets for just 58 runs after a sedate powerplay.
Openers Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, promoted to set the tone, managed a cautious 31 before Lizaad Williams shattered Farhan’s stumps with a nip-backer for 24 off 19 balls.
The dismissal brought Babar Azam to the crease for his much-anticipated T20I comeback, but the former skipper lasted just two deliveries, chipping a short-of-length ball from Bosch straight to cover for a golden duck.
 






Skipper Salman Ali Agha’s wretched night continued when he was trapped plumb in front by Bosch for two, Pakistan sliding to 43 for three in the eighth over.
Saim, who had laboured to 37 off 28 balls with four sixes, finally holed out to long-on off Linde, triggering a middle-order meltdown.
Usman Khan, the wicketkeeper-batsman, looked composed for his 12 before being stumped charging Linde. Hasan Nawaz fell for three, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, while Faheem Ashraf’s attempted reverse-sweep off Linde lobbed tamely to point for one.
Mohammad Nawaz provided late resistance with a combative 36 off 20 balls, including two sixes and four boundaries. His audacious scoop for six off Nandre Burger in the 18th over briefly raised hopes, but he perished in the next over, skying Williams to long-off.
 






Shaheen Shah Afridi muscled a four before falling to Bosch’s return catch for four, and Naseem Shah’s spirited nine ended with a thin edge behind off the same bowler. Abrar Ahmed was left stranded as Williams sealed the rout.
Earlier, Nawaz and Saim were impressive with their spin bowling on a batting-friendly surface to restrict South Africa to 194-9.
Nawaz (3-26) and Saim (2-31) kept the hosts from posting a 200-plus score despite Reeza Hendricks’ half century.
South Africa, put into bat first after Pakistan won the toss, rode on Hendricks’ anchoring 60 and a late flourish from Linde in front of a capacity crowd.
The Proteas got off to a blazing start, with Quinton de Kock and Hendricks plundering 44 in the powerplay.
De Kock, returning to international T20 cricket after a lengthy hiatus, looked in ominous touch, striking five boundaries in his 23 off 13 balls.
 






However, part-time spinner Saim struck in the fourth over, inducing a thick edge from de Kock that was pouched at point by Faheem.
Tony de Zorzi, on T20I debut, announced himself with a flurry of strokes, smashing five fours and a six in his 33 off 16. The left-hander’s audacious lofted drive off Salman Ali Agha for six over long-on was the highlight of a 49-run second-wicket stand with Hendricks.
But Nawaz, introduced in the eighth over, turned the game on its head. The left-arm spinner deceived de Zorzi with a wide, full delivery outside off, leaving the batsman stranded as wicket-keeper Usman Khan effected a sharp stumping.
Nawaz was not done. He accounted for the dangerous Dewald Brevis for nine, the ball skidding low to crash into off-stump as the youngster attempted a premeditated slog-sweep.
 






Matthew Breetzke, promoted to number, struggled for timing and fell for one, pulling a short delivery from Saim straight to deep square leg. At 112 for four in the 11th over, South Africa were wobbling.
Skipper Donovan Ferreira tried to stabilise but managed only 10 before Nawaz struck again, breaching his defences with a skidding arm-ball.
Hendricks, who had played second fiddle during the early blitz, took charge thereafter. The opener brought up his fifty off 32 balls with a top-edged sweep off Saim that sailed for six.
He found an able ally in Linde, who injected momentum with a 34-ball 36, laced with four boundaries and a six.
The pair added 39 for the sixth wicket, with Linde’s slog-sweep off Abrar Ahmed for six in the 17th over standing out.
Shaheen bowling the 17th, was taken for 18 runs, including four streaky boundaries as Linde feasted on width. Hendricks looked set for a bigger score but fell in the 18th over, bowled by Abrar while attempting a cross-batted swipe.
Naseem removed Linde in the 19th over with a yorker that uprooted middle stump, while Shaheen returned to dismiss Corbin Bosch, caught at long-on.
 






The final over saw drama as Williams was run out attempting a suicidal single, Shaheen’s acrobatic collection and Usman’s presence of mind sealing the innings at 194 for nine.
While Nawaz and Saim flourished, Shaheen and Naseem were expensive, conceding 45 and 34 respectively, but struck late blows. Abrar, despite going for 42, claimed Hendricks’ prized scalp.
The total, while substantial, could have been higher had South Africa avoided the mid-innings collapse, but it turned out to be more than enough at the end.
The second T20I is scheduled for Friday in Lahore. For Pakistan, questions over batting intent, middle-order fragility, and captaincy loom large once again.</p><small>2025-10-28 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/282228338a4323e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951803/govt-changes-nccia-dg-as-corruption-scandal-widens' target='_blank'><strong>Govt changes NCCIA DG as corruption scandal widens</strong></a><br><p>The federal government replaced the director general of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on Tuesday amid an ongoing corruption scandal concerning its employees and other issues.
The federal government established the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, operating under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combating cybercrime in Pakistan.
Notifications issued from the Cabinet Secretariat’s Establishment Division today said Syed Khurram Ali, a BS-21 officer of the police service, was appointed as the new NCCIA DG with immediate effect, replacing Waqaruddin Syed, who was directed to report to the division immediately.
The latter was appointed to the role in April.
Earlier today, a Lahore court granted the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) a three-day physical remand of six NCCIA officials in a case registered against them for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money and taking bribes.
The first information report (FIR) of the case has been registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who has been arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered against nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials, at 7:35pm yesterday. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest yesterday.
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of another official nominated in the case — Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director of operations in Islamabad — have also been unknown for several days.
Lahore NCCIA’s Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar are the six officials about whom it emerged yesterday that they had been arrested by the FIA.
 
 

Meanwhile, unhappy with the performance of the NCCIA, the Punjab government has decided in pri­nciple to set up its own wing to deal with the rising incidents of cybercrime in the province.
After the NCCIA was established in May this year — replacing the FIA Cybercrime Wing — the Pun­jab government tried to develop a “working relationship” with the federal authority, but it did not yield results.
Meanwhile, the NCCIA itself has been struggling with severe manpower shor­t­ages as thousands of complaints pour in each month. With a large backlog and limited resources, the authority has been unable to process cases efficiently.</p><small>2025-10-28 17:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2822071532179ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951801/modi-skipped-asean-summit-to-avoid-talk-of-pakistan-with-us-president-trump-report' target='_blank'><strong>Modi skipped ASEAN summit to avoid talk of Pakistan with US President Trump: report</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped out on attending an Asean summit in Malaysia to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia over the weekend to attend an Asean summit and opted to join the discussions “virtually” instead. The opposition Congress party had blamed the change of plan on Modi’s fear of meeting Trump.
The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, was held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur.
“Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed away from a regional leaders summit in Malaysia this week to avoid meeting US President Donald Trump and having a possible discussion about Pakistan,” people familiar with the matter said.
“Officials in the government were apprehensive that Trump would repeat his claim that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day armed conflict in May, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private,” Bloomberg reported about the alleged actual reason behind the skipping out on the summit.
It added that Modi was campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial Bihar election and he “didn’t want to risk a meeting with Trump that could end up being embarrassing for the prime minister, the people said.
“Modi is the main face of his party’s campaign in Bihar state and any comments by Trump, especially regarding Pakistan, could be used by the prime minister’s rivals against him and damage his party’s chances at the polls, they said.”
 
 

Bloomberg similarly reported in August that Modi had turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would set up a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. Also fueling the tensions has been Trump’s insistence of ending the May conflict between Pakistan and India — something that New Delhi adamantly refuses still.
Earlier today, Trump again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May.
Tensions between Pakistan and India escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-28 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281122278c2c4c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951752/9-nccia-officials-booked-for-extorting-money-from-ducky-bhais-family-6-remanded-in-fia-custody' target='_blank'><strong>9 NCCIA officials booked for ‘extorting money’ from Ducky Bhai’s family; 6 remanded in FIA custody</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore court on Tuesday granted the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) a three-day physical remand of six National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials in a case registered against them for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money and taking bribes.

Meanwhile, the whereabouts of another official nominated in the case — Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director of operations in Islamabad — have also been unknown for several days.
Lahore NCCIA’s Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar are the six officials about whom it emerged yesterday that they had been arrested by the FIA.
They were presented before a district court in Lahore today.
The officials were brought to the court in handcuffs.
At the hearing, the FIA sought their physical remand from Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo for further investigation.
“The suspects have to be interrogated,” the FIA’s lawyer contended.
“Till now, what have you found during the probe, on the basis of which you arrested the officials?” Justice Wattoo enquired.
The FIA’s lawyer replied that the probe was still under way.
For his part, the officials’ lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said details should be shared about the number of FIRs registered against the suspects.
At that, the FIA informed the court that the officials were nominated in just one FIR.
Following that, Ashfaq contended as per NCCIA rules, any action against an 18-grade officer was to be initiated after the director general’s permission. “Sarfraz is an officer, and permission has not been sought from the NCCIA for action against him.”
He further argued that when Aroob Jatoi had “given a bribe”, why did the FIA not register a case against him. On the other hand, a case against the NCCIA officials was registered within 20 minutes, he said.
According to the FIA’s application submitted in the court, a copy of which was seen by Dawn.com, the officials were arrested on October 27.
The agency sought a 14-day physical remand of the officials, as per the document. However, after arguments by lawyers from both sides and reserving its verdict, the court granted the FIA physical custody of the officials for three days.
Judge Wattoo ordered the FIA to present the NCCIA officials before the court on October 31 (Friday).
“There is material at this stage against accused Shoaib Riaz Muhammad Sarfaraz Chaudhary in the shape of a private person’s complaint, statement and detail of cheques, amount etc, which shows that further remand should be given for recovery and completion of investigation of first group of accused,” the order read.
Referring to the FIA’s request regarding the “second group of accused Zawar Ahmad, Ali Raza, Yasir Ramzan and Mujtaba Zaffar”, the judge noted: “Statements are on record in which detail is mentioned that how much amount and when it was collected and how it was paid as illegal gratification to high-ups.
“Said entitles at this stage to give remand to probe further. It looks [like a] deep-rooted matter,” the order said, adding that the investigation officer’s contentions to the extent of the second group of suspects were also plausible.
Application seeking officials’ court production
Before the hearing, another lawyer representing the six NCCIA officials, Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq, had submitted an application to the judicial magistrate, seeking his clients’ production before the court.
The application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the officials had been formally arrested by the FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle.
“Since their arrest, neither the family nor the legal counsels are allowed to meet with the suspects; so much so, FIA officials have also refused to issue [a] copy of [the] first information report (FIR) in which the aforementioned suspects’ arrest has been caused, which is a glaring violation of all the settled norms and principles of fair investigation and fair trial as guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and also the violation of Police Rules, 1934 and Police Order, 2002; as well as different standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the department,” the application read.
It highlighted that the relevant investigating officer or investigation agency was bound to produce arrested individuals before the competent court within the first 24 hours of detention.
“However, in a design, and manner, the suspects are arrested, kept and not being allowed to meet with family members as well as their legal counsels, it is seriously apprehended that the suspects may not be produced before this honorable court which equates to illegal confinement for a longer period and such action on part of [the] investigation officer is a sheer violation of Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and Articles 10 and 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well as Police Rules, 1934 and Police Order, 2002.
“That the above highlighted unlawful actions, on part of the police, are not only violative of Articles 4, 9, 10, 10A, 13 and 14 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with respect to right of individuals to be dealt in accordance with law etc., security/ liberty of person, safeguards [against] arrest and detention, right to fair trial, protection against self-incrimination and inviolability of dignity of man etc., but also very inhuman as being against the basic human rights,” the application stated.
It added that courts were the “guardian[s] of liberty of citizens and the abuse of power to rope innocent people in order to humiliate them should equally be kept under scrutiny and such unlawful actions should be curbed”. The application further mentioned that the right of liberty was one of the “most precious rights”, which had been guarded by the Constitution and courts.
In the application, the lawyer sought the court’s directives for the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore deputy director and the FIA director for Lahore to produce the NCCIA officers before it at the earliest in the “supreme interest of justice, equity and fairplay”.
FIR against NCCIA officials
Meanwhile, it emerged late last night that the NCCIA officials had been nominated in an FIR registered on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi.
Apart from the six officials in the FIA custody and Islamabad NCCIA’s Muhammad Usman, Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan and a person named Salman Aziz have also been nominated in the case.
The FIR has been registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, and the inquiry into his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
 
 

The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to “extort Rs9m” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman’s judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August 2025, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Salman Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added that Riaz gave Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director operations in Islamabad, and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen had been assigned the investigation of the case.
Controversies and transfer
Among the six NCCIA arrested officers, Additional Director Sarfraz was reportedly removed over different controversies last month and asked to report to the NCCIA headquarters, Islamabad. He said he was transferred to the headquarters and he had sought a six-month leave.
The three controversies were about laying hands on a number of YouTubers/social media influencers, including Saadur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai and Rajab Butt, for their alleged involvement in unregulated online trading and online gambling apps.
 
 

The other was the registration of a case against some lawyers who allegedly tried to get a suspect released from the NCCIA. The third controversy related to a tiff between a group of Lahore’s journalists and a serving deputy inspector general of police and some other police officials, as the former moved the NCCIA to act against the latter. According to an official, Chaudhry was transferred in light of different complaints against him.
When approached for comment previously, an NCCIA spokesperson had declined to comment on the missing officers, terming it a “serious matter”.
However, sources had told Dawn that the officers’ disappearance was linked to their investigations into social media influencers and their financial crimes.
On Friday, the Islamabad High Court had granted the police one more week to trace missing NCCIA Deputy Director Muhammad Usman, who has been missing for several days. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
The court was also informed that the petitioner had herself gone missing after initiating the case. The development had prompted the court to seek an updated report from the police on both disappearances.</p><small>2025-10-28 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/282032399791957.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951797/body-found-after-fire-near-karachi-university-destroys-over-a-dozen-makeshift-houses' target='_blank'><strong>Body found after fire near Karachi University destroys over a dozen makeshift houses</strong></a><br><p>A body was found after a fire which erupted near the University of Karachi (KU) on Tuesday evening destroyed huts and damaged graves and flats, according to officials.
A statement released by Rescue 1122 after the fire was brought under control said that the body of a 50-year-old man was recovered during a search operation.
Earlier, Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the fire erupted in the dry bushes outside KU. As a result, the fire spread rapidly due to heavy winds.
“It [the fire] engulfed a nearby graveyard, damaging some graves, while around 10-20 huts (makeshift houses) were destroyed,” the spokesperson said. “The fire also reached a nearby housing complex, which prompted citizens to vacate their flats.”
Khan said that 12 to 15 flats that were exposed to fire were vacated and residents were relocated to safe places. He added that 12 fire tenders were engaged to control the blaze.
A later statement from Rescue-1122 said that the fire had been brought under control and that “the cooling process is underway”.</p><small>2025-10-28 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/282104353487149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951798/cjcsc-shamshad-bangladesh-coas-appreciate-positive-trajectory-of-growing-defence-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>CJCSC Shamshad, Bangladesh COAS appreciate ‘positive trajectory’ of growing defence cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the Bangladeshi army chief on Tuesday expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in August last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement. CJCSC Mirza is currently on a visit to the country.
A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the CJCSC called on Bangladesh’s Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters, Dhaka.
“During the meeting, both sides appreciated the positive trajectory of expanding defence cooperation between the two countries and agreed to maintain regular exchange visits at various tiers of military leadership,” the ISPR said.
It added that the two dignitaries discussed the evolving global and regional security environment and underscored the importance of further strengthening bilateral cooperation between their militaries.
The discussions covered areas including training, joint exercises, and sharing of experiences in counter-terrorism.
“Both sides also noted the emerging challenges posed by disruptive and divisive disinformation efforts across multiple platforms, recognising them as a common concern. They reaffirmed the need to enhance cooperation and joint efforts to effectively counter these threats.”
 






A day ago, CJCSC Mirza met Bangladesh’s air and navy chiefs, with all parties vowing to improve defence and security collaboration.
Gen Mirza had held separate meetings with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M. Kamrul Hassan.
In January, PSO Lt Gen Hassan had met COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the two stressed the need for an “enduring partnership” between their countries to “remain resilient against external influences”.</p><small>2025-10-28 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28210607db55552.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951781/e-challan-system-officially-inaugurated-in-karachi-over-2650-issued-by-traffic-police' target='_blank'><strong>E-challan system officially inaugurated in Karachi; over 2,650 issued by traffic police</strong></a><br><p>More than 2,650 electronic challans have been issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the inauguration of the new e-ticketing system in the city.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid the port city witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.
According to a press release by the Sindh police dated October 28, 1,535 challans have been issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for over speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving.
Moreover, per the press release, seven challans were issued for putting tints on vehicle windows, five challans each for improper parking and parking in a no-parking zone, four for stop line violation, and three each for lane line violation and driving on the wrong way.
On the day of the inauguration, work was underway to further improve the technical aspects of the system, after which the e-challan system was activated, according to the press release.
The statement quoted the Deputy Inspector General Traffic as saying that this system is an “important milestone” in effective monitoring and ensuring compliance with traffic rules among citizens.
“With public cooperation, this system is being further improved. Citizens are urged to fully comply with traffic rules so that the traffic system in the city can be improved and accidents can be reduced,” said the statement.
Earlier this month, Inspector General (IG) of Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said the biggest problem in the metropolis is a lack of trained drivers, who are also responsible for tragic accidents.
Meanwhile, Additional IG of Karachi Javed Alam Odho said a faceless e-ticketing system would end abuse of powers by police and their negative attitude towards the public.</p><small>2025-10-28 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28194131a7e66e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951787/us-kills-14-in-strikes-on-alleged-pacific-drug-boats-pentagon-chief' target='_blank'><strong>US kills 14 in strikes on alleged Pacific drug boats: Pentagon chief</strong></a><br><p>American forces killed 14 people in strikes that destroyed four alleged drug-smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean, United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday, bringing the death toll from Washington’s anti-narcotics campaign to at least 57.
The United States began carrying out the strikes — which experts say are illegal — in early September, and has now destroyed at least 14 vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific.
“A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no US forces harmed,” Hegseth said in a post on X about strikes carried out the day before.
“The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” he said.
 






The Pentagon chief’s post included video of the strikes, the first of which targeted two stationary boats that appeared to be moored together, and the other two on vessels that were speeding across open water.
Hegseth said that US Southern Command “immediately” started searching for the sole survivor of the strikes, and that Mexican authorities “accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue”. He did not specify what happened to the survivor or if the person was found.
“We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them,” Hegseth said of drug traffickers.
Washington has carried out a major buildup of military forces in Latin America that it says is aimed at countering drug trafficking, deploying seven US Navy warships as well as F-35 stealth jets and ordering the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group to the region.
Regional tensions have flared as a result of the strikes and the military buildup, with Venezuela accusing the United States of plotting to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, who has accused Washington of “fabricating a war“.</p><small>2025-10-28 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2814591003e1d6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951766/ihc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-case-challenging-justice-jahangiris-eligibility' target='_blank'><strong>IHC judge recuses from hearing case challenging Justice Jahangiri’s eligibility</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro on Tuesday recused himself from hearing the case challenging the eligibility of Justice Tariq Meh­mo­­od Jahangiri.
A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake law degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC last year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s degree.
Today, a two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Soomro, took up a miscellaneous application filed by the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) seeking to become a party in the matter.
During the proceedings, Justice Soomro recused himself from hearing the case, following which the bench stood dissolved, and the hearing was adjourned without any further proceedings.
His decision comes after a division bench hearing a writ petition filed by Advocate Mian Daw­o­­od, which questioned the legitimacy of Jus­ti­­ce Jahangiri’s LLB degree, was reconstituted. Justice Mohammad Azam Khan was previously part of the bench led by Justice Dogar.
 
 

It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who challenged the transfer of Justice Dogar, as well as of two other judges — Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the IHC.
In its application, the IBA argued that fair and transparent adjudication of the pending writ petition would be impossible without hearing the bar as a party, since the issues involved are of “fundamental importance” to the legal fraternity and the rule of law.
The lawyers’ body emphasised that under its Memorandum of Association (2016), it is mandated to safeguard the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and civil liberties. It further maintained that the bar has historically been at the forefront of struggles for constitutional supremacy and must therefore be heard in this matter.
The plea recalled that the bar’s functions include facilitating its members in the performance of their professional duties, protecting their interests, and maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct.
“The Islamabad Bar is resolute in shielding the superior judiciary from attacks, whether internal or external, and in striving for the supremacy of the Constitution,” the application stated.
Case developments
On September 16, a division bench comprising Justices Dogar passed an interim order restraining Justice Jahan­giri from performing his judicial functions.
The judge then filed an appeal against the decision before the Supreme Court in person. Subsequently, the restraining order, issued without notice to the respondent, was suspended by a five-member Constitutional Bench of the SC on September 29.
The next day, the bench set aside the IHC ruling, declaring it “null and void”. The bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan observed that no sitting judge could be barred from performing judicial duties through an interim order of a high court.
 
 

Four days earlier, the Sindh High Court (SHC) extended its earlier interim order suspending the KU syndicate’s decision to cancel Justice Jahangiri’s law degree.
A two-judge bench of the SHC headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro stated that the interim order would continue till November 27 after federal and provincial law officers again sought more time to file comments.
Advocate Mian Dawood’s petition against Justice Jahangiri, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against him — a jurisdiction rarely invoked in such circumstances.
It argues that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from KU — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
 
 

The key allegations in the petition include the use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The KU has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The petition argued that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.</p><small>2025-10-28 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281931528503e14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951789/indian-national-charged-with-assault-of-2-teens-on-flight-from-chicago-us-justice-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Indian national charged with assault of 2 teens on flight from Chicago: US justice dept</strong></a><br><p>An Indian national was charged with an assault on a flight travelling from Chicago to Germany, according to a press release issued by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday.
The DoJ stated that Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork and was arrested on October 25 after the flight was diverted to Boston. He was charged in the US District Court with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm.
“According to the charging documents, on October 25, 2025, while on board Lufthansa flight 431 en route from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, Usiripalli allegedly stabbed a 17-year-old male passenger (Minor A) in the shoulder area with a metal fork,” the statement read. “Usiripalli then allegedly stabbed a second 17-year-old male passenger (Minor B) in the back of the head with the same metal fork.”
 


The DoJ said that when flight crew members attempted to subdue Usiripalli, he reportedly raised his hand, formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled an imaginary trigger.
“Immediately afterwards, Usiripalli allegedly turned toward a female passenger to his left and slapped her with his hand. Usiripalli also allegedly attempted to slap a flight crew member,” the statement read.
“As a result of the disturbance, the flight was diverted to Boston Logan International Airport, where Usiripalli was immediately taken into custody.”
The department added that while Usiripalli was admitted to the US on a student visa, it added that he presently does not have any legal status in the country.
“The charge of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while travelling on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000,” the statement read.</p><small>2025-10-28 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281726021cc2c56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951777/rare-lenticular-cloud-formation-over-quetta-leaves-netizens-puzzled-over-origins' target='_blank'><strong>‘Rare lenticular cloud formation’ over Quetta leaves netizens puzzled over origins</strong></a><br><p>A “rare lenticular cloud formation” observed over Quetta in the early hours of Tuesday left the public puzzled over the phenomenon and its origins.
Citizens reported sighting the phenomenon around morning prayers from many parts of Balochistan and speculation was rife about the likely cause.
 
 

Many social media accounts hinted that the cloud formation was the result of a missile test or a new technology tested by the military.
In a post on X later in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said the sight was a “lenticular cloud formation” which was observed early morning over Koh-i-Murdar region.
“The cloud appeared before sunrise, persisted for approximately 20 minutes, and dissipated just prior to sunrise.”
 






As per the United Kingdom’s Met Office, lenticular clouds are lens-shaped orographic wave clouds that are formed when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.
“These strange, unnatural-looking clouds sometimes form downwind of hills or mountains … They look a lot like the traditional shape of flying saucers in science fiction, and real lenticular clouds are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO (unidentified flying object) sightings across the world,” it said.</p><small>2025-10-28 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281953224a07606.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951790/warnings-grow-of-executions-ethnic-cleansing-in-sudans-el-fasher-after-capture-by-paramilitary' target='_blank'><strong>Warnings grow of executions, ethnic cleansing in Sudan’s El-Fasher after capture by paramilitary</strong></a><br><p>Reports were mounting on Tuesday of ethnically motivated atrocities in the western Sudanese city of El-Fasher since its capture by paramilitaries, with allies of the army accusing fighters of executing “more than 2,000” civilians.
El-Fasher fell to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after more than 18 months of brutal siege warfare, giving the group control over every state capital in the vast Darfur region.
Allies of the army, the Joint Forces, said on Tuesday that the RSF “committed heinous crimes against innocent civilians in the city of El-Fasher, where more than 2,000 unarmed citizens were executed and killed on October 26 and 27, most of them women, children and the elderly”.
Local groups and international NGOs had warned that El-Fasher’s fall could trigger mass atrocities, fears that Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab said were coming true.
The monitor, which relies on open source intelligence and satellite imagery, said the city “appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa and Berti indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”.
This included what appeared to be “door-to-door clearance operations” in the city.
In a report published on Monday, it said the actions of the RSF “may be consistent with war crimes and crimes against humanity and may rise to the level of genocide”.
The same day, UN rights chief Volker Turk spoke of a growing risk of “ethnically motivated violations and atrocities” in El-Fasher.
His office said it was “receiving multiple, alarming reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out atrocities, including summary executions”.
Pro-democracy activists, meanwhile, said El-Fasher residents had endured “the worst forms of violence and ethnic cleansing” since the RSF claimed control.
A video released by local activists and authenticated by AFP shows a fighter known for executing civilians in RSF-controlled areas shooting a group of unarmed civilians sitting on the ground at point-blank range.
The paramilitaries have a track record of atrocities, having killed as many as 15,000 civilians from non-Arab groups in the West Darfur capital of El-Geneina.
The army, which has been fighting the RSF since April 2023, has also been accused of war crimes.
‘Harder to unwind’
More than a year and a half of siege warfare made El-Fasher one of the grimmest places in a war that the UN has labelled among the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
Displacement camps outside the city were officially declared to be in famine, while inside it, people turned to animal fodder for food.
The UN warned before the city’s fall that 260,000 people remained trapped there without aid, half of them children.
The African Union’s chairman Mahmoud Ali Youssouf on Tuesday expressed “deep concern over the escalating violence and reported atrocities”, and condemned “alleged war crimes and ethnically targeted killings of civilians”.
The Sudanese army chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said on Monday that his forces had withdrawn from El-Fasher “to a safer location”, acknowledging the loss of the strategic city.
He pledged to fight “until this land is purified”, but analysts said that Sudan was now effectively partitioned along an east-west axis, with the RSF having already set up a parallel government.
Alan Boswell, project director for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, told AFP: “The longer this war drags on, this division will likely only grow more concrete and harder to unwind.”
Foreign backers
Anwar Gargash, an adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates, called the city’s capture a “turning point” that showed “the political path is the only option to end the civil war”.
The UAE has been accused by the UN of supplying the RSF with weapons, a charge it denies. It is also a member of the so-called Quad — alongside the United States, Saudi Arabia and Egypt — which is working for a negotiated peace.
The group has proposed a ceasefire and a transitional civilian government that excludes both the army and the RSF from power.
Talks last week in Washington involving the Quad made no progress.
The army has its own foreign backers in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkiye, observers have reported. They too have denied the claims.
In March, the army retook full control of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, but with both sides now having achieved significant gains neither appears willing to compromise in negotiations.</p><small>2025-10-28 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28183125f3b84f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951784/at-least-6-suspects-killed-in-separate-encounters-in-lahore-ccd' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 suspects killed in separate ‘encounters’ in Lahore: CCD</strong></a><br><p>At least six suspects were killed in four separate encounters with the Crime Control Department (CCD) in different locations of Lahore late on Monday, the CCD said on Tuesday.
Earlier this year, the Punjab government launched the CCD with a mandate to tackle organised crime, terrorism, and high-profile criminal gangs. Recently, the body has carried out a range of encounters. Officials have publicly praised the department for its successes, claiming it has “significantly reduced street crime and targeted major criminal figures.”
As per a statement issued by the department’s spokesperson today, “CCD teams conducted four different encounters in Lahore’s Nishtar Colony, Green Town, Harbanspura, and Ring Road, where six suspects were killed.”
In the first instance, in Nishtar Colony, the CCD team came under attack while they were out to arrest the suspects, the statement said.
“An exchange of fire ensued, leaving two suspects dead by their associates’ fire,” the CCD said, adding that the “deceased had been involved in theft, previous encounters with the police, murder, and attempted murder.”
In a separate incident that took place in Green Town, a detained suspect was killed by his own associates, it said, adding that two suspects were killed in an encounter on Ring Road as they were attempting to rob citizens, it added.
The CCD spokesperson said, “The suspects opened fire on the police team. Two were killed while another two managed to escape.”
In the fourth encounter that took place in the Harbasnpura area, one of the suspects died after sustaining severe injuries during an exchange of fire with the police, the statement said.
“The injured suspect was taken to the hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries,” the CCD added.
Rising number of ‘encounters’
The mounting death toll during the encounters has sparked concerns among legal experts and civil society.
On October 14, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep alarm at the “growing normalisation” of police encounters, a pattern it says has become entrenched since the establishment of CCD as a special wing of the Punjab Police in February 2025.
The rights body highlighted that the “trend undermines the rule of law and constitutional guarantees of due process.”
According to data compiled by the HRCP, the province has witnessed more than 500 alleged encounters since January 2025, resulting in over 670 fatalities — a figure higher than in any other province.
Human rights monitors allege that extrajudicial killings are being used as a substitute for the criminal justice system.
Critics argue that the encounters often follow a similar narrative: a suspect is located, they open fire on police, and are subsequently killed in the ensuing shootout, leaving no possibility for arrest, investigation, or trial.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28172419c5b6a92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951779/every-missile-test-pakistan-has-conducted-in-recent-months' target='_blank'><strong>Every missile test Pakistan has conducted in recent months</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has tested multiple missile types over the last few years to increase its defence capabilities and also to ensure credible deterrence. The missiles range from ground-launched cruise missiles to medium-range ballistic missiles.
Fatah 4 cruise missile
On September 30, the Pakistan Army successfully conducted a training launch of a newly inducted, indigenously-produced Fatah-4 cruise missile at a range of 750 kilometres, the military’s media wing said.
“Equipped with advanced avionics and state-of-the-art navigational aids, this weapon system is capable of evading [the] enemy’s missile defence system due to terrain-hugging features and engaging targets with high precision,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.

Fatah surface-to-surface missile
On May 5, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah series surface-to-surface guided missile with a range of 120 kilometres, as part of ‘Ex Indus’, the ISPR said in a statement.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the statement read.

Abdali ballistic missile
Also in May, Pakistan successfully tested the Abdali weapon system, a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a reported range of 450 kilometres, the ISPR said.
Like the Fatah missile launched that month, the Abdali was also launched during ‘Ex Indus’.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced manoeuverability features,” the ISPR said in a press release.

Ship-launched ballistic missile
Last November, the Pakistan Navy conducted a successful flight test of an indigenously developed ship-launched ballistic missile, the Directorate General Public Relations (Navy) said in a press release.
The SMASH (Supersonic Missile Anti-SHip) missile, with a range of 350-kilometres, is capable of engaging land and sea targets with high precision.
“The missile system is equipped with a state-of-the-art navigation system and manoeuvrability features,” it added.

Shaheen-II
Last August, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of the Shaheen-II surface-to-surface ballistic missile, the military’s media affairs wing confirmed.
The ISPR said in a statement that the training launch was aimed at the training of troops, validating various technical parameters, and performance evaluation of different sub-systems incorporated for improved accuracy and enhanced survivability.

The Pakistan Army formed the Rocket Force Command earlier in August to bolster the nation’s defence capabilities. The army’s latest combatant arm was formed following the war with India in May.
The new command will be responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines.
The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger. PM Shehbaz described the force as “equipped with modern technology and having the capability to strike at the enemy from different directions… another milestone in strengthening our conventional warfare capacity.”</p><small>2025-10-28 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281820009a33ec5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951783/trump-says-seven-brand-new-beautiful-planes-shot-down-during-pakistan-india-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says seven ‘brand new, beautiful planes’ shot down during Pakistan-India war</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May.
Addressing a dinner with business leaders during his trip to Japan, Trump claimed that a lot of the wars he stopped were because of his tariffs imposed on multiple countries, stating that he did “a great service to the world”.
“If you look at India and Pakistan, they were going at it,” he said. “Seven brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down.
“I said to [Indian] Prime Minister Modi and I said to the Prime Minister [Shehbaz Sharif], very nice man, a very good man and the Field Marshal [Asim Munir] over in Pakistan … I said, ‘look we’re not going to do any trade if you’re going to be fighting’,” Trump said.
“We said ‘no, we’re not doing any deals if you’re going to fight’ and within 24 hours that was the end of that. It was amazing, actually,” he added. “I think trade is responsible for 70 per cent of the fact that we didn’t have wars.”
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281627501db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951772/peshawar-corps-commander-visited-to-congratulate-me-says-kp-cm-sohail-afridi' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar corps commander visited to congratulate me, says KP CM Sohail Afridi</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Tuesday said that the Peshawar corps commander visited the CM Secretariat earlier to “congratulate” him.
The CM shared this information while speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, where he was also asked what the two had discussed during the meeting.
“He came to congratulate me, and it was not an official [exchange]. The conversation was unofficial. And our stance is the same [everywhere], what we say inside is what we say outside,” Afridi replied.
 






Responding to a follow-up question, he further explained that he was the chief executive of a province and even the inspector general of police and the chief secretary had visited his office. Similarly, he continued, “the corps commander will also come there, and the officers of all of our security institutions will also come. We will discuss matters pertaining to the province with them.”
Apparently referring to security officials, he said they should visit the chief ministers and the prime minister’s office instead of the office holders going to them.
The CM also stressed that his government’s stance would be the same as that of the PTI and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.
Imran, who was has been in jail since 2023, had blamed former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for an alleged conspiracy that resulted in his ouster as the prime minister via a no-confidence vote in April 2022.
Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
Meanwhile, several PTI supporters have also been facing military trials and convictions following violent protests on May 9, 2023, over Imran’s arrest, during which civilian and military properties and installations were vandalised.
The PTI has also been opposing military operations in KP, even though Afridi’s immediate predecessor as the provincial chief executive, Ali Amin Gandapur, had deviated from the party line in the past and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military.
Gandapur was removed as the CM earlier this month on Imran’s directive while the PTI had named Afridi as his potential replacement. Later, Afridi was elected as the CM on October 13.
Three days before his election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership.
In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations?
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
Regarding another question about the change in KP leadership and how it might signal a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR stated that the establishment is itself a part of the state.
“Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’
‘Courts held hostage’
Speaking outside the SC today, KP CM Afridi alleged that courts had been “held hostage” since April 9, 2022, when Imran was ousted as the premier.
“We are firmly standing alongside the judges who want to deliver justice,” he said, regretting that a superintended was disregarding judges’ directives — an apparent reference to relevant authorities not allowing him to meet Imran in jail despite court orders.
He said his name was in the visitor’s list for Imran today, adding that if he was denied a meeting even today, he would wait for the court’s decision.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28181758f6c1437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951778/multan-sultans-look-to-ease-tensions-with-pcb-send-proposal-for-stronger-psl' target='_blank'><strong>Multan Sultans look to ease tensions with PCB, send proposal for ‘stronger’ PSL</strong></a><br><p>Amid recent tensions between Multan Sultans and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the PSL franchise on Tuesday submitted a proposal to the PCB aimed at strengthening the Pakistan Super League “through better governance, transparency, and partnership”, according to a statement.
The letter to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi “acknowledges recent tensions but frames this as an opportunity to rebuild trust and put professional systems in place so the PSL can reach its full potential.”
 






According to the statement, Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen reaffirmed the franchise’s long-standing commitment to the league.
The letter notes concerns about ad hoc decision-making and limited management experience, and calls for institutional processes and accountability, the statement read.
Four key reforms were proposed by Multan Sultans, beginning with franchise representation on PSL committees and working groups.
“Formal inclusion of every franchise so policies reflect the league’s collective experience across scheduling, recruitment, ticketing, marketing, and match-day operations,” the statement said, requesting the establishment of a “structured way for franchises to add value to each part of the PSL’s planning and implementation.”
The second reform was on structured hiring for key PSL roles. “Franchise participation in defining roles, vetting candidates, and providing input prior to selection to improve merit-based recruitment and professional standards.
“The PSL has the ability to attract top regional talent and should not have to rely primarily on current or former PCB employees.”
Multan Sultans called for ‘professional management structure’ in their third reform, suggesting “a clear organisational chart with defined departments for operations, marketing, fan engagement, player affairs, and finance, led by a qualified executive team.
The fourth and final reform was aimed at ‘regular reporting to franchises’.
“Monthly meetings on fixed dates with agendas circulated in advance, minutes recorded and shared, and action points tracked across finances, operations, marketing, ticketing, player affairs, and fan engagement.
“This will increase accountability and collaboration,” the statement read.
According to Multan Sultans, the proposal emphasises “partnership over control and aligns all stakeholders around the shared goal of building a globally respected league for Pakistan and its fans.
“After a successful decade, Multan Sultans feel it is time to take the PSL to the next level,” the statement concluded.
The development comes after the franchise, and more specifically Tareen, has been embroiled in a saga with the PCB.
Tareen hit out at Pakistan Super League management late on Thursday stating he was “unhappy at their mediocre mindset” after his franchise was issued a legal notice threatening suspension over breach of contractual obligations.
Earlier that day, the PSL management had acted following repeated public statements by Tareen criticising the PCB and PSL, and had sought a public apology if the latter wished to avoid legal proceedings.
 
 

Tareen then posted a video on social media platform X on Thursday night, in which he could be seen holding what seemed to be the legal notice sent by the PSL management, saying he wanted to apologise but demanded better of the league organisers.
Making sharp remarks targeted the PSL management, he ended the video by tearing up what seemed to be the legal notice he had received.
In a post on X today, Tareen wrote: “Even though tearing the notice was quite satisfying, it’s time to move forward.
“In recognition of the PSL as a national asset, we’re putting grievances aside and aiming for a fresh relationship with the board. One built on transparency, cooperation and trust.

The PML-N and PPP — coalition partners in the federal government — announced yesterday that they will jointly bring about a no-trust motion against AJK Prime Minister Haq.
The PML-N has said it would support the no-trust motion against the AJK premier but would not become part of the government, and instead would be in the opposition. PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira said his party accepted that decision.
Today, Iqbal chaired a meeting of the PML-N’s “political coordination committee” at his planning ministry in Islamabad on the directives of PM Shehbaz Sharif.
Kashmir affairs minister Amir Muqam and Adviser to PM on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah were among the meeting’s participants, while PML-N’s AJK President Shah Ghulam Qadir was leading his parliamentary party.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Iqbal said: “This is proof of great democratic maturity that two major stakeholders are agreeing on bringing a vote of no confidence, considering Kashmir’s political situation and for better governance there.
“And they have also agreed that if one party is part of the government, the other party will play its role in the opposition. This is a sign of a mature democratic system,” he added.
 


“We will also demand that the new government that comes into power conduct independent and fair elections as soon as possible, so that a stable government can be formed in Kashmir through which it can proceed speedily on its journey of progress,” the PML-N leader said.
Iqbal further said that while his party was part of the previous coalition government, it was a “minority stakeholder”, emphasising that the PML-N parliamentary party in AJK had consistently demanded to be “separated from the current government” because of its poor performance.
Iqbal asserted that other stakeholders and parties had also supported the PML-N stance that the “coalition setup was not a solution” to Azad Kashmir’s issues.
Responding to a reporter’s query, Muqam asserted that the agreement signed earlier this month with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) will be implemented, regardless of the government in power.
 
 

Speaking to reporters earlier today, Muqam stated that the PML-N’s decision to be part of the opposition benches in the AJK Legislative Assembly would not hurt ties with the PPP.
“There will be no impact on our relations, the PPP knows this and we do too.”
Asked whether there was a possibility of the PTI and the PPP coming together to form a coalition government in AJK, Muqam said, “There is no such chance.”
Yesterday, a PML-N panel, led by Iqbal and comprising Muqam and Sanaullah, called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss possible options for the formation of the AJK government to be led by the PPP.
Both parties have ratcheted up pressure on the embattled premier to step down from the post, or face a VONC in the region’s legislative assembly.
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members, and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members.
The PPP, whose ranks swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the forward bloc joined it on Sunday, can comfortably gather the needed votes with the support of PML-N’s nine members in the assembly.
The PTI has four members, and the Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party each have one member.
In light of this situation, the incumbent PM was reportedly advised to opt for an “honourable exit” by resigning as he had lost the support of the majority. He has three options: dissolve the assembly to prevent the party from coming to power, step down, or face a no-confidence vote.</p><small>2025-10-28 11:11</small></div><hr>
