• Worst death toll in a single day since aid resumed in May
CAIRO: Israeli tanks fired into a crowd trying to get aid from trucks in Gaza on Tuesday, killing at least 59 people, according to medics, in one of the bloodiest incidents yet as desperate residents struggle for food.
Medics said at least 14 other people were also killed by Israeli gunfire and air strikes elsewhere in the densely populated enclave, taking Tuesday’s overall death toll to at least 73.
Video shared on social media showed around a dozen mangled bodies lying in a street in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli military acknowledged firing in the area and said it was looking into the incident.
Witnesses interviewed by Reuters said Israeli tanks had launched at least two shells at a crowd of thousands who had gathered on the main eastern road through Khan Yunis in the hope of obtaining food from aid trucks that use the route.
Palestinian medics said at least 59 people were killed and 221 wounded in the incident, at least 20 of them in critical condition. Casualties were being rushed into the hospital in civilian cars, rickshaws and donkey carts. It was the worst death toll in a single day since aid resumed in Gaza in May.
In a statement, the Israeli military said: “Earlier today, a gathering was identified adjacent to an aid distribution truck that got stuck in the area of Khan Yunis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area.
The health ministry said 397 Palestinians, among those trying to get food aid, had been killed and more than 3,000 were wounded since late May.

The meeting, listed on the president’s official schedule, will be held in the Cabinet Room and closed to the press.
The lunch is being seen in Islamabad as a major diplomatic win — particularly because earlier this month, an Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance , and Indian media depicted it as a diplomatic success, contrasting it with the apparent inability of the Pakistani delegation to secure a similar meeting. Munir’s invitation to the White House is now being projected by officials in Islamabad as a diplomatic counterpoint to those narratives.
This development also marks a notable success for Pakistan in the ongoing diplomatic contest that followed last month’s air combat with India — a confrontation that brought South Asia dangerously close to nuclear conflict. Munir is in the US on a five-day official visit.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir, who was elevated to Pakistan’s rare five-star rank last month — the first such promotion since Ayub Khan in 1959 — has made headlines during his trip, urging India to engage with Pakistan “as a civilized nation,” rather than attempting to impose regional hegemony.
Speaking to members of the Pakistani American community on Monday evening, he strongly rejected Indian claims that Pakistan was behind the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, calling it a pretext for cross-border aggression. He accused India of seeking to establish a dangerous “new normal” of violating international borders, which Pakistan had forcefully rejected. “We would rather embrace martyrdom than accept this dishonor,” he said.
The interaction at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington’s Georgetown neighbourhood drew a large and enthusiastic crowd, with supporters showering the army chief with rose petals and chanting slogans in his praise. Protesters aligned with the opposition PTI party demonstrated outside, calling for democratic reforms and the release of jailed leaders, but their voices were largely drowned out inside the venue.
In his remarks, Munir also addressed the broader regional landscape, declaring Pakistan’s “clear and strong” support for Iran in its war with Israel while also backing US efforts to de-escalate the situation. “We want this war to end immediately,” he said.
One of the most consequential developments during Munir’s visit, however, has been Pakistan’s strengthened counterterrorism partnership with the United States — particularly against the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) group. On Tuesday, Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, described Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the fight against IS-K, praising Islamabad’s operations along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
Gen. Kurilla revealed to the House Armed Services Committee that Pakistani operations, supported by US intelligence, had killed dozens of IS-K militants and captured multiple high-value individuals, including Mohammad Sharifullah, one of the masterminds of the Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul that killed 13 American troops.
“The first person Munir called was me,” Gen Kurilla said. “He said, ‘I’ve caught him — ready to extradite him back to the US Please tell the Secretary of Defence and the President’.” Sharifullah was promptly extradited.
In a separate statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kurilla noted that Pakistan had conducted “dozens of operations” to dismantle IS-K’s presence in the border regions and continues to play a pivotal role in countering terrorism in Central and South Asia.
 
 

The Centcom chief’s comments reflect a growing acknowledgment in Washington that Pakistan remains essential to regional stability. As Kurilla noted, while the Taliban have pushed IS-K militants into the tribal areas, these sanctuaries still allow the group to plan and plot attacks not just against regional allies, but also the US homeland.
Despite the security challenges Pakistan faces — including over 1,000 terrorist attacks last year alone, which claimed the lives of some 700 security personnel and 2,500 civilians — Gen Kurilla said Pakistan “has been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world”.
During his interaction with the diaspora community, Gen Munir emphasised Pakistan’s gratitude for the role overseas Pakistanis play in bolstering the national economy. He dismissed concerns over brain drain, describing it instead as a “brain gain.”
He avoided discussing domestic politics directly, and when one attendee attempted to criticise former prime minister Imran Khan, Munir discouraged it. When another guest jokingly suggested that political opponents might need their “software fixed,” the general responded that democratic societies must protect the right to dissent.
The evening concluded with pledges of renewed commitment from both the army chief and the diaspora to work toward a stronger, more resilient Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-18 03:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18074350a043de1.jpg?r=074707' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917737/imran-puts-off-protest-due-to-middle-east-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Imran puts off protest ‘due to Middle East situation’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI patron-in-chief, Imran Khan, has delayed his party’s countrywide protest for at least two weeks owing to the situation in the Middle East.
This was announced by Mr Khan’s sisters, Noreen Niazi and Uzma, after they met their brother in Adiala Jail on Tuesday.
Mr Khan’s third sister, Aleema, was not allowed to meet her brother.
 






Talking to the media, Ms Niazi said her brother was “well aware of the international situation” and said that Pakistan should remain united during Iran-Israel war.
Ms Uzma said the world already knew about Mr Khan’s stance against Israel.
Earlier, Mr Khan had called upon his supporters to start preparations for countrywide protests after Eidul Azha.
PTI Central Infor­mation Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram also confirmed that Mr Khan has delayed the protests for two weeks.
“We are passing through very sensitive time. So it has been decided that the party will not hold any protest for two weeks,” Mr Akram told Dawn.
Raoof Hasan, the head of PTI’s political think tank, stated the global situation, particularly in the Middle East, was rapidly changing.
“It is the need of time to stop all kinds of protests and give a message that the whole nation is united,” he added.

This means propaganda and disinformation campaigns are now infinitely more chaotic, and it is much more difficult to track malign actors who make it difficult for the public to discern truth from fiction. We saw this recently during the brief skirmish between Pakistan and India, where narrative subterfuge was used by both sides, particularly India, to make it difficult for ordinary people to discern exactly what was happening on the ground.
We are now seeing it again in the Iran-Israel conflict, as various stakeholders aligned with each party’s interests are pushing narratives that suit their aims.
A concerning sub-theme in this narrative war is the rumour-mongering about the involvement of Pakistan’s armed forces and its nuclear weapons in the conflict, which prompted officials here to issue a public clarification that the country’s nuclear deterrent is focused on its eastern neighbour and meant only for defensive purposes.
There are many social media accounts active on platforms like X which have a substantial global reach and whose only job, it seems, is to shape public opinion with xenophobic and Islamophobic messaging.
Interestingly, many of these accounts have been found to be operated by individuals who are far removed from the countries and contexts they comment so prolifically on. The role of Indian disinformation networks, for example, has been highlighted in international investigations. Given the sensitive nature of the situation in the Middle East, it is important for Pakistan to remain wary of what is being said and keep communicating its official position clearly.
Fake news is dangerous, especially when the fog of war descends. Sadly, it seems that some in the neighbourhood are quite eager to utilise it to continue fomenting trouble for this country.

This funding will support humanitarian organisations working inside Afghanistan with over 141m euros, while also responding to the needs of Afghan citizens and refugees in Pakistan and Iran, with 10m euros allocated per country.
The announcement comes as senior representatives of the humanitarian community gathered in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss Afghanistan’s current situation, main challenges, and ways forward.
 
 

The EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, said: “As the Afghan people continue to face numerous hardships, both within Afghanistan and in Pakistan and Iran, the EU remains ready to help them.”
Particularly concerning are the needs of the thousands of Afghans that have been recently returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, a situation that is only adding to the population’s suffering. This EU funding will provide much needed aid to the most vulnerable, so they can get food, healthcare, education and other essential services.
EU humanitarian aid is solely channelled through humanitarian partners working on the ground.

• TV, radio, newspapers losing ground to social networks, video-sharing platforms
PARIS: People are increasingly turning to generative artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT to follow day-to-day news, a respected media report published on Tuesday found.
The yearly survey from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found “for the first time” that significant numbers of people were using chatbots to get headlines and updates, director Mitali Mukherjee wrote.
Attached to Britain’s Oxford University, the Reuters Institute annual report is seen as unmissable for people following the evolution of media.
 
 

Text remains the most preferred way for people worldwide to consume news, although around a third say they prefer to watch the news online and 15 per cent say they prefer to listen.
Younger people are much more likely to prefer watching or listening to the news.
The trend is particularly acute among young Americans. Over half of people under age 35 in the US are relying on social media and video networks as their main source for news, the report found.
Across the countries that the report surveyed, 44pc of people aged 18 to 24 said these networks are their main source of news.
The biggest-name chatbot — OpenAI’s ChatGPT — is the most widely used, followed by Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama.
Respondents appreciated relevant, personalised news from chatbots.
Many more used AI to summarise (27pc), translate (24pc) or recommend (21pc) articles, while almost one in five asked questions about current events.
Distrust remains, with those polled on balance saying AI risked making the news less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.
In addition, the report found that prominent podcasters like Joe Rogan are playing a bigger role in news dissemination in the United States.
Traditional US news media increasingly risks being eclipsed by online personalities and creators.
One-fifth of a sampled group of Americans came across news or commentary from podcaster Rogan in the week following the presidential inauguration, the report found, while 14pc of respondents said they had come across former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson discussing or commenting on news during that period.
Despite their popularity, online influencers and personalities are seen as the biggest sources of false or misleading information worldwide, along with politicians, the report found. In the United States, politicians are considered the biggest sources of false or misleading information.
News still a draw for X
The Reuters Institute report also pointed to traditional media — TV, radio, newspapers and news sites — losing ground to social networks and video-sharing platforms.
The institute found that many are still using Elon Musk-owned social media platform X for news, despite a rightward shift since the world’s richest man took it over.
“Many more right-leaning people, notably young men, have flocked to the network, while some progressive audiences have left or are using it less frequently,” the authors wrote.
Some 23pc of people in the United States reported using X for news, up 8pc on 2024’s survey, with usage also rising in countries like Australia and Poland.

The Israeli military said two barrages of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel in the first two hours of Wednesday morning. Explosions were heard over Tel Aviv.
Israel told residents in the area of Tehran to evacuate so its air force could strike Iranian military installations. Iranian news websites said explosions were heard in Tehran and the city of Karaj west of the capital.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps said that hypersonic missiles were used during the latest attack on Israel, AFP reported.
“The 11th wave of the proud Operation Honest Promise 3 using Fattah-1 missiles” was carried out, the Guards said in a statement carried by state television, claiming that Iranian forces “have gained complete control over the skies of the occupied territories”.
In a series of posts on Truth Social, the President Trump’s increasingly irate tone and choice of words indicated that the US was not far from intervening to support Israel, its closest ally in the region.
“We now have completely and total control of the skies over Iran,” he posted, prompting many to question what he meant by ‘we’.
The US president has maintained that his country is not involved in the Iran-Israel conflict yet, but threatened Iran with severe consequences if it targeted US troops and assets in the Middle East.
He then posted ‘UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER’, an apparent demand addressed at Tehran.
Trump also made a veiled threat against Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying “we know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding… We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now”.
Trump met for 90 minutes with his National Security Council on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the conflict, a White House official said.
The meeting in the White House Situation Room lasted around one hour and 20 minutes, a White House official said.
The most likely option under consideration by Trump would be the use of giant US “bunker-buster” bombs against Iran’s deeply buried Fordow nuclear facility that Israel’s bombs cannot reach.
The BBC’s Frank Gardner termed it the “30,000lb question”; the US has them, Israel doesn’t, he noted.
The New York Times said Trump was also considering allowing US tanker aircraft to refuel Israeli combat jets so they could carry out long range missions.
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the US military was deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes.
The deployments include F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, and officials said had so far been used to shoot down drones and projectiles targeting Israel.
Four US Stratofortress bombers are currently stationed at a remote US base in the Indian Ocean, an AFP analysis of satellite imagery indicated.
The four B52H bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons or other precision-guided munitions, were spotted on a southern tarmac at Diego Garcia on Monday at 0922 GMT.
A White House official said Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Tuesday.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also described the deployments as defensive in nature.
The US already has a sizeable force in the Middle East, with nearly 40,000 troops in the region, including air defence systems, fighter aircraft and warships that can detect and shoot down enemy missiles.
US lawmaker Thomas Massie said that he introduced an Iran War Powers Resolution with fellow lawmaker Ro Khanna to prohibit US involvement in the Israel-Iran war.
“This is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our constitution,” he said.
Trump’s sometimes contradictory and cryptic messaging about the conflict between close US ally Israel and longtime foe Iran has deepened the uncertainty surrounding the crisis. His public comments have ranged from military threats to diplomatic overtures, not uncommon for a president known for an often erratic approach to foreign policy.
 
 

Britain’s leader Keir Starmer, speaking at the Group of Seven nations summit in Canada that Trump left early, said there was no indication the US was about to enter the conflict.
US said that it will close its embassy in Jerusalem until Friday amid the growing military conflict between Israel and Iran, as speculation mounts about possible American intervention, AFP reported.
“Given the security situation and in compliance with Israel Home Front Command guidance, the US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed tomorrow (Wednesday, June 18) through Friday (June 20),” the embassy said in a statement posted on Tuesday to its website.
Regional influence weakens
Khamenei’s main military and security advisers have been killed by Israeli strikes, hollowing out his inner circle and raising the risk of strategic errors, according to five people familiar with his decision-making process.
 
 

With Iranian leaders suffering their most dangerous security breach since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the country’s cybersecurity command banned officials from using communications devices and mobile phones, Fars news agency reported.
Israel launched a “massive cyber war” against Iran’s digital infrastructure, Iranian media reported.
Israel launched its air war, its largest ever on Iran, on Friday after saying it concluded Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and has pointed to its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Netanyahu has stressed that he will not back down until Iran’s nuclear development is disabled, while Trump says the Israeli assault could end if Iran agrees to strict curbs on enrichment.
Before Israel’s attack began, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years.
The IAEA said on Tuesday an Israeli strike directly hit the underground enrichment halls at the Natanz facility.
Israel says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.
But Israel will struggle to deal a knock-out blow to deeply buried nuclear sites like Fordow, which is dug beneath a mountain, without the US joining the attack.
Iranian officials have reported 224 deaths, mostly civilians, while Israel said 24 civilians had been killed. Residents of both countries have been evacuated or fled.
Global oil markets are on high alert following strikes on sites including the world’s biggest gas field, South Pars, shared by Iran and Qatar.</p><small>2025-06-18 03:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18080031f773928.jpg?r=080149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917734/army-chief-asks-india-to-engage-with-pakistan-like-a-civilised-nation' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief asks India to engage with Pakistan like a ‘civilised nation’</strong></a><br><p>• Field Marshal Munir indicates country stands by Iran, but also backs US peace efforts
• Says that in a democracy, people have the right to express their views
WASHINGTON: Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has urged India to engage with Pakistan as a “civilised nation” rather than trying to impose its hegemony on the region.
In an interaction with the Pakistani Ame­rican community on Monday evening, he also stated that Islamabad “stro­n­gly supports Iran” in its war with Israel, while backing US efforts to end the conflict.
The army chief, who is on an official visit to the United States this week, received a warm welcome from a large gathering of Pakistani Americans — some of whom had travelled from as far as California and Texas.
He was garlanded and showered with rose petals upon arrival at the Four Sea­sons Hotel in Georgetown, Washington. Outside the venue, about half a dozen PTI supporters staged a protest, demanding the release of jailed party founder Imran Khan and other leaders and the restoration of “full democracy” in Pakistan.
Inside, however, the crowd’s enthusiastic chants of “Muhafiz Munir Zindabad!” easily drowned out the protesters. Supporters praised the armed forces’ performance during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos against India, lauding their bravery and professionalism.
The slogans began as soon as the COAS expressed appreciation for the vital role overseas Pakistanis play in strengthening the national economy, particularly through remittances. The migration of skilled Pakistanis abroad, he said, was “not a brain drain, but a brain gain” for the country.
His remarks drew the first of more than a dozen standing ovations he received that evening — each lasting several minutes.
Field Marshal Munir spoke in detail about last month’s clashes with India, stating that New Delhi had launched this “misadventure” in an attempt to impose its own version of a new world order — one that includes violating the sovereignty of other nations under false pretenses.
He firmly rejected the allegation that Pakistan was involved in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, stating that India had used the incident as a pretext to bomb targets inside Pakistan.
“India attempted to establish a ‘new normal’ — a dangerous precedent of crossing international borders at will,” he said. “But we reje­c­ted this new normal and demonstrated that Pakistan has the strength to resist India’s hegemonic ambitions.”
“We would rather embrace martyrdom than accept this dishonour,” the army chief declared, urging India to pursue peace through dialogue. “Let us address our differences like civilised nations — on equal footing,” he said.
 
 

Explaining how India was sponsoring terrorist attacks inside Pakistan, the COAS said that while Pakistan had been “the biggest sufferer” of terrorism, India was “the biggest beneficiary” — and that was why New Delhi was not interested in eliminating terrorism.
Addressing the issue of extremism, the army chief recalled that there was no such menace in Pakistan during the 1970s. “People of all sects participated in Muharram … I remember seeing Western tourists moving freely in Rawalpindi. We want that Pakistan back,” he declared.
He noted that during the conflict, there was “textbook harmony” and synergy between Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership. He even thanked Indian PM Narendra Modi — tongue-in-cheek — for “uniting the entire nation by invading their motherland”.
The army chief avoided commenting on domestic politics. When a member of the audience attempted to make negative remarks about Imran Khan, he was stopped.
Later, when another participant suggested that critics of the government should have their “software fixed,” Field Marshal Munir respon­ded that in a democracy, people have the right to express their views.
Speaking about the Iran-Israel war, he said: “We have taken a clear and strong position in support of Iran and are playing an active role in efforts to de-escalate the situation.”
He noted that the United States was also “doing its best” to bring the conflict to an end. “We want this war to end immediately,” he said, adding that Pakistan was working with other countries to help defuse tensions.

• Major initiatives include infrastructure projects, reforms, job creation and restoration of peace       • Minister Nausherwani claims entire development fund of Rs219bn fully utilised for first time in outgoing year
QUETTA: The PPP-led government in Balochistan on Tuesday presented its second budget of the current term, featuring a record outlay of Rs1.03 trillion and proposing a development expenditure of Rs349.5 billion.
The budget for the fiscal year of 2025-26 also commits to ‘austerity’ in its current expenditure, aiming to produce a provincial cash surplus of Rs36.5bn, according to budget documents.
The budget was presented by Finance Minis­ter Mir Shoaib Nausherwani in the Balochistan Assembly, who claimed it was “not a mere document”, but a “roadmap for sustainable economic progress” of the strife-ridden province.
He claimed the government fully utilised the development budget — Rs219bn — for the first time in history in the outgoing fiscal year.
In comparison, the average utilisation had been 60pc during the three previous years.
The budget projects most of its receipts — Rs801bn — in the shape of its share from the federal tax divisible pool and straight transfers.
 
 

Meanwhile, revenue generation from the pro­vince’s own-source is estimated to be Rs101bn, including Rs48bn from levy on services.
The federal and foreign assistance for development projects is estimated to be Rs104.5bn.
The current expenditure is projected to stay around Rs642bn while the development allocations of Rs349bn include provincial PSDP of Rs245bn, federal assisted schemes of Rs66.5bn and foreign assisted projects of Rs38bn.
Mr Nausherwani said the government would will extend the ban on the purchase of new cars except for law enforcement agencies as a part of its austerity drive.
He claimed the government had reduced its budgeted current expenditure during the outgoing fiscal year from Rs609bn to Rs544bn by cutting wasteful spe­n­ding and increased total allocations for development to Rs243bn.
Major initiatives
“The major initiatives of the government for the FY 2025-26 include improving the basic infrastructure in far-off and backward areas of the province, preemptive measures to deal with emergency situations, introduction of modern reforms, strengthening of social sector, steps for social protection, creation of job opportunities and restoration of complete peace,” said Mr Nausherwani in his budget speech.
He claimed the budget document proposed steps for the welfare of all segments of society, including public servants, women, pensioners, youth, fishermen and labourers.
The government has proposed an increase of 10pc increase in salaries and a 7pc in pensions of all public-sector employees, in line with the federal government’s decision.
The Disparity Reduction Allowance for the government employees from Grade 1 to 16 has been increased to 20pc.
The minister said the government had abolished 6,000 extra jobs as part of its downsizing drive in various provincial departments under advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to save Rs14bn for development schemes during the current fiscal year.
However, he also announced plans to create 4,188 new contract and 1,958 regular posts in government departments next year to accommodate the youth entering the job market.
He said the government would has proposed projects in the next fiscal year that would “change the fortune of the people”.
These projects include safe city authorities in eight more cities with an allocation of Rs18bn, Rs20bn for public welfare at the district level, Rs3bn for sanitation schemes and 1,000 water filtration plants at the union council level and Rs25bn for the construction of a dam in Mashkel.
Mr Nausherwani added that Rs16bn have been allocated for the skill development of youth and ext­e­n­ding interest-free loans to them.
Sustainable development
The minister claimed his government’s priority would be projects to meet Sustainable Development Goals in FY26.
Such projects would include the construction of new dams, roads, indu­s­trial zones, terminals, railways sche­mes, microfinance and agriculture.
He said for the first time, a Rs500m grant is being allocated to protect the environment under the Balochistan Climate Change Fund.
Rs8bn have been earmarked for all universities of Balochistan, while the Higher Education Commi­ssion has also allocated Rs3bn.
He said the government would spend Rs28bn on Early childhood education and primary education in the next fiscal, while it allocated Rs6.7bn for Global Partnership Education.
The provincial government has allocated Rs16.4bn for the health sector and Rs71bn for the non-development budget.

Iran, which has denied such intentions, has in the past threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz for traffic in retaliation to Western pressure. Experts have said that any closure of the strait could restrict trade and impact global oil prices.
Below are details about the strait: The strait lies between Oman and Iran and links the Gulf north of it with the Gulf of Oman to the south and the Arabian Sea beyond. It is 21 miles (33 km) wide at its narrowest point, with the shipping lane just 2 miles (3 km) wide in either direction.
Why does it matter?
About a fifth of the world’s total oil consumption passes through the strait. Between the start of 2022 and last month, roughly 17.8 million to 20.8m barrels of crude, condensate and fuels flowed through the strait daily, according to data from Vortexa.
 


The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the strait, mainly to Asia. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have sought to find other routes to bypass the strait.
Around 2.6m bpd of unused capacity from existing UAE and Saudi pipelines could be available to bypass Hormuz, the US Energy Information Administration said in June last year.
Qatar, among the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas exporters, sends almost all of its LNG through the strait.
Iran has threatened over the years to block the strait but has never followed through.
The US Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is tasked with protecting commercial shipping in the area.
History of tensions
In 1973, Arab producers led by Saudi Arabia slapped an oil embargo on Western supporters of Israel in its war with Egypt.
While Western countries were the main buyers of crude produced by the Arab countries at the time, nowadays Asia is the main buyer of OPEC’s crude.
The United States more than doubled its oil liquids production in the last two decades and has turned from the world’s biggest oil importer into one of the top exporters.
During the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, the two sides sought to disrupt each other’s exports in what was called the Tanker War.
In July 1988, a US warship shot down an Iranian airliner, killing all 290 aboard, in what Washington said was an accident and Tehran said was a deliberate attack.
In January 2012, Iran threatened to block the strait in retaliation for US and European sanctions. In May 2019, four vessels — including two Saudi oil tankers — were attacked off the UAE coast, outside the Strait of Hormuz.
In July 2021, an Israeli-managed oil tanker was attacked off Oman’s coast, killing two crew members, with Israel blaming Iran for the incident, which Iran denied.
Three vessels, two in 2023 and one in 2024, were seized by Iran near or in the Strait of Hormuz.
On June 17, 2025, two oil tankers collided and caught fire, near the Strait of Hormuz, where electronic interference has surged during the conflict between Iran and Israel, but there were no injuries to crew or spillage reported.</p><small>2025-06-18 02:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17232020bcc0d2b.jpg?r=232114' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917714/gb-fines-hotel-rs15m-for-allegedly-dumping-sewage-into-attabad-lake' target='_blank'><strong>GB fines hotel Rs1.5m for allegedly dumping sewage into Attabad Lake</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan administration on Tuesday imposed a fine of Rs1.5 million on a hotel for allegedly dumping sewage waste into Hunza’s Attabad Lake.
The development came a day after a foreign tourist and vlogger named George Buckley posted a video on his Instagram page, claiming that sewage water was being pumped out by the hotel into the Attabad Lake
In the video, Buckley could be seen standing next to the lake with a friend and saying: “We found out some information through a local that the sewage is actually being pumped into the water.”
The tourist also showed muddy water being mixed into the lake.
The post gained significant traction on social media, prompting a response from the hotel.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The hotel dismissed the claims in a social media post today, saying, “This lake has been home for us for the last six years.”
“… To dump sewage water into the lake would be like desecrating our own house. We have never nor will we ever dump a single litre of wastewater into Attabad Lake.”
The post also said that the muddy appearance of the water near the hotel was due to adjacent water streams carrying mud, rocks and minerals, which
mixed with the lake water.
“This phenomenon is known as confluence, where two separately flowing water bodies meet. If one of the water bodies is high in turbidity, then this causes a muddy/cloudy water surface at the point of confluence.”
Buckley responded in the comments section of the hotel’s video, saying, “The only document you have provided to me and the public that looks into this environmental issue was the report from July 2021.
“I’ve asked 3 times to see an inspection report after that date conducted by the EPA and local government (which was suggested to be done quarterly in the 2021 report), yet you have provided nothing over the last 17 hours since I asked the first time.”
He also said that the property smelled “badly of sewage”, adding, “Nothing that a natural occurrence like the silt runoff would create, not even close.”
GB Environment Department Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn.com that the administration had taken action against the hotel on a complaint made by a foreign tourist alleging that waste from the hotel was being dumped into the lake.
He said, “The administration has imposed a fine of Rs1.5 million and sealed a large part of the hotel consisting of 30 rooms from where the sewage water had entered the lake.”
According to Hussain, after the video went viral on the internet, the GB chief secretary took immediate action and sought a report from the Hunza deputy commissioner, resulting in a 15-member team inspecting Attabad Lake today.
Hussain said there was “evidence that water pollution had been found when human waste from the hotel entered the lake”.
He added: “The hotel administration was repairing the sewage line at the time when the waste had entered the lake, but there was no major pollution. The fine was imposed on the hotel for
negligence.”
He said that a report will be sent to the chief secretary on Wednesday to decide further steps, adding that the matter will be heard at the magistrate’s court for legal proceedings.
He further said that “strict action was taken against the hotel in October 2024 for causing water pollution.”
Speaking to Dawn.com, Hunza journalist Alamgir Hussain said that the locals have protested several times against the hotel for allegedly causing “severe pollution in the lake”.
“But due to its effectiveness, the administration has been avoiding action,” he alleged.
Hussain said that hotels and buildings cannot be legally constructed on the banks of the lake.
“The laws in this regard are also clear, but the administration is helpless before the hotel administration. If foreign tourists had not pointed it out, there would have been no action,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-18 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171736368cc47d9.png?r=183738' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917693/ptis-gohar-suggests-tax-exemption-for-salaried-class-earning-upto-rs22m-annually' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Gohar suggests tax exemption for salaried class earning upto Rs2.2m annually</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan on Tuesday suggested increasing the minimum taxable income to Rs2.2 million per annum from the current Rs0.6m to provide relief to the salaried class.
The government has proposed a new income tax structure in the federal budget. The revised rates offer tax cuts of up to 80 per cent for low-income salaried individuals, while limiting relief for higher earners to just 3pc. The tax exemption limit has remained unc­h­anged at Rs50,000 per month.
Speaking in the National Assembly on Tuesday during ongoing budget discussions, Gohar proposed that employees earning up to Rs2.2m annually should be exempted from income tax.
 
 

“In the income tax slabs, there is no tax on earnings up to Rs600,000 per year. This should be increased to Rs 2.2m or it will be an injustice,” the PTI leader asserted.
Taxpayers earning between Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m annually will now face a 1pc tax rate, down from 5pc, offering up to 80pc tax reduction. For annual incomes between Rs1.2m and Rs2.2m, the rate will drop to 11pc from 15pc (on the amount exceeding Rs1.2m).
For annual salaries bet­ween Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m, the rate drops from 25pc to 23pc (on the income exceeding Rs2.2m). No percentage change was made for the remaining two slabs, except reductions in the fixed sums.
A 1pc surcharge reduction has been proposed for individuals earning above Rs10m to discourage skilled professionals from emigrating. Meanwhile, pensioners drawing over Rs10m annually will now be taxed at 5pc.
 


During the NA session, Gohar also expressed concern over high budgetary allocations for several government departments.
He stated that the National Accountability Bureau had been allocated Rs7.5 billion despite “filing less than a hundred accountability cases last year”.
“The previous PDM government made amendments that there will be no accountability below Rs500m,” he said, referring to the changes to the country’s anti-graft laws that were upheld by the Supreme Court last year.
As a result, Gohar said, the accountability watchdog only filed 98 cases. He added that the National Assembly has been allocated a budget of Rs16bn despite being “one of the worst performing in the world”.
The PTI chairman further said that the “actual” inflation rate was much higher than projected.
“The government is claiming inflation has reduced to 3.7pc, but the policy rate is 11pc. The actual inflation rate is much higher. If it was 3.7pc, the policy rate would be 7-8pc,” he told the NA.
Stressing the need for “out-of-the-box solutions” to provide relief to the public, Gohar claimed Pakistan had the lowest growth rate among the least developed economies, and the highest level of people living below the poverty line.
A recent report by the World Bank, issued based on a survey conducted in 2018-19, stated that almost 45pc of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line. The findings came in the wake of World Bank’s update of global poverty lines.
 
 

Speaking on other budgetary measures, the PTI leader recommended abolishing the stamp duty on property sales.
He also criticised the government for failing to bring pension reforms or completing the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines.
‘Inadequate health budget’
Gohar also expressed concerns over reducing the federal health budget from Rs 54bn to Rs46bn and allegedly axing several projects.
He expressed concern that over a third of the country’s children were out of school. A report issued last year by the Pak Alliance for Maths and Science (Pams) puts that figure at 25.3m, or 36pc of children in Pakistan.
Leaders of other political parties, including the ruling PML-N’s ally PPP, also voiced their concerns over the budget, according to remarks carried by state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
PPP’s Shazia Marri called on the government to address employees’ problems and questioned not increasing the minimum wage.
 


Syed Hussain Tariq, another PPP lawmaker, said the agriculture sector should be supported to ensure food security.
Echoing Gohar’s remarks, Shahida Begum of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam — Fazl (JUI-F) termed the budget allocated for education and health inadequate, emphasising that this should be enhanced to 4pc of the GDP.
PPP MNA Sehar Kamran also said health and education have been “neglected” in the budget.
However, Syed Aminul Haque of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) alluded to the positive economic indicators, including the fall in inflation, as well as the increase in foreign exchange reserves and remittances.
 
 

He noted that international financial institutions were recognising the country’s economic recovery, Radio Pakistan added.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam highlighted relief planned for the people, including employees, in the budget.
PML-N’s Malik Ibrar Ahmed insisted the government has presented a “people-friendly budget”, saying it envisages a vision to take the country forward on the path of development.</p><small>2025-06-18 02:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1722071838c6fd3.jpg?r=221825' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917712/panel-on-food-safety-calls-for-science-led-approach-fiscal-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Panel on food safety calls for science-led approach, fiscal reforms</strong></a><br><p>A panel of government officials and health experts on Tuesday stressed the need for a science-based approach and comprehensive fiscal reforms in the food sector, as part of efforts to improve food safety and public health on World Food Safety Day.
The panel called “Science in Action and Fiscal Governance for Safe Food” was jointly organised by the Senate, Gallup Pakistan, Impact Research International, and Islamabad Food Authority in the federal capital, according to a press release.
“The event underscored the critical need for a science-led approach to food safety and called for urgent fiscal reforms, particularly in taxation policy to support the formal food sector,” the press release said.
Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research, presided over the panel. According to the release, he stressed the urgent need to design and implement evidence-based policies that ensure access to safe, traceable food in line with international standards.
“Food safety and security are not just issues of today, they are challenges for the future. Our systems must evolve to guarantee compliance, traceability, and public trust,” he was quoted as saying.
Another panellist Rida Qazi, Advisor to the Senate on Special Initiatives, reiterated the message, the press release said. She was quoted as saying, “Safe food deserves to be called food. Food safety must begin at the farm and extend all the way to our dining tables.”
Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) Secretary Jamil Ahmed Qureshi urged the need for alignment between fiscal policies and health priorities. “We must incentivise formalisation of the food sector,” he was quoted as saying.
“[The] public welfare should be the priority and taxing safe packaged milk is counterproductive. Instead, our policies should reflect our national commitment to providing safe, nutritious food for all,” he further added, per the release.
A food industry expert addressed fiscal hurdles, highlighting the disconnect between policy and public health goals. “Our taxation framework should enable, not obstruct, the availability of safe food. Taxing the formal sector only pushes consumers toward unsafe, unregulated options and undermines food security,” he was quoted as saying.
Gallup Pakistan CEO Bilal Gillani said that true food security can only be achieved through the commitment and collaboration of a strategic triad: science, economy, and culture, the press release said.
“He explained that scientists must lead with data-driven research, economists must design budgets that support both providers and consumers of safe food, and a cultural shift must be fostered where the consumption of safe, nutritious food becomes a natural part of daily life.”
Hana Mehmood, another panellist, emphasised the role of science in policymaking, according to the press release.
She was quoted as saying, “Public health protection and consumer empowerment start with food safety and transparent nutritional information. Our decisions must be grounded in scientific evidence, not assumptions.”
The press release said that the consensus of the panel was that the formal food sector ensures “traceability, transparent nutritional labelling, and regular monitoring for microbial and chemical safety”.
Zubair Faisal Abbasi from Impact Research International said, “These products adhere to Codex Alimentarius standards and are regulated by national and provincial food safety authorities. Therefore, our fiscal governance must be structured to actively incentivise the formal and documented sector,” according to the press release.
It added, “One of the strongest messages of the day resonated clearly: ‘It’s not food if it’s not safe.’
“… Unfair taxation policies make this safer option less accessible to consumers. Experts from government, academia, and industry stressed that adopting equitable taxation aligned with global best practices will ensure fair access to safe nutrition and foster a healthier, more resilient nation.”</p><small>2025-06-17 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/172100187b1426d.jpg?r=211350' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917674/fact-check-viral-image-does-not-show-haifa-attacked-by-iranian-missiles-but-oct-2024-israeli-strikes-in-lebanon' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral image does not show Haifa attacked by Iranian missiles but Oct 2024 Israeli strikes in Lebanon</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platforms X and TikTok on Sunday shared an image claiming to show the Israeli city of Haifa devastated by Iranian missile strikes. However, the viral image is an old photo of an Israeli strike in Lebanon from 2024.
As Israel and Iran entered the third day of intense missile exchanges, reports emerged of at least four injuries in Haifa following Iranian strikes on June 15, according to Al Jazeera. The escalation began on June 13 when Israel launched airstrikes targeting Iranian commanders, scientists, and nuclear facilities, claiming it aimed to halt Tehran’s alleged nuclear weapons development — an accusation Iran denies, asserting its programme is for civilian use.
On Sunday, an X user shared an image showing a large explosion at night, with multiple fireballs and plumes of smoke rising into the sky. The blast appears to be occurring in a densely populated urban area, given the surrounding city lights and visible high-rise buildings in the foreground.
The caption of the post read: “Haifa now. Chaos and destruction.”
The post received 185,400 views.
The same image was also circulated by many users on X, as seen here, here, here, here, here, and here, collectively garnering over 277,000 views.
The image was found on TikTok as well with a caption; “Breaking - The port of Haifa has been completely destroyed.”
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel.
A reverse image search of the viral image of the massive explosion yielded a news report from The Washington Post published on October 3, 2024, titled: “Israel unleashes major strikes near Beirut as Lebanon campaign escalates.”
The image was sourced to wire news agency Reuters. Searching for the image on the agency’s website yielded the following caption: “Smoke and flames rise over Beirut’s southern suburbs after a strike, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, as seen from Sin El Fil, Lebanon, Oct 3, 2024.”
According to the WP report, Israel’s military offensive in Lebanon escalated on October 3, 2024, with strikes hitting soldiers and medics and pummeling the southern suburbs of Beirut, as Lebanese authorities said 1.2 million people had been displaced by the fighting and Israeli forces ordered more villages to evacuate in the south.
The same incident was covered by Al Jazeera on Oct 4, 2024, including a 44-second video.
 
 

As per the report, Israel launched its largest airstrike to date on the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, targeting densely populated areas and causing significant destruction and panic among residents.
The attack, which included 11 consecutive airstrikes, resulted in massive explosions that set off car alarms and caused buildings to shake, with smoke billowing over the city. The strikes targeted areas near Beirut’s international airport and extended for the first time to the central Bashoura district, close to Lebanon’s parliament.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that an image shows the Israeli city of Haifa destroyed by Iranian missile strikes is false. The viral image actually dates back to an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon Oct 3, 2024.
Multiple claims
At the same time, iVerify Pakistan observed multiple other claims regarding the Iran-Israel conflict. Here are more claims that were debunked by the platform.
- Video showing Iranian missiles in Israel — MISLEADING
On June 13, an X user, who appeared to be a PML-N supporter based on his bio, shared a video clip showing missiles in the sky hitting a city. The caption read: “Iran reached Tel Aviv. Now face it.”
The post gained over 5.5 million views.
The same video was shared by Iran’s state news agency IRNA, with the caption: “Iranian missiles keep coming.”
The post received over 46,000 views.
Another X user also posted the same clip, which gained more than 5,000 views.
The same video was also shared on Instagram by various users here, here and here, collectively receiving over 25,000 likes.
A reverse image search led to an Instagram post dated October 9, 2024. The post featured the same viral video, with the caption simply reading “Tel Aviv.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The same video, showing a missile striking a city, was also shared by another user on X on October 8, 2024. The caption stated: “Iran’s missile attack was so outrageous that even the Japanese and Koreans are making videos about it, and it has received millions of views.”
 






The previous videos were shared in the context of the October 2024 outbreak of violence between Iran and Israel.
Thus, the viral clip is unrelated to the current bout of conflict between Iran and Israel and has been shared as far back as to the October 2024 violence between the two countries.
- Video of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan provided Iran with intelligence — MISLEADING
On Saturday, a video was shared by an X  user, featuring Defence Minister Khawaja Asif allegedly saying that Pakistan provided Iran with intelligence and cover following Israeli attacks.
The statement was purportedly made during a speech in the National Assembly, and the clip featured a Geo News logo.
The post was viewed by over 50,000 people.
The same clip with the same claim was shared here, here, here, here and here.
A keyword search of “Khawaja Asif” and “National Assembly speech” yielded a 44-minute video of Asif’s speech published by the official YouTube channel for the National Assembly on Saturday.
 


In the speech, the minister addressed unprovoked Israeli aggression towards Iran, pledging unwavering support for the latter.
At the 5:46-minute mark, he condemned Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences on June 13, killing Iran’s nuclear scientists as well as civilians.
He went on to say that Israel had foreign support in providing cover and intelligence for its attacks. He did not mention providing Iran with cover and intelligence anytime during the speech.
“Israel is not alone in all this. They were provided intelligence, cover and everything against Iran.”
Notably, the viral clip had omitted the first part of his above comment and he was actually talking about international support for Israel against Iran instead of Pakistan helping Iran.
- Viral video of building collapsing in Tel Aviv — FALSE
On Saturday, an X user shared a 16-second clip showing a building collapse beside a high-rise tower in an urban area with the location tagged as Tel Aviv.
The caption of the post read: “What a soothing scene.”
The post received 348,200 views and 2,700 reshares.
The same clip was circulated by many users on X, as seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here, collectively garnering over 2.2m views.
The clip was shared on TikTok as well with a caption; “Another view of Tel Aviv, today June 14, Long live Iran”, gaining 1.5m views.
Analysing the video using tools to detect manipulation showed that Attestiv assigned it a suspicion rating of 21 per cent and Hive Moderation indicated a 37.4pc likelihood that the video was AI-generated.
 


A reverse image search yielded a TikTok account named “3amelyon” which shares AI-generated content. The viral clip was uploaded on the TikTok account on May 26, gathering 3.5m views.
The same clip was uploaded on the instagram account of ‘3amelyon’ on the same date, gathering over 28,000 likes.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The video was thus AI-generated and unrelated to the current conflict.

A week earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on the floor of the NA, revealing that an 18pc tax would be applied on imported solar panels, while online businesses and digital marketplaces would also come under the tax net.
During today’s meeting of the NA standing committee,  Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that there was no sales tax on photovoltaic cells or solar panels.
“There is no tax on solar panels which are imported as complete products. If parts of solar panels are imported and manufactured here, there is a tax on it,” he said.
“Solar panels used to be very expensive, but now they have become quite cheap,” he added.
 






Committee chairman Syed Naveed Qamar said, “All political parties opposed the tax on solar [panels] in the House. There are other ways of collecting money and our position regarding tax on solar panels is clear.”
According to committee member Mohammad Mobeen, solar panels became more expensive after the tax decision was announced.
“Check the market to see how much solar prices have increased within two weeks,” he said, adding that the sales tax was “unbearable for the poor”.
The FBR chairman said that 18pc GST will bring in Rs20 billion to the national kitty.
“If technology is to be brought into the country, the government should provide relief to the people,” committee member Shahram Tarakai said. He added that taxes were being imposed when the cost of doing business in Pakistan was already high.
“Solar is a source of alternative energy,” MNA Shahida Akhtar Ali said. “A tax should be imposed on sugary drinks, while tax relief should be given on solar panels.”
According to the FBR chairman, 32,000 MW of solar power was imported in the last five years, and 6,271 MW was used in net metering. He said that 13,000 MW of solar panels were not installed anywhere at that time, adding that 6,506 MW was used in non-net metering, and 5,521 MW of solar panels were used off-grid.
“There has also been over-invoicing in the import of solar panels,” he said, adding that the matter had come up in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance.
A press release issued by the Senate standing committee said that it held its fifth session today.
 






It said the committee discussed a range of critical recommendations and policy matters.
“The committee strongly recommended withdrawing the proposed 18pc GST on solar panels. Members observed that ahead of the budget, certain stakeholders had imported and dumped solar equipment in anticipation of the tax hike. The chairman emphasised the discriminatory nature of the move, saying, ‘The committee rejects the sudden imposition of GST on solar imports and urges immediate withdrawal.’”
Finance bill 2025
The NA panel also discussed the Finance Bill 2025, which proposed provisions granting arrest and money laundering notice powers to tax commissioners.
According to the FBR chairman, the law gave the impression that it was introduced to arrest traders. “The law on [such] arrest already exists which has seen some changes.
“There is an amendment related to tampering or forgery while the second clause is about tampering and fraud on a large scale.”
 
 

He further said that arrests would be made if there was a risk that the suspect of tax fraud was fleeing. “If the tax is not paid despite three notices, then an arrest is made,” he said, adding that the arrest decision was taken by the FBR committee.
MNA Mobeen said that any FBR officer can say that tax fraud has occurred with the amendment and the suspected person will have to prove that they did not commit tax fraud. He questioned, “Is there a timeline set for the arrest and inquiry process?”
“The inquiry will be completed within six months,” the FBR chairman remarked.
On Saturday, a parliamentary panel pressed senior tax officials to drop proposed provisions in the bill, warning the move would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses.
Lawmakers debated the implications of enhanced powers for the FBR and discussed measures to curb tampered vehicles.
Senator Mandviwalla warned that there is a grave risk of misuse of the power to arrest or issue a notice. Even a junior FBR officer sending a notice could create chaos, he warned. He also emphasised that receiving a money laundering notice often leads to business shutdowns.</p><small>2025-06-17 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171838369357966.png?r=184815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917703/alcaraz-and-raducanu-to-team-up-in-revamped-us-open-mixed-doubles' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz and Raducanu to team up in revamped US Open mixed doubles</strong></a><br><p>Nine of the world’s top-10 men and nine of the top-10 women have officially entered into the US Open’s revamped mixed doubles event, tournament organisers said on Tuesday, with former singles champions Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu teaming up.
The competition, which will take place a week before the singles main draw during its “Fan Week”, will award $1 million in prize money to the winning team.
Sixteen teams have entered and the entry window closes on July 28, after which the top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking will be in the draw via direct acceptance, with eight more wildcard entries.
“In our initial discussions about reimagining and elevating the US Open mixed doubles championship, we wanted to find a way to showcase the world’s best men and women competing with and against one another,” USTA CEO Lew Sherr said.
“We were confident that we would be able to get the top players in the game excited about this unique opportunity. Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited.
“It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”
Other pairs include twice US Open champion Naomi Osaka teaming up with Nick Kyrgios, as well as Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas.
The matches will be best of three sets, with short sets to four games, no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a third set.
The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games.
Although a number of big names such as Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka have entered, the format came in for criticism from renowned doubles players.
Reigning champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori said the new format was a “profound injustice” that disrespects doubles players, describing the new event as a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show”.
The US Open had said the changes were made following the success of the “Mixed Madness” exhibition event held ahead of last year’s tournament, which paired up a number of high-profile singles players into teams.
“Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,” Italians Errani and Vavassori had said.
The pair have entered the competition this year.

Sabalenka serves up apology to Gauff after French Open final comments
World number one Aryna Sabalenka said she has apologised to Coco Gauff after dismissing the American’s maiden French Open triumph, adding that she regrets the comments she made about the 21-year-old after the final.
Sabalenka had been poised for victory after claiming the opening set in a tiebreak, only to watch Gauff orchestrate a stunning 6-7(5) 6-2 6-4 comeback to claim her second Grand Slam title.
Sabalenka made 70 unforced errors in the final and later said at a press conference that Gauff won “not because she played incredible, (but) because I made all of those mistakes” — comments she has since regretted making.
“It was just totally unprofessional of me, I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then,” Sabalenka told Eurosport.
“We all make mistakes. I’m only human and I’m still learning in life. We all have those days when we lose control.
“The difference with me is that the world watches me do it, I get a lot more hate afterwards for what I did than other people.”
Sabalenka said she had reached out to Gauff personally afterwards to apologise.
“I wanted to apologise and make sure that she knows that she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her. I never intended to attack her,” Sabalenka added.
“I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I’m not necessarily grateful for what I did.
“It took me a while to look at it again, to go into it with my eyes open and to understand. I realised a lot about myself.”
Having lost two Grand Slam finals this year, Sabalenka will now turn her attention to the grasscourt swing, warming up for Wimbledon by playing at the Berlin Open this week.</p><small>2025-06-17 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171801149241ca7.jpg?r=180531' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917702/india-regulator-asks-air-india-for-training-data-of-pilots-dispatcher-of-crashed-plane' target='_blank'><strong>India regulator asks Air India for training data of pilots, dispatcher of crashed plane</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation safety watchdog has asked Air India for the training records of the pilots and dispatcher for the plane that crashed last week as part of its investigation into the incident that killed at least 271 people, government memos showed.
The directorate general of civil aviation also asked all flying schools to conduct training compliance checks, according to the confidential memos, seen by Reuters.
The DGCA said the requests were part of a “regulatory” review of the accident, and also sought details of action taken following the watchdog’s audits of Air India in the last few months. It asked for the details to be provided by Monday. It was not clear whether Air India had complied with the directive.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London with 242 people on board began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday before crashing into nearby buildings. Everyone on board was killed, bar a single passenger, along with about 30 on the ground.
Sumeet Sabharwal, who the Indian government has said had 8,200 flying hours of experience and was also an Air India instructor, was the commanding pilot of flight AI171. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder who had 1,100 hours of experience. Sabharwal’s funeral took place in Mumbai on Tuesday.

The watchdog requested for training details and supporting documents for the pilots, as well as for the flight dispatcher. The memo did not elaborate on the type of documents required, but accident investigations commonly look at a crew’s training and qualifications, flight history, medical records and any actions previously taken against them.
The memo did not raise any concerns with Air India’s operations and some of the requests are standard in the aftermath of a major incident.
Dispatchers are DGCA-certified ground-based airline employees whose role includes flight planning, assessing weather and airspace conditions, and coordination with the pilots.
While the request for pilot training data was sent by the DGCA, the accident investigation is being led by another wing of the aviation ministry, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.
Air India’s Chairman N. Chandrasekaran told staff on Monday the incident should be a catalyst to build a safer airline.
The DGCA, through a separate memo dated June 16, also asked flying schools across the country to “strictly follow additional safety and operational measures.”
The regulator said instructors must check for compliance with procedures concerning training, maintenance and licensing, and coordinate flight plans with nearby airports in advance to ensure any emergencies are dealt with swiftly.
“Compliance will be assessed during audits/surveillance,” said the memo by the Directorate of Flying Training, reviewed by Reuters.
Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, visited Air India’s headquarters near New Delhi and met the airline’s chairman to discuss the crash, Reuters reported on Monday.
The crash poses a new challenge for Air India, which the Tata Group bought in 2022 and has been trying to revamp, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.
In a June 13 memo headed “updating airport emergency plan”, seen by Reuters, government-managed airports have also been asked to conduct a full-scale training exercise — typically an emergency drill — on June 30.</p><small>2025-06-17 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171745287e0ac39.jpg?r=174725' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917699/charred-bodies-shattered-lives-after-gunmen-kill-100-in-nigeria' target='_blank'><strong>Charred bodies, shattered lives after gunmen kill 100 in Nigeria</strong></a><br><p>The gunmen attacked after dark and chased farmer Fidelis Adidi away from the central Nigerian village of Yelwata. The next morning he returned to find the charred remains of one of his two wives and four of his children.
They had been living in a room he had rented in the market, in an attempt to keep them safe from a wave of clashes between cattle herders and farmers in the country’s Middle Belt region.
His second wife and another child were badly wounded in the assault that began on Friday night and, according to Amnesty International, killed around 100 people in the town in Benue region.
“My body is weak and my heart keeps racing,” the 37-year-old told Reuters as he stood outside the room, surveying the damage. “I lost five of my family members.”
In another room in the market, bodies lay burned beyond recognition next to blackened piles of food and farm equipment.
Authorities have struggled to contain the violence that has simmered for years, fuelled by competition over land as well as ethnic and religious divisions.
President Bola Tinubu — who called the recent upsurge in attacks “depressing” on Monday —is due to visit Benue on Wednesday, his first visit there since coming to office two years ago.
Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency said it was working with aid agencies to help at least 3,000 people displaced by the violence in a territory where the majority Muslim north meets the predominantly Christian south.
Market trader Talatu Agauta, who is pregnant with her second child, fled when the attackers came on Friday night and took refuge in the state capital Markudi.
She came back over the weekend to find 40 bags of her rice had been burned. A devastating blow, but not enough to drive her from her home.
“I came back and even if I die here, I don’t mind,” she said.</p><small>2025-06-17 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171147291930468.jpg?r=123734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917666/russian-overnight-attack-on-kyiv-kills-14-injures-44' target='_blank'><strong>Russian overnight attack on Kyiv kills 14, injures 44</strong></a><br><p>Waves of Russian drones and missiles struck districts across the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early on Tuesday, killing 14 people and injuring 44, according to the interior ministry.
The Russian attack struck 27 locations around the capital, damaging residential buildings, educational institutions, and critical infrastructure facilities, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.
“Today, the enemy spared neither drones nor missiles,” he said about what he called one of the largest attacks on the city since Russia launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Reuters witnesses said drones swarmed over the capital and they heard what appeared to be missiles overhead. An air raid alert remained in effect more than seven hours after it had been proclaimed.
Other parts of the country also came under attack, including a region outside the capital where one person was injured and the southern region of Odesa, where 13 people were injured, according to local authorities.
 


Klymenko said a ballistic missile struck a nine-storey residential building in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district, destroying a section of it. He said the emergency services were racing to search through the rubble for any possible survivors.
Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that a 62-year-old US citizen had died in a dwelling opposite a site where medics were providing assistance during the attack. Klymenko said the man died from shrapnel wounds.
Both Ukraine and Russia have launched drone attacks in recent weeks as the two sides have held two sessions of direct talks on ending the more than three-year-old war. The talks have produced agreements on freeing prisoners of war and returning the bodies of fallen soldiers, but little more.
“More strikes by Russian drones on residential buildings in Kyiv,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. “Russia is continuing its war on civilians.”
Russian air defence units intercepted and destroyed 147 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, including the Moscow region, overnight, Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-06-17 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17133040d183145.png?r=134155' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917677/pm-shehbaz-for-linking-reko-diq-with-railway-network-by-2028' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz for linking Reko Diq with railway network by 2028</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday directed relevant authorities to link the Reko Diq project in Balochistan with the Pakistan Railway’s line network by 2028 to meet the requirements of future transportation and cargo services.
In January, Saudi Arabian mining fund Manara Minerals said it was set to buy a 10-20 per cent stake in the Reko Diq copper and gold project in Pakistan for proceeds of about $500 million to $1 billion.
In April, the Reko Diq Joint Venture shareholders approved the project’s updated feasibility study and conditionally approved the associated Phase-1 development capital, subject to securing up to $3bn in project financing.
While chairing a meeting today, PM Shehbaz issued orders for the formation of an inter-ministerial committee to look after financing matters for upgrading and developing Pakistan Railways.
The committee will present recommendations regarding to financing required for Pakistan Railways’ development and its extension to Reko Diq.
During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the upgradation of ML-1 and ML-3 railway as well as the overall development of Pakistan Railways to meet the requirements of future transportation and cargo services.
The premier noted that Pakistan Railways served as a backbone for the country’s economy and communication.
“Pakistan Railways is a cheap, fast and environment-friendly source of transportation,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that the mines and mineral sector of Balochistan will develop, and new employment opportunities will be created for the people of the area after linking railways with Reko Diq.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi, and senior government officials.</p><small>2025-06-17 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17134614655fd1b.jpg?r=143150' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917679/indias-indigo-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-nagpur-after-bomb-threat' target='_blank'><strong>India’s IndiGo flight makes emergency landing in Nagpur after bomb threat</strong></a><br><p>An IndiGo flight travelling from Oman’s Muscat to New Delhi made an emergency landing in Nagpur city of India’s Maharashtra state on Tuesday after receiving a bomb threat, according to Indian media.
The flight left India’s Kochi city, where it had a layover, for the Delhi airport carrying 157 passengers and six crew members at 9:31am IST (9:01am PKT). The Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL) said the threat was received on its official email address, Press Trust of India reported.
All passengers of the IndiGo flight had been safely disembarked, according to Nagpur Deputy Commissioner of Police Lohit Matani.
While an investigation was underway, preliminary checks did not find anything suspicious, officials said.
After the bomb threat was received by the CIAL airport, a Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) was convened and the threat was declared as “specific”.
As per ANI, a similar incident happened on Monday, where a Lufthansa flight LH752 scheduled to fly from Frankfurt to India’s Hyderabad, was forced to return to Germany after a bomb threat was received through an email at Hyderabad airport at 6:01pm IST (5:31pm PKT) on June 15.
A committee was formed to assess the threat as per the standard operating procedure.
On June 13, an Air India flight AI 379 flying from Phuket to New Delhi with 156 passengers on board also received a bomb threat and was forced to land back in the southern Thai island after making a wide loop around the Andaman Sea.
The incident followed the crash on an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on June 12, shortly after takeoff, killing at least 271 people, including nearly 30 people on the ground.
Bomb threat diverts plane of Haj pilgrims within Indonesia
Separately, a plane carrying hundreds of Haj pilgrims back from Saudi Arabia was diverted in Indonesia today after an email bomb threat was sent to authorities, Indonesia’s aviation body said.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it received a report from Indonesia’s airport operator “regarding a bomb threat sent by an unidentified person via electronic mail”.
The email at 7:30am (5:30am PKT) contained a threat to “blow up” Saudia Airlines flight SV 5276, which was flying from Jeddah to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, it said in a statement.
After 10am (8am PKT) the pilot diverted the plane from its destination of Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to Kualanamu International Airport in Medan, a city on Sumatra island in western Indonesia.
The flight was carrying 442 Haj pilgrims, including 207 men and 235 women, it added.
“Upon identifying security and safety threats, the pilot decided to divert the landing to the nearest airport,” said InJourney Airports, Indonesia’s airport operator.
A transport ministry official told AFP the plane was still in Medan, and Flightradar24 showed the plane there.
The airport evacuated the pilgrims, and a bomb disposal unit swept the plane for explosive devices, the aviation body said in its statement.</p><small>2025-06-17 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17140309e5012b6.jpg?r=140326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917681/despite-law-us-tiktok-ban-likely-to-remain-on-hold' target='_blank'><strong>Despite law, US TikTok ban likely to remain on hold</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is widely expected to extend the Thursday deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States.
It would be the third time Trump put off enforcing a federal law requiring its sale or ban, which was to take effect the day before his January inauguration.
“I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said in an NBC News interview in early May. “If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.”
Trump said a group of purchasers is ready to pay TikTok owner ByteDance “a lot of money” for the video-clip-sharing sensation’s US operations.
Trump has repeatedly downplayed risks that TikTok is in danger, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app’s US business.
The president is “just not motivated to do anything about TikTok,” said independent analyst Rob Enderle. “Unless they get on his bad side, TikTok is probably going to be in pretty good shape.”
Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, but reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform after coming to believe it helped him win young voters’ support in the November election.
“Trump’s not really doing great on his election promises,” Enderle maintained.
“This could be one that he can actually deliver on.”
 
 

Digital Cold War?
Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration, with ByteDance having made no attempt to find a suitor.
TikTok “has become a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry; a flashpoint in the new Cold War for digital control,” said Shweta Singh, an assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School in Britain.
“National security, economic policy, and digital governance are colliding,” Singh added.
The Republican president announced an initial 75-day delay of the ban upon taking office.
A second extension pushed the deadline to June 19.
As of Monday, there was no word of a TikTok sale in the works.
Tariff turmoil
Trump said in April that China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over tariffs imposed by Washington on Beijing.
ByteDance has confirmed talks with the US government, saying key matters needed to be resolved and that any deal would be “subject to approval under Chinese law”.
Possible solutions reportedly include seeing existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
Additional US investors, including Oracle and private equity firm Blackstone, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance’s share in the new TikTok.
 
 

Much of TikTok’s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.
Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok’s valuable algorithm.
“TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand - it’s simply not as powerful,” said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
Meanwhile, it appears TikTok is continuing with business as usual.
TikTok on Monday introduced a new “Symphony” suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for advertisers to turn words or photos into video snippets for the platform.
“With TikTok Symphony, we’re empowering a global community of marketers, brands, and creators to tell stories that resonate, scale, and drive impact on TikTok,” global head of creative and brand products Andy Yang said in a release.</p><small>2025-06-17 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17141231c59e53a.jpg?r=141330' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917680/karachi-once-again-ranks-among-least-liveable-cities-in-global-survey' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi once again ranks among least liveable cities in global survey</strong></a><br><p>Karachi once again ranked in the bottom five of the world’s “least liveable cities” in a global survey by The Economist.
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the metropolis ranked 170 on a list of 173 countries — just above Dhaka, Tripoli and Damascus — and had a score of 42.7 on the index score, with a score of 100 being “most liveable”.
It was the only Pakistani city to feature on the list, albeit poorly.
 


Topping the list was Copenhagen, with a score of 98. Vienna and Zurich tied for second place at 97.1, followed by Melbourne at 97.0, and Geneva with a score of 96.8.
The annual survey, designed to help companies calculate hardship allowances when they relocate staff, rates 173 cities across five categories: health care, culture and environment, education, infrastructure and stability, according to The Economist.
In last year’s ranking, Karachi compared with Lagos, Tripoli, Algiers and Damascus. The year before, Karachi was ranked 169 out of 173 countries
Last October, the Asian Deve­lopment Bank said the livability of cities in Pakistan is decreasing, and urban centres in the country are becoming increasingly inefficient, scoring low on multiple competitiveness indexes, with congestion, unattractiveness and pollution.
The ADB report assessed that class division was a major problem in Karachi since most of the elite live in cantonment areas or private housing societies, while those on low incomes have been pushed to the city’s largest district, Karachi East.
The city is further divided along religious and ethnic lines, which has led to several outbreaks of violence in the past. Karachi is the only city in Pakistan that, to some degree, is expanding vertically due to limited land and urgent housing needs, the report said.
In July, Karachi was ranked as the second riskiest city for tourists with a rating of 93.12 out of 100 according to a Forbes Adviser list.
Per the ranking, Karachi had the highest personal security risk, reflecting risk from crime, violence, terrorist threats, natural disasters, and economic vulnerabilities.
The list said Karachi had the second-worst (level 3, reconsider travel) travel safety rating from the US State Department. It further said that the metropolis had the fourth-highest infrastructure security risk, reflecting the availability and quality of city infrastructure.</p><small>2025-06-17 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171343286cb6102.jpg?r=134343' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917678/pm-shehbaz-reiterates-commitment-to-defending-pakistans-right-to-water' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reiterates commitment to defending Pakistan’s right to water</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated Pakistan’s commitment towards defending its right to water, terming the Indus River as the “lifeline” of the people of Pakistan, in his message on “World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought”.
Observed on June 17 every year, the annual day highlights global urgency against drought. Climate Risk Index 2025 ranks Pakistan 1st among top 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2022, with over 68 per cent of its land area now classified as arid or semi-arid. Prolonged droughts in Balochistan, Sindh and South Punjab continue to push vulnerable communities deeper into poverty.
In a statement released by the PM’s office, PM Shehbaz raised alarm over India’s unilateral action to hold the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance, calling it a “serious concern”.
“There is no provision for such actions under the Treaty, and the waters of the Indus are the lifeline of the 240 million people of Pakistan,” he added, vowing to defend Pakistan’s right to water.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international obligations, “particularly those agreements that are vital to regional peace.” PM Shehbaz also promised to accelerate efforts to enhance the country’s domestic water storage capacity.
 
 

On the issue of land, PM noted that “nearly 50pc of our land area is affected by various forms of degradation driven by deforestation, overgrazing, salinity, waterlogging, and unplanned urbanisation”.
These issues are made worse by climate change, which has “intensified the frequency and severity of droughts, wildfires, and floods,” the statement added, citing the 2022 floods and recurring dry spells to highlight the scale of the problem.
He underscored the importance of land as an asset for Pakistan’s food security, water availability, biodiversity conservation, and rural livelihoods.
Over one million km of productive land — about 113pc of Pakistan’s total land area — is lost worldwide to degradation every year, requiring $1 billion in daily investments for restoration between 2025 and 2030, according to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
 
 

PM lauded this year’s theme, “Restore the land. Unlock the opportunities,” as a “timely call” for the restoration of degraded land. He stressed that restoration is “essential not only for climate resilience but also for unlocking social, economic, and environmental benefits”.
Detailing the government’s efforts towards climate resilience, he stated that sustainable land management and ecosystem restoration remain “key pillars” of the government’s climate resilience agenda.
Landmark initiatives like the upscaling of the Green Pakistan Programme have resulted in the plantation of over 2.2 billion plants, he observed.
The statement further quoted him as saying: “We are also implementing the National Climate Change Policy and National Adaptation Plan to guide integrated land use and enhance ecological integrity.
“These policy frameworks align with our commitments under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), to which Pakistan has been a Party since 1997.”
PM Shehbaz urged all stakeholders to join hands in restoring degraded land and securing a climate-resilient future for future generations.
In March, Paki­stan Meteorological Depar­tment (PMD) issued a drought alert for Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab due to scant rainfall.</p><small>2025-06-17 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17130903e912083.jpg?r=133403' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917675/army-chief-lauds-overseas-pakistanis-contributions-during-us-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief lauds overseas Pakistanis’ contributions during US visit</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has expressed his deep appreciation for the significant role being played by overseas Pakistanis as ambassadors of the country during his official visit to the United States, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
Field Marshal Munir arrived in Washington on Sunday for a five-day official visit aimed at reinforcing military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the United States, diplomatic sources confirmed.
The visit, which sources described as “primarily bilateral in nature”, is not officially linked to the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14, despite its timing.
“During the visit, the COAS interacted with the overseas Pakistani community in Washington DC,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“During the interaction, the COAS expressed his deep appreciation for the vital and most significant role being played by overseas Pakistanis for being ambassadors of Pakistan,” the press release continued.
He acknowledged their contributions to Pakistan’s economy and global reputation through remittances, investments and higher achievements in other domains.
The ISPR added that COAS received a warm reception and welcome from the overseas Pakistanis, who gathered in large numbers to meet with the army chief.
According to the military’s media wing, the diaspora warmly appreciated the outstanding performance of Pakistan’s armed forces during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos/Marka-e-Haq, showcasing their bravery and professionalism.
 
 

The overseas Pakistanis shared their experiences and suggestions with the army chief. He emphasised the importance of engagement with the overseas Pakistanis, highlighting the need for continued collaboration and cooperation to address common challenges and promote cooperation.
“The interaction concluded with a renewed sense of purpose and commitment, as the COAS and the overseas Pakistanis pledged to work together towards a more secure, prosperous, and resilient Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
Field Marshal Munir did not attend the military parade on the occasion of the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations, but some sources speculated that he had spent the last two days at the US Central Command’s headquarters in Tampa, Florida.
The sources had said that the army chief’s visit aims to reinforce military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the US, with meetings expected with senior US officials, including the Secretaries of Defence and State and senior US military commanders.</p><small>2025-06-17 08:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17123320a776bf8.png?r=123352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917668/pakistan-us-agree-to-advance-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US agree to advance talks on reciprocal tariffs: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their economic partnership as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on reciprocal tariffs through constructive engagement, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistan faces a potential 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington in April on countries around the world.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary,  Howard Lutnick, last night. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.
“The government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,” he said. “We have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards competitive economy.”
Aurangzeb continued that both sides agreed to advance negotiations on reciprocal tariffs through constructive engagement, aiming to finalise the trade deal at the earliest.
The discussions focused on meaningful engagement in trade, investment, and strengthening mutually beneficial economic ties, he said.
“Both sides also agreed that further technical-level discussions would take place in the coming days, following a mutually agreed roadmap,” the finance minister added.
As regards pension reforms, the finance minister said the Defined Contribution Pension Scheme is a “win-win” for both the government and the employees.
In June last year, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved major changes to the federal government’s pension system. The finance ministry said federal government employees would contribute 10pc of their basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc.
At today’s event, Aurangzeb said the government has increased the pension of retired employees by 7pc in line with inflationary trends.
“We have also proposed a 5pc tax on pensions above Rs10 million while protecting low and middle income pensioners,” he said.
Two important visits from Pakistan to the United States — one by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the other by a trade delegation — due this week were postponed due to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, official sources told Dawn earlier this week.
The three-day visit would be the latest in a series of high-level exchanges between Islamabad and Washington amid a fragile regional security climate following last month’s military standoff between India and Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-17 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17121025ff55e51.jpg?r=121031' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917669/openai-wins-200m-contract-with-us-military' target='_blank'><strong>OpenAI wins $200m contract with US military</strong></a><br><p>The US Department of Defence on Monday awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to put generative artificial intelligence (AI) to work for the military.
San Francisco-based OpenAI will “develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains”, according to the department’s posting of awarded contracts.
The programme with the defence department is the first partnership under the startup’s initiative to put AI to work in governments, according to OpenAI.
OpenAI plans to show how cutting-edge AI can vastly improve administrative operations such as how service members get health care and also cyber defenses, the startup said in a post.
All use of AI for the military will be consistent with OpenAI usage guidelines, according to the startup.
 
 

Big tech companies are increasingly pitching their tools to the US military, among them Meta, OpenAI and, more predictably, Palantir, the AI defense company founded by Peter Thiel, the conservative tech billionaire who has played a major role in Silicon Valley’s rightward shift.
OpenAI and defense tech startup Anduril Industries late last year announced a partnership to develop and deploy AI solutions “for security missions.”
The alliance brings together OpenAI models and Anduril’s military tech platform to ramp up defenses against aerial drones and other “unmanned aircraft systems”, according to the companies.
“OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values,” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said at the time.</p><small>2025-06-17 07:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/170942087dbfcc2.jpg?r=094219' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917650/window-dressing' target='_blank'><strong>Window dressing</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN is on the front lines of the global climate crisis, yet continues to approach the challenge with a troubling mix of policy confusion, underfunding, and institutional weakness.
The country remains among the most climate-vulnerable in the world, without contributing even 1pc to GHG emissions. From the devastating floods of 2022 that affected over 33m people, to the recurring heatwaves, droughts and water shortages, the evidence is everywhere.
 
 

What remains missing is a credible, well-resourced plan to take these challenges head-on — a plan rooted in data, foresight and political commitment.
The recently unveiled federal budget once again reveals the contradictions that have long plagued our climate policy. While the government claims to prioritise climate resilience, its actual allocations tell a different story.
Only Rs85bn has been allocated to adaptation — the category that includes essential interventions such as disaster preparedness, food and water security, early warning systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure.
A staggering Rs603bn, on the other hand, has gone to mitigation, largely centred around energy sector subsidies and rebranded hydropower projects.
This imbalance is difficult to justify. The finance minister himself has acknowledged that adaptation is our foremost climate challenge. Yet, year after year, budgets continue to reflect a lopsided focus on mitigation — a domain where Pakistan’s global emissions profile gives it limited room to make meaningful impact.
It is the country’s exposure to floods, heat, glacial melt and food insecurity that requires urgent and sustained investment, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Sindh, Balochistan and south Punjab.
 
 

Compounding the problem are self-defeating fiscal decisions. While a carbon levy has been introduced to curb fossil fuel consumption — a step in the right direction — the government has increased taxes on solar panel imports and hybrid vehicles.
Incentives for EVs have also been rolled back. These contradictory signals only undermine public confidence in the government’s commitment to a green transition and discourage much-needed private sector participation.
Institutional capacity is another concern. The Ministry of Climate Change has seen its funding slashed from Rs3.5bn to Rs2.7bn. This not only weakens its ability to conduct research and develop evidence-based policies, but also limits its role in coordinating and implementing climate finance from international donors.
Meanwhile, the provinces lack the resources and expertise to implement adaptation measures effectively. We cannot afford to continue down this path. The costs of inaction are already evident — in economic losses, in displaced communities and in rising climate-related deaths.
If the country is to weather the storms ahead, it must align its words with actions, prioritise adaptation, eliminate policy contradictions, and empower its institutions to lead from the front. The climate clock is ticking — and Pakistan is running out of time.
