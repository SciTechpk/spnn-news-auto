The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides held the first round of talks after the ceasefire.
The day today began with special prayers in mosques, followed by a 31-gun salute in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute at provincial capitals, according to Radio Pakistan.
The main ceremony of Youm-i-Tashakur was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was the chief guest at the ceremony. The chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief were also present there.
 
 

In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a “golden chapter” in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy’s intentions, state media  Pakistan Television reported. He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack.
“In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued.
He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.
A video posted by the government on X showed the premier hoisting the national flag at the PM’s House.
 






In Sindh, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah hoisted the national flag in Karachi, according to APP. The ceremony was attended by various provincial ministers, advisers, special assistants, chief secretary and other officials.
Speaking to the media, CM Murad said that seven individuals from Sindh were martyred during the conflict with India, including six personnel of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in Bholari and one civilian from Ghotki. He announced compensation of Rs10 million each for the families of the martyrs and Rs1 million for the injured.
Rescue 1122 officials marked Youm-i-Tashakur at a ceremony in Peshawar. Rescue 1122 Director General Shah Fahad told Dawn.com that a minute of silence was observed and prayers were offered for those who were martyred and injured. The rescue officials also organised a walk where they raised national slogans.
The Punjab police also paid a tribute to the PAF for their victory, APP reported. Punjab Inspector General (IG) Usman Anwar, the head of the provincial force, expressed condolences for the martyrs of the operation and lauded the veterans, saying: “We honour the heroes who laid down their lives and those who returned victorious.”
The IG added that full security arrangements were made for ceremonies and rallies in Lahore and across Punjab.
PM Shehbaz visits martyred PAF squadron leader’s home for condolences
PM Shehbaz also visited the residence of Squadron Leader Usman Yousaf, who was martyred in attacks by India, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, COAS Munir and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accompanied the prime minister.
The prime minister extended his condolences to the family members of the martyred squadron leader and also prayed for him.
PM Shehbaz paid tribute to the martyr’s services for the country and his sacrifice while defending the homeland.</p><small>2025-05-16 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16152352f3e4958.jpg?r=170835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo' target='_blank'><strong>India should adhere to ceasefire, Pakistan will respond if hostilities resume: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday urged India to maintain the ceasefire agreed with Pakistan, warning that the country would respond if the neighbour resumed aggression.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
The nation observed Youm-i-Tashakur across the country today to honour the armed forces and the people for the victory in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos — a part of Marka-i-Haq — against India.
During his weekly press conference today, the spokesperson said: “The recent announcement of a Pakistan-India ceasefire is a positive development. We urge India to faithfully adhere to its implementation.”
He said Pakistan appreciated the role of friendly countries in facilitating the ceasefire and reiterated support for US President Donald Trump’s announcement on engaging with Pakistan and India to seek a resolution to the Kashmir dispute.
The spokesperson said the ceasefire was achieved by the role of several countries. “India’s portrayal of Pakistan as acting out of despair and frustration of Pakistan is baseless,” he added.
 


He informed that the military operations chiefs of both countries had maintained periodic contact since May 10 and both had agreed on a “structured mechanism for phased de-escalation”.
The spokesperson said that Pakistan had also returned a constable of the Indian Border Security Force on Wednesday as a gesture of “goodwill” in return for a sepoy of the Pakistan Rangers.
He said that at a time when the internal community was promoting regional peace and stability, “India’s rhetoric reflects a persistent tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and cast unwarranted aspersions on Pakistan’s nuclear assets.”
In contrast, the spokesperson said that “Pakistan is a responsible state and remains committed to the ceasefire and taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.”
He requested Pakistan’s international partners to ensure India honoured its commitments and refrained from further aggression due to its “belligerent posture”. “Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond,” he warned.
The spokesperson said Pakistan always believed in dialogue and the restoration of peace and wanted a solution to all issues, including occupied Kashmir, through negotiations.
FM Dar appreciates UK role in de-escalation
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and discussed regional developments, including the ceasefire.
Dar appreciated the UK’s constructive role in de-escalation.
The two also reviewed bilateral ties and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening relations and enhancing economic and trade cooperation.

Delhi suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, shortly after 26 civilians in India-held Kashmir were killed in what India called an act of terror.
Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but accord remains “in abeyance” by India despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing a ceasefire last week following the worst fighting between them in decades.
After the April 22 attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered officials to expedite planning and execution of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers, three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan’s use, six people told Reuters.
One of the key plans under discussion involves doubling to 120km the length of the Ranbir canal on the Chenab, which runs through India to Pakistan’s agricultural powerhouse of Punjab, two of the people said. The canal was built in the 19th century, long before the treaty was signed.
India is permitted to draw a limited amount of water from the Chenab for irrigation, but an expanded canal — which experts said could take years to construct — would allow it to divert 150 cubic meters of water per second, up from about 40 cubic meters currently, the four people said, citing official discussions and documents they had seen.
Details of the Indian government’s deliberations on expanding Ranbir have not previously been reported. The discussions started last month and continue even after the ceasefire, one of the people said.
The Indian ministries responsible for water and foreign affairs, as well as Modi’s office, did not respond to Reuters’ questions. Indian hydropower giant NHPC, which operates many projects in the Indus system, also did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Modi said in a fiery speech this week that “water and blood cannot flow together,” though he didn’t refer to the treaty. Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters on Tuesday that India “will keep the treaty in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
 
 

The water and foreign ministries of Pakistan did not respond to requests for comment.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told lawmakers this week that the government had written to India arguing that suspending the treaty was unlawful and that Islamabad regarded it as remaining in force.
Islamabad said after India suspended the treaty in April that it considered “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” to be an “act of war.”
About 80 per cent of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects serving the country of some 250 million.
Any efforts by Delhi to build dams, canals or other infrastructure that would withhold or divert significant amount of flow from the Indus system to India “would take years to realise,” said water security expert David Michel of the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
But Pakistan has had a preview of the kind of pressure it could face from India: Water at a key receiving point in Pakistan briefly fell by as much as 90pc in early May after India started maintenance work on some Indus projects.
WB president says ‘no provision’ in IWT for suspension
Last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said that there is no provision in the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) for suspension, in an interview with Indian broadcaster CNBC-TV18.
Speaking in New Delhi, he had said, “There is no provision in the treaty to allow it to be suspended, the way it (IWT) was drawn up, it either needs to be gone or it needs to be replaced by another one. That requires the two countries to want to agree.
“The treaty is not suspended, it’s technically called something in abeyance, is how the Indian government worded it.”
Article XII of the IWT makes it clear that it can only be modified by mutual agreement.
Success threatened
The Indus system runs through some of the world’s most geopolitically tense areas, originating near Lake Mansarovar in Tibet and snaking through India’s north and Pakistan’s east and southeast, before emptying into the Arabian Sea.
The treaty is widely seen as one of the world’s most successful water-sharing accords, having survived several major wars and longstanding tensions between India and Pakistan.
It restricts India largely to setting up low-impact hydropower projects on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan. Delhi has freedom to utilise the waters of three other rivers - the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi tributaries — as it sees fit.
Alongside the plans to expand Ranbir canal, India is also considering projects that would likely reduce the flow of water into Pakistan from rivers allocated to that country, according to two government documents seen by Reuters and interviews with five people familiar with the matter.
One document, an undated note prepared by a government company for officials considering irrigation plans, suggests that water from the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum “potentially be distributed into rivers” in three northern Indian states.
One of the people said the document, the details of which have not been previously reported, was created for discussions with power ministry officials after the April 22 attack.
Delhi has also created a list of hydropower projects in occupied Jammu and Kashmir territory that it hopes will expand capacity to 12,000 megawatts, up from the current 3,360 MW.
The list, created by the power ministry and seen by Reuters, was not dated.
A person familiar with the document said it was created before the Kashmir incident but is actively being discussed by government officials. The prospective projects also include dams that can store large volumes of water, in what would be a first for India in the Indus river system, according to two people familiar with the matter.
India has identified at least five possible storage projects, four of which are on tributaries of the Chenab and Jhelum, according to the power ministry document.
International relations expert Happymon Jacob at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University said that India’s new focus on the IWT reflected an attempt to pressure Pakistan over Kashmir.
“With the latest conflict, Delhi may refuse to discuss Kashmir with Pakistan in any format,” he said.
“Delhi has not only progressively narrowed the scope of bilateral talks but has also curtailed the agenda, focusing only on specific issues like the IWT.”
Pakistan has said that it is preparing legal action in several international forums, including the World Bank, which facilitated the treaty, as well as the Permanent Court of Arbitration or the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
 
 

“Water should not be weaponised,” Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told Reuters on Monday. “We don’t even want to consider any scenario which … does not take into account the reinstatement of this treaty.”
Michel, the US-based expert, said that concern over the treaty’s suspension was not limited to Islamabad.
“As geopolitical competition across the region deepens, more than a few Indian observers fear that Delhi’s use of water against Islamabad risks licensing Beijing to adopt the same strategy against India,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-16 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1613182539668ab.jpg?r=143344' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911386/uaes-flydubai-starts-operations-for-peshawar-airport' target='_blank'><strong>UAE’s flydubai starts operations for Peshawar airport</strong></a><br><p>UAE-based low-cost airline flydubai has started flights to Peshawar’s Bacha Khan International Airport, the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement today.
Peshawar’s airport is a major passenger hub with 75 per cent flights internationally bound, according to the PAA’s website.
The inaugural flight of flydubai, FZ 375, “arrived in Peshawar last night with 164 passengers”, the PAA said in a statement.
It added that the flight was given a water cannon salute at Bacha Khan Airport, which is a traditional aviation gesture to honour inaugural flights.
A cake-cutting ceremony was also held on the arrival of flydubai, the statement added.
The UAE-based airline will operate daily flights to Peshawar from Dubai, flydubai had said in a statement.

The PAA noted that air connections from Peshawar to Gulf and European countries will be expanded.
FZ 375 departed back to Dubai at 2:20am PKT with 184 passengers, the statement concluded.
In October 2023, Qatar-based airline Salam Air also started flights to Peshawar.
The carrier had announced to operate twice-weekly flights from Muscat to Peshawar, scheduled on Mondays and Thursdays.</p><small>2025-05-16 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16123853c5cea7f.jpg?r=123916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911384/polio-outbreak-declared-in-papua-new-guinea' target='_blank'><strong>Polio outbreak declared in Papua New Guinea</strong></a><br><p>A polio outbreak has been declared in Papua New Guinea, sparking concern about the disease’s spread in a country with low vaccination rates, health officials said.
Papua New Guinea was certified as polio-free in 2000, but immunisation rates among children are low — less than 50 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation.
The virus was detected in wastewater and environmental samples in the Pacific nation’s capital, Port Moresby, and second largest city Lae, the WHO said.
In subsequent testing, two children in Lae were found to have the poliovirus type 2 strain, according to the WHO representative in Papua New Guinea, Sevil Huseynova.
The confirmation of community transmission in the children “constitutes a polio outbreak”, Huseynova said in briefing notes provided to AFP on Friday.
The health agency “expresses deep concern over the confirmed outbreak”, she said. Genetic testing showed the polio strain detected in Papua New Guinea was linked to one circulating in Indonesia.
“Polio is a highly infectious disease, and in communities with low polio immunisation rates, the virus quickly spreads from one person to another,” Huseynova said.
Papua New Guinea Health Minister Elias Kapavore said the situation was “serious but manageable”.
“We’ve dealt with this before and know what works,” he told reporters on Thursday. “Vaccination is safe and effective, and we’re acting quickly to keep children protected,” he said.
Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious and potentially fatal. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and mainly affects children under five years old.</p><small>2025-05-16 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16111812a988918.jpg?r=111947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911373/two-climbers-from-india-and-philippines-die-on-everest' target='_blank'><strong>Two climbers, from India and Philippines, die on Everest</strong></a><br><p>An Indian climber and another from the Philippines became the first mountaineers to die on Mount Everest in the current March-May climbing season of the world’s highest peak, hiking officials said on Friday.
Subrata Ghosh, 45, from India, died on Thursday below the Hillary Step while returning after reaching the 8,849-metre (29,032 feet) peak.
“He refused to descend from below the Hillary Step,” said Bodhraj Bhandari of Nepal’s Snowy Horizon Treks and Expedition organising company.
No other details were available.
The Hillary Step is located in the ‘death zone’, an area between 8,000-metre (26,250 ft) high South Col and the summit where the level of natural oxygen is inadequate for survival.
“Efforts are underway to bring his body down to the base camp. The cause of his death will be known only after post mortem,” Bhandari said.
Philipp II Santiago, 45, from the Philippines, died late on Wednesday at the South Col while he was on his way up, said Himal Gautam, a tourism department official.
Santiago was tired when he reached the fourth high camp and died while resting in his tent, Gautam added.
Santiago and Ghose were both members of an international expedition organised by Bhandari.
Nepal has issued 459 permits to climb Everest during the current season that ends in May. Nearly 100 climbers and their guides have already reached the summit this week.
Mountain climbing, trekking and tourism is a source of income and employment for Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world.
At least 345 people have died on Everest in more than 100 years since summiting expeditions were known to have started, according to the Himalayan data base and hiking officials.</p><small>2025-05-16 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1611095771ecf04.png?r=114822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911246/shakib-rajapaksa-join-lahore-qalandars-karachi-kings-sign-munsey' target='_blank'><strong>Shakib, Rajapaksa join Lahore Qalandars; Karachi Kings sign Munsey</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Former Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan and Sri Lankan batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa have signed up for Lahore Qalandars for the remainder of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) season, the franchise announced on Thursday. Meanwhile, Karachi Kings have secured the services of Scotland opener George Munsey.
The tenth edition of the PSL is set to resume from Saturday — with Kings taking on Peshawar Zalmi at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium — after the league was postponed as a result of cross-border tensions between Pakistan and India, which started May 7 before culminating in a ceasefire three days later.

The disruption had seen the franchises release their respective players, with the overseas contingent flying out of Pakistan as military action escalated between the neighbours.
Although the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later released a revised schedule for the PSL, not all overseas players originally signed by the franchises were ready to return to the country as teams scrambled to sign replacements.
Shakib comes in place of New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell, who, the franchise said, was nursing a hand injury.
“It’s a tournament I’ve always enjoyed watching, and now I’m looking forward to contributing on the field,” Shakib said in a Qalandars statement.
Rajapaksa, meanwhile, is the replacement for England pacer Tom Curran, who picked up an ankle injury before returning home on May 7. “Bhanuka is a proven match-winner with the kind of fearless intent we value at Lahore Qalandars,” the side’s director Sameen Rana said, while ruing Curran’s absence.
“Tom has been a key part of our setup, both on and off the field,” he noted. “His energy, commitment, and all-round skills made a strong impact. It’s unfortunate to lose him at this stage, but his long-term fitness is the priority.”
Meanwhile, Zimbabwean all-rounder Sikandar Raza joined the Qalandars squad on Wednesday night, the franchise said.
On May 18, Rawalpindi will host a double-header as Multan Sultans will take on Quetta Gladiators in the afternoon, while Peshawar Zalmi and Lahore Qalandars will go head on head in the evening encounter. Islamabad United and Karachi Kings will feature in the last group-match of the event the next day.
The action will then shift to Lahore, where the first Qualifier is scheduled on May 21. Eliminator 1 and Qualifier 2 will follow on May 22 and 23, respectively.

Here’s why</strong></a><br><p>Despite decades of reform efforts and promises, Pakistan’s governance system fails to deliver. Time and again, ambitious agendas are announced, yet institutions remain marred by entrenched inefficiencies, widespread corruption, bureaucratic inertia, and poor service delivery. One may ask, what is it we keep getting wrong? The problem is, we’ve been looking for answers everywhere but within.
While civil service initiatives have been repeatedly proposed and occasionally implemented, their impact has been diluted by an enduring centralisation of power that resists meaningful change. At the heart of the failures lies an often overlooked truth: no reform can truly succeed without a genuinely empowered, autonomous, robust and constitutionally protected local government system.
The case for local government empowerment
Local governments form the foundation of democratic governance and responsive service delivery. They are uniquely positioned to identify and address the specific needs of communities, provide targeted solutions, and enable direct citizen participation. Yet, in Pakistan, these governments have historically been undermined or co-opted by provincial and federal powers that view decentralisation as a threat rather than an opportunity.
Around the world, decentralised governance has proven its worth. Germany’s decentralised administrative model delegates core services like education and health to local authorities, ensuring responsiveness and efficiency. In Brazil, participatory budgeting, which gives citizens a direct say in local spending, has enhanced transparency and reduced corruption.
 
 

In the Pakistani context, academic research has emphasised the strategic importance of local governance. A landmark study on decentralisation reveals that local government reforms often originated from non-democratic regimes — seeking legitimacy rather than lasting institutional change. However, such reforms, including those under Ayub Khan and Musharraf, lacked permanence due to the absence of constitutional backing and the deep entrenchment of central authority.
The Musharraf model and its lessons
General Pervez Musharraf’s Devolution of Power Plan (2000) remains one of the most ambitious local governance initiatives in Pakistan’s history. Implemented through the Local Government Ordinance (2001), the system introduced a three-tier structure — district, tehsil, and union councils — with elected representatives managing local development, finance, and public services.
Under this system, Citizen Community Boards (CCBs) and Musalihat Anjumans were introduced to institutionalise citizen participation and local dispute resolution. For the first time, bureaucrats were made subordinate to elected officials at the local level. However, the lack of constitutional protection meant that the system was dismantled once Musharraf left power. Post-2008 democratic governments did not hold timely local elections, and provincial governments resisted genuine decentralisation.
Despite its flaws, the Musharraf-era devolution revealed the transformative potential of local governance. District governments took ownership of development planning, citizens were engaged in project selection, and marginalised communities had greater access to public services.
Why civil service reform alone is not enough
Civil service reform typically focuses on merit-based recruitment, performance evaluation, training, and reducing corruption. However, without corresponding decentralisation, these reforms are confined to the upper echelons of governance and rarely affect outcomes at the grassroots level.
The Pakistani civil service remains highly centralised, with officers frequently rotated across provinces and ministries. This practice discourages specialisation and undermines local accountability. Without empowered local governments, even the most efficient bureaucrats cannot address local challenges effectively.
 
 

Moreover, civil servants in Pakistan often operate in a political vacuum — isolated from the constituencies they are meant to serve. This disconnect hampers their ability to respond to local needs and fosters a sense of alienation among citizens. In my recent article for weekly business and economic magazine Profit, I argue how local institutions can play a crucial role in countering extremism. By delivering essential services, creating employment opportunities, and improving community engagement, they can address the root causes of disillusionment — tasks that remote, centralised bureaucracies are ill-equipped to manage.
A comparative perspective
Across the globe, governments are discovering that the path to national progress begins at the local level.
India’s Panchayati Raj system showcases the power of grassroots democracy. Its local government structure mandates regular elections and assigns significant administrative and financial authority to local bodies. The integration of civil servants in this framework ensures accountability, responsiveness, and deeper citizen engagement.
Turkey’s urban governance is another example. Istanbul’s transformation through empowered municipal leadership illustrates how decentralisation can spur urban renewal, infrastructure development, and economic vibrancy.
Estonia’s e-governance revolution demonstrates the potential of digital integration at the local level. By streamlining services and enhancing transparency, it has significantly reduced corruption and increased efficiency. Countries such as Pakistan can draw on this approach to modernise civil services and empower local institutions.
Here’s what must be done
To truly empower citizens and transform governance from the ground up, Pakistan must reimagine and revitalise its local government systems. The foundation lies in granting constitutional safeguards that mandate regular elections and clearly define the authority of local bodies, with the Supreme Court ensuring provincial compliance. A specialised municipal civil service cadre, as seen in India, can infuse professionalism and continuity into local administration. Equally critical is devolution of finances — empowering local governments with control over property taxes, municipal services, and a fair share of national revenue.
Moreover, digitising administration at tehsil and union levels will bring much-needed transparency, while institutionalising public participation and oversight through citizen juries, community boards, and participatory budgeting will make governance more inclusive. Finally, a performance-based bureaucracy — where civil servants are evaluated on service delivery outcomes instead of tenure or connections — can drive a culture of accountability and effectiveness.
Without such bold reforms, Pakistan risks perpetuating a system that keeps power distant from the people it is meant to serve.
 


A holistic approach
These examples highlight that local government empowerment, combined with civil service reform, creates a governance architecture capable of addressing complex societal needs. Pakistan can draw valuable lessons from these experiences to navigate its own reform journey.
Civil service reform in Pakistan cannot — and should not — be pursued in isolation. The country’s administrative challenges are deeply intertwined with its political and governance structures. The absence of empowered local governments has not only hollowed out democratic participation but also undermined the effectiveness of the civil service.
To build a responsive, accountable, and citizen-oriented governance system, Pakistan must embrace a dual-track reform agenda: transforming the civil service while simultaneously devolving power to the grassroots. Only then can we hope to resolve the governance crisis that continues to plague this nation. It is imperative for policymakers, civil society, and international partners to support the cause of local governance — not just as an administrative reform, but as a democratic necessity.</p><small>2025-05-16 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/160950304cbb3e6.jpg?r=095152' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911304/protests-in-gilgit-baltistan-after-arrest-of-acc-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Protests in Gilgit-Baltistan after arrest of ACC leaders</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: Protests broke out across Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Thursday after police arrested five leaders of the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee (ACC), including its chairman, Ehsan Ali Advocate, ahead of a planned Grand Jirga on May 26.
Demonstrations were held in Hunza, Gilgit and Skardu, where protesters condemned the arrests and demanded the immediate release of the detained leaders. The ACC said the arrests were aimed at sabotaging the jirga, which was to address issues surrounding the ownership of natural resources in the region.
According to officials, police arrested the activists — Ehsan Ali Advocate, Engineer Mahboob Wali, Masoodul Rehman, Asghar Shah and Waheed Hassan — from various places in Gilgit on Wednesday evening. A GB anti-terrorism court on Thursday granted police 14-day physical remand of the accused, who were taken to the Airport Police Station.
Authorities have refused to share the First Infor­mation Report (FIR), but a police source told Dawn that the arrests were made under anti-terrorism laws for alleged anti-state activities and hate speech during the recent Pakistan-India border tensions. An FIR has reportedly been registered against 16 ACC leaders.
In Aliabad, Hunza, demonstrators gathered along the Karakoram Highway. Protesters accused the GB government of targeting political dissent under false pretenses.

Meanwhile, according to a decision announced by the PM, the nation will be observing Youm-i-Tashakur on Friday (today) on the victory of Pakistan in the recent conflict with India.
“You have not only changed the mindset of the world but also the equation in the region and in the world,” the prime minister said while addressing a gathering of Pakistan Air Force officers during a visit to PAF airbase Kamra. He paid the visit to meet the Pakistani pilots who had successfully defended the nation during one of the longest aerial engagements of the 21st century between May 6 and 10.

He noted that PAF had established its superiority over India by downing not five but six fighter planes, including three Rafale jets.
“Today I want to tell the nation with pride that you (PAF pilots) have not downed five but six Indian fighter planes,” he added.
He said that Pakistani Shaheens had made history. “Your friends and foes will remember this history forever. You destroyed the enemy and boosted the confidence of your friends,” he added.
He recalled that after the Pahalgam incident, Pakistan had offered a transparent and independent inquiry, but India imposed war on Pakistan and brutally killed innocent citizens. However, Pakistan’s response was vigorous and India will never dare to attack Pakistan again, he added.
The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, and other officials.
PM Shehbaz urged his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to hold dialogue and said: “Your fever of war would have gone, so now talk about peace and you know what are its prerequisites — first you have to give the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir under the UN resolutions. “Let’s sit together to resolve this issue, otherwise it can ignite the fire anytime in the future,” he added.
Earlier, PM Shehbaz talked to Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev by telephone and conveyed his profound gratitude for resolutely standing with Pakistan during the crisis with India.
President Aliyev warmly congratulated the prime minister on Pakistan’s remarkable success and welcomed the ceasefire.

The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench had taken up petitions filed by five judges of the IHC concerning the seniority dispute and the transfer of three judges to the IHC. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar headed the bench.
“This is unfortunate that the national politics has seeped into the bar politics,” regretted Justice Hasan, adding that this tendency was started by a political party now opposed to the present opposition. The judge bemoaned that this malaise had never been the practice in the past.
While pointing towards senior counsel Hamid Khan, who was representing  the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and the Lahore Bar  Association (LBA), Justice Hasan observed that it was to his knowledge  that the presidents of both associations were staunch members of a  political party and Mr Khan was also its senator.

Counsel says suo motu on ‘meddling’ still pending, claims it showed weakness of judiciary

He also wondered why  the Islamabad High Court Bar Association had earlier withdrawn their  petitions from the apex court.
Hamid Khan responded that when the judges could not stand extraneous pressures, how could the bars do that?
Referring to the letters written by IHC judges highlighting alleged meddling on the part of the intelligence agencies in the judicial affairs and subsequent hearings by the Supreme Court on a suo motu, the counsel emphasised that had the high court judges not shown courage by writing these letters, the matter would not have ever surfaced. But it is unfortunate that the suo motu case is still pending, which shows weakness on the part of the judiciary, he added.
The counsel said the Supreme Court should have decided the challenges to the 26th Amendment since it has become a roadblock in every other matter.
Hamid Khan also read out excerpts from the letter as well as the reports furnished by different high courts during the suo motu hearing on the letter by the IHC judges.
However, the constitutional bench repeatedly asked the counsel to stick to the constitutional disputes since the suo motu case was still pending before a larger bench. Justice Mazhar said the counsel should have filed an application seeking an early hearing of the suo motu case, if he was so concerned.
Earlier, senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, who was representing the five high court judges, closed his arguments while citing a statement by the five petitioner judges. The bench observed that the statement was irrelevant since the judges were already before the court through their petition.
In the statement, the five judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Riaffat Imtiaz — stated that they stood up to be counted in defence of constitutionalism, the rule of law, and judicial independence.
As high court judges, they said they did not seek self-aggrandisement or any personal benefit from the outcome of these proceedings.
“And we have done so in full view of the code of conduct requiring judges not to indulge in avoidable litigation and public controversy. The actions impugned in this petition would not have been intolerable had they merely affected our seniority amongst our peers. They are abhorrent as they constitute commandeering of IHC and demolition of its independence and sanctity before our eyes,” the statement said.
The judges went on to say that they had taken administrative measures to stem the slide in judicial independence and the resultant weakening of fundamental rights and the rule of law. They said their petition was a measure of last resort, as per the statement.
The counsel also left certain points for the constitutional bench to ponder by questioning whether any established mode was available for the transfer of judges from one high court to another and that what should be the best mode to protect the independence of the judiciary as held in previous judgements, like the Sharaf Faridi, Malik Asad Ali and Al-Jehad cases.
The counsel emphasised that the judges would never be independent unless fully insulated from outside pressures, and if a judge who was 16th in seniority was transferred to another high court to become the senior-most judge, then it would destroy the concept of legitimate expectancy of the rest of the judges to become the chief justice.
The counsel also questioned if the constitutional court could take guidance from the practice prevalent in the civil services, but Justice Mazhar reminded that transfer in the civil service was one of the conditions for which no consent was needed.

“It is true that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, and the chairman later informed Imran Khan about it. However, the call was solely related to the current tensions with India and had nothing to do with political negotiations,” PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram told Dawn.
Mr Akram added, “I spoke to Mr Gohar, and he confirmed that no offer for negotiations was made during the call, nor did he convey any such message to Imran Khan.”
Media reports have suggested that PM Shehbaz had extended an invitation for talks to PTI and that Imran Khan had not only accepted the offer but also instructed Mr Gohar to proceed, albeit with a condition to keep the process out of the media spotlight.

Gohar says former premier ‘will never strike a deal’

According to party sources, it was correct that talks couldn’t be held during media presence. “In the past, we tried to hold talks with the government and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, but because of the speculations by the media, the talks could not reach a logical end. However, no such offer has been made at the moment,” a party official said.
Sources claimed that during the meeting between Mr Khan and Mr Gohar, other people, including Salman Safdar and Zaheer Abbas, were also present, making it implausible for confidential matters such as negotiations to be discussed.
Mr Gohar also rejected any such development. Talking to media persons, he said that no deal was made with anyone regarding Imran Khan’s case.
“No such deal has been made. However, I believe that political issues should be addressed through dialogue. Khan Sahib’s sons Kasim and Sulaiman have also said that no deal has been made. Both sons are aware of the issues and are in contact with their father,” he said.
Replying to questions, Mr Gohar said the prime minister had given an offer for negotiations on the floor of the house, and Mr Gohar had welcomed it.
“I said that we would ask Khan Sahib and the party, and then we will be able to reply. I have never shared Khan Sahib’s talks with anyone on the record or even off the record,” he said.
He said that both sons of Imran Khan gave a very good interview and shared whatever was in their hearts. “They are very close to their father and are in contact with him,” he said.
Mr Gohar insisted that Imran Khan “will never make a deal and will never be broken”.

An IHC division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif directed the case be fixed for hearing next week following a request by senior lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa.
The courtroom witnessed the presence of a high-profile legal team of the PTI, including Salman Akram Raja, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, Niazullah Khan Niazi and Shoaib Shaheen, as well as PTI leaders Aleema Khan, Asad Qaiser, Shandana Gulzar, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry and Nadia Khattak.
An accountability court in Islamabad had sentenced the former prime minister and Bushra Bibi to 14 and seven years in prison, respectively, on Jan 17 this year.

Directs case be fixed for hearing next week

In their appeal against the conviction, the former prime minister’s legal team highlighted significant procedural irregularities, withholding of key evidence, and political victimisation.
The defence pointed to a November 2021 judgement from the UK Court of Appeal which, they argued, clearly established that the disputed £190 million was not proceeds of crime.
 
 

The funds, part of a settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and property tycoon Malik Riaz Hussain, were to be transferred to the Supreme Court under a legally binding arrangement.
The appeal criticised NAB for failing to produce witnesses from the NCA or present credible documentation to establish the wrongdoing.
The defence also challenged the authenticity of a “confidentiality deed” presented by NAB, describing it as unverified and unsupported by forensic validation. Lawyers argued that the deed was procedural in nature and not indicative of any criminal activity.
Mr Khan’s petition said there was no evidence of personal financial gain and that the funds in question were deposited into the Al-Qadir University Trust — a legally registered entity for educational purposes.
“The prosecution’s own evidence confirms that no donations or monetary benefits were received personally by Mr Khan or his wife,” the appeal stated.
Furthermore, the petition accused NAB of a politically motivated investigation, highlighting the selective targeting of the PTI founder while omitting six other implicated individuals.
Bushra Bibi, who is serving a seven-year sentence in the same case, filed a separate appeal saying that the case against her lacked credible evidence and it was rooted in a political vendetta.
Her legal team referenced the testimony of the Chief Financial Officer (PW-5) of Al-Qadir Trust, who reportedly confirmed that neither she nor her husband gained any financial advantage from the Trust.
Later, talking to journalists outside the courtroom, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar confirmed that Barrister Gohar Ali Khan recently held a meeting with the party’s founder. The development comes amid growing speculation about possible negotiations between PTI and the government.
Barrister Zafar acknowledged there has been media buzz regarding the PTI founder’s openness to dialogue. However, he clarified that Barrister Gohar has neither confirmed nor denied reports of potential talks, stressing that any communication with the PTI founder remains confidential.
“The matter has not yet been discussed in our core committee,” Mr Zafar said. “Imran Khan, the founder of PTI, has consistently maintained that the current government is not legitimate. Any decisions or directions regarding negotiations will be made only after clear instructions are received from both Barrister Gohar and the party founder.”
Mr Zafar reiterated that PTI remains united for Pakistan and it is open to dialogue, but any formal talks will depend entirely on the directives of the party’s top leadership.
“If the PTI founder instructs us to engage in talks, then we will move forward accordingly,” he said.
Aleema Khan, the sister of Imran Khan, on the other hand, strongly rejected reports suggesting her brother has agreed to initiate talks with the government. Speaking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, she said such claims were baseless and fabricated.
“I don’t understand where this news came from,” she said, referring to the alleged backchannel negotiations.

• Reforms expected to boost exports by $5bn in five years
• Simple average tariff to fall from 19pc to 9.5pc
ISLAMABAD: In a major policy shift, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved a comprehensive five-year tariff reform plan to be announced in the federal budget 2025-26, aiming to drastically reduce customs duties, additional customs duties, regulatory duties on raw materials and semi-finished goods, and a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
The first phase of the reform, set to be launched with the next budget, introduces a simplified customs duty structure with slabs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 per cent. The existing 16pc slab will be reduced to 15pc, while the 11pc rate will drop to 10pc. The 3pc slab will be abolished, with products either moved to a zero-duty category or the new 5pc slab.
The proposed tariff overhaul, seen by Dawn, is set to eliminate the additional customs duty of 2pc on 4,294 tariff lines in the upcoming budget. The plan also includes a reduction of additional customs duty from 4pc to 2pc on 545 tariff lines, from 6pc to 4pc on 2,227 tariff lines, and from 7pc to 6pc for all products currently subject to a customs duty above 20pc.
The government is set to slash regulatory duties, which currently reach as high as 90pc on various products, bringing them down to a maximum of 30pc. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has also supported the major overhaul of the tariffs to boost industrial production in the country.
A further substantial cut is scheduled for next year’s budget, while the final three years of the plan will see a gradual, nominal reduction in tariffs.
According to estimates, this tariff rationalisation is projected to boost exports by approximately $5 billion by the end of the plan’s implementation, reinforcing Pakistan’s drive towards a more competitive global trade position.
Five-year roadmap
Industries such as auto, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and plastics — currently shielded by effective tariff rates ranging between 100pc and 150pc — will see those rates reduced to around 50pc to 60pc. The premier said his government’s priority is to shift away from import substitution to an export-led growth strategy.
Under its ambitious reform agenda, the government has set a target to slash the simple average tariff from the current 19pc to 9.5pc within five years. A key adjustment in the plan includes restructuring duty slabs, replacing the existing slabs of 0pc, 3pc, 11pc, 16pc and 20pc with a streamlined system of 0pc, 5pc, 10pc and 15pc. This will not only simplify the tariff structure but also bring certainty, transparency, and uniform cascading margins that are easy to administer and comply with.
By the end of the five-year implementation period, the tar­iff overhaul will establish a uniform maximum duty slab of 15pc, eliminating sector-specific peaks that previo­usly exceeded 20pc — primarily affecting the auto industry.
The additional customs duties currently set at 2pc, 4pc, 6pc and 7pc across various slabs will be gradually phased out to zero within the next three to four years.
Regulatory duties, which presently range from 5pc to 90pc on various products, will also be fully eliminated over five years, easing import costs and improving market accessibility.
Moreover, the 5th Schedule of Customs, which provides industry-specific tariff concessions, will be dissolved, with all products covered under it transitioning to the 1st Schedule in a phased manner.
According to the tariff reform plan, these concessions will either be discontinued or extended universally, ensuring a more equitable trade policy across industries.
Exports-led growth strategy
The government has decided to embark on an outward-looking, export-led growth tariff policy. This major shift in the trade and tariff policy is based on thorough research, evidence from successful economies and Pakistan’s own experience.
The drastic cuts in duties will provide full support to the vulnerable sectors and industries. The cascading principle will be maintained and industries will still enjoy substantially high effective rates of protection.
The current high, complex, and discriminatory tariff structure has favoured only a few big businesses, which over time have become less efficient and unproductive.
The vested interests taking advantage of the myths and disconnects around tariff reforms are raising their voice against the reforms, a senior Customs officer said. “There is no truth to the assertions that tariff rationalisation would affect external balance or revenue generation negatively,” the officer claimed.
Scientific models used in policy analysis suggest that while imports may rise slightly, exports are expected to grow at a faster pace, improving the trade balance. More than 45pc of imports are inelastic — comprising food and energy — and historically, spikes in the import bill have stemmed from global price hikes rather than imports of industrial inputs.
It is expected that this shift from import substitution to an export-led policy will give a much-needed boost to the economy. Lower tariffs will reduce anti-export bias and help businesses, especially small businesses in textile, agriculture and light engineering sectors, to integrate into global value chains, the policy said.

• PTI facing blackout in coverage by official media
ISLAMABAD: The government faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of an important money bill in the middle of the process.
It was after facing a 67-32 vote defeat on the motion tabled by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to present the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 for its passage that opposition members belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) realised that their absence could prevent the government from maintaining quorum for which the presence of 84 members is required in the 336-member house.
As soon as Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah declared the result of the headcount on the motion, the PTI members strategically walked out, leaving behind their colleague Aamir Dogar to point out lack of quorum at a time when the chair had already got approval of two clauses of the three-clause bill through a voice vote.
 
 

The deputy speaker desperately ordered a headcount and then suspended the proceedings till completion of the quorum. The government, however, not only failed to complete the quorum — for which it required the presence of 17 more members — but also could not hold the members already present in the house and thus the number dropped to even less than 67.
When the proceedings resumed after half an hour, the chair found no other option but to announce the adjournment of the sitting till Friday morning (today) without completing the agenda, which included the passage of five bills.
The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 is already in the field as the government had introduced it last year in the form of an ordinance.
However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it has now become mandatory for the government to get it passed from the assembly for continuation of its enforcement. The bill, according to the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is aimed at removing some difficulties faced by taxpayers in the implementation of higher tax rates on income from federal government securities as well as rationalising standard tax rate on whole of the business income of banking companies.
Media blackout
The state-run media, as well as the official social media platforms of the National Assembly, continued the policy of censoring the proceedings of the house with opposition members facing a complete blackout.
Earlier, the National Assembly’s proceedings were not broadcast live on its official social media platforms when the house held a discussion on the Pakistan-India conflict, following the Pahalgam attack.
On May 6, when Leader of Opposition Omar Ayub Khan raised the issue of his speech being censored, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq asserted his authority, saying he had the right to expunge anything deemed “against national interest”.
The proceedings were not live-streamed on the NA’s official YouTube and Facebook channels, while PTV aired speeches from the treasury benches only.
At that time, a senior National Assembly Secretariat official had stated that the live-streaming of parliamentary proceedings had been stopped on social media in view of the sensitivity of the situation between Pakistan and India, adding that the live-stream would resume soon.
Though censorship of “objectionable parts” of opposition lawmakers’ speeches has become something of a norm, a complete blackout of proceedings during debate on an important issue was quite unprecedented.
After completion of the debate on India-Pakistan conflict, the live-streaming of the NA proceedings began on its official YouTube and Facebook channels, but now with complete blackout of the opposition members even during the question hour.
There was no word from the government on the issue. However, a senior official of the NA Secretariat told Dawn that the blackout of opposition members was being done on the directives of Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.

The government incre­ased the Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM) on both petrol and diesel to clear about Rs34 billion loss to the oil industry owing to a tax loophole in the Finance Bill 2024-25.
In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Fina­nce said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of the fluctuations in the international market.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel was reduced by Rs2 per litre to Rs254.64 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs256.64.
Most of the transport sector runs on high-speed diesel. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot price of petrol was kept unchanged at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct effect on middle- and lower-income households.
At present, the government charges about Rs96 per litre tax on both petrol and high-speed diesel.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.
The government also charges about Rs17 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre of potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage a rise in petroleum consumption. This was done through an increase in the petroleum levy through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidies on electricity rates and the construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
At the request of the Petroleum Division, IFEM has now been increased by Rs1.87 per litre to address losses faced by refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs). The financial impact, estimated at Rs34bn for FY25, stems from the reclassification of petroleum products as “exempt” under the new Finance Act, rendering input sales tax non-refundable for refineries and OMCs.
The Petroleum Division proposed that the Rs34bn shortfall be recovered through IFEM over a 12-month period, with the adjustment automatically ending in the 13th month.
Petrol and HSD remain the government’s top revenue generators, accounting for monthly sales of 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.

• Hamas says Gaza ‘not for sale’
GAZA: Palestinian rescuers reported more than 100 people killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on blockaded Gaza, where a US-backed organisation said it intends to begin distributing aid by the end of the month.
Aid to Gaza has been cut off since March 2, a tactic Israel has said is intended to force concessions from Hamas, but the group insisted on Thursday that the restoration of humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory was “the minimum requirement” for talks.
It also warned that Gaza was not “for sale” hours after US President Donald Trump, on a visit to the region, again floated taking over the territory and turning it into “a freedom zone”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said the death toll from Israeli bombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103.
Israel’s aid blockade preceded a resumption of military operations on March 18, ending a ceasefire that had largely halted hostilities since mid-January.
For weeks, UN agencies have warned that supplies of everything from food and clean water to fuel and medicines are reaching new lows.
“Israel’s blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination,” Human Rights Watch interim executive director Federico Borello said.
AFPTV footage from the aftermath of a strike on Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory showed flattened buildings and piles of concrete rubble.
“We pray for this war to end, and we appeal to all international institutions to end the war because enough is enough,” said Gaza resident Maher Ghanem, his arm in a sling.
Gaza not ‘for sale’
Israel says the aid stoppage and military pressure are meant to force Hamas to free the remaining prisoners.
But senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the entry of aid into Gaza was “the minimum requirement for a conducive and constructive negotiation environment”.
“Access to food, water, and medicine is a fundamental human right — not a subject for negotiation,” he added.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US-supported NGO, said it would begin distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza this month after talks with Israeli officials.
But the United Nations on Thursday ruled out involvement with the initiative.
“As we’ve stated repeatedly, this particular distribution plan does not accord with our basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality, independence, and we will not be participating in this,” said UN spokesman Farhan Haq.
Trump said he wanted the United States to “get involved” in Gaza.
“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good… let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said on the Qatar leg of a Gulf tour, adding he would be “proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone”.
The comments echoed an idea he floated in February for the United States to “take over” the devastated territory and redevelop it into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.
Hamas official Naim said “Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land — it is not real estate for sale on the open market”.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas — in remarks addressing a UN commemoration of the “Nakba”, the flight or expulsion of an estimated 700,000 Palestinians during the creation of Israel in 1948 — warned against repeating the displacement of his people in Gaza.
The United Nations estimates that 70 per cent of Gaza is now either an Israeli-declared no-go zone or under evacuation order.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 2,876 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,010.
West Bank raids
In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, raids were ongoing and roads blocked after Israel’s military chief vowed to find the perpetrators of an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman.
WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the territory were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for the attack.
“To make sure this never happens again… we need real revenge!” one user said.
In the northern village of Tammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks.
The West Bank has seen an upsurge in violence since the beginning of the Gaza war.

• India says water treaty to remain suspended until end to ‘cross-border terrorism’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to investigate the ‘nuclear black market’ in India and repeated incidents of theft and illicit trafficking of radioactive material, as it rejected a call by India’s defence minister for the nuclear watchdog to monitor Islamabad’s nuclear programme.
Pointing to multiple incidents of radioactive material theft in India and other security lapses, the Foreign Office said, “Pakistan urges a thorough investigation of these incidents and calls upon India to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and arsenal.”
“If anything, the IAEA and the international community should be worried about the repeated theft and illicit trafficking incidents involving nuclear and radioactive material in India,” the statement added.
The Foreign Office was responding to comments made by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during a speech to Indian soldiers in Srinagar, in which he said, “I believe that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”
Mr Singh’s remarks came days after the two nuclear-armed neighbours paused their worst military confrontation in nearly three decades following the Pahalgam attack, a militant assault that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based groups. Tensions spiked as cross-border exchanges escalated, prompting global concern over a potential nuclear flashpoint.
In a separate statement days after the ceasefire, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.”
In its response, the Foreign Office said Mr Singh’s comments “reveal his profound insecurity and frustration regarding Pakistan’s effective defence and deterrence against Indian aggression through conventional means,” adding that “Pakistan’s conventional capabilities are adequate to deter India, without the self-imposed ‘nuclear blackmail’ that New Delhi suffers.”
The Foreign Office also criticised Mr Singh’s remarks as “ignorant of the mandate and responsibilities” of the IAEA, a Vienna-based UN agency tasked with verifying that nuclear programmes remain peaceful. India’s civilian nuclear facilities are subject to IAEA safeguards under a 2008 agreement, but its strategic programme is not.
Citing recent incidents, the Foreign Office recalled that five individuals were reportedly caught in the Indian city of Dehradun last year with a radioactive device allegedly stolen from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. In another case, a gang was found in possession of Californium — a highly radioactive element valued at over $100 million. Three separate incidents of Californium theft were also reported in 2021.
“These recurring incidents call into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material. These incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India,” the Foreign Office said.
While tensions have de-escalated for now, the heated rhetoric and the Indus Waters Treaty suspension have pushed South Asia’s nuclear-armed rivals into another prolonged diplomatic standoff.
Water treaty tensions
In a further sign of deteriorating ties, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced on Thursday that the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would remain in effect “until cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped”.
 
 

India had announced the treaty’s suspension immediately after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
Pakistan had then condemned the Indian move, stating: “Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. The treaty is a binding international agreement brokered by the World Bank and contains no provision for unilateral suspension.”
Water is a “vital national interest of Pakistan, a lifeline for its 240 million people and its availability will be safeguarded at all costs”, the Foreign Office warned at the time.
“Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty, and the usurpation of the rights of lower riparian will be considered an act of war and responded with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” it added.

• Dar says ultimately ‘political dialogue’ will take place to address all issues; reiterates opposition to Indian move to end Kashmir’s autonomy
• Senate resolution condemns India for unprovoked strikes against Pakistan
• Trump claims hostilities between nuclear neighbours ‘settled’, asks both to focus on trade
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan and India extended the nascent ceasefire till May 18, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday informed the Senate that Pakistan sought a “composite dialogue” with New Delhi to put all contentious matters to rest.
According to the foreign minister, the ceasefire was extended through military-to-military communication, but a political dialogue will ultimately have to take place to resolve the problems between the two neighbours. “We have told the world that we will hold a composite dialogue,” he informed the Senate.
The FM said Pakistan had never accepted the unilateral revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status by India in 2019, while also warning that any attempt to block Pakistan’s water through the unlawful suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would be treated as an act of war.
He said there was no clause in the treaty under which it could be held in abeyance. “It could neither be amended nor terminated unilaterally,” he said, alluding to the Indian move to hold the treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam shooting. The deputy prime minister said India used the Pahalgam incident as a pretext to sabotage the Indus Waters Treaty.
The FM also clarified that Pakistan had not sought the ceasefire in conversations with world leaders during the heightened tensions with India. In fact, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a telephonic conversation, conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, he added.
 
 

The FM also referred to subsequent calls from friendly countries and said Pakistan’s position that it desired peace with dignity and honour was explained to all. “We told our friends that we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international law.
The foreign minister pointed out that the recent conflict began after the Pahalgam incident, which India instantly blamed on Pakistan in the absence of any evidence. “We offered a transparent and neutral investigation into the Pahalgam attack, but India refused,” he regretted.
‘No longer diplomatically irrelevant’
Speaking about the recent conflict, he said Pakistan was “no longer diplomatically irrelevant”. “Pakistan is no longer diplomatically irrelevant; we have proven our strategic and diplomatic significance.”
As she opened the debate on the recent escalation, PPP leader Sena­tor Sherry Rehman said that Pakis­tan established its clear dominance in the tactical field as compared to India’s far more expensive force. “This war was deliberately thrust on us,” she said, adding that Pak­istan demonstrated to the world it was a responsible nuclear power.
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz said it was the right time to push the country tow­a­rds normalisation and political stability. “We have seen the performance of the nation when it is united,” he said, urging the government to pursue Pakistan’s foreign policy aggressively. He said that the recent escalation internationali­sed the Kashmir issue once again.
Resolution against India
The house also unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques, while praising the befitting response by the armed forces. The resolution urged the government to proactively engage the international community for the peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
It stressed the importance of strict adherence to the Indus tre­aty and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to protect its rightful share of water as a fundamental component of national sec­u­rity, international agreements, eco­nomic stability, and sovereignty.
It reminded India that any violations of the Indus treaty constituted a serious breach of international humanitarian law, and amounted not only to a war crime, but also a crime against humanity, with grave, regional, and global repercussions.
Separately, US President Donald Trump urged the two countries to focus on trade instead of war. He told US troops at a base in Qatar during a Gulf tour that Pakistan and India were happy with that, reported Reuters.
‘Maintain ceasefire’
The State Department on Thursday said the United States had urged India and Pakistan to maintain the current ceasefire.
Asked at a Washington press briefing about the reported extension, State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott said: “What we are happy to see is the ceasefire. That’s where our focus remains — and on the direct talks we want to see.”
Piggott credited both Indian and Pakistani leadership for agreeing to the truce. “The President (Trump) has been clear in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” he said.
“For the past couple of days, we’ve been saying that we want to encourage and see direct talks between the parties. We have been clear on that,” Piggott emphasised.

Trump began a visit to the UAE on the latest stage of a tour of wealthy Gulf states after hailing plans by Doha to invest $10 billion in a US military facility during a trip to Qatar.
“I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship will only get bigger and better,” Trump said in a meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
“Your wonderful brother came to Washington a few weeks ago and he told us about your generous statement as to the 1.4 trillion,” Trump said, referring to a UAE pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over 10 years.
Trump was referring to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohamed’s brother and the UAE’s national security adviser and chairman of two of Abu Dhabi’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds.
“And all I can say is thank you very much,” Trump added.
“We will work very hard to deserve it.”
Sheikh Mohamed told Trump the UAE was “keen to continue and strengthen this friendship for the benefit of the two countries and peoples”, adding to Trump: “Your presence here today, your excellency, the president, confirms that this keenness is mutual.”
Before his departure for the UAE, Trump said in a speech to US troops at the Al Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha that defence purchases signed by Qatar on Wednesday are worth $42bn.
He was met at the airport in Abu Dhabi by Sheikh Mohamed, and the two leaders visited the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, its white minarets and domes, impressive in the late-afternoon light.
“It is so beautiful,” Trump told reporters inside the mosque, which he said had been closed for the day.
“First time they closed it. It’s in honour of the United States. Better than in honour of me. Let’s give it to the country. That’s a great tribute.”
The UAE’s leaders want US help to make their wealthy Gulf nation a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The US has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
The deal would boost the UAE’s construction of data centres vital to developing AI models.
But the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the US government, and the terms could change, sources said.
At the presidential palace, Trump and Sheikh Mohamed could be seen in TV footage in conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
Trump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday after a regional trip that began on Tuesday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown — because they’ll be getting calls, ‘could you be here? Could you be there?’”
Trump had hinted that he could stop in Istanbul for talks on Ukraine.
The two countries have finalised a technology framework agreement that was expected to be signed later on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The agreement requires commitments on both sides to the security of technology, the source said, without immediately providing details.
Deals, diplomacy
Some big business agreements have been signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a $600bn commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.
The trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy.
Trump said in Qatar that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.
He also announced on Tuesday that the US would remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
He urged Sharaa to establish ties with Syria’s longtime foe, Israel.
AI is likely to be a focus of the final leg of Trump’s trip.
Former US president Joe Biden’s administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of US AI chips to the Middle East and other regions.
Among the Biden administration’s fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress Beijing’s military strength.
Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.
If all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China.
Trump compared his visit to Saudi Arabia with one by his predecessor in 2022, when Biden gave the Saudi crown prince a fist bump.
“I shook more hands, more than any human being is capable of doing,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
“He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia, in that case, and he gives him a fist bump. That’s not what they want. They don’t want a fist bump. They want to shake his hand.”</p><small>2025-05-15 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15172049db20b01.png?r=172258' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911211/dg-ispr-warns-of-swift-and-assured-response-in-case-india-breaks-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR warns of ‘swift and assured response’ in case India breaks ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster Sky News that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
Speaking to Sky News, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.
“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.
 


Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.
“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.
He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”
DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.
In a press conference held last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”
“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-15 14:25</small></div><hr>
