<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/242215521d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950992/sanaullah-says-tlp-was-created-to-steal-pml-ns-votes-rules-out-negotiations' target='_blank'><strong>Sanaullah says TLP was created to steal PML-N’s votes; rules out negotiations</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Friday that the now-banned religious party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “created in a bid to cut into PMLN’s vote bank,”.
Yesterday, the religiopolitical party was banned by the federal cabinet. In the 2018 general elections, the TLP was estimated by political analysts to have cost the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) at least 15 closely contested national seats across Pakistan. The party secured nearly 2.2 million votes, mostly from Punjab and Karachi, during the elections.
Earlier today, the interior ministry notified a ban on the TLP, saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism, after nationwide TLP protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, Rana Sanaullah, in response to a question regarding TLP’s future as a political party and whether it was being kept as an option to be used against rival political parties, agreed that TLP had been used in the past for that purpose and went on to quip that “it was created to steal votes from the PML-N’s vote bank”.
However, the premier’s advisor denied that TLP’s current fate had anything to do with its previous use as a proxy group, stating that “it was up to the federal cabinet to decide on any dissolution plans”.
“I am not in a position to talk on behalf of the cabinet,” he said, expressing optimism that the decision to dissolve the party will be made.
When asked if the government was open to negotiating with the now-banned group if it provided any assurances, citing TLP’s 2021 ban and its subsequent lift, Sanaullah responded, saying, “I think there can be no reassurance after you have already violated reassurances that were made previously”.
He stressed that “any party, whether political, religious, or academic, involved in terrorist activities is liable to be banned under clause 11b of the Anti-Terrorism Act”.
In response to a question on whether TLP can still contest elections as a political party, the PM’s aide said: “It is very difficult for a party to function while they are banned under the ATA”, and maintained that “the party can not take part in any elections while it is still banned under the ATA.”
Detailing the next steps following the ban, he said, “Now that the government has notified the ban, within the next three days, all these grounds will now be sent to TLP for review, after which it will have 30 days to file an appeal in a high court via a writ jurisdiction”.
However, he clarified that the ban on the party “stands within the review period and also during the appeal period,” emphasising that “there is no space for accommodating the party”.
On the matter of potential dissolution, he elaborated that, “the first step here is the review and then the appeal”.
“How will a party, that has been banned now, act as a political party? If their offices and assets have been sealed, how will they function?”
According to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,”  according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.
The TLP was formed in 2015 out of a protest campaign seeking the release of Mumtaz Qadri, a police constable who had assassinated the former governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, in 2011 over his calls to reform the blasphemy laws and release Asia Bibi, who had been accused of blasphemy. Qadri was later executed.
The group founded a political party at Qadri’s funeral in 2016, which was attended by thousands of people.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24200547eb99141.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950983/afghan-transit-trade-to-remain-suspended-until-evaluation-of-security-situation-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan transit trade to remain suspended until evaluation of security situation: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi on Friday said that transit trade with Afghanistan would remain suspended for the foreseeable future till the current security situation was evaluated.
Questioned about the status of trade with Afghanistan during his maiden weekly press briefing, Andrabi said: “Afghan transit trade is closed, is not taking place. It is not taking place because of the factors that you were aware of. There was considerable discussion on this question during last week’s briefing as well. Till the evaluation of the security situation, this transit trade will remain closed.”
 


He said there had been continuous attacks on trading points at the border from the Afghan side that killed Pakistanis, adding that the lives of citizens were “more important than any commodity trade”.
Andrabi added that Afghan soil should not be used for fomenting and sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan.
 






Questioned about reports of the Taliban supreme leader ordering the construction of a dam on the Kunar river, the spokesperson said: “We are ascertaining the details. But generally trans-boundary rivers are governed by international law. In such matter, Pakistan is both an upper and lower riparian. So, we will follow this matter.”
The Chitral river originates from Pakistan and is called Kunar when it enters Afghanistan. It joins the Kabul river near Jalalabad before re-entering Pakistan.
Border crossings between the two countries have remained closed since October 11, following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
All trade and transit have been blocked since the fighting erupted, Khan Jan Alokozay, the head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters on Thursday.
The border clashes were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan across their shared border, saying they operated from havens in Afghanistan. The Taliban has denied the charge.
A ceasefire was agreed in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend and is holding between the two sides, but the border trade remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.
“We have no information when the border with Afghanistan will be opened,” a senior official of the Chaman administration had said earlier.
 
 

The official added that even though the traders and the people involved in import and export are demanding the reopening of the border, no decision has been made so far.
A senior official said that there was no chance of opening the border before the meeting between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul on Oct 25, where both sides will decide future plans in view of the recent clashes.
“Trade and business activities between Pakistan and Afghanistan will be restored under what will be the outcome of the Istanbul review meeting,” Imran Khan Kakar, a leading businessman, had told Dawn.
The border authorities opened the Friendship Gate for a limited time for the repatriation of Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi.
The activities at the immigration section of the Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) were also suspe­nded, and those who were going to Afghanistan using visas and passports were also stuck in Chaman due to the border closure.
“Over 5,000 Pakistanis are stranded in Spin Boldak as they visit there and Vesh on a daily basis for their small businesses,” an FIA official said.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24220009a516c65.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950991/palestinian-factions-agree-to-hand-gaza-to-technocrat-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian factions agree to hand Gaza to technocrat committee</strong></a><br><p>The main Palestinian political factions, including Hamas, said on Friday they had agreed that an independent committee of technocrats would take over the running of post-conflict Gaza.
During a meeting in Cairo, according to a joint statement published on the Hamas website, the groups agreed to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent technocrats”.
It said the committee would “manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.
The statement also said the factions had agreed to work on unifying a common position “to confront the challenges facing the Palestinian cause”.
It called for a meeting of all forces and factions to “agree on a national strategy and to revitalise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people”.
Hamas is not part of the PLO, which is dominated by its longtime rival Fatah.
An informed source told AFP on Thursday that delegations from Hamas and Fatah met in Cairo to discuss the second phase of a US-backed ceasefire plan in Gaza.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that both sides agreed to “continue meetings in the coming period and to work on organising the Palestinian internal front in the face of the challenges posed by the Israeli government”.
Alongside the Hamas-Fatah talks, Egypt’s intelligence chief Hassan Rashad met senior officials from key Palestinian factions.
They included Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, as well as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine — both factions within the PLO.
Hamas and Fatah have a history of deep political rivalry, which flared into fighting for a time after a 2006 election, and which has hindered efforts at Palestinian national unity.
In December 2024, they agreed to create a committee to jointly administer post-conflict Gaza. The agreement was criticised, particularly by members of Fatah.
Hamas, which seized power in the territory in 2007, has already made it clear that it does not wish to govern the post-conflict territory, but has pushed back against the insistence that it disarm its fighters.
Rubio seeks quick deployment of international Gaza force
Separately, top US diplomat Marco Rubio voiced hope of soon putting together an international force to police the ceasefire in Gaza.
The secretary of state visited Israel on the heels of Vice President JD Vance as part of an all-out effort by the United States to persuade both Hamas and Israel to respect the truce.
Rubio said it was critical for the deal to create “the conditions for the stabilisation force to come in as soon as it possibly can be put together”.
He expressed optimism for a durable end to the two-year Gaza conflict as he met Israeli, US and other Western forces monitoring the ceasefire from inside a vast converted warehouse in southern Israel.
The deal, spearheaded by President Donald Trump, calls for an international force to oversee security after Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas.
In Gaza, families were still trying to find their way back to their ruined homes — in many cases only to find they lie in areas controlled by Israeli forces beyond the so-called “Yellow Line”.
“Some young men from our family risked their lives, they went to inspect the destruction in our area, and told us that my house was destroyed,” said 42-year-old Hani Abu Omar, a displaced Palestinian speaking to AFP at a tented encampment in Al-Zawayda.
“All my life I’ve been working, earning, and doing everything I can to build a house.”
 
 

Israel’s campaign in Gaza since October 2023 has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands homeless and hungry.
Fighting has died down since the October 10 ceasefire, but aid flows are still restricted and Gaza is divided between Hamas territory in the ruined cities and a wide band of land outside the Yellow Line still held by Israel.
The arrival of an international security force may unlock reconstruction funds — US officials vow none will go to Hamas-held areas — but the troop-contributing countries have yet to be confirmed.
Rubio confirmed that Israel would enjoy vetoes on the force’s composition, amid reports Israel has objected to Turkiye’s participation.
“There’s a lot of countries that have offered to do it. Obviously as you put together this force, it will have to be people that Israel is comfortable with,” he said.
Turkiye, a Nato member and one of the region’s strongest militaries, was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel.
But, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it has welcomed Hamas leaders and been a vociferous critic of Israel, which Erdogan accuses of committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority state, has said it is ready to send troops to Gaza.
The United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, has already been involved in ceasefire monitoring.
Rubio said the US may seek a UN mandate for the force, as some countries need the world body’s imprimatur to deploy troops.
But he again rejected any future role for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel has banned from its territory.
Some 200 US soldiers have deployed to the Civil-Military Coordination Centre, where uniformed troops from a dozen countries were seen mingling in the hastily-assembled rented space.
Overhead screens showed the staff’s latest findings, including what it said was a new abundance of fruit, vegetables, cheese and coffee getting into Gaza.
Another projection showed the day’s schedule and ended with words from Trump that read like a motivational saying: “A new and beautiful day is rising. And now, the rebuilding begins.”
The Trump administration has been increasingly firm with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in March brushed aside an earlier ceasefire and ordered a major new offensive.
Netanyahu has sought to downplay any perception of tension with the US, his most crucial military and diplomatic backer.
Israel is still waiting for Hamas to return the remains of 13 of 28 dead hostages it promised to hand over.
Hamas said today it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye that “the war has effectively ended”.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24214944f4423d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950987/pakistan-among-possible-destinations-to-resettle-exiled-palestinian-captives' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan among possible destinations to resettle exiled Palestinian captives</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is among four possible destinations that are being considered to receive exiled Palestinian captives, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club (PPC), a non-governmental organisation established in 1993 to support political prisoners in Israeli occupation jails.
They were freed in exchange for Israelis held in Gaza, but instead of going home, 154 former Palestinian prisoners were exiled to Egypt, where they are confined to a hotel and kept under tight surveillance. All of them had been sentenced by an Israeli military court to life in prison on charges of murder, belonging to Palestinian resistance groups banned by Israel and more.
But when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza earlier this month, the group was put on buses and sent to Egypt, where authorities have put them in a five-star hotel that they cannot leave without clearance. Egypt first received 150 exiled prisoners in January, and more than eight months later, most of them are still in the same hotel, their fate undecided.
PPC official Hasan Abd Rabbo told AFP that the men remain in Egypt with accommodation costs covered by Qatar, while talks are underway over resettlement. He said possible destinations include Pakistan, Qatar, Turkiye and Malaysia.
“We were separated from our families for 20 years,” Murad Abu al-Rub, a 45-year-old who spent two decades behind bars for alleged murder and for belonging to a Palestinian organisation banned by Israel, told AFP.
Now, he is living in uncertainty and under close surveillance, far from the Palestinian city of Jenin where he was born.
“Nothing has changed. I still can’t see my mother or my siblings,” Abu al-Rub told a team of AFP journalists who were able to access the hotel.
Since the US-brokered ceasefire took hold on October 10, Hamas has freed all 20 surviving Israelis in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinians, most of whom returned to Gaza and the West Bank.
During previous truces in the conflict, thousands of other Palestinian prisoners were freed in similar exchanges.
The vast majority of those with life sentences were exiled to Egypt, which has formal ties with Israel and played a key mediation role.
Rights groups have long criticised Israel’s use of military courts to try Palestinians suspected of security offences, saying they do not offer fair trial guarantees.
Uncertainty
In Egypt, the 154 men are not free to move, and they have no work permits and no idea what comes next. The government has not issued any formal statement about their status.
“No Arab country wanted to take us in,” said Abu al-Rub, who was imprisoned for the alleged killing of four Israeli soldiers in 2006 in an operation by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade.
In the hotel corridors, the men spend hours on the phone, speaking to relatives.
“When I was arrested, my little sister was 15,” Abu al-Rub said. “I didn’t recognise her when I saw her on a video call.”
Over 19 years, he was shuffled through eight different Israeli prisons, never staying more than a few months in each.
Conditions
Kamil Abu Hanish, who spent 22 years in Israeli prisons, was jailed allegedly for murder and for belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), according to Israel’s justice ministry records.
He described the relief of being freed from jail.
“It was like moving between two worlds … from a world of shackles and locked doors to a world of freedom and open space,” he said.
But he also described his final hours in custody as some of the harshest.
“Dozens of prisoners were tied together with ropes. They blindfolded us and forced us to kneel. Then they made us lie face down with our hands bound,” said Abu Hanish.
Before Hamas’s October 7 attack, prisoners could study, play sports and attend daily discussion groups, he said, with inmates recounting a tradition of protest and rebellion in order to obtain these rights.
“We played volleyball and table tennis and held three educational sessions a day,” Abu al-Rub said.
“We had no rights left — even the simplest,” he said, adding that pens, paper, films, TV and newspapers were banned after October 7.
“Everything we had, including clothing and blankets, was confiscated. We were left sleeping on iron beds” during winter.
 
 

Palestinian, Israeli and international rights groups have documented similar claims of mistreatment, but Israel denies any such violations and says its prison service operates in accordance with the law.
According to the Palestinian Authority, nearly 11,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli custody, on charges related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Mahmoud al-Ardah, 50, also jailed on murder and other security charges, said the last two years were the worst.
“Daily beatings and humiliation,” said the man, accused of belonging to the Islamic Jihad organisation.
“In the last two years, I suffered more than in the previous 30.”
In 2021, Ardah was one of six inmates who escaped Israel’s Gilboa prison by digging a tunnel with spoons and improvised tools. He was rearrested and put in solitary confinement.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24204750a027925.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950986/4-rare-brydes-whales-sighted-off-gwadar-coast-wwf-p' target='_blank'><strong>4 rare Bryde’s whales sighted off Gwadar coast: WWF-P</strong></a><br><p>In a rare sighting, four Bryde’s whales have been spotted off the coast of Gwadar, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P).
In a post on X, the organisation said the group was sighted a day ago by local fishermen near Gwadar (Demi Zur) by local fishermen, who immediately reported the incident to WWF-Pakistan as part of its citizen science initiative.
“The whales were spotted by a fishing boat captained by Amir Dad Karim, who noticed movement on the calm sea about 5 kilometres north of their operation area. On approaching, they found a pod of baleen whales, later identified as Bryde’s whales, likely moving toward coastal waters to feed.”
The organisation said the Bryde’s whale (Balaenoptera brydei) is one of the three baleen whale species known from Pakistani waters — the other two are the blue whale and the Arabian humpback whale — adding that it lives in warm and temperate oceans and mainly feeds on schooling fish such as sardines, anchovies and mackerels, which are abundant along the country’s coastline.
It said the species was listed as “data deficient” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List and remained poorly studied globally.
“Like all other cetaceans, they are protected under Pakistan’s wildlife, fisheries, and international trade laws.”
“Such rare sightings remind us of the rich marine life along Pakistan’s coast and the importance of protecting it for generations to come,” it said.
 






WWF-Pakistan has strengthened its efforts to conserve marine mammals by developing a national databank of cetaceans — whales, dolphins, and porpoises — through the innovative citizen science initiative that engages fishermen, scientists and the public in reporting marine life sightings along the country’s coastline.
“Citizen science allows us to collect vital information about marine species that would otherwise go unrecorded,” said Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser at WWF-Pakistan. “This recent sighting is a promising indicator of a healthy marine food web.”
Pakistan’s waters have seen several sightings of Bryde’s whales in recent years, though some have ended tragically.
 
 

The last recorded incident was in November 2023 when a dead Bryde’s whale was found near Jiwani, close to the Pakistan-Iran border. Another was stranded in the same region in May 2023.
Rab Nawaz, senior director for biodiversity at WWF-Pakistan, praised the active participation of coastal communities in supporting conservation efforts.
“Fishermen in Sindh and Balochistan have played an essential role by sharing information about marine mammals and adapting fishing methods to prevent whale and dolphin entanglement. Their collaboration demonstrates the power of local knowledge in protecting endangered species,” he said.
Established in 1970, WWF-Pakistan is the country’s largest environmental organisation, with over 300 staff working across 32 offices. The organisation’s ongoing marine conservation projects aim to protect biodiversity, promote sustainable fishing practices, and ensure the long-term health of Pakistan’s coastal and ocean ecosystems.</p><small>2025-10-24 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24151616cd35282.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950966/sp-2-other-policemen-martyred-as-back-to-back-blasts-rock-kps-hangu' target='_blank'><strong>SP, 2 other policemen martyred as back-to-back blasts rock KP’s Hangu</strong></a><br><p>Three cops, including a superintendent of police (SP), were martyred as back-to-back blasts rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu on Friday, according to police.
KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed shared these details with Dawn.com, saying that the first blast targeted a police checkpost in the jurisdiction of Bilyamina police station.
He said no policemen were usually deployed at the checkpost, adding that some policemen were on their way to the site when a second blast took place near their vehicle.
Three policemen were martyred in the second blast, which was caused by an improvised explosive device, the IG said.
Kohat division’s Regional Police Officer (RPO) Abbas Majeed shared further details of the incident while speaking to the media in Hangu.
He said police security was on high-alert today in Hangu, as well as in other districts of Kohat.
Police had been carrying out a search and strike operation in the area and had also cordoned off a location at a distance of around 100 metres from the targeted checkpost since 10am, the RPO said. He added that the checkpost, an old one, was used by law enforcement personnel to rest during breaks when they would cordon off a nearby location.
“There was no one at the checkpost at the time of the incident,” he said, adding that an IED blast took place at the checkpost at 2pm. “However, since no police personnel were present there, there were no casualties.”
The RPO said SP (Operations) Asad Zubair, along with a police party, had left for the checkpost following the first blast. “As their vehicle approached the location, an IED blast occurred near the checkpost. Fitna-al-Khawarij had planted a more powerful IED there in comparison to the one used in the first blast.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is term designated for the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) by the state.
RPO Majeed said the second blast was a “big” one, which resulted in the death of two policemen on the spot. Meanwhile, SP Zubair was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, he added.
The official said a large police party was carrying out a search operation at the site of the incident.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi sought an immediate report from the IG following the incident and called a session of the apex committee on the law and order situation in the province, a statement from the CM office said.
It added that the CM had “strongly condemned” the incident and termed it “unfortunate”.
The statement further quoted him as saying that the “elements involved [in the incident] would be taken to task at all costs. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise the CTD (counter-terrorism department) and police”.
He added the sacrifices of the martyred police personnel, which also included a superintendent of police, “will not go in vain” and that  “all resources will be used to establish peace”.
CM Afridi also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, the statement said.
Condemnations
President Asif Ali Zardari “strongly condemned” the “attack in Hangu carried out by India-backed Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists,” a statement on the PPP’s X account said.
Fitna al-Hindustan is a term used by the state to frame India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The statement on the PPP’s account quoted President Zardari as saying: “Terrorists are enemies of the country’s peace and stability. Their cowardly acts are unacceptable.”
He paid tributes to the policemen martyred in today’s blasts, saying that the nation was “proud of the sacrifices of its brave soldiers”.
The president lauded the resolve and courage of police in the fight against terrorism and prayed for the martyred policemen, as well as their families, the statement said.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the police had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism.
“We are determined to completely eradicate terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also “strongly condemned” the blasts, a statement posted on his ministry’s X account said, adding that he paid tributes to the martyred police, including SP Zubair.
He also extended condolences to the families of the martyred policemen.
“The sacrifice of martyred SP Asad Zubair and two other police personnel will not go in vain. The sacrifices of the officers and personnel of KP Police cannot be forgotten,” the statement quoted him as saying.
 






Former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur also expressed sorrow over the martyrdom of policemen in the incident.
“Saddened to hear about the martyrdom of SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two [other] policemen during an IED attack in Hangu. KP police, security forces and the brave people of KP have been paying the price for our peace with their blood,” he posted on X.
 






Uptick in terror incidents
Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan since TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the ceasefire agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Today’s blasts take place five days after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district on Oct 19. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them.
Previously on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.
Prior to that, on the night of Oct 17, police had intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.</p><small>2025-10-24 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/242034417eb6cd4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950985/mobile-wallet-and-digital-banking-customers-may-face-disruptions-as-new-sbp-regulations-take-effect' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile wallet and digital banking customers may face disruptions as new SBP regulations take effect</strong></a><br><p>Citizens who have not yet completed biometric verification for their digital bank accounts and wallets may face service disruptions from October 25 as new regulations introduced by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in July take effect.
The regulations, introduced through BPRD Circular No.1 of 2025, had mandated streamlining of account opening and customer onboarding processes by all institutions under the SBP’s regulatory ambit, including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs. As per the circular, issued on July 25, all SBP-regulated entities (REs) need to “streamline the account opening/customer onboarding process and improve the customer experience”.
One of the new requirements introduced was that biometric verification of the account or wallet operator should be made the primary verification method for all accounts and digital wallets. The prevailing system had allowed operators to take up to 60 days to complete biometric verification before a debit block was imposed on their account.
With the new regulations going into effect starting October 25, industry sources expressed fears that potentially tens of millions of account-holders who have not completed biometric verification could lose the ability to operate them. They also expressed concerns that the regulations may prevent individuals operating foreign currency accounts from sending or receiving remittances.
The central bank and financial institutions were given three months to comply with the requirements, which are part of customer due diligence and onboarding-related requirements under the SBP’s Anti Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism/Counter Proliferation Financing Regulations.
The scope and applicability of the SBP’s regulations pertaining to digital accounts and wallets had been expanded in the ‘Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework’ introduced in July, and the change now “covers both in-branch and remote onboarding, and is applicable for opening accounts/wallets for Individuals and Entities (legal persons/arrangements), including Local Currency and Foreign Currency accounts, and explicitly mentioning Roshan Digital Accounts” and applies to all “SBP Regulated Entities (REs), including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs”.
The new framework also requires a “consolidated approach”, regardless of whether the onboarding process was performed in-branch or remotely. In the earlier framework, released in 2022, use of NADRA Verisys was allowed for verification at the time of account opening, while biometric verification was to be completed within 60 days.
However, under the 2025 framework, biometric verification will be the primary method for “customers with CNIC/NICOP/POC/ARC/POR cards prior to establishment of the relationship/opening of the account/wallet”.</p><small>2025-10-24 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/241851208e3502c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950981/india-cautious-on-trade-deals-says-us-pact-very-near' target='_blank'><strong>India cautious on trade deals, says US pact ‘very near’</strong></a><br><p>India will not accept limits on its trading choices or rush to sign agreements, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday, even as a senior government official said a bilateral trade deal with Washington was “very near”.
“India will not sign any trade deal in a hurry,” Goyal said during a speech at the Berlin Global Dialogue, referring to European Union and the US concerns over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil.
Alongside ongoing EU free trade pact negotiations, India is in trade talks with the United States, which has imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports.
US President Donald Trump said this week he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mainly about trade, and that Modi had assured him India would limit its oil purchases from Russia.
Goyal said New Delhi would take a measured approach.
An official aware of the ongoing trade talks with the US told reporters in New Delhi that the two countries are sorting out the language of their agreement.
“We are very near as far as deal is concerned,” the official said, adding that both countries are “converging on most of the issues”.
New Delhi has been resisting US demands to allow market access for American grains and dairy, citing the need to protect the livelihoods of small farmers. But India could consider allowing some corn and soymeal imports, trade and industry sources said.
After the United States sanctioned Russia’s top oil producers on Wednesday, Indian refiners — major buyers of cheap Russian oil — said they are set to sharply cut imports, potentially clearing a key hurdle to a US-India trade deal.
Goods exports to the US fell to $5.43 billion from $6.87bn in August, as tariffs hit shipments of goods such as textiles, shrimp, and gems and jewellery, data released by the Commerce ministry showed.
The EU, United Kingdom and the United States are pressuring New Delhi to scale back imports of discounted Russian crude, which the Western nations argue help fund Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.
India has long defended its energy purchases as essential for ensuring affordable supplies and energy security, but Indian refiners are now poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil to comply with new US sanctions on two major Russian producers.</p><small>2025-10-24 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24183722007cea1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950980/at-least-8-terrorists-killed-during-ibo-in-kps-tank-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>At least 8 terrorists killed during IBO in KP’s Tank: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>At least eight “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were killed during an Intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district as part of operation “Azm e Istehkam”, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
In today’s operation in Tank, “troops effectively engaged terrorist locations, and after an intense fire exchange, eight Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
“On 24 October 2025, on [the] reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Tank District,” the statement read.
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, the ISPR said.
It added that the slain terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians.”
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area as relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan [who] will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
In June last year, the federal government approved a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism campaign, Operation Azm-i-Istehkam.
On Oct 16, Security for­ces killed 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP over the course of three days, the military’s media wing said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-10-24 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/241843119b8bfb1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950971/fact-check-viral-video-of-indian-deputy-coas-criticising-politicisation-of-military-is-doctored' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video of Indian deputy COAS criticising politicisation of military is doctored</strong></a><br><p>Posts from pro-Pakistani accounts on social media platform X on Thursday circulated a video claiming to show Indian Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Strategy) Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai publicly denouncing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and warning against the politicisation of the Indian Armed Forces. However, the video is doctored.
A day ago, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts and is known for repeatedly sharing AI-altered videos, posted a clip with the following caption: “Breaking News: Indian Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai comes out openly against BJP politics of Narendra Modi. Any politicisation or saffronisation of the armed forces will lead to a defeat in the morale of Indian Armed Forces. We will resist against all attempts to make Indian army subservient to Hindutva.”
The post gained over 45,000 views.
The transcript of the video is provided below:
“As a senior officer who has devoted decades to the service of this uniform, I say this with deep concern. The growing influence of saffron politics is corroding the core values of the Indian Army. Our strength has always been rooted in discipline, unity, and constitutional duty, not in religious polarisation.
When ideology starts dictating loyalty, it fractures morale, fuels internal distrust and weakens combat effectiveness. If this trend continues, we will not be defeated by an external enemy, but by the political poison spreading within our own ranks.“
A post by another anti-Indian account gained over 35,000 views.
The same post was also reshared by other pro-military and Pakistani users on X, as can be seen here, here, here, here and here
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the purported political statement attributed to a senior Indian military officer.
Observing the video showed visible and auditory inconsistencies, including unnatural facial movements, distortion around the head, mismatched lip-syncing and abrupt changes in background tone during the segment in which the Indian army official is allegedly criticising the BJP.
Analysing the audio of the video using the forensic tool DeepFake-Total, which detects potential manipulation throughout the audio spectrum, showed a Fake-O-Meter score of 89.1 per cent.
The score indicates a very high probability of AI-generated or synthetically altered content.
 


A keyword and reverse-image search was subsequently conducted to trace the original footage, yielding a YouTube video uploaded on October 18, 2025, by Indian news channel Republic World with the following title: “Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai calls out Pakistan’s bluff, reveals details of Op Sindoor | Forces First Conclave.”
In the video, the Indian army official delivered an address about defence preparedness, counter-terror operations and technological modernisation. At no point did he discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the army.
 


A news report by the outlet on the same date also reported the same and did not mention any criticism of the Indian army’s alleged politicisation.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows Indian Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Strategy) Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai publicly denouncing the BJP and warning against the politicisation of the military is false. The clip is doctored and has been dubbed over through AI-generated audio.

On October 20, internet users in Pakistan complained of service degradation and slow browsing speeds on certain ISPs, which was once again attributed to a fault in the submarine cable. There was no statement or acknowledgment from the ISPs in question, the IT ministry, or the regulator, Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA).
When approached for comment, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja attributed it to the global shutdown of Amazon cloud services. However, many internet users claimed they had been informed by their ISP that services were suffering due to cable damage.
In a statement issued today, the company said, “We expect to fully recover the lost capacity within 72 hours (by 11:59pm on Monday, 27 October 2025),” adding that it had “immediately restored over 60 per cent of the affected capacity by procuring and activating additional bandwidth on alternate cables.”
“We are continuing to add more capacity and reroute traffic to improve peak-time performance, with newly procured bandwidth coming online via UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong,” the statement said.
It continued: “Incremental capacity will be added in staged activations prior to that, so many customers will experience noticeable improvement before then.”
The statement by the internet service provider added that its teams were working round the clock with “international partners to restore full performance and resilience”.
Detailing the outage, Stormfibre said, “Over the past few months, several regional submarine cables that carry much of the country’s traffic, including IMEWE and SEA-ME-WE4 have experienced outages.
The PEACE cable system originates in China and connects to Pakistan.
According to the PTA, the cables landing in the country are operated by PTCL, Cybernet and TransWorld Associates.
Three undersea cable networks operated by the PTCL are AAE-1 (Africa, Asia and Europe), SMW4 (South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) and the IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe).
“To mitigate the impact on our users, the Cybernet Network Operations team proactively procured additional submarine capacity on alternate paths, including the PEACE cable,” the statement said.
However, as per the company, on Oct 20, at approximately 5:30pm “the PEACE cable also suffered a cut in the Red Sea near Sudan.”
“This caused evening peak-time congestion and intermittent slowdowns for our users,” it said.
Internet users in Pakistan often face disruptions due to persistent submarine cable faults.</p><small>2025-10-24 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2416514580effdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950974/two-new-teams-as-many-venues-on-the-cards-for-next-psl-season-says-ceo-salman-naseer' target='_blank'><strong>Two new teams, as many venues on the cards for next PSL season, says CEO Salman Naseer</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Super League (PSL) is set for its biggest expansion yet, with two new teams and two additional venues expected to feature in the next edition of the tournament, PSL Chief Executive Officer Salman Naseer revealed on Friday.
Speaking during a podcast released by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Salman said the board was “very seriously considering moving on to six venues this time,” adding that “HBL PSL 11, God willing, will be played across six venues.”
He said the long-forgotten Imran Khan Stadium, formerly Arbab Niaz Stadium, in Peshawar was “almost ready,” but required some final upgrades before it could host matches of international standard. “We are certainly trying to prepare it for PSL 11,” he said.
 
 

“But what we need also is for the lease agreement to take place. For us to invest significantly as the PCB in this venue, we need to have a long-term lease in place.”
Salman confirmed that Faisalabad was also being lined up as the other new host city.
“The other venue, as people may have already guessed, since there are international matches scheduled there, is going to be Faisalabad,” he added.
On the league’s expansion plans, the PSL chief said the PCB was targeting two new franchises for the next season, with the tender process for team sales to begin in November. “There is a lot of interest and we are very keen to explore that interest,” he said.
“And how things look right now, it seems there’s going to be a lot of competition here too.”
The PSL, which began in 2016 with five teams, expanded to six franchises with the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018. The inclusion of two more sides would mark its first major restructuring in seven years and push the total number of teams to eight.
Salman’s revelations come a day after it emerged that the PCB had sent a legal notice to PSL franchise owner Ali Khan Tareen threatening termination of the franchise agreement with the board.
According to sources, the PCB is unimpressed by Ali’s criticism of the PSL management for what he believed was incompetence to improve the league as a brand.
While Multan Sultans said on Thursday the “PCB management to treat constructive criticism as a crime is outrageous”, Ali released an acerbic video late at night defending himself and apparently tearing apart the notice to conclude it.</p><small>2025-10-24 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/241335039da491f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950957/ihc-gives-police-one-more-week-to-locate-missing-nccia-official' target='_blank'><strong>IHC gives police one more week to locate missing NCCIA official</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday gave police another seven days to locate a National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) deputy director, who was allegedly abducted earlier this month.
The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband Muhammad Usman. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14. At the previous hearing, the court had given the police three days to locate the missing official.
Resuming the hearing of the case today, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan asked the police about the progress made in the case.
“What is the progress? You were given three days,” said the justice.
District Superintendent of Police (DSP) Legal Sajid Cheema informed the court that investigations were “underway” to trace the NCCIA official, adding that the senior superintendent of police investigation was looking into the matter.
“The missing deputy director was investigating the Ducky Bhai case,” the DSP said, referring to a case involving popular YouTuber Saadur Rehman.
The police official added that the “rest of the people investigating this case are also missing” and added that the police station investigating the case was in Lahore.
The senior police official also informed the court that the petitioner, Rozina, was previously in Lahore and then in Islamabad, according to data available till October 18. He said that her last address was Empress Road in Lahore, after which her phone had been switched off.
“When the investigating officer went to her house, he reported that the house was locked,” he said. Cheema added that the NCCIA official’s last location was pinpointed to Islamabad’s F-6 sector.
“If the WhatsApp data is found, everything will be known,” he claimed.
Meanwhile, the petitioner’s lawyer, Rizwan Abbasi, reiterated that his client was also “missing” after moving the plea in the IHC. He said that the last call the petitioner received was a threat to withdraw her plea.
At one point, the judge said that she might have been staying with her parents or her relatives.
“If she did go, did she go there willingly?” asked her lawyer. “A person was kidnapped from the federal capital; ten days have passed,” Abbasi added.
The court also ordered police to check Usman’s WhatsApp records to assist the investigation.
The DSP sought a week’s duration from the IHC to investigate the WhatsApp data. The court, accepting the request, granted another week for the recovery of the abductee and adjourned the hearing until next Friday.</p><small>2025-10-24 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24141823ddc8024.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950962/interior-ministry-notifies-ban-on-tlp-following-federal-cabinets-approval' target='_blank'><strong>Interior ministry notifies ban on TLP following federal cabinet’s approval</strong></a><br><p>The interior ministry on Friday notified the ban on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said: “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that TLP is connected with and concerned in terrorism.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11B(1)(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the federal government hereby orders TLP to be a proscribed organisation for the purpose of the Act and list the aforesaid organisation in the first schedule to the said Act,” the notification said.
The development comes a day after the federal cabinet approved a proposal to proscribe party under the Anti-Terrorism Act, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
 
 

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet.
The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country.
The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests.
The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees.
“In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP,” the PM Office statement said.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that participants were asked to share their views on TLP’s “firebrand” approach, and “almost everyone was of the view that the organisation must be barred from paralysing the country time and again”.
Later, speaking on Geo News, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the intent behind a ban was not to eliminate a party but to purge it of “anti-state and terrorist elements”.
He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”.
In separate remarks to Geo News, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the TLP had acted like an extremist group and violated its prior commitments.
Chaudhry said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. He said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectarianism and other such matters.
Legal framework
Under the country’s legal framework, the Nat­ional Counter-Terrorism Aut­hority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups. Those designated as terrorists or associated with terrorism face severe consequences, such as travel bans and financial sanctions.
Individuals may also be placed on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA for monitoring.
Historically, proscribed entities have included the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hizbut Tahrir, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Jaish-i-Mohammad and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).
The provincial government can request a ban on a party, as in the case of the TLP.
In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says.
The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.</p><small>2025-10-24 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2413443771b71ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950952/punjab-governor-says-kp-cm-afridi-should-definitely-be-allowed-to-meet-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab governor says KP CM Afridi should ‘definitely’ be allowed to meet Imran</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider said on Friday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi should “definitely” be allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
He expressed these views while answering a question during a press conference in Peshawar. His remarks come a day after Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran. It was the the second time that he had failed in his attempt to meet the former prime minister since assuming office on Oct 16, despite getting permission from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
When Haider, who was addressing the press conference alongside KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, was asked for his opinion on the matter, he said: “There is democracy [in the country], and in my view, political people should be dealt with in a political manner. The court has given [Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place.”
The Punjab governor further stated that “several visitors had been meeting several prisoners according to the schedule” at the jail on a daily basis. “So, if Sohail Afridi goes and meets the PTI founder, the sky will not fall down and the world will not end”.

“In my opinion, he (Afridi) should definitely be allowed [to meet Imran]. Otherwise, you are making someone a hero over nothing. Personally, I do not agree with the idea of preventing anyone from meeting someone.
“We are political people, and we have risen from a grassroots level. The PPP has always stood with democracy and never wants any undemocratic action anywhere,” he said.
The governor said he was fully confident that if the meeting took place, it would not cause any harm to the country.
Later, KP Governor Kundi was asked about how did he see his “working relationship” with Afridi shaping up.
At that, Kundi said the newly elected chief minister was currently engaged in activities pertaining to formation and “settlement” of his cabinet. “He is in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder. His cabinet is yet to be formed, and then he will move forward on this.”
He added that while every political party had its own agenda, but when it came to the governance of the province, his advice was to constitute a “parliamentary jirga” in the province and hold talks with the federation.
“We have to argue with logic to claim our rights […] We have [relevant] forums for that,” Kundi said, giving the examples of the Council of Common Interests and, particularly the National Finance Commission.
He assured that “doors are open from my end. The provincial government should prepare its case and approach the Centre to resolve the matters politically […] The Governor House will never be a hurdle [in the relationship] between the Centre an the province [for] peace, progress and prosperity in the province. In fact, it will play the role of a bridge.”
Meeting denied twice
KP CM Afridi has been intending to meet Imran in Adiala jail — where the PTI founder has been imprisoned since September 2023 — following his election on Oct 13.
Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
The new KP CM, who replaced his predecessor Ali Amin Gandapur following Imran’s directive, says he wants to consult the PTI founder on the constitution of his cabinet.
He had taken oath as the provincial chief executive on Oct 15 and gone to Adiala jail to meet Imran the very next day after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court. However, he was turned away after a wait of two hours.
On Oct 17, he moved the IHC, seeking a meeting with Imran, and wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi with the same request.
The plea was taken up yesterday along with several other similar ones by an IHC bench, which directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran.
Subsequently, Afridi had gone to Adiala Jail once again after the hearing but was again not allowed to meet Imran.
According to a Dawn report, police had stopped CM Afridi on his way to Adiala near the prison, prompting the PTI leaders to stage a brief sit-in before returning empty-handed.
Speaking to the media there, Afridi reiterated he wanted to meet Imran to finalise the provincial cabinet, adding that it was the responsibility of the IHC to ensure the implementation of its decision for the meeting.
The CM claimed his visit was “purely constitutional” and aimed at seeking guidance from his party leader on key policy matters related to governance in KP.</p><small>2025-10-24 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2413065859c2804.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950960/cooperation-in-trade-economic-spheres-win-win-proposition-pm-tells-regional-ministers-conference' target='_blank'><strong>Cooperation in trade, economic spheres win-win proposition, PM tells regional ministers’ conference</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that cooperation in trade and economic spheres was a “win-win proposition” which offered “rich dividends” to all parties involved.
He made the remarks while addressing the Regional Transport Ministers’ Conference in Islamabad. Transport ministers and senior officials from Türkiye, Sri Lanka, Iran, Maldives, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Kazakhstan are attending the two-day conference which kicked off on Thursday.
Addressing the conference today, PM Shehbaz said: “It cannot be stressed enough that cooperation in trade and economic spheres is a win-win proposition, offering rich dividends to all.
“This would strengthen our common stake in peace and reinforce efforts for development in the region,” he said.
In his remarks, the premier also talked about Pakistan’s key geographic location, saying: “Our geography links the warm waters of the Arabian Sea and the Persian gulf to the majestic Karakoram and Himalayan range, flowing through the timeless Indus Valley.
“Pakistan’s long coastline also makes our ports of Gwadar and in future many other potential ports on this coastline, including Karachi, as key transit points on the maritime Silk Road,” he added.
He recalled the “vision and foresight” of former premier and his brother Nawaz Sharif, pointing out that one of his earliest initiatives after assuming power was the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
“CPEC has been a transformative experience for this region, connecting markets [and] bringing people together across China, Central Asia, South Asia and Middle East,” he said.
He added that by linking the Gwadar port with China’s Xinjiang province, the road had “opened new routes for trade and energy cooperation, serving as a vital gateway of connectivity, opportunity and cultural exchanges”.
He highlighted that following the success of its first phase, Pakistan would now be entering into the second and “very exciting phase of CPEC 2.0”, which was centered and based on fostering business-to-business partnerships and strengthening investment opportunities for Chinese companies in Pakistan as well as from “friendly and brotherly countries” attending the conference.
He emphasised that in the digital age, connectivity was not just related to roads, railways and airlinks, but also encompassed data, innovation, research and development, and technological integration.
“Pakistan is investing in digital infrastructure to ensure that we are adequately equipped to catch up with the fourth industrial revolution around the globe,” he highlighted, adding that 60 per cent of the country’s population was between 15 to 30 years of age.
“It is a huge challenge but also brings huge opportunities,” PM Shehbaz said.
“If we’re able to provide ample opportunities to our youthful boys and girls in the fields of information technology, artificial intelligence [and] vocational training, that will be our greatest asset,” he emphasised.
“We don’t have black gold, but we have our youth as our greatest asset which will become the harbinger of Pakistan’s speedy progress and prosperity in times to come,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-24 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24130514c01931d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950956/authorities-say-over-1000-including-pakistanis-entered-thailand-from-myanmar-this-week-after-scam-hub-raid' target='_blank'><strong>Authorities say over 1,000, including Pakistanis, entered Thailand from Myanmar this week after scam hub raid</strong></a><br><p>More than 1,000 people, mostly Chinese, have fled from Myanmar into Thailand this week, Thai authorities said on Friday, after the Myanmar military raided one of the country’s largest scam centres.
Sprawling cyberscam hubs, where fraudsters swindle victims through online cons, have flourished along Myanmar’s loosely governed border during its years-long civil war.
While some scammers are trafficked into the often-fortified compounds, experts say others work voluntarily, hoping to earn more in the multibillion-dollar illicit industry than they can at home.
Thailand’s Tak provincial office said 1,049 people had crossed from Myanmar into Mae Sot district from Wednesday to Friday morning — up from the 677 who had fled the KK Park scam compound as of Thursday morning.
Nationals from India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and more than a dozen other countries were among them, the office said in a statement.
 






Thailand’s Immigration Bureau said most of the arrivals were Chinese men.
Myanmar’s junta said on Monday it raided KK Park, located just across the border from Thailand, and seized Starlink satellite internet devices.
An AFP investigation revealed last week that the use of the devices had grown rapidly at the compounds in recent months.
Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which operates Starlink, said on Wednesday that it had disabled more than 2,500 Starlink internet devices at Myanmar’s scam centres.
Sawanit Suriyakul Na Ayutthaya, deputy governor of Tak province, told AFP on Friday that authorities believed most of those who had entered Thailand were from KK Park, but they were still investigating.
He said on Thursday that the arrivals would be screened to determine whether they were victims of human trafficking.
Otherwise, they could be prosecuted for illegal border crossing, he said.
Footage from public broadcaster Thai PBS on Thursday showed people using foam boxes to float across the river to Thailand.

The development came in a case pertaining to a protest staged by the PTI in November last year, in which the court has issued arrest warrants for her multiple times.
The last non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema in the case was issued on October 22 over her persistent absences from the hearings. It was executed yesterday as Punjab Sub-Divisional Police Officer Azhar Shah presented the warrant before an Islamabad High Court bench and obtained Aleema’s signature on the spot.
During today’s hearing, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah observed that Aleema “is present everywhere but doesn’t appear before the court”.
Her attendance at the court would be ensured, he remarked.
The judge directed the National Database and Registration Authority director general (DG), as well as the Passports DG, to block her CNIC and passport.
The court also ordered the forfeiture of the properties of her guarantor to the state and directed the State Bank of Pakistan to freeze all of Aleema’s bank accounts.
Following these directives, the court adjourned the hearing till Oct 27.
Case background
The case at hand famously came to be knows as the November 26 protest case. The said protest had seen more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”.
Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations.
Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.
The Rawalpindi ATC has issued arrest warrants for her in the case at least four times.
The last and third non-bailable arrest warrants for her were issued during the Oct 22 hearing, when the court had also issued show-cause notices to two police of­ficers for submitting a bogus report regarding the non-arrest Aleema Khan.
The court had observed that the officers had presented a “fabricated and misleading report” claiming that Aleema Khan had gone into hiding, despite videos circulating on social media showing her addressing the media outside Adiala Jail the previous evening.
Prior to that, the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her continued absence from the proceedings during an Oct 20 hearing as well.
Previously, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during a hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. During that hearing, the court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest.
The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.</p><small>2025-10-24 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24115940f575740.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950950/on-un-day-dar-says-pakistan-dedicated-to-playing-role-in-building-just-and-prosperous-world' target='_blank'><strong>On UN Day, Dar says Pakistan dedicated to playing role in building just and prosperous world</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan’s dedication to playing its part in building a “just and prosperous” world while marking United Nations (UN) Day.
UN Day marks the anniversary of the entry into force in 1945 of the UN Charter. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the UN and its charter.
In a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to multilateralism along with the international community.
“We believe the UN, as the world’s most representative multilateral institution, remains uniquely placed to address shared global challenges, including grave threats to international peace and security, [the] worst humanitarian crises, persistent development gaps, and the existential climate crisis,” he said.
Dar added that Pakistan’s foreign policy was firmly rooted in the UN Charter’s principles: the sovereign equality of states, non-interference, the right to self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of disputes, according to the Quaid-i-Azam’s vision.
“Our history reflects a consistent preference for diplomacy over confrontation, engagement over isolation, and partnership over polarisation,” he said.
According to the foreign minister, the country’s commitment to multilateralism is demonstrated through decades of active engagement with the UN system.
He pointed out that Pakistan has ranked among the top Troop-Contributing Countries to UN peace operations since 1960, and hosts the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), one of the oldest peacekeeping missions.
 






Dar said that the charter affirmed “our collective resolve to uphold international law and self-determination”. However, he added that these values were not being universally upheld, referring to occupied Kashmir and Gaza.
“Regrettably, these ideals continue to be violated with impunity, most egregiously in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine,” he said.
“The legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri people for self-determination, upheld by relevant UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions, continue to be denied by brutal repression by India.
“Similarly, Gaza has become a graveyard for our shared humanity and global conscience,” he added.
He said that Pakistan remained dedicated to playing its role in building a “more peaceful, just, and prosperous world” as a non-permanent member of the UNSC for 2025-26.
He highlighted the country’s reputation as a consensus builder, pointing out its presidency of the UNSC in July of this year. He added that its “active role” in promoting UN charter principles “enables us to work towards outcomes that reflect the aspirations and priorities of the wider UN membership”.
He reiterated that Pakistan “stands ready to work with fellow UN member states and with the United Nations system to reinvigorate the UN charter’s promise to pursue peace, development and human dignity for all”.</p><small>2025-10-24 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24110831b7beacb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950946/trump-says-all-trade-talks-with-canada-terminated-following-anti-tariff-advertisement' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says all trade talks with Canada terminated following anti-tariff advertisement</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday all trade talks with Canada were terminated following what he called a fraudulent advertisement in which former and late president Ronald Reagan spoke negatively about tariffs.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum and autos earlier this year, prompting Ottawa to respond in kind. The two sides have been in talks for weeks on a potential deal for the steel and aluminum sectors.
“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
 


Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier this week the ad from his province with anti-tariff messaging had caught Trump’s attention. The ad showed Reagan, a Republican, criticising tariffs on foreign goods while saying they caused job losses and trade wars.
“I heard that the president heard our ad. I’m sure he wasn’t too happy,” Ford said on Tuesday.
 






The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation issued a statement late on Thursday saying the ad by the government of Ontario was “using selective audio and video” of Reagan and that the foundation was reviewing its legal options.
“The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address (by Reagan in 1987), and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks,” the foundation said in its statement.
The Canadian government had no immediate comment.
Trump has used tariffs as leverage on many countries around the world.
Trump’s trade war has increased US tariffs to their highest levels since the 1930s and he has regularly threatened more duties, sparking concerns among businesses and economists.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters on Thursday that Canada will not allow unfair US access to its markets if talks on various trade deals with Washington fail.
Next year, the US, Canada and Mexico are due to review their 2020 continental free-trade agreement.</p><small>2025-10-24 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2411163665f0c26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950947/india-trials-delhi-cloud-seeding-to-combat-deadly-smog' target='_blank'><strong>India trials Delhi cloud seeding to combat deadly smog</strong></a><br><p>India trialled cloud seeding over its smog-filled capital for the first time, spraying a chemical from an aeroplane to encourage rain and wash deadly particles out of the air.
Cloud seeding is the practice of using aeroplanes to fire salt or other chemicals into clouds to induce rain.
New Delhi city authorities, working with the government’s Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, launched a test run on Thursday afternoon using a Cessna light aeroplane over the city’s northern Burari area.
“A trial seeding flight was done … in which cloud seeding flares were fired”, Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in a statement late on Thursday.
 






“This flight was the proving flight for checking the capabilities for cloud seeding, the readiness and endurance of the aircraft, the capability assessment of the cloud seeding fitments and flares, and coordination among all involved agencies.”
It comes ahead of a planned rollout of the scheme.
Delhi’s Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that “if conditions remain favourable, Delhi will experience its first artificial rain on October 29.”
 






It was not immediately clear what chemical was used in the test to encourage the rain.
New Delhi and its sprawling metropolitan region of 30 million people are regularly ranked among the world’s most polluted capitals, with acrid smog blanketing the skyline each winter.
Cooler air traps pollutants close to the ground, creating a deadly mix of emissions from crop burning, factories and heavy traffic.
Levels of PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — at times rise to as much as 60 times the UN daily health limits.
Pollution rose this week after days of fireworks launched to mark Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, shooting PM2.5 levels to more than 56 times the limit.
That came after the Supreme Court this month eased a blanket ban on fireworks to allow the use of the less-polluting “green” crackers — developed to reduce particulate emissions.
At dawn on Thursday, PM 2.5 levels were 154 microgrammes per cubic metre in parts of New Delhi, according to monitoring organisation IQAir, just more than 10 times World Health Organisation limits.
A study found in September that the noxious air is even turning Delhi’s iconic 17th-century Red Fort black.
Scientists warned that the Unesco World Heritage Site is being steadily disfigured by a black crust, according to a study published in the Heritage journal by a joint team of Indian and Italian researchers.
Invented in the 1940s, countries have been seeding clouds for decades to alleviate drought, fight forest fires, and even to disperse fog at airports.
China used it in 2008 to try to stop rain from falling on Beijing’s Olympic stadium.
But research on the effects of cloud seeding on neighbouring regions is mixed — and some evidence suggests it does not work very well even in the target area.</p><small>2025-10-24 06:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/241107234679aa3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950945/pm-shehbaz-invites-qatari-investors-to-explore-opportunities-for-collaboration-under-sifc-framework' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz invites Qatari investors to explore opportunities for collaboration under SIFC framework</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited Qatari investors to “explore new avenues of collaboration” under the government’s Special Investment Facilitation Council framework, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported on Friday.
The SIFC is body that was set up in 2023 with the objective to assist with foreign investments.
PM Shehbaz invited Qatari investments under its framework during a meeting with Qatar’s Minister of Commerce and Industry Sheikh Faisal bin Thani bin Faisal Al Thani in Islamabad today.
According to Radio Pakistan, PM Shehbaz underscored during the meeting the importance of enhancing bilateral trade and investment cooperation highlighted opportunities in this connection in energy, agriculture, food security, information technology, tourism and infrastructure development sectors.
“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of Pakistan-Qatar relations, anchored in shared faith, values, and mutual respect,” the report said.
It added that the premier also appreciated Qatar’s role as an “important partner and an influential regional mediator”.
Recently, Qatar, along with Turkiye, mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which led to a ceasefire between the two sides after days of hostilities on the border.
During today’s meeting, PM Shehbaz conveyed to the visiting minister Islamabad’s “deep appreciation for Qatar’s consistent support on regional and global issues” and reiterated Pakistan’s desire to strengthen collaboration at regional and multilateral forums.
For his part, Faisal Al Thani “reaffirmed Qatar’s commitment to further deepen economic engagement with Pakistan”, the Radio Pakistan report said.
He also conveyed “warm greetings from the Qatari leadership” to PM Shehbaz and both sides agreed to continue close coordination to “translate shared understandings into tangible outcomes, including greater facilitation for business-to-business linkages and investment projects”.
Faisal Al Thani had arrived in Pakistan to co-chair the sixth session of the Pakistan-Qatar Joint Ministe­rial Commission (JMC) on Econo­mic, Trade and Technical Coopera­tion.
The three-day session concluded yesterday, during which Pakistan and Qatar signed a protocol to formalise commitments across multiple sectors, including a pledge of $3 billion in investment in Pakistan through the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) or other designated investment vehicles.
According to an official statement, the protocol commits both sides to implementing the emir of Qatar’s earlier pledge to invest $3bn in Pakistan. A key focus under this arrangement is strengthening direct engagement between the QIA and Pakistan’s SIFC to streamline investment processes and create an enabling environment for Qatari investors.
The SIFC will serve as the leading platform for facilitating investment in priority sectors.
During his meeting with PM Shehbaz, Faisal Al Thani noted that the sixth session of the JMC “provided an important platform to review existing cooperation and identify new initiatives to advance mutually beneficial partnerships”.</p><small>2025-10-24 06:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2408083068e677d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950911/tlp-banned-as-govt-takes-hard-line-after-unrest' target='_blank'><strong>TLP banned as govt takes hard line after unrest</strong></a><br><p>• Cabinet told 2021 proscription was lifted after party pledged to renounce violence
• Talal says TLP acted like an extremist group, reneged on commitments
• Rana Sanaullah says ban aims to ‘purge anti-state, terrorist elements’, not erase party
• PM unveils three-year ‘Roshan Economy’ power tariff of Rs22.98 per unit
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to proscribe the religion-political group Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet.
The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country.
The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests.
The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees.
“In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP,” the PM Office statement said.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that participants were asked to share their views on TLP’s “firebrand” approach, and “almost everyone was of the view that the organisation must be barred from paralysing the country time and again”.
The cabinet meeting was held on a single-point agenda, and no other items were discussed, the source added.
Later, speaking on Geo News, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the intent behind a ban was not to eliminate a party but to purge it of “anti-state and terrorist elements”.
He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”.
In separate remarks to Geo News, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the TLP had acted like an extremist group and violated its prior commitments.
Mr Chaudhry said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. He said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectarianism and other such matters.
Legal framework
Under the country’s legal framework, the Nat­ional Counter-Terrorism Aut­hority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups. Those designated as terrorists or associated with terrorism face severe consequences, such as travel bans and financial sanctions.
 
 

Individuals may also be placed on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA for monitoring.
Historically, proscribed entities have included the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hizbut Tahrir, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Jaish-i-Mohammad and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).
The provincial government can request a ban on a party, as in the case of the TLP.
In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says.
The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party.
Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.
Electricity package
Separately, PM Shehbaz announced a three-year “Roshan Economy Elec­tricity Package” offering additional electricity to the industrial and agriculture sectors at a subsidi­sed rate of Rs22.98 per unit from Nov 2025 to Oct 2028. The current tariffs of around Rs34 for industry and Rs38 for agriculture will be reduced to Rs22.98 for both. During a meeting with a delegation of experts from the industry and agriculture sectors, as well as representatives of the business community, he said the fiscal impact would not be passed on to domestic consumers or other sectors.
Appreciating the efforts of Power Minister Awais Leghari and his team, he said lowering energy costs was essential to competitiveness, exports and job creation.

• Official sees no chance of opening border before Istanbul summit on 26th
QUETTA / ISLAM­ABAD: Border closures between Pakistan and Afghanistan for over 12 days on Thursday have pushed up prices of essential goods in both nations, with tomatoes now costing five times more in Pakistan since fighting broke out between the two neighbours this month and transit trade coming to a halt.
Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since Oct 11, following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600km frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
“We have no information when the border with Afghanistan will be opened,” a senior official of the Chaman administration said.
The official added that even though the traders and the people involved in import and export are demanding the reopening of the border, but no decision has been made so far.
All trade and transit have been blocked since the fighting erupted, Khan Jan Alokozay, the head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters on Thursday.
“With each passing day, both sides are losing aro­und $1 million,” he said.
Fresh fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat and dairy products make up most of the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries.
The prices of tomatoes, used extensively in Pak­i­s­tani cooking, have jumped by over 400 per cent to around Rs600 per kg. Apples, which mostly come from Afghanistan, are also seeing a price surge.
Around 5,000 containers of goods are stranded on both sides of the border, said a Pakistani official at the main Torkham border crossing.
He said there was already a shortage of tomatoes, apples and grapes in the market.
‘No chance’
A senior official said that there is no chance of opening the border before the meeting between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul on Oct 26 where both sides will decide future plans in view of the recent clashes.
“The trade and business activities between Pakistan and Afghanistan will be restored under what will be the outcome of the Istanbul review meeting,” Imran Khan Kakar, a leading businessman, told Dawn.
The border authorities opened the Friendship Gate for a limited time for the repatriation of Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi.
The activities at the immigration section of Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) was also suspe­nded and those who were going to Afghanistan using visas and passports were also stuck in Chaman due to the border closure.
“Over 5,000 Pakistanis are stranded in Spin Boldak as they visit there and Vesh on a daily basis for their small businesses,” an FIA official said.
Clearance suspended
According to customs officials, more than 1,009 trucks carrying transit cargo, exports, and imports goods are stranded because of a suspension in customs clearance owing to “unprovoked aggression” from Kabul.
The disruption follows the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at key border crossings — including Tor­k­ham, Ghulam Khan, Kha­rlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective from October 12 and at the Chaman border from October 15.
According to the officials, the suspension was prompted by unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side that posed serious security risks to customs inspectors and personnel stationed at these posts.
An official announcement from the FBR confirmed that around 500 vehicles carrying transit trade cargo remain stra­nded at the Torkham and Chaman border crossings.
The transit consignments, imported by Afghan traders, are awaiting customs clearance.
On the bilateral trade front, congestion remains acute at the Torkham border, where 255 export vehicles and 24 import vehicles are currently held at the terminal.
An additional 200 trucks, stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road, are awaiting clearance.
In contrast, the Chaman border has comparatively lighter traffic, with 25 export vehicles and five import vehicles still pending processing.
In light of prevailing security concerns, the FBR has confirmed that the majority of customs personnel have temporarily relocated to headquarters.
However, a limited number of inspectors and support staff remain stationed at each border post to resume clearance operations promptly once conditions stabilise and trade routes reopen.
To mitigate disruption and ensure the continued availability of essential consumer goods in the market, the collectorates of the Northern Region have proactively cleared import consignments that had arrived prior to the border closures.

Earlier in the day, the PSL management had acted following repeated public statements by Tareen criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and PSL, and had sought a public apology if the latter wished to avoid legal proceedings.
The move marked a significant escalation in the simmering tensions between the board and the Multan franchise.
Tareen then posted a video on social media platform X on Thursday night, in which he could be seen holding what seemed to be the legal notice sent by the PSL management, saying he wanted to apologise but demanded better of the league organisers.
Making sharp remarks targeted the PSL management, he ended the video by tearing up what seemed to be the legal notice he had received.
Tareen had stoked the fire in April when he shared a podcast clip on X questioning the PCB’s pre-season build-up, writing: “How is PSL 10 bigger and better? Same games, same teams – what’s new? Fed up with hollow words. PCB had time to plan innovations, but we’re repeating last year. Our biggest brand deserves more. Explain the vision!”
A few days later, he sought to clarify his stance amid backlash from other franchise owners, posting: “I love PSL — it’s a MADE-IN-PAKISTAN success story we all benefit from. My words were about pushing for real growth, not negativity. Salman Naseer & PCB team are giving their all. Let’s unite as owners to back them and elevate the league. No more stagnation!”
However, the tensions persisted. In July, Ali renewed his criticism in response to a PCB post-season debrief video celebrating PSL 10’s “success”.
He wrote: “Applause? You must be kidding. TV ratings down, attendance plummeting, digital engagement slowing — yet we’re celebrating? PCB, wake up. PSL deserves better planning, not self-congratulation. Time to fix these issues before it’s too late.”
A PCB source said the repeated statements “damaged the league’s reputation and violated the terms of the agreement”.
The board’s notice reportedly outlines specific clauses of the franchise agreement that were breached. PCB officials maintained that the board remains committed to upholding the integrity and professional standards of the PSL.
A Multan Sultans spokesperson told Dawn on Thursday that “the PCB last month sent a legal notice, which is not a notice of termination”.
“The notice threatens termination of our franchise agreement and a lifetime blacklist of Mr Tareen from owning any cricket team in the future,” a statement by the franchise said later.
“Every statement he (Tareen) has made has been in the best interest of the PSL, urging the league to aim higher and do better.
“For the PCB management to treat constructive criticism as a crime is outrageous. It demonstrates the pettiness of the current management and clearly shows that the PSL is not open to questions or accountability, even from those who have given the most to make it stronger.
“Silencing honest feedback is not how great leagues are built,“ it read.
The development comes amid growing concerns over franchise-board relations within the PSL framework, with several stakeholders calling for greater transparency and consistency in the PCB’s dealings with team owners.</p><small>2025-10-24 02:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24072408671be8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950908/punjab-under-fire-for-choking-wheat-flow-to-two-provinces' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab under fire for ‘choking’ wheat flow to two provinces</strong></a><br><p>• KP says ‘ban’ on inter-provincial movement of commodity violates Article 151(1)
• Warns of shortages, risks to food security
• Sindh accuses Punjab of halting supply of wheat seed; seeks PM’s intervention
PESHAWAR / KARACHI: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Thursday asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs are disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province.
Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed.
In a letter to his Punjab counterpart, KP’s food secretary said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security.
The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depends on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day.
“The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read.
While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements.
KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force.
“This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said.
The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on Oct 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025, where the smooth inter-provincial movement of wheat and its products was emphasised.
“The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said.
On Wednesday, KP Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to KP, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province.
Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat.
Mr Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable.
Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5 million tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.

Meanwhile, despite an apparent ceasefire between coalition partners, tensions between the PPP and PML-N have escalated once again after the Punjab government allegedly halted the supply of wheat seed to Sindh — a move that sparked strong protests from the PPP, which has called for the prime minister’s urgent intervention.
Nisar Khuhro, PPP’s Sindh chapter president and chair of the provincial Public Accounts Committee, accused both the federal and Punjab governments of being “anti-Sindh” and urged PM Shehbaz to take immediate notice of the issue.
“As the wheat sowing season begins, the Punjab Agriculture Regulatory Authority and the Food Department, acting on the Punjab government’s directives, have reportedly halted the supply of hundreds of thousands of wheat seed bags to Sindh,” he said.
“This disruption has raised serious concerns that wheat cultivation across vast areas of Sindh could be severely affected. If Punjab does not resume seed supply to Sindh immediately, the province’s overall wheat production could decline significantly,” he added.
On Wednesday, the PPP’s questions over the wheat procurement mechanism following the recent announcement of the minimum support price (MSP) at Rs3,500 per 40 kilograms created quite a stir between the two sides and drew a strong reaction from the Punjab government.
In May, the federal food minister told the National Assembly that Passco was being abolished as part of market deregulation. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested.
Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked at a press conference on Wednesday who would procure wheat and under what mechanism following Passco’s “abolition”. He said farmers were at the mercy of middlemen paying below the MSP.
The remarks drew a strong response from the Punjab government. Provincial Information Minister Azma Bokhari urged the PPP leadership to take notice of Mr Murtaza’s remarks, warning the PML-N would otherwise respond in kind.
With the dust barely settled, the PPP’s leadership from Sindh has now raised fresh objections, accusing the PML-N of depriving the province’s farmers of their due rights.
“It’s a grave injustice to Sindh’s farmers and tantamount to economic exploitation of growers and haris [farm labourers],” said Mr Khuhro. “Pakistan produces about 552,000 tonnes of wheat seed annually, out of which Punjab-based seed companies account for roughly 516,000 tonnes. However, the Punjab government is reportedly preventing these companies from selling their wheat seed to Sindh.”
According to the PPP leader, Sindh’s farmers and dealers have already paid Punjab-based suppliers for the seeds, yet the supply has been blocked. He described the move as “anti-Sindh” and discriminatory against the province’s farmers.

In the early hours of an August morning, when mist still clings to the ground, the sound of axes and chainsaws echoes from village thickets across the south-western tehsil of Jand in Punjab’s northern Attock district.
“By the time the sun is fully up, truckloads of timber have already left for markets far away,” says Muhammad Ramzan, a 62-year-old farmer from Kanni village, pointing toward a barren patch where a small forest once stood. “These trees took decades to grow, but only hours to fell,” he tells Eos.
This is a pattern across villages in Jand and adjoining areas in Attock, where an entrenched network of illegal loggers, transporters and middlemen — called the ‘timber mafia’ — is stripping the hillsides at a pace the land cannot recover from. 
While data remains limited, the Punjab State of Environment Report 2024 notes that forest cover accounts for only about three percent of the land, amounting to approximately 0.5 million hectares. The Global Forest Watch, an online platform that provides data and tools for monitoring forests, noted that in 2020 that Punjab had 107,0000 [107,000?] hectares of natural forest, extending over 0.52 percent of its land area, which was down by 125 hectares in 2024.

A powerful timber mafia, protected by official collusion and lubricated with bribes, is denuding the landscape in the northern reaches of Punjab…

For Jand’s residents, this isn’t just environmental degradation — it’s an existential threat.
WHY THESE TREES MATTER
Jand lies on the southwestern edge of Attock district, where the Salt Range gives way to semi-arid plains. The tehsil borders Mianwali to the south and Kohat to the west, with the Indus River flowing nearby.
Here, trees are not ornamental — they are infrastructure. Their roots bind fragile soil, preventing landslides during monsoons. Their shade creates microclimates that allow small farms to survive harsh summers. Without them, the already difficult climate grows hotter and drier.
The consequences of the deforestation are already visible. Rainwater from seasonal rains, once absorbed by the forest floor, now rushes unchecked across bare slopes, causing soil erosion and washing away farmland. Wells that once sustained entire hamlets are running dry. Wildlife — jackals, porcupines, migratory birds — is vanishing as habitat disappears.
For women in poorer households, deforestation has meant longer, more dangerous walks to gather firewood. Naseem Bibi, a schoolteacher from a hamlet in Jand, says her students are missing morning classes. “Some of our girls help their mothers collect wood because the nearest stand of trees is now a two-hour walk away,” she tells Eos. “They return tired before school even begins.”
Shopkeepers in Jand’s small bazaars report business impacts. Summers are hotter, dust storms more frequent. “Our produce spoils faster now,” says a fruit vendor in Jand city. Others point out that customers complain that the quality of melons and peaches has gone down.

OPERATIONS IN THE DARK
The timber mafia operates with brazen confidence. Under cover of darkness, trucks loaded with freshly felled wood rumble down unpaved tracks toward markets in Kohat, Swabi, Peshawar and beyond.
“They come at night, always in groups, and they have people in the system who warn them about raids,” says Abdul Majeed, a farmer from a nearby village. “When I was young, this whole area was covered in trees,” he continues. “Now it’s just barren slopes and stones,” he tells Eos.
Interviews with those involved reveal a sophisticated, cross-border operation. Sakhi Muhammad, a local labourer who works for Rs1,500 per day as a tree cutter, confirms that “most of the activities are carried out after sunset to save our skins from police, local administration and the forest department.” He outlines the supply chain: small logs are sold to local tobacco processing units mushrooming recently in the area, while big logs are transported to the neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.
Samar Shah, a truck driver involved in the trade, tells Eos the network is largely run by outsiders. “All of the people in this business from chopping to transportation belong to KP,” he says, explaining that individuals from bordering districts such as Kohat have settled in the area to manage the illicit trade.
THE SCEPTRE OF COLLUSION 
Local activists allege the timber mafia is able to operate because of corruption and political patronage. Bribes to avoid checkpoints, selective enforcement of forest laws, and underreporting of tree losses have become routine. 
When asked how trucks travel unchecked across provinces, Shah smiles and takes out a Rs1,000 currency note. “This piece of permit opens all roads from Motorway to GT road,” he tells Eos.
“Everyone knows who is behind this,” says environmental campaigner Farhan Gul, “but when vested interests benefit, no one dares to stop them.”
Malik Shabbir, a community elder from Jand, puts it more bluntly: “They know who is cutting the trees, they know when the trucks leave, but they pretend nothing is happening.”
Ijaz Khan, a forest department official in Jand, contests the claim, saying trees are properly numbered in official forest areas such as Jalwal. He tells Eos that timber transported between cities requires permits and permit fees are deposited in the national treasury. “Anyone found illegally chopping trees or transporting timber faces fines,” he adds. However, he acknowledges that neither the permit fees nor fines are high enough to discourage the practice.
Complicating the enforcement picture is the trade in trees from private land. A local timber merchant, Asif Khattak, offers a glimpse into a potential loophole. He claims to only purchase, chop and sell “legal” timber from “personal jungles established by local landlords on their lands or farmhouses.” He points out there is no restriction on cutting down private property trees. Khattak identifies the local community and tobacco processing plants as his main buyers, with larger logs used for coal making[??] in nearby districts. This legal loophole allows vast quantities of wood to be cleared with little oversight, often providing a veil for illegally sourced timber.
The gravity of the situation is now drawing concern from higher authorities. Dr Rabia Noureen, the deputy director of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) in Attock, terms the large-scale chopping of trees a “threat” to the environment and ecosystem of the area. She tells Eos that the EPA is collaborating with sister organisations, especially the forest department, local stakeholders and donors, to carry out large-scale tree-plantation drives to combat deforestation.
Echoing this alarm at the national level is Malik Amin Aslam, a Pakistani environmentalist and former federal minister for climate change, who also hails from Attock. He tells Eos that the ongoing floods are a wake-up call to the government on the costs of unchecked deforestation. “Trees, especially old standing forests, are a lifeline for our resilience in this age of climate fury,” he says. “The government must take urgent notice of this ongoing massacre in Jand and apprehend the timber mafias active over there,” he adds.
In July this year, the Jand Bar Association passed a resolution condemning the “ruthless chopping of trees” and calling on authorities to halt illegal cutting. The association’s president, Advocate Nighat Shamim, also dismissed the forest department’s claim that timber is being cut to meet local fuel demand in nearby areas without natural gas supply.
A FAINT GLIMMER 
Locals are beginning to organise community watch groups and grassroots plantation drives but, without official backing, their efforts face long odds.
In the meantime, the people of Jand watch their horizon grow emptier with each passing year. The hilltops, once dotted with hardy crowns of acacia and keekar, now stand exposed — bare monuments to what was lost and what may never return.
