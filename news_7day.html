<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02082108cd8da12.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939073/tianjin-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Tianjin summit</strong></a><br><p>THE SCO’s two-day summit, which concluded in the Chinese city of Tianjin on Monday, offered a glimpse into a more multilateral world; where sovereign nations can come together as equals, breaking away from the West-led, Eurocentric model that has prevailed since the end of World War II, and which is currently under severe strain.
It also offered a forum where bilateral disputes and diverging viewpoints can be addressed and accommodated through a multilateral lens. For example, the Tianjin Declaration condemned the terrorist attacks targeting the Jaffar Express and in Khuzdar, along with the Pahalgam episode, signalling that condemnation of militancy should not be selective, and terrorism in all its forms should be shunned.
This is also a validation of Pakistan’s narrative, as this country has been denouncing the Pahalgam attack from the beginning, while also calling for hostile foreign actors to desist from supporting terrorist violence within its borders. It also suggests that certain states’ efforts to isolate Pakistan internationally have failed.
 
 

Additionally, the declaration called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while highlighting the “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the besieged Strip and denouncing the US-Israel aggression against Iran.
The fact is that any emerging multilateral order must be based on justice and international law. All those who violate these basic principles must be censured, unlike the present system, where perceived enemies face the full force of the law, as well as military aggression, while friends literally get away with murder. Israel’s ongoing genocide in the occupied territories is the most glaring example of this hypocrisy.
The West, primarily the US and its European/Nato allies, are highly suspicious of groupings such as the SCO and Brics, mainly because they challenge their entrenched hegemony on world affairs. Moreover, Western states are loath to see their ‘foes’ such as Vladimir Putin and Masoud Pezeshkian being accorded full protocol. They should remember that many of them treat Benjamin Netanyahu with even more reverence despite his criminal acts. Russia and China, which are currently leading the push towards a more multilateral global order, may not be perfect examples to emulate. But unlike the West, they are seen to support a more equitable world system, where the Global South has a voice.
Countries like Pakistan must take full advantage of the emerging regional and global formations. However, one set of global hegemons must not be replaced by another. Rather, a just new order is required where the social, economic and political rights of all states are respected. The future need not be one of confrontation between SCO/BRICS and the Western bloc, but of cooperation, where the path to progress has no strings attached.

• Shocks felt in five provinces of Afghanistan, many parts of Pakistan
• Officials fear casualties may rise as rescue efforts hampered by risk of landslides and rock slides after recent rains
• UN chief, PM Shehbaz, President Zardari express condolences; KP govt decides to immediately send medicines
NURGAL: A massive rescue operation was underway in Afghanistan on Monday, after a strong earthquake and multiple aftershocks collapsed homes onto sleeping families in a remote, mountainous region, killing more than 800 people, according to the Taliban authorities.
The 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck just before midnight, rattling buildings from Kabul to Islamabad.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) also recorded at least five aftershocks throughout the night.
Casualties and destruction swept across at least five provinces of Afghanistan, while tremors were also recorded in the two province of Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab, besides the federal capital of Islamabad.
Near the epicentre in eastern Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,800 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
Another 12 people were killed and 255 injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, while 58 people were injured in Laghman province.
In Wadir village in the hard-hit district of Nurgal, dozens of people joined the effort to pull people from the rubble of destroyed or severely damaged homes more than 12 hours after the initial earthquake, AFP journalists saw.
The epicentre was about 27km from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the USGS, which said it struck just eight kilometres below the Earth’s surface. Such relatively shallow quakes can cause more damage, especially since the majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes vulnerable to collapse.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in remote Kunar provinces “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned.
Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, which border Pakistan, were also hit by flooding in recent days, authorities said.
Rescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the border, where mudbrick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the quake.
“The area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant — that is why many of the roads are impassable,” Kate Carey, an officer at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Reuters.
Rescue teams and authorities are trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimise the risk of contamination to water resources, Carey said.
Casualties could rise as rescue teams access more isolated locations, authorities said.
Taliban’s defence ministry said at least 40 flight sorties had been carried out on Monday.
A member of the agricultural department in Nurgal said people had rushed to clear blocked roads in the hours after the earthquake, but that badly affected areas were remote and had limited telecoms networks.
“There is a lot of fear and tension… Children and women were screaming. We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad said.
He said that many living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghan refugees who have returned to the country from Pakistan and Iran after decades. “They wanted to build their homes here.”
Condolences pour in
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep condolences, on behalf of the people of Pakistan, to the families who lost their loved ones in the earthquake. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government decided to immediately dispatch a consignment of essential medicines to earthquake-stricken reg­ions of Afghanistan, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announcing that the provincial government was fully prepared to also deploy medical staff.

• Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej surge to ‘exceptionally high’ levels through central Punjab, threaten province’s southern parts
• PDMA warns of urban flooding threat to Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat amid heavy rains
• Over 2.4m people and 600,000 animals displaced; 390 relief camps set up
• 41 deaths reported so far; rescue teams conducting ‘largest-ever operation’
LAHORE: Punjab remains in the grip of a worsening flood crisis, as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers surge to “exceptionally high” levels, threatening vast swathes of land, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has warned of more torrential rain, which could lead to urban flooding across Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.
The water level in the Punjab’s rivers is expected to rise further after the High Commission of India informed Pakistan of incoming floodwater from the Harike and Ferozepur headworks, according to the Pakistan Commission for Indus Water.
“Harike and Ferozpur along the Sutlej in India are at high flood level as of 8am on Sept 1, which will affect the water levels in the respective downstream districts,” says an advisory released by the PDMA.
Northern India, particularly in the catchment areas of rivers that flow into Pakistan, has been experiencing heavy and continuous rainfall in recent weeks. According to Indian forecasts, the next 36 hours will be critical in Uttrakhand, Himachal, Haryana, and Punjab, as there are chances of heavy rainfall in these areas.
As of 1am on Tuesday, the Chenab at Trimmu recorded a massive and steady outflow of 532,498 cusecs, classified as a “very high” flood. A dangerous surge is moving towards Head Trimmu, and water levels are expected to swell to nearly 700,000 cusecs.
At the same time, the Ravi River is also at a “very high” flood level at Balloki Headworks with 144,675 cusecs, while Sidhnai Headworks is also in a similar state, recording 105,604 cusecs and rising.
The Sutlej River continues to pose a severe threat at Ganda Singh Wala, maintaining an “exceptionally high” flood with steady outflows of 253,068 cusecs. The situation is projected to worsen, with approximately one million cusecs of water expected to converge at Panjnad between Sept 4 and 5.
The provincial government, which has termed this its “largest rescue and relief operation,” is now shifting its focus south.
A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity told Dawn, “The water has passed the major central Punjab population centres, but the true test of our infrastructure and preparedness is now at Panjnad and the areas beyond. We are monitoring it on a minute-by-minute basis.”
On Monday, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that various cities were on high alert for the next 24 to 48 hours, including Jhang, Sahiwal, Toba Tek Singh, Okara, Multan, Pak­pattan, Bahawal­nagar, Vehari and Bahawalpur.
Speaking at a press conference in Lahore, she said the water released by India had created ‘extraordinary circumstances’. “To meet those circumstances, there were extraordinary preparations and readiness by Punjab’s authorities, rescue teams, and civil defence in times of emergency,” she added.
‘Punjab’s worst flood ever’
Addressing another press conference, PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia said 41 people have lost their lives in the floods, while eight have been injured.
He warned that Punjab is facing the biggest flood in its history, with the ninth spell of the monsoon predicted to bring more rain over the next two days.
He added that no new flood surge had entered Head Marala, but after the rains, the water in Leh Nullah at Katariyyan has reached up to 19 feet.
Mr Kathia said that there is no threat to Trimmu Headworks and noted that water from the Chenab would enter Multan within the next 12 hours, where it would merge with floodwaters from the Ravi.
He warned that a breach may have to be made at Safura on Monday night due to the major surge at Sidhnai, with arrangements already completed. He said the breach will affect 14 villages and 17,000 acres.
He added that a flood surge of 600,000 to 650,000 cusecs was expected at Head Muhammad Wala on Tuesday (today). An important meeting regarding Head Muhammad Wala had already been held in Multan and key decisions taken. If breaching occurs there, 16 revenue estates (mouzas) will be affected.
The PDMA chief predicted that floodwaters would accumulate at Panjnad on September 5, though at lower levels than earlier estimates. He said water from the Sutlej was currently moving towards Sulemanki and Head Islam.
He claimed that timely decisions had saved many lives. He said that Rescue 1122 was conducting the largest rescue operation in its history, with 3,100 villages and 2,900 revenue estates affected across Punjab.
So far, more than 2.4 million people have been affected, with over 900,000 people and 600,000 animals relocated to safe areas. Relief efforts include 390 camps and tent cities, while the Livestock Department is arranging fodder and feed for animals.
 
 

Mr Kathia also noted that India had only provided information regarding the Sutlej, with no details shared about any other river surges.
He further said that there is no longer any expectation of a major surge at Marala, however, rainwater will still come.
Earlier, Multan Com­missioner Aamir Karim Khan said over 450,267 people and 468,284 livestock had been relocated to safer places.
He said that a flood surge of nearly 800,000 cusecs in the Chenab was expected to pass through Multan between Monday and Tuesday night.
A decision regarding possible breaching at Sher Shah and Head Muhammad Wala would be made based on the water situation.
Urban flooding alert
Meanwhile, PDMA on Monday issued alert about urban flooding in Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat due to heavy rainfall expected in the next 72 hours.
According to an advisory, Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat may face urban flooding in the next 72 hours as parts of Punjab are set to receive rainfall.
 
 

“A well-marked monsoon low is present over southwest Haryana and adjoining areas, while a strong trough of a westerly wave lies over the northern parts of the country.”
It forecasted “widespread heavy to very heavy rainfall, along with torrential downpours, at scattered places over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Beas (upstream of Ganda Singh Wala), Ravi, and Chenab rivers, along with their tributaries and nullahs, as well as in Lahore and Gujranwala divisions, from Sept 1 to 3.”
In light of the situation, the PDMA warned of rising river flows, forecasting “very high” to “exceptionally high” floods in the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab. District authorities have been directed to take precautionary measures, prepare for urban flooding, and disseminate information among the public.

• Calls for building small dams, reservoirs, instead of mega projects
• Terms local govts essential for disaster management
• House to formally begin debate on floods today
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly’s new session on Monday began with an unusual display of unity as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed solidarity with flood victims, but this bonhomie proved short-lived as the opposition refused to attend a briefing by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Addressing a news conference outside Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the sitting, PTI leaders, including Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Asad Qaiser, announced they had decided not to attend the briefing on the orders of incarcerated party leader Imran Khan.
Proceedings continued only for an hour or so before Speaker Ayaz Sadiq cut short the sitting, announcing that the NDMA had arranged a briefing for some 100 MNAs at 6pm and asking members to attend it.
Earlier, the house suspended the normal agenda of the day and decided to initiate a full-fledged debate on the ongoing flood catastrophe that had caused massive devastation in the country’s northern areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, besides inundating a vast area of Punjab due to release of water by neighbouring India.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry moved a motion to begin a formal debate on “the situation arising out of the recent devastating floods in the country”.
‘Man-made disaster’
The highlight of the brief NA sitting was the speech of Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, who termed the recent devastation caused by floods “a man-made disaster”.
The minister also called for local government elections in the country, besides stressing the need for building small dams and reservoirs to avert such tragedies in future.
“The catastrophe we are facing [today] cannot be called a natural disaster,” the minister declared.
“We have done value addition by constructing hotels and houses on waterways. We have encroached riverbeds,” he said, adding that this was the third or fourth such disaster in last 12 to 14 years.
Without naming anyone, he said when someone would be obliged to build a housing society on a riverbed, nature would react.
“In KP also, the people had encroached natural flow of rivers. What steps we have taken to remove encroachments on waterways after the country faced similar floods some three years back. He said they would face such tragedies again and again if they did not change their way.
Highlighting damages caused by floods in his home constituency, Mr Asif alleged a “contracting company” had destroyed his city of Sialkot.
“They are influential people and sitting in the Senate,” he said, pointing the finger at Zahir Khan and Bros (ZKB).
It was unfortunate that all big dams had been built by military dictators, while politicians had built hotels on riverbeds, he regretted.
He suggested building hundreds of small dams and reservoirs, instead of waiting for decades to build mega projects, warning that water would become an extremely scarce commodity in the future.
He was of the opinion that they needed to build small dams, which could be completed within a year or two.
“Do not do politics on it. We have political differences, but climate is a national, rather international issue, and it needs a national response,” he said.
LG system
“A comprehensive and robust local government system is needed to serve the masses in the cities, villages and tehsils,” said the minister amid desk-thumping by the members, regretting that presently there were no local body institutions in Punjab and other parts of the country.
The local bodies were essential for disaster management, he said, adding that power must be dispersed to towns, villages, tehsils and districts.
Earlier, Ali Muhammad Khan of the PTI said the federal government should come forward to help KP people. He called for a detailed parliamentary discussion on water issues and the need for building new dams.
“The whole house should think over it as to how we can build dams and reservoirs. There should be no politics on the issue of dams,” the PTI leader said.
He asked the federal government to complete work on Mohmand Dam project that had been started by the PTI’s government.
He said political parties had failed to build even a single big water reservoir.
 
 

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan drew the attention of the house towards the flood devastations in his Buner constituency, stating that 240 people had died and another 120 were still missing.
He said the party had suspended its political activities in Punjab due to flood situation.
He praised the KP government and the armed forces for their role in the rescue efforts in the province.
He, however, termed the assistance so far provided by the federal government “insufficient”.
PPP’s Naveed Qamar urged collective national action against climate change and environmental mismanagement.
The PPP leader warned that floods could be 22pc more destructive next year, while in the long term, melting glaciers might dry up the Indus and other rivers, turning fertile lands into deserts and threatening centuries-old ecosystems.

• Putin urges shift from ‘Euro-centric’ security model
• Tianjin Declaration condemns terror attacks in Pakistan; reaffirms commitment to fight separatism and extremism
ISLAMABAD: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pressed his vision for a new global security and economic order that prioritises the “Global South”, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called on leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to initiate a structured process to resolve longstanding disputes in South Asia.
“Global governance has reached a new crossroads,” said President Xi, adding that member states “must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practise true multilateralism” — a thinly veiled swipe at the US.
The summit brought together more than 20 world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian PM Narendra Modi, in the Chinese port city of Tianjin.
In an image designed to convey a mood of solidarity, Putin and Modi were shown holding hands as they walked jovially towards Xi before the summit opened. The three men stood shoulder-to-shoulder, laughing and surrounded by interpreters.
“It’s hard to tell if the scene was choreographed or improvised, but it doesn’t really matter,” wrote Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, a research agency.
Putin, whose country has forged even closer economic and security ties with China amid the fallout from the Ukraine war, said the SCO had revived “genuine multilateralism”, with national currencies increasingly used in mutual settlements.
“This, in turn, lays the political and socio-economic groundwork for the formation of a new system of stability and security in Eurasia,” Putin said.
“This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others.”
Xi also called for the creation of a new SCO development bank, in what would be a major step towards the bloc’s long-held aspiration of developing an alternative payment system that circumvents the US dollar and the power of its sanctions.
Call for S. Asia dialogue
Addressing the 25th SCO Heads of States Council meeting, PM Shehbaz also made Pakistan’s case for normal and stable relations with its neighbours, advocating dialogue over confrontation.
“Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism,” he said, expressing disappointment over the region’s extremely disturbing development in the last few months.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s support for multilateralism, the prime minister said the SCO remained a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration.
On regional security, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms, including what he termed “state terrorism,” while recalling the country’s immense sacrifices in the fight against extremism.
“We have lost over 90,000 lives and endured economic losses exceeding $152 billion — a sacrifice unparalleled in history,” he said, adding that foreign elements were involved in recent terror incidents in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms… Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interest must know that the world no longer buys this narrative. We had irrefutable evidence of the involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the PM remarked.
The prime minister also strongly condemned Israel’s unjustified aggression against Iran, a fellow SCO member, and called for an immediate end to the bloodshed in Gaza. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the two-state solution with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Palestine.
He said Pakistan supports a peaceful and stable Afghanistan for the benefit of the entire region, expressing that hope that trilateral cooperation between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan would yield positive results. Addressing the challenge of climate-induced disasters, the prime minister spoke about the devastating floods currently affecting Pakistan due to torrential rains, which have caused massive human and economic losses. He thanked the international community, particularly China, for their solidarity and assistance.
Tianjin Declaration
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably stated: “Member states strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025. Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes.
They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats,” the declaration said.
It added that the SCO members were committed to ensuring sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges and threats.
It said that they reaffirmed their determination to continue the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, arms smuggling and other forms of transnational organised crime.

• Endorses boycott of by-polls and resignation from parliamentary committees; daily walkouts planned in NA and Senate to highlight ‘lack of democracy’ in country
ISLAMABAD: Claiming that the international community has not shown interest in supporting Pakistan after floods, the parliamentary committee of the PTI on Monday urged former prime minister Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government to help flood-hit people in Punjab and KP.
The committee endorsed the decision of Imran Khan to boycott the by-elections and resign from parliamentary committees. It also decided to stage a daily boycott of the National Assembly to send a message to national and international community that the democracy does not exist in the country.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said that during the meeting, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan briefed the committee on his meeting with party patron-in-chief Imran Khan, after which the committee endorsed the decision to boycott the by-elections and resign from parliamentary committees.
“However, as international community has hardly shown any interest in supporting the flood victims, the committee decided to urge Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds for their support,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser further said that the overseas Pakistanis would be asked to transfer funds either to KP government or charity organisations of Imran Khan. The funds would be used to support flood victims in both Punjab and KP, he said.
“We fear that the crops will be ba­­dly affected due to floods, and next year there will be enormous pressure on the rupee as government will have to import food items including wheat and rice,” he warned. He said that the committee had decided to boycott the parliamentary sessions on a daily basis.
 
 

To another question, the PTI leader explaining the decision said that members of parliament would attend the sessions of the Senate and National Assembly and then walk out in protest.
He added that the country lacked the democracy, which was leading to continuous problems and growing security issues.
Rain hits Gandapur meeting
Meanwhile, PTI had arranged a meeting of media persons with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur at KP House in Islamabad but heavy rain disrupted the event.
Strong winds dislodged the canopy set up in the lawn, forcing organisers to cancel the meeting. Media persons were later informed that the session could not be held.

• Senators seek clarity on energy supply, debt before privatisation
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee was informed on Monday that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited is expected to be privatised by November this year.
Briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation on the current status of the process, the Privatisation Commission secretary said that four companies were participating and would need to form consortiums with established airlines to operate PIA. Two applicants had already been disqualified for not meeting standards.
When Senator Zeeshan Khanzada raised concerns over PIA’s Rs650 billion debt, committee chairman Senator Dr Afnan Ullah Khan suggested that the airline’s two hotels could be sold to offset liabilities.
When Senator Khanzada questioned the government’s strategy of selling profitable companies in the first phase, the Privatisation Com­mis­sion secretary replied that investors are naturally more interested in profitable entities. Even if such companies were given away for free, he argued, it would still be the right decision as they may not remain profitable in the future.
The committee, chaired by Afnan Ullah Khan and attended by Senators Zeeshan Khanzada, Umer Farooq and Asad Qasim, also reviewed progress on other key privatisation initiatives, including power distribution companies (Discos), generation companies (Gencos), and Pakistan Minerals Development Corporation (PMDC).
 
 

The committee members stressed the need for clarity on energy supply agreements, debt restructuring and protection of profitable state assets before moving forward with privatisation.
Power Division officials informed the committee that Nandipur and Guddu power plants are on the privatisation list. “Eight important issues of Nandipur have been resolved, with only one pending related to the gas purchase and sale agreement,” they said, adding that the government was still deciding whether to provide a dedicated gas supply or continue with the current arrangement of supply on availability.
Regarding the Guddu power pla­nt, the officials said that four of nine outstanding issues had been resol­v­­ed, while disputes over land transfer re­­mained. The plant’s land is still re­­g­­istered under Wapda, though the latter has issued an NOC and the transfer process is underway.
Senator Afnan Ullah underlined the importance of resolving the energy supply issue for successful privatisation.

A statement from the police spokesperson said the action was taken after her complaint and video statement.
A case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The suspect had been stalking her for several days, the social media influencer said in the first information report.
She added that on Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.
Samiya thanked the Islamabad police in a subsequent video on her Instagram account and mentioned that the suspect had threatened her to take her complaint back.
Earlier in June, the Islamabad police said they had arrested the main suspect in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, a day after she was shot dead in her house.</p><small>2025-09-01 19:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/012208588adcdac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938960/vaccines-dont-save-lives-vaccination-does-health-experts-shed-light-on-global-immunisation-trends' target='_blank'><strong>‘Vaccines don’t save lives. Vaccination does’: Health experts shed light on global immunisation trends</strong></a><br><p>With over one million children in Pakistan still missing routine vaccination, health experts on Monday gathered in Lahore for a week-long workshop focused on strengthening national immunisation efforts.
When it comes to vaccination, Pakistan continues to face challenges of low uptake, public hesitancy and mistrust, operational bottlenecks, and the unfinished struggle against the poliovirus.
The National Vaccinology Workshop kicked off today at Lahore’s Pearl-Continental Hotel and will run through till Friday.
The first day brought together leading experts who spoke on topics ranging from the history of vaccines and the science of how they work to global immunisation trends, coverage challenges, and Gavi’s support. Gavi is a public-private partnership formed in the year 2000 that aims to improve vaccine access in the world’s poorest countries.
Speakers on the first day included Prof Asad Ali, Dr Junaid Iqbal, Prof Farah Qamar, Dr Chaudhri Irtaza Ahmad, and Dr Richard Omore.
“What are the interventions modern medicine has done to save most lives?” Prof Ali began by asking the audience, before shortly answering himself: “Antibiotics and vaccines.”
Despite being a public health breakthrough, he noted, vaccines are costly to develop and produce because the safety threshold for administering them is set far higher than for most medicines, since they are typically given to healthy individuals.
“For years, access was largely limited to wealthy countries, until the launch of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation, through which international organisations pooled resources to support vaccine uptake worldwide,” he said.
Pakistan is currently Gavi’s largest recipient under its strategic phases 4.0 and 5.0, but experts warn that the country must begin preparing for life beyond donor support.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Dr Omore pointed to Kenya’s experience, where vaccine procurement faced transition challenges including critical vaccine stock shortages after the country crossed Gavi’s income threshold and lost support, forcing the government to quickly find its own funds.
He said Pakistan should use the current period of support to plan for a smooth transition so that immunisation programmes are not disrupted.
Dr Omore also stressed the importance of continued disease surveillance, noting that monitoring new strains and tracking vaccine impact, such as with human papillomavirus (HPV) or pneumococcal vaccines, is essential both for guiding health policy and for building public trust by showing evidence of reduced disease.
Earlier today, a poliovirus case was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district, taking the nationwide tally for this year to 24.
Last month, the World Health Organisation announced that it is partnering with the Pakistan government to train workers for the country’s first HPV vaccine drive. Experts have also urged advocacy for the said drive to ensure success.</p><small>2025-09-01 18:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/012104272c67524.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938863/over-800-dead-as-60-magnitude-earthquake-hits-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Over 800 dead as 6.0-magnitude earthquake hits Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>A massive rescue operation was under way in Afghanistan on Monday, after a strong earthquake and multiple aftershocks flattened homes in a remote, mountainous region, killing more than 800 people, the Taliban authorities said.
The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27 kilometres from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Nangarhar and Kunar provinces border Pakistan, with the Torkham crossing, the site of many waves of Afghan returnees deported or forced to leave, often with no work and nowhere to go.
The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from capital Kabul to Islamabad. After the initial quake, a series of at least five aftershocks followed throughout the night, with the strongest being one of magnitude 5.2 just after 4am (2330 GMT on Sunday).
More than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking, according to the USGS.
 
 

Casualties and destruction swept across at least five provinces and rescuers were still pulling people from destroyed homes and evacuating the injured by helicopter as evening approached.
“The search operation is still going on. Many people are stuck under the rubble of their roofs,” the disaster management head in eastern Kunar province, Ehsanullah Ehsan, told AFP, warning the death toll could rise.
Near the epicentre in the east of Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,500 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
Another 12 people were killed and 255 injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, he added.
“Numerous houses were destroyed,” interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.
The majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes that are vulnerable to collapse.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in remote Kunar provinces “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned in a statement to AFP.
Afghanistan’s government-run Bakhtar News Agency reported citing officials from the Disaster Management Department in Kunar that “the most severely impacted districts include Noor Gul, Chawkay, Watapur, Mano Gai, and Chapa Dara”.
 






Three villages were razed in the province of Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, the health ministry earlier said.
The Taliban authorities and the United Nations mobilised rescue efforts to hard-hit areas. The defence ministry said 40 flight sorties had so far been carried out.
A member of the agricultural department in Kunar’s Nurgal district said people had rushed to clear blocked roads to isolated villages, but that badly affected areas were remote and had limited telecoms networks.
“There is a lot of fear and tension … Children and women were screaming. We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad told AFP.
He said that many living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghans who have returned to the country from Iran and Pakistan in recent years.
“They wanted to build their homes here.”
In Wadir village in Kunar’s Nurgal district, dozens of residents of the surrounding area helped rescuers to pull people from the rubble of flattened homes, sometimes with their bare hands, AFP journalists saw.
Many injured were transported to hospitals in Jalalabad city, such as 22-year-old Zafar Khan Gojar, who was evacuated from Nurgal along with his brother, whose leg was broken.
“The rooms and walls collapsed … killing some children and injuring others,” he told AFP.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in Kunar “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned in a statement to AFP.
Roads remained blocked nearly 20 hours after the earthquake, despite residents’ efforts to clear the way.
Images from Reuters Television showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped soldiers and medics carry the wounded to ambulances.
Rescuers were scrambling to find survivors in the area bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where homes of mud and stone were levelled by the midnight quake that hit at a depth of 10km.
The disaster will further stretch the resources of the South Asian nation already grappling with humanitarian crises, from a sharp drop in aid to a huge pushback of its citizens from neighbouring countries.
Condolences
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed grief over the incident and extended his condolences.
“I stand in full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan after the devastating earthquake that hit the country earlier today,” he said.
Delegation of the European Union to Afghanistan posted on X: “The EU extends its heartfelt condolences to all affected by the recent devastating earthquake in Afghanistan’s Kunar & Nangarhar provinces. Our humanitarian partners are actively on the ground, providing critical aid to the victims. We stand in full solidarity with Afghans.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also extended condolences over the loss of life.
“Deeply saddened by the devastating earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, which shook Kabul & was also felt in various parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad. With reports confirming hundreds of precious human lives lost & villages destroyed, our hearts go out to the victims and their families. On behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan, I extend my heartfelt condolences & prayers to the bereaved families,” he said on X.
He added, “We stand in solidarity with our Afghan brothers & sisters in this hour of grief, and we are ready to extend all possible support in this regard.”
 






In his condolence message, President Asif Ali Zardari also said that “during this hour of grief and hardship, Pakistan stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan.”
The statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said, “He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and for strength and resilience of the affected communities. He further prayed that the departed souls may rest in eternal peace and that the Almighty may grant courage to the bereaved families to bear this immense loss.”
In his statement, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar offered prayers for those injured and impacted by the quake.
 






The Foreign Office said he later called Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi to convey his condolences and assured readiness to extend all possible support as required by the Afghan side.
 






Following earlier reports of casualties, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he was “extremely saddened by the tragic loss of over 300 lives and the many injuries”.
“My deepest condolences go out to the families who have lost their loved ones and heartfelt prayers for full and quick recovery of those injured. This immense sorrow is felt by us all,” he said on X.
 






KP Governor Karim Kundi also expressed grief over the “loss of hundreds of lives and large-scale financial damages caused by a powerful earthquake”.
In his condolence message, Kundi extended heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families and prayed for the early recovery of the injured. He said the people of Pakistan stood in solidarity with the Afghan government and people during this difficult time.
Deadly quakes
Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.
In October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.
In June 2022, a 5.9-magnitude quake struck the impoverished eastern border province of Paktika, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.
Ravaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a series of humanitarian crises.
Since the return of the Taliban, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished nation’s ability to respond to disasters.
Funding cuts to Afghanistan obstruct earthquake response
Humanitarian officials said that the shrinking of funding for Afghanistan, led by US aid cuts, was hampering the response to the powerful earthquake, with dozens of clinics closed and a helicopter out of use.
The Taliban administration and aid officials have a daunting task to rescue and help thousands of Afghans with a tinier budget than ever and an economy in crisis.
“The actual delivery of response has been badly hit by the funding cuts this year, but also the number of people we have on the ground is much less than we would have had six months ago,” said Kate Carey, deputy head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan has been badly affected since President Donald Trump’s administration in January began funding cuts to its humanitarian arm and aid programmes worldwide in what he casts as part of a broader plan to remove wasteful spending.
But even before that, funding was shrinking to Afghanistan due to competing emergencies in areas such as Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan, as well as frustration from donor governments over the Taliban’s policies towards women, especially its restrictions on the work of Afghan female NGO staff.
Humanitarian aid, aimed at bypassing political institutions to serve urgent needs, has shrunk to $767 million this year, down from $3.8 billion in 2022.
The impact of the cuts was starkly illustrated by the latest crisis, Carey said, with a creaking health system now dealing with thousands of patients hit by falling rubble.
Forty-four health clinics catering to over 363,000 people in Nangarhar and Kunar suspended operations or closed this year due to US aid cuts, according to World Health Organisation figures.
Where in the past a helicopter would have taken health teams and supplies to remote villages only accessible by foot, funding cuts to the World Food Programme, which runs a humanitarian air service, put the aircraft out of commission earlier this year, Carey said.
The Taliban has appealed for more aid in a country where half the population was already in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, according to UN estimates.
“Support from the international community is seen as essential,” said Abdul Rahman Habib, spokesperson for the Taliban-run Ministry of Economy, noting the fall in funds for food, healthcare, displaced people and communities hit by climate change.
Aid has been a lifeline during Afghanistan’s global isolation under the Taliban, whose government has only formally been recognised by Russia. Sanctions on some of its leaders have hampered the banking sector and the US has frozen billions in central bank assets.
Taliban authorities do not publicly release their annual budget. The World Bank noted in April that although authorities’ tax and revenue mobilisation had been relatively strong, it had not been enough to offset the sharp drop in aid.
As well as the global funding plunge, the UN and charities have to navigate a plethora of complex policies on operations under the Taliban, who say Afghan female aid staff should not work, though there are exemptions in health and education.
The Taliban, who have closed high schools and universities to female students and placed restrictions on their movement without a male guardian, say they respect women’s rights in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law.
Sherine Ibrahim, the International Rescue Committee’s Afghanistan Director, said today that the funding cuts were a drag on the response to Afghanistan’s latest disaster.
“Although we have been able to act fast, we are profoundly fearful for the additional strain that this disaster will have on the overall humanitarian response in Afghanistan,” she said.

The 10 families have been among more than 2,000 Afghans caught in limbo in Pakistan as Germany’s conservative-led government this year froze a programme to offer them sanctuary.
Most of them arrived in Hanover on a commercial flight from Istanbul around 2pm (1200 GMT), said an AFP reporter and the Airbridge Kabul initiative set up to help those affected.
An interior ministry spokeswoman confirmed that “45 Afghan nationals entered Germany. These are all individuals who obtained visas through legal proceedings … All of these individuals have fully completed the admission procedure and security screening“.
The Airbridge Kabul initiative later said that two more people had arrived after catching a later connection from Istanbul.
A mother and daughter who did not want to give their names told AFP they were looking forward to their new life in Germany.
“It feels very good and pleasant when girls can go to school, study, and I can also work, study, integrate into society, and learn the language,” the mother said.
“I am very happy that after many difficulties and challenges, we finally managed to reach a good life,” said the daughter, aged 20.
“I could have done many things, studied, achieved a position and reached the goals I had for myself, but unfortunately, I couldn’t. From now on, I will achieve them,” she said.
450 detained
After the Taliban returned to power in 2021, Germany set up a scheme to offer sanctuary to Afghans who had worked for German institutions or were otherwise deemed at high risk of persecution, including rights activists and journalists.
But the scheme was frozen under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who took office in May, as part of a wider crackdown on immigration.
While the Afghans have been left stranded in Pakistan, authorities have also stepped up a crackdown on Afghans living in the country without residency.
Last month, Berlin said around 450 Afghans waiting to come to Germany had been detained, and more than 200 of them were sent back to their Taliban-run homeland.
While alarm has grown about their fate, Germany has agreed to resume accepting some of the others.
The government said last week that Afghans for whom “courts have found that Germany is legally obliged to issue visas” would travel to Germany “in stages” once they had cleared security checks.
The 10 main applicants who arrived on Monday were eight women and two men who had been involved in “politics, the justice system and journalism”, said Eva Beyer, a spokeswoman for the Airbridge Kabul initiative.
Around 85 other stranded Afghans have begun legal proceedings against Germany, “and there are more every day”, Beyer said.</p><small>2025-09-01 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/012026338eee29c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938952/militant-attacks-surge-to-decade-high-in-august-says-think-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Militant attacks surge to decade-high in August, says think tank</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan witnessed an alarming spike in militant violence in August this year, registering a 74 per cent increase in militant attacks compared to July, becoming the “deadliest month in over a decade”, according to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on Monday.
In July, PICSS documented 82 militant attacks across the country, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries, a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June.
According to the think tank, those killed in July’s militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.
“With 143 militant attacks recorded, August became the deadliest month in over a decade, surpassing all monthly figures since February 2014, as per the PICSS Militancy Database,” the think tank’s latest report read.
The wave of violence left 194 people dead, including 73 security forces personnel, 62 civilians, 58 militants, and one pro-government peace committee member, according to PICSS.
Additionally, 231 others were injured, comprising 129 security personnel, 92 civilians, eight militants, and two peace committee members. Militants also abducted at least 10 individuals during the month.
“In response, security forces escalated their operations, killing at least 100 militants and arresting 31 others across the country. However, these actions also led to the deaths of three civilians and one security personnel,” according to PICSS.
When accounting for both militant attacks and security operations, at least 298 individuals lost their lives in August. These included 158 militants, 74 security forces personnel, 65 civilians, and one peace committee member.
The number of injured also rose to 250, with 137 security personnel, 100 civilians, 11 militants, and two peace committee members affected. PICSS observed a 100pc increase in security forces’ deaths and a 145pc rise in injuries compared to July. Militant fatalities rose by 27pc, while civilian deaths climbed 20pc.
The report highlighted that the most alarming escalation occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the tribal districts, which saw 51 militant attacks — a 200pc increase. These attacks resulted in 74 deaths, marking a 124pc rise.
The rest of KP was also similarly hit, with 55 attacks causing 56 deaths, including 26 security personnel, 22 civilians, and eight militants. In total, KP witnessed 106 militant attacks, the highest monthly figure in over 10 years, according to PICSS.
Operations were launched in Bajaur and North Waziristan, “resulting in partial clearance of militant hideouts, although the situation remains tense,” the think tank added.
Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, resulting in 52 deaths — 23 security personnel, 21 civilians, and eight militants. Another 45 people were wounded, including 23 security personnel and 22 civilians.
“Security forces eliminated 50 militants in the province — the highest number of militant deaths in operations since June 2015, when 60 were killed,” according to PICSS.
Sindh reported six attacks, leaving eight people dead — six civilians and two security personnel. Security forces arrested 11 suspected militants, all in Karachi.
In Punjab, two attacks occurred: a banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) assault in Dera Ghazi Khan, and an unsolved killing of a young cleric in Rawalpindi. resulting in the deaths of one civilian and one attacker.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, TTP-linked militants struck Chilas district, killing two security personnel and injuring one.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
The government labelled the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeking to improve counterterrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards.
Last week, the Balochistan government extended the enforcement of Section 144 across the province for another 15 days due to the prevailing law and order situation, according to an official notification from the additional chief secretary of the Home Department.
In March, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc from 2024 to 1,081.</p><small>2025-09-01 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0120321436ad4b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938953/israel-is-committing-genocide-in-gaza-scholars-association-says' target='_blank'><strong>Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, scholars’ association says</strong></a><br><p>The world’s biggest academic association of genocide scholars has passed a resolution saying the legal criteria have been met to establish that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, its president said on Monday.
Eighty-six per cent of those who voted among the 500-member International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) backed the resolution declaring Israel’s “policies and actions in Gaza” had met the legal definition set out in Article II of the 1948 UN Convention on genocide.
Israel launched its devastating assault on the Gaza Strip in October 2023, after fighters from Hamas attacked Israeli communities, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages. Since then, Israel’s military action has killed 63,000 people, damaged or destroyed most buildings in the territory and forced nearly all its residents to flee their homes at least once.
 
 

A global hunger monitor relied on by the United Nations says parts of the territory are now suffering a man-made famine, which Israel also denies.
The three-page resolution calls on Israel to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population”.
It also states that the Hamas attack on Israel, which precipitated the fighting, constituted international crimes.
“This is a definitive statement from experts in the field of genocide studies that what is going on on the ground in Gaza is genocide,” the association’s president, Melanie O’Brien, a professor of international law at the University of Western Australia who specialises in genocide, told Reuters.
“There is no justification for the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, not even self-defence,” she added.
Israel’s foreign ministry called the statement disgraceful and “entirely based on Hamas’ campaign of lies”. Israel has in the past strongly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and claims they are justified as self-defence. It is fighting a case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague that accuses it of genocide.
Convention adopted in wake of holocaust
The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, adopted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany, defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”. It requires all countries to act to prevent and stop genocide.
Since the genocide scholars’ association was founded in 1994, it has passed nine resolutions recognising historic or ongoing episodes as genocides.
The IAGS publishes a journal and holds regular international conferences of scholars studying genocide, and is considered the largest academic group in the field. Another group, the International Network of Genocide Scholars, also holds conferences and publishes a journal, but does not issue similar resolutions.
Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of the Gaza government media office, welcomed the resolution’s “prestigious scholarly stance”, which he said “places a legal and moral obligation on the international community to take urgent action to stop the crime, protect civilians, and hold the leaders of the occupation accountable”.
Sergey Vasiliev, a professor of international law at the Open University in the Netherlands who is not a member of the association, told Reuters the resolution showed that “this legal assessment has become mainstream within academia, particularly in the field of genocide studies”.
Several international rights groups and some Israeli NGOs have already accused Israel of committing genocide.
Last week, hundreds of UN staff at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk wrote to ask him to explicitly describe the Gaza conflict as an unfolding genocide, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.</p><small>2025-09-01 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01183932cf62e97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938949/sco-summit-adopts-joint-declaration-condemning-jaffar-khuzdar-pahalgam-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>SCO summit adopts joint declaration condemning Jaffar, Khuzdar, Pahalgam attacks</strong></a><br><p>The leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Monday adopted a statement condemning terrorism in Pakistan and India amid tense ties between the two nations that have seen allegations against each other for alleged involvement in militant attacks.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12.
On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
On April 22, assailants conducted an attack in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000.
In all three scenarios, both countries accused the other of having a role in the incident. The SCO defence ministers summit in June had failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal. According to The Times of India, New Delhi had refused to sign the document after it omitted a reference to the Pahalgam attack.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran.
The SCO summit of leaders is currently underway in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin. China’s President Xi Jinping hosted the two-day summit of SCO leaders as well as “SCO plus”, bringing together some 20 heads of state and government, besides leaders of international organisations. It was the largest gathering of the SCO as well as the fifth time hosted by China since the bloc was formed in 2001.
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably said: “Member states strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 2025.
“Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes. They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats.”
The declaration said the SCO members were committed to ensuring sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges and threats.
It added that they reaffirmed their determination to continue the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, arms smuggling and other forms of transnational organised crime.
They also signed the Agreement on the Universal Centre for Countering Challenges and Threats to the Security of SCO Member States and the Agreement on the SCO Anti-Drug Centre.
The member states also noted the proposal to establish a Centre for Strategic Studies in the field of security.
The declaration said the SCO members would continue to actively implement the Programme of Cooperation of SCO Member States in Countering Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism for 2025-2027.
“The member states strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stress that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable, and call on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists, with the central role of the United Nations, by fully implementing the relevant UN Security Council resolution and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in accordance with the UN Charter and the principles of international law, in order to jointly combat all terrorist organisations. They stress the importance of adopting by consensus a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.”
The leaders further adopted 24 documents to strengthen cooperation in security, economy and cultural exchanges.
They also adopted a 10-year SCO Development Strategy until 2035, which “defines the priority tasks and main directions for deepening multifaceted cooperation in the interests of ensuring peace and stability, development and prosperity in the SCO space”, read the joint statement.
Amid the US tariffs, which have roiled international markets, the SCO leaders expressed support for the multilateral trading system.
They also marked the 80th anniversary of World War II victory and of the founding of the UN, the declaration added.
‘SCO Partner’
The SCO also evolved from the “Shanghai Five” mechanism comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before Uzbekistan joined as the sixth member. Today, it included 10 member states, two observers and 14 dialogue partners across Asia, Europe and Africa.
The organisation covers approximately 24 per cent of global land area and 42pc of the world’s population, with member states accounting for roughly one-quarter of global GDP and trade increasing nearly 100-fold in two decades.
China’s trade with SCO members, observers and dialogue partners reached a record $890 billion in 2024, or 14.4pc of its total foreign trade.
At the Tianjin summit, the SCO member states decided to combine the statuses of “observer” and “dialogue partner” into a single status of “SCO Partner”.
Laos was accepted as a new “SCO Partner” at the Tianjin summit.
While the previous SCO leaders’ summit was held in Kazakhstan in July 2024, which saw 25 strategic documents — covering energy, security, finance and information security — adopted, China will pass on the SCO chairmanship to Kyrgyzstan and the next summit will be held under the slogan “25 years of the SCO: together towards sustainable peace, development and prosperity”.
Situation in Middle East and Afghanistan
Regarding the situation in the Middle East, the SCO leaders reiterated their deep concern over the continuing escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and strongly condemned actions that led to numerous casualties among the civilian population and a “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the Gaza Strip.
They stressed the need to ensure an immediate, complete and sustainable ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid, and intensified efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all residents of the region.
“Member states note that the only possible way to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East is through a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian question,” the declaration said.
It added that they also strongly condemned the military strikes by Israel and the United States against Iran in June, saying that such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including nuclear energy infrastructure, which resulted in the death of civilians, were a “gross violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter, and an infringement on the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran” that undermined regional and international security with serious implications for global peace and stability.
“They noted that the physical nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities must be ensured on a permanent basis, including during periods of armed conflict, in order to protect the population and the environment from harm. In this regard, they reaffirmed their commitment to diplomatic initiatives aimed at the peaceful resolution of the issues that have arisen.
“Member states reaffirmed the importance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015), emphasising that it is binding and must be implemented in full in accordance with its provisions, and consider that any attempts to interpret it arbitrarily undermine the authority of the UN Security Council.
“They called for the resumption of constructive dialogue between the parties involved and for a focus on jointly seeking solutions that would prevent further escalation of the situation,” the declaration said regarding Iran and its stalemate on nuclear talks.
On Afghanistan, the SCO members reaffirmed their commitment to the country’s establishment as an independent, neutral and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war and drugs, and expressed their readiness to support the efforts of the international community to ensure peace and development in the country.
“Member states reiterated that the formation of an inclusive government with broad participation of representatives of all ethno-political groups of Afghan society is the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the country,” the declaration said.</p><small>2025-09-01 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0119013783e4c23.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938946/trump-says-india-offered-to-reduce-tariffs-on-us-goods-to-nothing' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says India offered to reduce tariffs on US goods to nothing</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on US goods to zero amid deteriorating ties between the two countries.
While calling the US’s relationship with India “one-sided”, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “They have now offered to cut their tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago.”
The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to Trump’s comments, which follow the implementation of total duties as high as 50 per cent on Indian goods.
 


Relations between the two countries have plummeted, with 50pc levies on many Indian imports into the US taking effect last week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, a part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Since his return to the White House this year, Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
Amid this dispute, India has grown closer to Beijing and Moscow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Heads of State summit, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The latest tariff salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
Trump wants greater US access, while Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.
But analysts have cautioned that a 50pc duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewellery have already reported cancelled US orders and losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.</p><small>2025-09-01 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01165910c0ec672.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938927/afghan-cricket-board-calls-for-support-from-business-community-for-quake-victims' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Cricket Board calls for support from business community for quake victims</strong></a><br><p>The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) on Monday called for support from the country’s business community for victims of the earthquake that killed at least 800 people and left more than 2,500 injured.
The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27km from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
“The (ACB) calls upon all national businessmen, traders [and] rich countrymen to extend their support to the affected families of Kunar and other eastern provinces in this dire situation, while also recognising its own responsibility in this regard,” the governing body said in a statement on X.
 






“The leadership of the ACB, along with all the players and staff, express its deepest sorrow over the loss of lives and casualties caused by the severe earthquake in the eastern provinces, particularly in Kunar.
“In this time of immense grief, we consider ourselves united with all our people.”
It added that the earthquake had caused many deaths and affected many others, saying it was “truly a great calamity”.
The board said it stood in solidarity with the bereaved families of Kunar and all the eastern provinces and “extends heartfelt condolences and sympathies to them during this difficult time”.
The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from capital Kabul to Islamabad. After the initial quake, a series of at least five aftershocks followed throughout the night, with the strongest being one of magnitude 5.2 just after 4am (4:30am PKT).
More than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking, according to the USGS.
Near the epicentre in the east of Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,500 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. Another 12 people were killed and 255 were injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, he added.
“Numerous houses were destroyed,” interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.
The majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes that are vulnerable to collapse.
Minute of silence in Tri-series match
A minute of silence will be held today before the start of the UAE-Afghanistan T20I Tri-series match at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
“The Emirates Cricket Board joins the Afghanistan Cricket Board in offering sympathies and condolences to the victims of the tragic earthquake,” the Emirati board said in a post on X.
 






Zalmi Foundation pledges Rs10m for quake victims
The chairman of the Zalmi Foundation, Javed Afridi, pledged Rs10m to support those struck by the calamity, saying he was “heartbroken by the devastation of the earthquake in Afghanistan”.
“So many lives lost, families shattered, and loved ones in pain. Our prayers are with our Afghan brothers and sisters in these tough times,” he added.

PM Shehbaz arrived in China on Saturday to attend the SCO Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit held from August 31 to September 1. Besides Pakistan, the SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
“We respect all international and bilateral treaties and expect similar principles to be followed by all SCO members,” PM Shehbaz said at the summit today, in an apparent reference to fellow SCO member India and its unilateral move to hold the IWT in abeyance in April.
“Uninterrupted access to due share of water as per existing treaties among SCO members will strengthen the SCO working smoothly and will support the achievement of broader goals for which the SCO was established,” he stressed at the summit in China’s Tianjin.
 
 

India held the IWT in abeyance following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
Earlier this month, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz called for a “comprehensive and structural dialogue to discuss all outstanding disputes”, adding: “I will request your consideration to lead this dialogue under your sagacious leadership so that they can have its dividends as early as possible.”
The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan sought a “normal and stable relationship with all its neighbours”. “It seeks dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz noted: “Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism. And yet, to our shock and deep disappointment, the region witnessed extremely disturbing developments during the last few months.
“Pakistan supports and respects the sovereignty and integrity of all SCO members and its neighbours,” he added.
 


“We will continue our efforts, along with all SCO members and the chairman of SCO, to promote progress and prosperity in the entire region and to ensure lasting peace in South Asia,” PM Shehbaz pledged.
“Pakistan has always abided by the UN and SCO charters and will always respect the principles that will hold dear to all of us for our collective good. As a peace-loving nation, Pakistan has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy, consultation over confrontation,” he reiterated.
During his address, the premier also highlighted the severe floods that Pakistan was once again facing.
“My country is once again passing through unprecedented torrential rains, cloudbursts and massive devastation due to consequent flooding in three of our major rivers,” PM Shehbaz said, highlighting huge loss of lives and livestock, as well as severe damage to infrastructure and crops.
 
 

“We deeply appreciate the international community’s, including China’s, solidarity, sympathy and support with us,” he said, hailing the rescue and rebuilding efforts of “my brave and resilient people”.
At the outset of his speech, the prime minister noted that the port city of Tianjin, where the summit is taking place, represented “China’s core values as a connector and bridge of cultures and civilisation”.
He thanked President Xi and his government for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements for the SCO gathering. The premier also extended his felicitations to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan on their national days today and yesterday, respectively.
PM Shehbaz further said: “For us, the SCO is a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration. China’s successful tenure as chair of the SCO is reflective of President Xi’s sagacious and visionary leadership.”
He stressed that China’s “global leadership” was exemplified not only through the bloc but also in landmark initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
‘Irrefutable evidence of foreign hands in terrorism on Pakistani soil’
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz also highlighted the issue of terrorism and said Pakistan had “irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands” in the Jaffar Express hijacking in March.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of at least 26 passengers, including 18 security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.
“We have irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident, as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and KP provinces of Pakistan,” the premier said at the summit.
“Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interests must know that the world no longer buys this fictitious narrative.”
 
 

Days after the hijacking, the military spokesperson had said India was the main sponsor “in this terrorist incident in Balochistan and others before”. In April, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations had also said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.
At the SCO summit, the prime minister noted: “The menace of terrorism, separatism, [and] extremism continues to pose a grave threat to Pakistan and endanger peace and security of the entire SCO region and the SCO family.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with the fullest force at our command, including state terrorism in clear and ambiguous terms,” he added.
Recalling the country’s “great sacrifices in combating terrorism not only for its own self but for the region and far beyond”, PM Shehbaz reiterated that Pakistan had lost over 90,000 valuable lives and endured economic losses of over $152 billion.
“A sacrifice which has no parallel in history,” the premier said, adding that there “cannot be a bigger manifestation of our unwavering commitment to defeat terrorism with the cooperation of all SCO members and global powers around the globe”.
Afghanistan and regional connectivity
The prime minister also voiced Pakistan’s desire for a “peaceful and stable” Afghanistan, noting that it was not only in Islamabad’s interest but that of the entire region.
“While we remain engaged in building our ties with the Afghan leadership to leverage them as economic partners and good neighbours, we hope that this cooperation with Afghanistan and our trilateral meetings between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan will have positive results in times to come,” Shehbaz said.
 
 

“As SCO leaders, we have reaffirmed year after year the significance of enhanced regional connectivity. This requires efficient land, air and rail transport corridors to ensure the reliability of supply chains,” he stressed.
The premier asserted that the expansion of CPEC could serve as a “practical demonstration of SCO’s vision for regional connectivity and economic integration”.
‘Heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza’
During his address, PM Shehbaz also condemned Israel’s deadly attacks on Iran in June this year and its “heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza”.
“Israel’s unjustified aggression against our fellow brotherly member country Iran, a fellow SCO state, is condemnable and therefore unacceptable,” the prime minister said.
 
 

“The suffering and starvation unfolding in Gaza is a festering wound on our collective conscience. We reiterate our call for an immediate end to gruesome violence and heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza,” the premier said.
He underscored that Pakistan has consistently supported the UN-mandated two-state solution, which meant the creation of an independent state of Palestine with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Meetings with SCO leaders
PM Shehbaz also held meetings with fellow SCO leaders on the summit’s sidelines.
 






Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condoled the prime minister on the ongoing floods in Pakistan and expressed his country’s support.
 






The two also reviewed the state of cooperation across diverse sectors and expressed satisfaction with the positive momentum in bilateral relations.

Surrounded by mountains, Afghanistan is prone to earthquakes as it sits near the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, a highly active seismic zone.
Many of the recent quakes have had shallow depths, which increased the intensity of shaking on the surface and destruction.
Here is a timeline of major earthquakes that struck the country since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 and before.
August 31, 2025: A 6.0 magnitude earthquake shook eastern Kunar province, killing more than 800 people and injuring more than 2,000 others, and flattening hundreds of houses and buildings.

October 7, 2023: A 6.3 magnitude earthquake and subsequent aftershocks in Herat province killed more than 2,000 people and injured more than 9,000. The earthquake was the country’s deadliest in years.
March 21, 2023: A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the northeastern province of Badakhshan, killing at least 13 people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
September 5, 2022: At least eight people were killed after tremors hit Kunar province, causing dozens of houses to collapse.

June 22, 2022: A shallow, 6.1-magnitude earthquake in the eastern provinces of Paktika, Paktia, Khost, and Nangarhar killed at least 1,036 people and caused thousands of homes to collapse.
January 17, 2022: A 5.9 magnitude shallow earthquake in the western province of Badghis killed at least 26 people.
Oct 26, 2015: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake, one of the most powerful quakes in the country’s history, killed 399 in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to NIH, the latest case was detected in a 20-month-old infant in the southern KP’s Tank district, taking the province’s total tally to 16. Fifteen of them have been detected in southern KP, according to the NIH.
Last week, the KP government launched a polio immunisation campaign, with emphasis on the south of the province, where polio teams faced the most resistance.
The latest case has taken the total cases recorded in 2025 to 24, according to NIH — including 16 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Noting the prevalence of polio in the south of KP, the NIH said, “A comprehensive strategic Roadmap for Polio eradication in Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been developed and finalised.
“The plan incorporates microplanning innovations, gap analyses, and targeted strategies and interventions to address persistent challenges,” it added.
To deal with growing cases in the region, NIH stated that a campaign will be carried out in the south of the province — set to run from September 15 to 18.
Part of an immunisation campaign announced last week, the three-day drive aims to target Bannu, Bajaur and seven districts of the Dera Ismail Khan division.
In its statement, the NIH appealed to parents to cooperate with polio teams and complete their child’s immunisation course.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01145443e11c73e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938911/thousands-protest-in-indonesia-as-military-deployed-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands protest in Indonesia as military deployed in capital</strong></a><br><p>Thousands rallied across Indonesia on Monday as the military was deployed in the capital after six people were killed in nationwide protests sparked by anger over lavish perks for lawmakers.
At least 500 protesters gathered outside the nation’s parliament in Jakarta on Monday afternoon as dozens of police officers watched on. Soldiers were present earlier but left after several hours.
Thousands more rallied in Palembang on Sumatra island and hundreds gathered separately in Banjarmasin on Borneo island, Yogyakarta on the main island of Java and Makassar on Sulawesi island, according to AFP journalists around the country.
“Our main goal is to reform the parliament. We hope the parliament will come out and meet us. We want to talk to them directly, they are our representatives,” protester and university student Nafta Keisya Kemalia, 20, told AFP outside parliament.
“Do they want to wait until we have a martial law?”
The deadly protests, which began last week over MP housing allowances nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta, have forced President Prabowo Subianto and parliament leaders to make a U-turn over the measures.
Demonstrations began peacefully, but turned violent against the nation’s elite paramilitary police unit after footage showed one of its teams running over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan late on Thursday.
Protests have since spread from Jakarta to other major cities, in the worst unrest since Prabowo took power.
 


Police set up checkpoints across the capital today, while officers and the military conducted city-wide patrols and deployed snipers in key locations. While the usually traffic-clogged streets were quieter than usual.
Hundreds of soldiers were camped at the city’s national monument, and some were stationed outside the presidential palace, according to an AFP journalist.
At least one group, the Alliance of Indonesian Women, said late last night that it had cancelled its planned protest because of heightened security.
Schools and universities in Jakarta were holding classes online until at least Tuesday, and civil servants based in the city were asked to work from home.
On Monday, Prabowo paid a visit to the injured police at a hospital where he criticised protesters.
“The law states that if you want to demonstrate, you must ask for permission, and permission must be granted, and it must end at 6pm,” he said.
Looting
Experts said Prabowo’s U-turn in a speech on Sunday and parliament’s gesture to revoke some lawmaker perks may not be enough to dispel the unrest.
“The Indonesian government is a mess. The cabinet and parliament will not listen to the people’s pleas,” 60-year-old snack seller Suwardi, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told AFP near parliament.
“We have always been lied to. That’s why people are always angry. Because they never met our demands.”
The Indonesian stock index fell more than three per cent at the open on Monday after the weekend unrest rattled markets.
Deep-rooted anger against police drove protests on Friday after footage of the van hitting Affan went viral. Seven officers were detained for investigation.
On Monday, Agus Wijayanto, head of the accountability bureau at the National Police, told reporters an investigation had found criminal acts committed by two officers — the driver of the van and the officer next to him.
They “could be dishonourably discharged”, said Agus, adding their ethics trial would take place on Wednesday.
The crisis has prompted Prabowo to cancel a trip to China this week for a military parade commemorating the end of World War II.
The finance minister’s house was pillaged overnight on Saturday, and several lawmakers have reportedly had their houses ransacked.
At least three people were killed after a fire on Friday started by protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar, while a fourth was killed by a mob in the city in a case of mistaken identity. Another confirmed victim was a student in Yogyakarta, who died in clashes.
In anticipation of further unrest, TikTok on Saturday suspended its live feature for “a few days” in Indonesia, where it has more than 100 million users.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01153137ae8b983.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938916/catastrophic-rains-floods-to-trigger-food-shortages-in-pakistan-warns-un' target='_blank'><strong>Catastrophic rains, floods to trigger food shortages in Pakistan, warns UN</strong></a><br><p>The ongoing torrential rains and surging floods have inundated large swaths of farmlands and destroyed ready-to-reap crops across Pakistan, triggering fears of a food crisis and inflation, the UN and growers warned on Monday.
The raging floods struck the northeastern Punjab, the country’s largest province and food basket, last week, submerging hundreds of villages, schools and health centres, washing away livestock and destroying crops, aside from killing around 50 people and triggering evacuations.
The surging floods have so far affected more than 2 million people, in addition to the evacuation of more than 700,000 people, according to official statistics.
The water is flowing further south to fall into the mighty Indus River and is feared to wreak havoc on Sindh in the coming days.
“This isn’t normal — yet it’s becoming the new normal. Monsoons, driven by climate change, now bring fear and devastation to communities across Pakistan,” Mo Yahya, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said in a post on X, after visiting the flood-hit areas.
 






“Flooded rice fields stretch as far as the eye can see. Farmers now face months without crops or income until the next planting season,” he said, while posting a video of flooded farmlands in Hafizabad district.
 






“This is only the beginning — more intense rains are expected in the coming weeks. As the water flows further south, it will threaten more families with displacement and destruction,” Yahya added.
“This is not just another natural disaster; this is climate change.”
Endorsing the warning, Waqar Ahmad, the secretary general of Kisan Board of Pakistan, a nationwide farmers body, said that the catastrophic floods have destroyed the three main crops of rice, sugarcane and sesame (oil-rich seeds) across Punjab.
“Rice crop has particularly taken a toll as the floods have hit the major rice-producing districts,” Rizvi told Anadolu.
According to him, 70 per cent of the standing rice crop has been destroyed by the latest floods.
 
 

He cautioned that if neighbouring India releases another deluge of floodwaters towards Pakistan, the remaining amounts of the standing crops will be badly affected.
Waheed Ahmad, the head of Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exports Association, fears that the latest floods would likely cause food inflation as massive deluges have destroyed huge amounts of crops and vegetables across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He urged the government to lift the levy on vegetable and fruit imports from Afghanistan and Iran to cope with the looming food shortages.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01140447b3261c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938904/un-sets-up-pakistani-network-to-curb-human-trafficking-enhance-migration-governance' target='_blank'><strong>UN sets up Pakistani network to curb ‘human trafficking’, enhance ‘migration governance’</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations on Monday launched a network on migration in Pakistan in a bid to improve migration governance and tackle human trafficking in the country, according to a UN press release.
Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities. A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.
The network, called — Pakistan United Nations Network on Migration (UNNM) — was inaugurated at a ceremony in Islamabad and aims to develop a “unified, collaborative approach to migration governance”, the press release said.
The UNNM will focus on “responding to the interconnected challenges of human trafficking and migrant smuggling” within international frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs) and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM).
The GCM is “the first intergovernmental agreement to cover all dimensions of international migration,” according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
In light of the network, Pakistan’s first Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund programme (MMPTF) was formed, with special emphasis on combating Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in Pakistan.
The IOM describes Trafficking in Persons as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion.”
While Smuggling of Migrants means “materially profiting by procuring another person’s illegal border crossing”, according to the IOM.
 
 

Established to support the implementation of GCM, the initiative will be run “jointly by IOM and UNODC in collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, the private sector, the media, and civil society,” the press release said.
Speaking at the ceremony, UN Resident Coordinator Mohamed Yahya, who was also the host of the event, said, “The establishment of this network is a testament to our collective resolve to ensure that migration is safe, orderly, and regular.”
Mohamed Yahya was appointed as the network’s chair.
He went on to say that the establishment of a network “provides a crucial platform to shift the narrative on migration, amplify a unified voice, and foster the innovation needed to address complex challenges related to mobility and protecting the rights of all people on the move”.
As per the press release, the MMPTF will employ a “whole of government” and “a whole of society” approach to tackle human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and improve the methods of migration governance.
“Life makes us move. But journeys, either from our home to new destinations or back to our country, should become easier, more dignified,” said Moazzam Ali, a Pakistani migrant who voluntarily returned to Pakistan from Romania.
“The network will leverage partnerships across the UN system to promote policy coherence and integrate migration policies into the broader development goals,” the press release added.
Head of the UN Migration Network Secretariat Jonathan Prentice, who joined the meeting via video, congratulated Pakistan on playing a role in the “global collective to help improve migration governance in the world”.
The ceremony featured a panel discussion as well, titled — ‘Enhancing whole-of-government migration governance in the age of complex mobility dynamics and emerging global challenges’ — with panellists including representatives from governmental departments.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/011108231e00b7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938881/crew-of-5-dead-as-army-helicopter-crashes-in-gbs-chilas-due-to-technical-fault-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Crew of 5 dead as army helicopter crashes in GB’s Chilas due to ‘technical fault’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A crew of five died on Monday after an army helicopter crashed in Diamer District’s Chilas town in Gilgit-Baltistan after developing a “technical fault”, the military’s media wing said in a statement.

It added that all crew members on board were martyred as a result of the crash.
The crew members were identified as Major Atif, who was the pilot in command, Major Faisal, the co-pilot, flight engineer Naib Subedar Maqbool, and crew chiefs Havaldar Jahangir and Naik Amir, according to the ISPR.
Earlier, Diamer Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, in a statement, had confirmed the incident, saying that the helicopter was conducting a test landing on a newly proposed helipad when it crashed.
He said that the Diamer police and rescue teams had reached the incident site to start the evacuation.
Separately, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in a statement, said he had issued directions to impose an emergency at Chilas Hospital and ordered the immediate availability of medical staff.
He also expressed his condolences and paid tribute to the martyred personnel. “The sacrifice of the martyrs of the helicopter crash is a source of pride for the nation,” he said.
Earlier this month, a rescue helicopter crashed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, killing two pilots and three crew members. The helicopter was dispatched with supplies following flash flooding in the region.
In 2024, at least six people died and eight others were critically injured after a helicopter of a petroleum company crashed near the Shewa oil field in North Waziristan.</p><small>2025-09-01 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0110420799f249f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938766/flood-prone-housing-schemes-along-ravi-rife-with-irregularities' target='_blank'><strong>‘Flood-prone’ housing schemes along Ravi rife with irregularities</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The area declared as “prone to floods” by the Punjab irrigation department is rife with violation of rules and regulations, absence of requisite infrastructure as well as weak enforcement led to the massive devastation in private housing schemes along a long stretch of River Ravi in Lahore.
The rules defined for the approval of private housing schemes by various authorities are either not being implemented or enforced when it comes to the area prone to floods.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda).
There is also a disparity in the approval mechanism between different authorities, especially Ruda. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) follows the Private Housing Scheme Rules 2014 (updated), under which (rule-7) says the land proposed for any housing scheme or land subdivision cannot be approved if it doesn’t fulfill certain requirements. One of them is that the land must be out of the flood-prone area. The tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) also follow the same rules in areas within their jurisdictions.

Disparity muddies the water in different authorities’ approval mechanisms

But on the other hand, Ruda — an authority having territorial jurisdiction carved out in 2020 by the then PTI-led government covering a 46km stretch along the river with 132,000 acres and 960 sq-km land — interprets its Ruda Private Housing Scheme Rules 2021 differently. However, it has the same conditions for the approval of housing schemes as the LDA or TMAs.
 
 

“It is very confusing that Ruda may accord approval to housing schemes in flood-prone zones without an NOC from the irrigation department. But the LDA and TMAs don’t approve schemes if its land exists in flood-prone regions identified by the irrigation department,” wonders an official source in the Punjab government.
The recent flooding in various housing schemes approved by Ruda shows that if its own rules were followed in true letter and spirit, the massive devastation seen in various approved and unapproved housing schemes could have been averted.
“I think Ruda’s focus is on approving and regulating housing schemes instead of on one of its most important jobs i.e. building river training works, embankments, barrages, river channelisation among others. In my opinion, Ruda should have developed the aforementioned infrastructure first and then accorded approval to housing schemes,” deplores an officer, who requested not to be named.
“I am really surprised as to how the housing schemes in Ruda, which already exist in the flood plains as per the irrigation department, can be developed,” he said. He also criticised LDA and TMA for keeping mum on the mushroom growth of housing schemes, mostly illegal, in the flood-prone areas near Ravi before the existence of Ruda. “Why had the LDA and TMAs failed to stop such malpractice?” he questioned.
However, an LDA officer, on the condition of anonymity, claimed the authority had taken stern action against illegal housing schemes. “We took very serious action against various housing schemes in the past. These included declining approval for illegally extending portion of a housing scheme on the Multan Road. Similarly, we carried out several demolition operations in another illegal housing scheme near Chuhng on Multan Road,” he argued.
A spokesperson of Ruda, when contacted, said, “Ruda, having land in Lahore and Sheikhupura, inherited as many as 103 illegal housing schemes and land subdivisions from LDA and the TMAs. Besides these there were some other schemes that already had approval for a phase or the initial piece of land measuring 100, 200, 300 kanals, but hadn’t obtained approval for their extensions. Such societies developed extensions unlawfully that showed weak enforcement by their then regulators”.
When asked about development of housing schemes in the area prone to flooding, he claimed that the ongoing river training works and embankments would completely eliminate the risks of floods. He said the authority also bound developers to ensure construction of flood protection embankments on their before giving them the final approval.
On the question of giving approvals to housing schemes without the NOC from the irrigation department, the spokesman said, “There is no need for an NOC from the irrigation department as the authority gives approval as per its master plan that guarantees safeguards from floods.”
The spokesperson said that despite Ruda inheriting already existing housing schemes, its teams were doing their best to regulate all of them. Several illegally developed schemes have huge populations that could not be relocated due to various legal, administrative and livelihood issues.
When asked why Ruda focused on according approvals instead of focusing on quickly completing river training works to mitigate floods, he said that the river training works had already been completed in a 7km area onward from Ravi Syphon. He claimed, “You can see that wherever we completed our works, the flood didn’t affect anyone”. The fees received from housing scheme developers were being spent on the ongoing development works in Ravi, he added.
To another question, he said enforcement teams had carried out several operations in the Ruda project area against illegal housing schemes. He claimed that when Ruda’s flood adaptation work was completed, the remaining area would be completely safe.
Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, who has been under fire after his housing scheme — the ParkView Housing society — was flooded from Ravi, released a video on social media on the issue. He said that he acquired the housing scheme through a bank auction in 2010 along with all the NOCs and approvals from relevant government bodies, including LDA as Ruda was established later.
 






He also criticised Ruda for not completing the barrages, embankments and other protective structures in the area. He said that it was Ruda’s responsibility to safeguard the area from floods. He said the authority charged housing societies for building protective structures.
He claimed that despite collecting all the charges, Ruda had not made a single road, embankment, lake or barrage in the area.According to former LDA chief engineer Dr Habib ul Haq Randhawa, who also specialises in environmental sciences, river routes whether old or new should not be blocked through urban development, commercial regeneration or for any purpose whatsoever. During normal flow, he said, a river could be temporarily diverted with the help of embankments.
“But extreme flooding will damage such structures, besides increasing the intensity of the flood. Therefore, we should refrain from all kind of developments in the river-influenced areas which are prone to flooding even only once a decade,” Dr Randhawa said while talking to Dawn.
“In the river routes adjacent to cities, a delicate relationship exists between humans and the ecosystem. Government agencies should only allow sustainable town planning having the least impact on the river ecosystem and its flow,” he said.
He suggested to conduct a comprehensive report delineating each riverbed and flood influence. He said intensive plantation should be done in the vacant riverbeds as it curbed flash flooding from the rivers. “The riverbeds must have margins wide enough to grow and shrink without endangering the population. Native vegetation and classic riparian forests should be grown there. These steps help to reduce the waterflow and flooding,” Mr Randhawa said.

The 13th edition of the women’s showpiece 50-over tournament will begin on Sept 30. Pakistan is set to play its matches in Sri Lanka following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, which resulted in a “hybrid model” being decided upon.
The overall prize money at the eight-team marquee tournament totals $13.88 million — a monumental rise of 297 per cent from $3.5m at the last edition held in New Zealand in 2022, ICC said in a statement.
The total prize pot eclipses that at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup from two years ago in India, which had total prize money of $10 million.
“The announcement aligns with ICC’s strategy to amplify the growth of women’s cricket and a decision to introduce pay parity was announced ahead of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024,” ICC said.
 






The winners of the 13th edition of the Women’s Cricket World Cup will receive prize money of $4.48 million — a 239pc increase from the $1.32m awarded to Australia in 2022.
“Meanwhile, the runners-up will receive $2.24m, an increase of 273pc in comparison to the $600,000 England won three years ago. The two losing semi-finalists will take home $1.12m (up from $300,000 in 2022) each.
Each group stage participant is guaranteed to earn $250,000 while each group-stage win will get the victors $34,314.
In the second half of the final table, the teams finishing fifth and sixth will take home $700,000 each and those in seventh and eighth place will earn $280,000.
“This announcement marks a defining milestone in the journey of women’s cricket,“ ICC Chairman Jay Shah said.
“This four-fold increase in prize money is a landmark moment for women’s cricket and reflects our clear commitment to its long-term growth.

“Our message is simple, women cricketers must know they will be treated on par with men if they choose this sport professionally.

“The uplift underscores our ambition to deliver a world-class ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup and to inspire the next generation of players and fans.
“Women’s cricket is on a remarkable upward trajectory, and with this step we are confident the momentum will accelerate.
“We call upon all stakeholders, fans, media, partners, and Member Boards, to join us in championing the women’s game and ensuring it receives the recognition and respect it deserves.”</p><small>2025-09-01 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/010926477b814f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938837/pakistan-suspends-mail-to-us-amid-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan suspends mail to US amid tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: More than 25 countries of the world, including Pakistan, have temporarily suspended mail delivery to the United States after the US imposed new taxes and duties.
Because of this situation, the Pakistan Post has also stopped delivering booked mail to the US because it fears it will be returned under the new US rules.
The US government has suspended the previous duty-free facility under an executive order number 14324 on July 25. The US move has severely affected postal communications to the US worldwide because now all types of mail delivery to the US will have to pay duties and taxes under the new system.
 
 

All major countries of the world, including China, the UK, Japan. Austria, Australia, New Zealand, India, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, have temporarily stopped mail delivery to the US because airlines have also shown their inability to deliver mail.
The countries hit by the US move have taken up the matter with the US through the Universal Postal Union, a UN agency, which is taking steps to resolve the dispute.
