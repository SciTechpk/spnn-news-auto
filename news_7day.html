While KWSC Chief Operating Officer Asadullah Khan had on Thursday said that the repair work would be completed by Saturday night, a water utility spokesman said that the repair work was still in progress and would be completed by Sunday (today).
The leakage in the main supply line wreaked havoc on Karachi University and nearby housing societies. It also caused an acute water shortage in several areas of the metropolis.
 
 

Officials said that the city required over 1,200 million gallons of water daily and it was getting 400 MGD, out of a regular supply of 650MGD, due to the repair work on the Siphon No 19.
The KWSC spokesman said that the water would be released to the Siphon No 19 after the completion of the repair work. The water pumped from the Dhabeji Pumping Station usually took 14 to 16 hours to reach the city’s distribution network, he added.

“100 per cent of samples of tea leaves and 90 per cent of milk samples collected in different areas have been found adulterated and contaminated with chemicals and added colours,” the officials added.
Speaking to Dawn on Saturday, they said that the SFA had recently inspected as many as 127 tea shops and stalls in different parts of Karachi to collect samples of the two major ingredients of the aromatic beverage prepared by boiling water, milk, sugar and cured leaves.
Their analysis showed that all of them were using contaminated and adulterated tea leaves, while only 10 per cent were using pure milk, they added.

Food Authority says milk was adulterated with detergent, carbonates, salt and water

They said that 80 per cent samples of the milk collected from 127 tea shops were found adulterated with different chemicals, while 10 per cent had water adulteration.
The sources added that the milk samples were found adulterated and contaminated with detergent, carbonates, salt, sugar, skimmed milk and added water.
They said, tea leaves in all 110 inspected tea stalls and shops were also found adulterated and contaminated.
SFA Director General Asif Jan Siddiqui said that the collected samples of the milk and tea leaves were examined by the collaborated laboratory of the SFA and the University of Karachi.
He said the authority had planned a strict action against the use of adulterated and contaminated ingredients of tea — a popular hot drink throughout the world. “Strict action will be taken against those involved in the supply and business of the adulterated milk and tea leaves,” he added.
Mr Siddiqui said that the drive against the use of adulterated ingredients in chai had been launched in all seven districts of the city and all 127 samples of the tea leaves contained polyphenols, a low-cost material found in different plants and used by manufactures and supplies to increase profit.
The SFA chief said that tea adulteration with other plants negatively impacts health, potentially leading to digestive issues and other complications.
He said that the adulterants diluted the natural polyphenol content of the tea, affecting its quality.
The officials said that the tea shops and stalls were selected in different localities across the city. The areas included Clifton, Saddar, Burns Road, old city areas, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area, Gulshan Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Korangi, Shah Faisal, SITE, Keamari and Malir.
The district-wise report of the samples, available with Dawn, said that only 10 per cent sample were found adulterated with added water and did not have any other adulterants.
 
 

According to the district-wise break-up of the collected samples, he said that as many as 43 samples of milk were taken from as many shops in district South and 19 of them were found adulterated.
Nine out of 16 samples collected in Korangi were detected adulterated, 10 out of 20 in Malir, five out of 16 in East, six out of 13 in Keamari, three out of seven in West and two out of 12 samples in district Central.
Alarmingly, all 110 samples of tea leaves in seven districts were found adulterated with polyphenols.
Of them, 43 were taken in district South, 16 in Korangi, three in West, 13 in Keamari, 16 each in East and Malir and three in district Central.

The authorities were using a private van to transport prisoners; the driver and the vehicle were released by the gunmen.
Officials said that a police team was shifting 10 prisoners to Quetta and the central jail in Mach from Gadani jail.
 
 

When the wagon reached the Mangocher area of the Kalat district in late evening, the armed men were blocking the national highway and inspecting every vehicle, including buses and trucks.
After they came across the prison van, they freed the prisoners and kidnapped five police personnel, who were guarding the van, along with their official weapons.
Two police personnel dressed in plainclothes, however, remained safe.
The prisoners included one condemned prisoner who was awarded a death sentence and another was awarded life imprisonment and both were tried for killing their wives. Other prisoners allegedly involved in drug smuggling were coming to Quetta for their case hearing on May 5.
Officials said that security forces had launched a search operation in the hilly area of Mongochar and the surrounding areas to recover the hostages. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.

An official statement issued here said that Mr Saif met deputy head of the US Embassy in Islamabad where both sides discussed the tense situation between Pakistan and India following the ‘false flag’ operation in Pahalgam.
The discussions also covered regional peace, law and order, and the political climate at both national and provincial levels, the statement said, adding that Mr Saif strongly condemned India’s baseless allegations post-Pahalgam and highlighted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war-mongering behaviour.
The statement said that the KP government’s spokesperson briefed the US diplomat on ‘politically-motivated’ and ‘fabricated’ cases against political prisoners, including PTI founding chairman Imran Khan. 
The two sides also discussed development issues in the province, especially in the merged districts.
Mr Saif stated that the KP government was specially focusing on development of the merged areas, and emphasised that the provincial government was investing heavily in improving law and order, education, and health sectors for the welfare of the people.
The US diplomat appreciated the provincial government’s initiatives for public welfare and assured full cooperation from the United States, the statement said.

• GB lawmakers call for RTI law in region
ISLAMABAD: The opposition party, PTI, has accused the government of harassing journalists and viewing the freedom of expression as a “threat”.
In a statement issued on World Press Freedom Day, the party claimed dozens of journalists have been harassed, abducted or targeted with false cases over the past year.
“Incidents like the martyrdom of renowned journalist Arshad Sharif stand as clear examples of the choking of independent journalism,” the PTI said, while referring to the journalist killed in Kenya in 2022 before the incumbent government came into power.
 
 

“In addition, prominent journalists such as Kashif Abbasi, Arif Hameed Bhatti, Habib Akram, Paras Jahanzeb and many others “who dared to speak the truth” have been deprived of their livelihoods,” said the PTI information secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, in an apparent reference to news anchors taken off air during the past few months.
Mr Akram expressed concern over the press freedom in Pakistan which was “currently under severe state repression, censorship, and retaliatory actions”.
Pakistan dropped to 158th spot (out of 180 countries) on the 2025 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. This was only marginally one point lower than 2022 — the last year of PTI’s government — when Pakistan ranked 157th.
Mr Akram alleged the current government has imposed “strict restrictions” on digital and social media.
 
 

He said pro-PTI YouTube channels and X accounts were being shut down while “journalists who speak the truth” were either being forced to leave the country or removed from their jobs.
The PTI leader questioned why senior journalists were being targeted for disagreeing with the government’s narrative and why despite court orders, there was an “undeclared ban on covering PTI or even mentioning Imran Khan’s name” on TV? He also demanded the restoration of X in Pakistan.
RTI law for GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan, government and opposition lawmakers highlighted the challenges faced by journalists in the region and called for the Right of Access to Information (RTI) law.
At an event held at the Central Press Club Gilgit in connection with the World Press Freedom Day on Saturday, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed said the assembly will play its role in formulating laws to facilitate journalists.
“The Right to Information Act submitted in the GB Assembly will be approved after necessary amendments.”
Speaking on the occasion, the president of PPP GB chapter, Amjad Hussain Advocate, said journalists in the region were facing more challenges than their counterparts in other parts of the country.
 
 

Special Assistant to GB Chief Minister on Information Iman Shah said the approval of the proposed media and digital media policy was being deliberately delayed. He said Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarrar has assured of steps for the betterment of the media industry and journalists.
Member of the Assembly and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Information Javed Manwa said the RTI Act has been submitted to the assembly, but no progress has been made on it yet.
He clarified that without the legislation, there will be risks of disinformation and misinformation.
Representatives of journalists’ bodies also spoke about their issues. They said the RTI Act needed to be implemented after approval from the assembly.
They said the GB government was using advertisements “as a weapon to suppress the voice of journalists and media houses” in the region.
Later, journalists took a rally from the Central Press Club to Chinarbagh to demand in favour of their demands.
Separately, the newly elected Central Press Club Gilgit cabinet members also took their oath on Saturday.
Speaker Ahmed administered the oath to newly elected President Tahir Rana, General Secretary Wajahat Ali, Senior Vice President Imtiaz Ali Sultan, Vice President Saadat Ali, Finance Secretary Nadeem Khan and Joint Secretary Syed Sher Abbas.

Tensions between the nuclear-armed countries have soared since the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir in which 26 people were killed on April 22.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his military “full operational freedom” to respond while Islamabad earlier this week warned they had “credible intelligence” that India was planning imminent strikes.
 
 

High season in the cooler climes of the Neelum Valley, the tourist centre of AJK, begins in May as temperatures around the rest of the country rise.
“It’s been a really bad start,” said Muhammad Awais, a 22-year-old photographer at a popular picnic spot.

Tourism drives Neelum Valley’s economy, attracting 300,000 visitors annually

Tourism is the Neelum Valley’s lifeline, drawing over 300,000 visitors each year from all over Pakistan, according to the district administration.
Much of the local population depends on roughly 350 guesthouses, which employ thousands of families.
“Our livelihoods depend on tourism, and without it, we suffer,” Awais told AFP.
“The way things are unfolding is very slow, and it’s affecting our work badly.” This week police and soldiers at army checkpoints barred tourists from entering the valley, allowing only local residents through the checkpoint.
Tourists were instead told to return to the main town of Muzaffarabad.
“It’s extremely disappointing that the government did not warn us or advise against visiting,” said Saleem Uddin Siddique, who travelled from the capital Islamabad with his family. “Our hopes are now dashed,” the 69-year-old retired accountant said.
‘We don’t want war’
Islamabad has denied any involvement in last month’s attack at Pahalgam and the uneasy neighbours have issued a raft of tit-for-tat punitive diplomatic measures.
The two South Asian nations have exchanged gunfire for nine consecutive nights along the militarised Line of Control, according to Indian defence sources.
 
 

International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to settle their differences through talks.
On India’s heavily fortified border, residents of farming villages along the Chenab river have sent families back from the frontier, recalling the terror of the last major conflict between the two nations in 1999.
There has been an exodus of tourists on the Indian side of the border too since the Pahalgam attack.
Indian authorities have heavily promoted the region as a holiday destination, both for skiing in winter and to escape the sweltering heat of the summer.
The AJK government has ordered religious schools to close and urged residents to stockpile food. However, some tourists continued to arrive undeterred.

“We don’t think the threat of possible war is serious,” said Mudasar Maqsood, a 39-year-old factory worker from the eastern city of Kasur, over 630km away, who was blocked along with his friends from entering the valley.
“We should not disrupt our routine life,” he added.
Raja Iftikhar Khan, the president of private tourism association, said the situation could become “extremely dire”.
“This disruption has been devastating for all those tied to tourism,” he said. “We don’t want war — no sensible businessperson ever does”.

Paweł Małaszko arrived in Gilgit on Saturday as part of his adventure to cycle across Pakistan — from the shores of the Arabian Sea to the K2 Base Camp.
However, his adventure was stalled as the required permit to go to the popular tourist destination couldn’t be issued due to an ongoing legal battle.
On Friday, the GB Chief Court ordered the government to issue the trekking permit to Mr Małaszko.
Last year, the GB government hiked permit fees for mountaineering and trekking expeditions by 300 per cent under the GB Finance Act, 2024.
The region’s tour operators challenged the decision in court, which issued a stay order, effectively suspending the issuance of new permits.
Mr Małaszko had filed an appeal in the GB Chief Court for the trekking permit, according to Asghar Ali Porik, a tour operator.

An official of the GB tourism department said the Polish cyclist has been granted a trekking permit after the court order.
However, permits to other foreigners couldn’t be issued until the court gives a clear directive, the official added.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Małaszko confirmed his journey to the K2 basecamp would begin in the next couple of days.
Before his journey to the K2 Base Camp,  the cyclist travelled to the Khunjerab Pass from Gilgit on Saturday.
He arrived in Gilgit after cycling from Kara­chi, covering a distance of around 1,900 kilometres.
Mr Małaszko said the expedition was not only his dream but also “an opportunity to promote Pakistan as a destination for adventure and exploration throughout Europe and beyond”.
‘Tourism to take a hit’
Since the stay order by the GB Chief Court, the tourism department has stopped issuing permits to foreign adventurers.
The matter has been pending for more than two months since a hearing could not be held due to lawyers’ strike.
Muhammad Ali, a tour operator, told Dawn the delays might force foreigners to cancel their trips this year.
 
 

He added that this would badly hurt the tourism sector as a large number of foreign tourists have planned to visit Pakistan for trekking and mountaineering this year.
The GB tourism department official said 900 foreign mountaineers and trekkers have applied for a visa this year, with more applying for visas every day. Official sources told Dawn the GB cabinet was likely to discuss the issue of permits on May 6.

The phrase is often attributed to the American visual artist Andy Warhol. In 1968, Warhol ‘predicted’ that tools to become famous (albeit for a brief period of time) will become available to every person. 
Indeed, today, anyone can gain short bursts of fame by using digital tools and social media platforms. But such folk often fall back into oblivion. The irony is, if gaining fame has become easier, sustaining it has become harder. Fame can be addictive — even that of the 15-minute variety. People want to elongate it. They become desperate enough to even cross certain ethical boundaries to remain in the picture. 
And when they can’t, they plunge into depression. Some ultimately accept their fate, but some try to rekindle moments of ‘fame’ by triggering sympathy for themselves through self-pitying/ teary-eyed videos and posts. They may also start talking about their deteriorating mental health, or apologise for their ‘unethical’ behaviour. This may lead to another round of ‘fame’, but one that doesn’t have much staying power as well. 
The desire to cling to one’s 15 minutes of fame can be a rather awkward manifestation of pathos. It is present in politics as well. In May 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic had started to peak, a report by Reno-based journalist William Puchert pleaded that the state government of Nevada start taking more serious steps against protesters who were regularly gathering to oppose the mandatory wearing of masks and the closure of shops. 

From viral videos to populist protests, fame in today’s world is fast, frequent and fleeting. But the pursuit of attention, even in the political arena, can lead to distorted priorities and the manipulation of genuine causes for personal visibility

Puchert wrote, “It’s time for their 15 minutes of fame to be over.” According to Puchert, the protesters were not only becoming willing conduits of the highly contagious Covid-19 virus, but that they were holding protests because they had started to enjoy the coverage they were getting in the media. 
Puchert was sure the moment the media stopped giving them coverage the protesters were likely to disperse. Yet, it was also possible that decreasing media coverage could have made the protesters adopt even more desperate tactics to cling on to their ‘fame.’
 
 

Take the recent example of protests in Sindh against the federal government’s decision to irrigate a corporate farming project in the arid Cholistan region in Punjab through canals cut from parts of the River Indus that runs across Sindh. The Sindh government is headed by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
Parties that oppose the PPP-led government began to hold protests against the project. 
Pressured by Sindhi nationalist groups, the Islamist Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), the conservative Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), and the populist Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the PPP-led provincial government, too, began holding rallies against the project. It then accelerated the process of making the federal government put the project on the backburner. 
The PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto argued that, at a time when India was threatening all-out war and the cancellation of a vital water treaty with Pakistan, the situation required that the canal project be postponed. The federal government agreed. Yet, even though the size of the protests shrank, they began to get more aggressive. 
 


I believe this was/is a case of (political) 15 minutes of fame. Consider this: figuratively speaking, since 2008, Sindhi nationalists, PTI, JUIF and GDA combined have never received as many votes in an election in Sindh as the number of hours of media coverage that they have recently received. Especially to the Sindhi nationalists, it doesn’t really matter anymore if the project has finally been halted. Leaders who often lose by tens of thousands of votes to PPP candidates in Sindh suddenly began to see their photos, flags and words in all kinds of media. 
But after the project was postponed, their 15 minutes of fame began winding down. As I am writing this (on Monday, April 28), some attempts were being made by Sindhi nationalists to force the Sindh government’s hand. With the media now more focused on the rising tensions between Pakistan and India, violence at an anti-canal protest alone can keep the Sindhi nationalists in the picture. They want to cling to the ‘fame’ that they enjoyed and now think they might be losing it. They are. 
Clingers in this regard start to intently focus on one specific area of concern, while overlooking other important concerns. When the recent Pakistan-India tensions began to peak, the anti-canal protests or, for that matter, a strike call by the Jamaat-i-Islami to protest against Israeli brutalities in Gaza, started to seem out of place.
So, can one assume that those who try to cling to their 15 minutes of fame may end up divorcing themselves from reality that exists outside their own immediate interests? 
In December 2014, when the Nawaz Sharif government and the military establishment decided to launch a large-scale military operation against Islamist militants, PTI chief Imran Khan was holding a sit-in in Islamabad against the Nawaz regime. 
 
 

When asked to end the sit-in by the government and sign a multiparty agreement on the military operation, Khan refused. The then military chief Gen Raheel Sharif had to arm-twist Khan into calling off the sit-in. 
As Khan was moving out of the sit-in area, his car was swarmed by groups of men and women who were pleading him not to go. One of them was a good friend’s maternal aunt. My friend told me she was there at the sit-in from day one and one could often see her on TV as well. She became a celebrity of sorts in her circle of friends and relatives.
But now there she was, weeping and urging Khan not to end the sit-in. It didn’t matter to her that just a few days before, militants had slaughtered over 140 students and teachers at a school in Peshawar. Instead, to retain that ‘buzz’ and attention that she had received during the heyday of the sit-in, she willingly cut herself off from a less glorious reality.
Unfortunately, she then slipped into depression. My friend never mentioned her again. He still doesn’t.

A Sri Lankan Airlines fli­ght from Chennai to Colo­mbo was thoroughly sear­ched upon arrival by Colo­mbo police on Saturday after the Chennai control centre alerted them about the possibility that the Pahalgam “suspects are on board”.
The airline said its flight UL122 arrived in Colombo from Chennai at 11:59am and was subjected to a “comprehensive security search” upon arrival.
 
 

“This was carried out in coordination with local authorities following an alert from the Chennai Area Control Centre regarding a suspect wanted in India who was believed to be on board.”
Speaking some 10 days after the massacre in India-held Kashmir, a Congress politician expressed doubt if the Modi government was competent to catch the attac­kers. His comments were turned into a criticism of the army, forcing him to retract.
Dismissal of ministers, NSA
The glaring security and intelligence failure have drawn criticism from opposition and defence analysts as demands have been raised for the resignation of home and defence ministers.
Some analysts have called for the dismissal of the national security adviser (NSA).
Reports are coming in of how the attackers trapped the tourists by mingling with them and shepherding them towards a place on the meadow from where they could not escape.
 
 

The Hindu quoted a senior government official as saying on Saturday that two attackers who had earlier mingled with the tourists herded the startled crowd towards the two shooters, who then segregated tourists based on religion and killed them.
It said the attack happened at two to three points within 50 metres of the entry-cum-exit point at Baisaran and so far, it seemed “four men were involved”. The meadow is fenced from all sides.
The official said two of them deliberately herded people towards the shooters, knowing that the crowd would scatter after hearing gunshots.
The official was further quoted by The Hindu report as disclosing that they received specific intelligence input on an attack at “hotels” in Srinagar and Dachigam, some 22km from Srinagar, on April 19, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to inaugurate the Katra-Sangaldan stretch of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link.
 
 

However, the PM’s visit was cancelled due to inclement weather after which the tourists were targeted, the official believed.
“A lot of chatter was picked up by security agencies for a month before the attack on April 22. This is why senior police officers were stationed in Srinagar four to five days prior to the attack and they were also trying to build on the information,” said the official.
However, another official said the input was generic, suggesting the target could be “security personnel deployed at hotels”.
90-minute delay
While he claimed the delay of more than 90 minutes for the Army to reach the shooting site was a tactical move to avoid collateral damage to the security forces, the other official according to The Hindu cited the long wait for mobilisation of adequate personnel behind the delay.
By the time reinforcements reached Baisaran, the attackers had already fled into the forests.
Two days after the attack, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah while talking to MPs at an all-party meeting blamed nearby hotels for sending tourists to Baisaran “without informing the police”.
He admitted that there was no security presence at the place on the day of the shooting, though the tourist site was usually provided with security well before the start of Amarnath Yatra in July.
However, the official quoted by The Hindu in its report said Baisaran meadow is open throughout the year, except during the Amarnath pilgrimage.
The tender to maintain the tourist site was awarded to a Bijbehara resident in August 2024 and there is no government order suggesting that it is a regulated area under security watch.

The 67-year-old was arrested on Friday outside a military camp in Serres for allegedly taking photographs in an area where it is forbidden. The man was noticed by soldiers, who alerted the police.
Appearing before prosecutors on Saturday, the man apologised and claimed that he “did not realise that the place he was photographing was a military camp”. According to the same sources, he said that he only took two photos of the camp gate.
When the judge asked him if it is legal in Georgia to photograph military installations he replied that “camps in his country are mostly located in forest areas and are not accessible to civilians”.
The man claimed that he came to Greece on April 28 as a result of a close relative of his wife’s serious health problem. The case follows that of a Greek man remanded in custody on suspicion of photographing supply convoys on behalf of Russia in the port city of Alexandroupolis.

• Some see status quo after tomorrow’s meeting as war-like situation expected to hike food prices
KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11 per cent, opinions on the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) likely decision on the policy rate are divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
Researchers conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Monday to set the key interest rate for the next two months. The central bank had delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate unchanged in the last review, disappointing the business community, which was demanding a substantial cut of at least 500bps. Many experts were expecting a slight cut of up to 50bps.
However, once again, many experts believe the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some have also found reason for a likely status quot as they feel the war-like situation between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.
This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.
In a poll conducted by Topline Securities, 69pc of market participants expect a rate cut of at least 50bps, while 31pc believe that the central bank will maintain the status quo.
“We believe the central bank will maintain the status quo in the upcoming meeting,” said the Topline.
The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to bottom out and clock in below 0.50pc year-on-year at 0.29pc. For the full FY25, inflation is expected to average between 4.5 and 5pc, it added.
However, a poll conducted by Reuters shows that out of 14 analysts and investors, nine believe that the State Bank will keep the rate unchanged; three expect a 50bps cut, while the two were expecting a 100bps cut.
Due to continuous deceleration in inflation, it is generally believed in the financial sector that the interest rate should be reduced for two reasons: to attract domestic investors, increase economic growth, and reduce the real interest rate, now over 11pc.
The State Bank has slashed the interest by 1,000bps since June 2024 to 12pc and kept it unchanged in March. The business circle demands further cuts to revive economic activities, but the policymakers look cautious, fearing higher inflation in the coming months.
Some bankers believe the geopolitical tensions added uncertainty, which demands a cautious approach.
A Tresmark (global currency tracker) poll shows 68pc of traders expect no change in monetary policy stance. CPI has collapsed to 0.3pc in April against 0.7pc in March and 17.3pc last year. Core inflation has dipped to 7.4pc. A textbook setup for a rate cutMarkets are rattled by trade risks, capital outflows, and a central bank that’s rightly cautious, it said.
“Over $225m has quietly exited from bonds and equities in April. A cut could widen the exit door,” said the Tresmark report.
“That said, the growth story is buried. Export-to-GDP keeps falling. FDI is limp. If there’s ever been a case for monetary stimulus, it’s now. Perhaps the central bank may need to prioritise growth over caution,” said Tresmark CEO Faisal Mamsa.
Businesses call for major cut
Meanwhile, the United Business Group leader has strongly slammed the high interest rate regime and said that the benefits of low inflation should be reflected in the SBP policy rate decision.
Member Central Core Committee United Business Group (FPCCI) Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari said that 0.3pc inflation in April had created a ground to cut the interest rate by 400bps to 8pc and bring down the electricity tariff to Rs26 per unit to provide real relief to the economy.
“When inflation has dropped to such a low level, bringing the policy rate down to single digits is both economically logical and essential for policy coherence,” he said while addressing a meeting of the business community in Islamabad on Saturday.
“Reducing the interest rate to 8pc would stimulate investment, lower borrowing costs, and accelerate economic activity,” he said.
At the same time, the business community expressed serious concerns about high electricity rates, which were hurting industrial production and squeezing the purchasing power of ordinary consumers.
The business community warned that if this opportunity is not seized, the country could face industrial stagnation, unemployment, and economic slowdown despite the temporary dip in inflation.
The Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) also urged the SBP to cut its policy rate to single digits to stimulate industrial activity and drive sustainable economic growth.
RCCI President Usman Shaukat emphasised that the current interest rate is significantly hampering business growth and must be lowered.
“Pakistan currently maintains the highest interest rate regime in the region,” said Mr Shaukat in a statement.

This fuelled uncertainty about the economy and pushed the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) further into the red zone in the outgoing week.
On Wednesday, the PSX witnessed a bloodbath caused by the information minister’s statement regarding an imminent attack by Indian forces within the next 24 to 36 hours. This news had scared investors who began offloading their holdings, wiping out a staggering Rs427bn from the market capitalisation as the benchmark KSE index suffered the third largest single-day loss of 3,546 points.
However, the last session of the week staged a strong rally as investors turned to value-hunting, helping the index to partially recover the losses it suffered on the eve of Labour Day.
In the preceding week, a host of negative news, including a downward growth revision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a persistent decline in the foreign exchange reserves amid a weak rupee, halted a brief bullish momentum the market built on the back of some positive economic data.
AKD Securities Ltd said the market remained volatile throughout the week, primarily due to concerns over the potential escalation in tensions between Pakistan and India.
However, the market rebounded on the last trading day and recovered a significant portion of earlier losses as Pakistan allowed Afghan trucks to enter India via the Wagah border.
Moreover, positive signals from the US and Gulf countries urging de-escalation and a lower-than-expected inflation reading for April contributed to a recovery in sentiment in the weekend session.
As a result, the benchmark KSE-100 index closed the week with a loss of 1,355 points or 1.17pc to 114,114 week-on-week.
Corporate results also influenced stock-specific performance, particularly in the banking, cement, and technology sectors.
In April, inflation increased to 0.28pc year-on-year, compared to 0.69pc in March. In another positive development, Pakistan’s case for approval of the $1bn second tranche and $1.3bn Risilence Support Fund (RSF) programme from IMF’s executive board has been scheduled for review on May 9.
However, on the fiscal side, tax collection during the outgoing month fell short of the target, taking the 10MFY25 collection shortfall to Rs831bn. Additionally, trade deficit widened by 36pc to $3.4bn in April, due to a 14pc year-on-year increase in imports and 9pc decline in exports.
Market participation also weakened amid the prevailing volatility, with the average traded volume falling by 29pc to 424m shares compared to 599m shares in the previous week.
After opening at 117,874 in April, the benchmark index remained negative. It, however, hit an intra-month high of 120,797 but plumbed a low of 110,104 points. However, it closed the month at 111,327 points, marking a decline of 6,480 points or 5.5pc over March.
Trading was dominated by the March quarter result announcements, which were broadly lower than market expectations and weighed down on investor sentiment.
Week-on-week, investor participation declined as the average traded volume and value stood at 424m shares and Rs27.5bn, down 29pc and 6pc.
The sector-wise positive contribution was from vanaspati and allied industries, sugar and allied industries, and modarabas, up 30.2pc, 3.7pc 2pc week-on-week. On the other hand, transport, refinery, and pharmaceuticals reported a decline of 8.3pc, 6.5pc, and 5.9pc, respectively.
Flow-wise, barring debt, major net selling was recorded by individuals and foreigners with a net sell of $7.2m and $6.8m, respectively. On the other hand, mutual funds and other organisations absorbed most of the selling with a net buy of $5.4m and $5.1m, respectively.
With the anticipated policy rate cut in Monday’s upcoming State Bank of Pakistan’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting, the AKD Securities said the IMF Executive board’s approval of the second tranche and Resilience Support Fund programme would be key triggers as the likelihood of wider scale escalation between Pakistan and India remains low.
The brokerage house maintained an “overweight” stance on banks, E&P, fertiliser, cement, OMCs, autos, textile, and technology sectors, as they stand to benefit from monetary easing, structural reforms, reciprocal tariffs and a continued decline in commodity prices.

But to remain composed and committed to justice amid hostility is an extraordinary feat, one that only a few can sustain in Pakistan’s increasingly polarised society.
Pakistan has, from time to time, produced individuals who quietly defy the dominant currents of fear and division. They stand as sentinels of sanity, choosing principles over populism. One such figure emerged from Umerkot, a border district in Sindh that rarely escapes headlines due to its fragile interfaith fabric, rising Hindu-Muslim tensions, and growing anxieties over forced conversions.
Here, where Hindus constitute a significant portion of the population, and communal suspicion often simmers just beneath the surface, the potential for conflict is real and recurring.
 
 

In February 2012, the town stood on the edge of such a rupture. A property dispute between Muslim shopkeepers from the Arain community and the custodians of the centuries-old Aakharo Temple spiralled into violence. A viral SMS incited local Muslims to mobilise after Friday prayers, and within hours, fear had gripped the city. Two Hindu men were injured, arrests were made, and the area shut down in anticipation of further unrest.
In that moment of chaos, a voice of restraint emerged: Maulana Abdul Rehman Jamali, a Deobandi scholar and local imam affiliated with the JUI. His sermon from the mosque’s pulpit cut through the noise.
“This is not a religious issue,” he declared, “it is a property dispute — and exploiting it can have grave consequences.” He urged the Hindu community to keep their shops open and cautioned Muslims against mobilising around false grievances. His intervention, grounded in Islamic ethics and civic responsibility, likely averted a larger crisis.
Maulana Jamali’s life was marked by quiet but firm resistance to extremism. Though rooted in the religious mainstream, he was never a sectarian. During the height of Shia-Sunni tensions in the neighbouring districts, he consistently called for unity and warned against the politics of hate. He was also a vocal proponent of Jinnah’s inclusive vision of Pakistan, often reminding congregants that the state’s promise was one of equality, not religious dominance.

Civil society must rediscover its moral anchors — figures who inspire and connect with people.

His symbolic gestures were as profound as his sermons. In one gathering, he drank from the leftover water of a low-caste Hindu, publicly rejecting caste discrimination and affirming the dignity of all human beings. When he died at 85, Umerkot mourned him as a rare bridge between communities. His funeral drew both Muslim and Hindu leaders, and temples held special prayers in his memory, a scene that testified to the legacy of a man who chose peace when it was neither easy nor popular.
The residents of Umerkot also remember another notable figure — Mama Dar Badar, who had no permanent home. He was a poet, artist, and left-leaning activist who earned profound respect across all communities. While he was alive, his influence often prevented confrontations between groups.
Even today, the city recalls such icons of peace, and many believe that if figures like Maulana Jamali or Mama Dar Badar were still around, tragedies like the death of Dr Shahnawaz Kunbhar might have been averted.
 
 

Dr Kunbhar, accused of blasphemy, was killed last year in a staged encounter allegedly orchestrated by the police. The absence of peace-building figures like Jamali and Badar has created an opening for extremists to stoke tensions. An official inquiry report mentions these elements, along with a number of police officials, in the extrajudicial killing of Dr Kunbhar.
Though these extremists lack significant power, the people of Umerkot fear that unchecked activities could further escalate tensions. The city longs for voices of unity and reason to counter divisive forces, although civil society in Sindh raised its voice against the killing of Dr Kunbhar. To a large extent, society overall is losing its strength to stand up against this strand of extremism.
The mobilisations by civil society in Sindh, started after the extrajudicial killing of Dr Kunbhar, are encouraging, echoing earlier sparks of resistance — such as the outcry following Mashal Khan’s lynching in Mardan in April 2017. At that time, civil society in KP did raise its voice, but the moral clarity was soon overwhelmed. Powerful religious parties shielded the perpetrators, and the judicial process turned them into heroes rather than criminals. The courts eventually set many of them free.
This pattern is not accidental. In many regions, some extremist elements are seen to have entrenched themselves within the legal and law enforcement systems. The lower judiciary and segments of the lawyers’ community often appear to offer legal and moral cover to the accused, aligning with hard-line religious outfits and local business interests.
 
 

Meanwhile, some in the police are reported to treat blasphemy allegations as tools for personal gain and basking in the rewards granted by religious zealots: cash, land, and public praise.
Civil society must rediscover its moral anchors in this bleak environment: figures who inspire and connect with ordinary people. Offering resistance in moments of crisis is no longer enough. A longer, deeper narrative must be constructed, rooted in local wisdom and humane values.
Figures like Maulana Abdul Rehman Jamali and Mama Dar Badar provide such inspiration. Though not well recognised nationally, local communities honour them as heroes. Indeed, there would be other examples across the country of individuals who stood firm against hate, refused to align with sectarian pressures and built legacies of coexistence through quiet, local acts of defiance.
Remembering them is not nostalgia. It is an act of resistance, a reminder that justice, peace, and empathy are still possible in Pakistan and that true heroes often act without applause but leave behind a blueprint for courage.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
Earlier today, India said Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.
“This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the Directorate General of Shipping said in a statement.
Similarly, an order issued later today from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs’ Ports and Shipping Wing said: “In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.”
Following last week’s tit-for-tat measures, New Delhi has taken more steps against Pakistan, including closing its airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23 and blocking social media accounts of media and leaders.
Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.
In August 2019, Pakistan had already formally downgraded its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.
India bans all imports from Pakistan, suspends inbound mail
India also said it banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan and suspended the exchange of inbound mail and parcels.
India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notification, said the ban on all imports will take effect immediately.
“This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,” it said.
 
 

In response to India’s slew of aggressive moves against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced retaliatory measures that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.
However, Pakistan earlier this week allowed 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
In another step to cut off ties, the Indian government also announced today it was suspending the exchange of all “inbound mail and parcels” from Pakistan.
“Government of India has decided to suspend exchange of all categories of inbound mail and parcels from Pakistan through air and surface routes,” a public notice issued by its communications ministry said, according to Hindustan Times.
The notification was also shared on the official X account of India’s Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia.
 


Mail exchanges between the two arch-rivals also saw a breakdown in 2019 following India’s revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status, according to ANI News.
Pakistan suspended postal mail services in August 2019 and resumed them in November that year, ANI said, citing Pakistani media reports.
Parcel services, however, remained suspended as of Nov 19, 2019, the report added.
Attaullah Tarar’s social media account also blocked
Meanwhile, India continued its blocking spree as Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said today his social media account had also been blocked in the neighbouring country, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
 
 

The Indian government has already blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) for users in India.
India has blocked dozens of accounts so far in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, including of high-profile Pakistani cricketers, actors, entertainment channels, news publications and journalists.
Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”
LoC visit for media
Separately, the information ministry said it was facilitating a visit for media representatives, both local and international, to the Line of Control (LoC) for Saturday and Sunday “to expose India’s baseless and fabricated propaganda regarding so-called and imaginary ‘terrorist camps’ in Pakistan”.
“India has repeatedly made unfounded and baseless claims about alleged terrorist hideouts along the LoC,” the ministry said in a press release.
 


“During the visit, media representatives would be taken to the exact locations falsely propagated by India as terrorist camps and would be presented with factual, on-ground realities that refute these malicious allegations,” it said.
The ministry said that Pakistan reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to peace and “categorically rejected any form of terrorism or terrorist activities anywhere in the world”.
“The nation remains resolute in defending its sovereignty, and any aggression by India will be met with a swift and befitting response,” it concluded.

The protest came in the wake of the deadly April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Occupied Kashmir, which left 26 people dead and reignited tensions between India and Pakistan.
India has accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack, an allegation Islamabad has firmly denied, instead calling for an independent and impartial investigation into the incident.
Waving Pakistan flags and placards, demonstrators chanted slogans including, “Gen Asim Munir Zindabad”, “Pakistan Zindabad”, “Kashmir belongs to Pakistan” and “We condemn Indian terrorism”.
 
 

The protesters also denounced India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindutva ideology, with chants of “Modi is terrorist” and “Down with Hindutva ideology” echoing through the streets.
PML-N UK President Ahsan Dar addressed the protesters, saying:“ This huge show is a reflection of the sentiment Pakistani overseas have for their motherland. Today, Pakistanis from across the UK have gathered outside India House to express their support for the civilian and military leadership of Pakistan.
He added that India had hastily blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack without presenting any evidence. “It’s clear this was a false flag operation aimed at maligning Pakistan.”
Dar also highlighted the unity among the diaspora community. “We countered Indian protesters on April 25 in large numbers. We are glad that activists of PTI, PML-N and other parties joined us against Indian aggression. The whole nation is united.”
The demonstration remained peaceful but drew significant attention from passersby and local media.
London Police maintained a visible presence to ensure order.

Religious groups have gained strength after the toppling of the iron-fisted regime of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, opposing attempts at reforms they say are un-Islamic.
Hefazat-i-Islam — an influential group made up of multiple political parties, Muslim organisations and religious schools — issued a string of demands at Saturday’s rally, including the abolishment of a government women’s commission seeking equality.
“Men and women can never be equal: the Holy Quran outlines specific codes of life for both genders,” said Mohammad Shihab Ud­din, 53, leader of a women’s mad­­rassa, a religious school. “There is no way we can go beyond that.”
No date has been set for elections, but caretaker leader Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who heads the interim government, has promised polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest.
 
 

Muhammad Umar Faruq, 30, another teacher at a seminary, said they helped the interim government run the country.
“If a government atte­mpts anything anti-Isla­mic in a country where 92 per cent of the population is Muslim, we will reject it immediately,” he said.
Hasina, who was blamed for extensive human rights abuses, took a tough stand against Islamist movements during her autocratic 15-year rule.
Since she fled to India — where she has defied extradition orders to face charges of crimes against humanity — religious groups have become emboldened.
Religious parties have demanded an end to a swath of activities, including cultural events deemed “anti-Islamic” — from music to theatre festivals, women’s football matches and kite-flying celebrations.

Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal reported 11 killed “after the bombardment of the Al-Bayram family home in the Khan Yunis camp” in southern Gaza at around 3am.
Bassal said that eight of the dead had been identified and were all from the same extended family, including a boy and girl, both one-year-olds, and a month-old baby.
An Israeli army spokesperson confirmed the strike. At the scene, rescue workers and residents searched through the rubble with their bare hands, illuminating the destruction with hand-held torches.
Footage by an AFP journalist showed a rescuer that was carrying the lifeless body of an infant from the wreckage.

Foreign Press Association urges Tel Aviv to give media ‘unrestricted’ access to Palestinian enclave

Fayka Abu Hatab, a resident in a nearby building, said she “saw a bright light, then there was an explosion, and dust covered the entire area”. “We couldn’t see anything, it all went dark,” Abu Hatab said.
 
 

“All of our windows were destroyed, our rooms were destroyed, the neighbours’ house was destroyed,” she added.
On Friday the civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 42 people across the conflict-ravaged territory, which has been under a total Israeli blockade since March 2.
Israel halted aid deliveries to Gaza, saying Hamas had diverted supplies. Israel says the blockade is meant to pressure Hamas into releasing prisoners held in the Palestinian territory.
‘Unrestricted’ access
The Foreign Press Association on Saturday called on Israel to allow news media “unrestricted” access to Gaza, off-limits to outside journalists operating independently since the conflict there began in Oct 2023.
“We call on Israel to stop the never-ending delays, uphold the fundamental principles of press freedom and allow unrestricted entry for journalists to Gaza,” the Jerusalem-based association wrote in a statement to mark World Press Freedom Day.
 
 

The FPA has more than 350 members working for foreign media outlets in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The association criticised Israel for an “unprecedented ban preventing foreign journalists from entering Gaza”, calling the decision a “mark of shame for a country that claims to be a beacon of democracy”.
The FPA, which has filed an appeal with the Israeli Supreme Court challenging the ban, said its members “salute our Palestinian colleagues who continue to report the story at great personal risk”.
With the exception of a journalist for US outlet CNN who entered a field hospital in Rafah operated by the United Arab Emirates in 2023, the only outside journalists allowed into Gaza, which is under Israeli blockade, did so with Israeli forces.

In separate clashes bet­ween security agencies and militants, two terrorists were killed in North Wazir­istan, three were shot dead in Bajaur, while two others were gunned down in retaliation by police after they atta­cked a security post on Bannu-Dera Ismail Khan Road in Lakki Marwat district.
Five terrorists, including a high-value target, were killed and two others, inc­luding one wanted by po­l­ice, were arrested in sep­arate operations carried out by security forces in KP on April 30 and May 1, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing.
The ISPR said during an intelligence-based operation (IBO), troops effectively engaged militants’ hideout in Bajaur. In an intense exchange of fire between security forces and terrorists, a high-value target, Fareedullah, and two other terrorists were neutralised.
In the Dossali area of North Waziristan district, security forces killed two terrorists during an IBO, according to the ISPR.
 
 

It added that troops successfully busted a hideout of terrorists during a third encounter with militants in Mohmand district and arrested two of them. One of them was later identified as Lal Ameer alias Ibrahim, who was wanted by the police for his active role in terror activities.
Security forces seized weapons, ammunition and explosives from the terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The military’s media wing said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.
Security official martyred
Meanwhile, a security official was martyred in an explosion in the Garhiom area on the outskirts of South and North Waziristan districts on Saturday, sources said.
An improvised explosive device went off near a convoy of the security forces, the sources said, adding that the explosion claimed the life of a security official.
A curfew was later imposed in the area due to security concerns.
Two killed in Lakki
In Lakki Marwat district, a security checkpoint near Gandi Chowk on Bannu-D.I. Khan Road came under attack at 2am on Saturday, prompting the police to retaliate, officials said.
A heavy gunfire panicked locals as some of them came out of their houses to assist the police.
“The militants used light and heavy weapons in a bid to take over the police post building, but failed as police fought gallantly forcing them to retreat under the cover of fire,” the officials said.
 
 

A rocket shell fired by the terrorists hit and damaged the main gate and the boundary wall of the police post, they said, adding that an area resident, Ahmad Khan, who along with others had come out of his house to assist police, lost his life in the ambush.
“A police official, Naseer Khan, and a watchman of a local market, Mujeebur Rehman, were also injured and taken to nearby hospital,” officials maintained, adding an effective response by law enforcers forced the militants to flee the place.
After the attack, a large contingent of police led by SP Investigation Murad Khan Wazir and backed by armoured personnel carriers reached the area and launched a search for the assailants.
Subsequently, police surrounded some militants hiding the forest locally called ‘darga’, near Shah Tora, Takhtikhel area of Lakki Marwat. After a fierce gun battle, two of them were killed, police said, adding that advanced weapons including M-4 rifles and 9MM pistols were seized from the area.
Later, Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan visited the site, met police personnel and praised them for repelling the attack bravely.
Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi and SP Wazir accompanied him.
Mr Khan said the cops stood against the menace firmly and thwarted the malicious designs of militants.
President, PM hail forces
Later, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded security forces for operations against terrorists in North Waziristan and Bajaur.
The president reiterated the resolve of continuing actions against terrorists and appreciated the security forces’ operations for eliminating these elements.
He said their determination for the eradication of terrorism and the defence of the motherland was resolute.
The prime minister said that they would continue foiling the nefarious designs of the enemies of humanity.
PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed continuing the fight against terrorism till its complete elimination from the country.
Funeral
Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for a martyred police official, Imranullah, at the Iqbal Shaheed police lines with full state honour.
 
 

Imranullah of the counterterrorism department of police was seriously injured in an armed clash with terrorists in the Domel Chashmi area of Bannu district on Wednesday night.
He remained under treatment at a local hospital but his condition deteriorated after which he was being shifted to a hospital in Peshawar when he breathed his last.
His body was later shifted to Bannu where RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi, SP CTD Fazal Wahid and other police officials attended his funeral.
Arrests
Also on Saturday, police claimed to have arrested scores of suspects and anti-state elements during an operation and snap checking in Bannu and Lakki Marwat district.
“The offensives were launched after a surge in militant attacks on police installations in both southern districts,” officials said.

• Food depots being relocated from exposed areas to safer zones
• Officials asked to develop contingency plans to ensure uninterrupted food supply
MUZAFFARABAD: The Food Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the Line of Control (LoC), amid heightened tensions with India and fears of possible incursion from across the divide.
In snowbound and remote areas of AJK — many of which lie adjacent to the LoC — the Food Department traditionally stocks specially treated wheat flour with an extended shelf life to sustain local populations from December through May. In comparatively safer areas, routine storage is limited to a 15-day supply due to easier accessibility.
However, in response to fresh directives from AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, the department has begun increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months.
“In accordance with the prime minister’s instructions, we have launched an intensive operation to ensure wheat flour stocks are available for a full two months in the entire LoC belt,” AJK’s Minister for Food Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim told Dawn.
He said the government was simultaneously working on relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones without disrupting access for residents.
 
 

The minister added that he had also instructed officials to prepare contingency plans to maintain uninterrupted food supply chains to vulnerable settlements, especially those that were frequently cut off during winter or during episodes of Indian shelling.
On Thursday, the AJK premier had informed the Legislative Assembly that he had constituted a special ‘Emergency Response Fund’ with an initial allocation of Rs1 billion.
The fund would cater to urgent needs such as replenishment of wheat flour, procurement of lifesaving medicines, and provision of other essential services in the 13 constituencies situated along the volatile LoC, spanning six districts — Neelum, Jhelum Valley, Haveli, Poonch, Kotli and Bhimber.
When contacted, AJK Food Department Director Abdul Hameed Kiani said sufficient wheat flour stocks had already been secured in all depots along the LoC.
“However, in light of the prime minister’s instructions and the uncertain situation, we are now increasing our storage capacity to meet a two-month demand,” he said.
“All contractors engaged by the department have been mobilised to use the maximum number of vehicles to deliver wheat flour in the shortest possible time,” he said, adding that department officials were supervising dispatches directly — both at the flour mills and in the delivery zones.
According to Mr Kiani, nearly 70 per cent of the target had so far been achieved.
On Saturday, around 250 tonnes of flour were dispatched from a single mill on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad.
Food Inspector Syed Zawar Haider, who was overseeing operations at the mill, said the consignments were being sent to various parts of Neelum Valley and forward areas of Jhelum Valley district.
“We are executing the task without interruption and expect to complete the operation within the next two days,” he said.

Fresh Israeli raids were reported overnight, after Israel said repeatedly that its forces stood ready to protect the Druze minority after sectarian clashes killed 119 people, mostly Druze fighters, according to a Britain-based war monitor.
Since ousting longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Syria’s new authorities — who have roots in Al Qaeda — have vowed inclusive rule in the multi-confessional, multi-ethnic country, but they must also contend with pressure from radical extremists in their ranks.
“I strongly condemn Israel’s continued and escalating violations of Syria’s sovereignty, including multiple air strikes in Damascus and other cities,” Pedersen said in a post on X, calling “for these attacks to cease at once”.

Tel Aviv says its troops are in southern Syria

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 20 strikes hit military targets across Syria late Friday, in the “heaviest” assault carried out by Israel on its neighbour this year. 
Syria’s state news agency SANA reported strikes near Damascus and in the country’s centre, west and south, saying one civilian was killed. An Israeli military statement said its forces “struck a military site, anti-aircraft cannons and surface-to-air missile infrastructure in Syria”. It did not give further details.
Firas Aabdeen, 32, a member of the security forces in Harasta near Damascus where one of the attacks hit, said he heard several “very loud” strikes and that a largely disused Assad-era military barracks was targeted. 
The barrage followed an Israeli attack near the presidential palace in Damascus early on Friday, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz called a “clear message” to Syria’s new rulers.
“We will not allow forces to be sent south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community,” they said. Israeli foe Iran, which propped up the now ousted Assad government, condemned the strikes, accusing Israel of seeking to “destroy and annihilate the defence, economic and infrastructure capabilities of Syria as an independent country”.
Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, also an Assad ally, said that the attacks were “a clear attempt to undermine” and weaken Syria.
Israel army ‘deployed’ in south
The Israeli military said it was “deployed in southern Syria” and “prepared to prevent the entry of hostile forces into the area of Druze villages”.
Since the collapse of the Assad government late last year, Israeli troops have entered the UN-patrolled buffer zone on the Golan Heights and have carried out incursions deeper into southern Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli army was speaking of a new deployment or how many troops were involved. A Druze official in the community’s heartland in Sweida province said there had been “no deployment of Israeli soldiers” there.
This week, Druze clerics and armed factions reaffirmed their loyalty to a united Syria, following clashes between Druze fighters and loyalists of the new government.
The unrest in Sweida and the southern suburbs of the capital was sparked by the circulation of an audio recording attributed to a Druze citizen and deemed blasphemous.

A Nigerian tribunal last week rejected the US social media giant’s appeal against a $220 million fine imposed by the country’s consumer protection agency, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC).
In appeals court papers cited by various media, including the BBC and The Africa Report, Meta said it “may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures”.
Meta’s social media platforms — WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram — are among the most popular in the country. Meta has until the end of June to pay the fine, Nigerian media reported.
“We disagree with the NDPC’s (Nigerian Data Protection Commission) decision, which fails to take into account the wide range of settings and tools that allow everyone using Facebook and Instagram in Nigeria to control how their information is used,” a Meta spokesperson said.
“We’re committed to protecting user privacy and have appealed the decision,” the company spokesperson said in an email response. Nigeria had accused Meta of violating the country’s data protection and consumer rights laws on Facebook and WhatsApp. 
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi had said investigations carried out in conjunction with the NDPC between May 2021 and Dec 2023 revealed “invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria”.
A WhatsApp spokesperson said on Saturday: “The FCCPC order contains multiple inaccuracies and misrepresents how WhatsApp works, and we are urgently applying to stay the order and appeal the Tribunal’s decision to avoid any impact to users.” 
On Saturday, the FCCPC described Meta’s reaction as “a calculated move aimed at inducing negative public reaction and potentially pressuring the FCCPC to reconsider its decision”. In its statement it said that Meta had been sanctioned for “similar breaches” in Texas, India, South Korea, France and Australia, but had “never resorted to the blackmail of threatening to exit those countries.

Work is in full swing inside the Apostolic Palace to equip the 13th-century chapel for the vote to elect Pope Francis’s successor, according to a video released by the Vatican press office on Saturday.
The nearly five-minute video shows builders laying beams on scaffolding to build a raised wooden floor, before setting up large tables for the use of the 133 cardinal electors casting their votes in the conclave.
Other builders are seen installing the heavy stove, where the ballots are burnt, in a corner of the chapel.
The video, dated Friday, also shows firefighters climbing onto the chapel’s tiled roof to secure the chimney flue.
Smoke from the flue — eagerly watched for in St Peter’s Square below — will be black if no candidate has secured a two-thirds majority, or white if the Church has a new pontiff.
Silvio Screpanti, Vatican City’s deputy director of infrastructure, said five electricians and five technicians would remain onsite for the duration of the conclave.
A technician “will remain throughout the voting” in a small room near the Sistine Chapel, “with a remote control for the stove”, which is now electronically activated, he said in an interview for the Vatican City State website.
Ahead of the vote, technicians are “blacking out all the windows” in the areas used during the conclave and deactivating “all the technological devices and sensors installed in recent years in the Sistine Chapel”.
The day before the conclave, they will install  “approximately 80 lead seals at all entrances to the perimeter”.
They are also cleaning and repainting “around 200 rooms” for cardinals and their staff at the Santa Marta guest house and a building next door, including blocking views from some windows, he said.
Furniture is kept to a “necessary minimum”, including a “bed, bedside table, and wardrobe”, Screpanti said.
Some of the technicians have already taken part in conclaves, while for others it is their first time.
All those staying to help however must take an oath of secrecy and sleep in the Vatican, “without being able to contact their families”.
‘Princes of the church’ meet 
The cardinals of the Catholic Church held their ninth in a series of near-daily meetings at the Vatican on Saturday ahead of the election of a new pope.
The closed-door “general congregations” allowed them to discuss the challenges the successor to Pope Francis will face before they are locked into the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday for the vote.
Walking through crowds of pilgrims and journalists for the morning meeting, the “Princes of the Church” gave little away — not even speculating how long the conclave would last.
“We do not know, we just wait for God to tell us,” said Cardinal William Seng Chye Goh, archbishop of Singapore, seen as one of the more conservative prelates.
The cardinals were called to Rome from around the world after the death on April 21 of Francis, an energetic reformer from Argentina who led the Catholic Church for 12 years.
According to Vatican press director Matteo Bruni, 177 cardinals, including 127 aged under 80 and thus eligible to vote in the conclave, attended Saturday’s meeting.

The Large Taxpayer Office  (LTO) Islamabad had decided to attach the bank accounts of the two telecoms before they could file an appeal against the court decision. The LTO remained operational on Saturday for the purpose of attaching the bank accounts of Telenor Pakistan and Deodar Pakistan, a subsidiary of Jazz. 
Following the promulgation of Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, the FBR has started recovery proceedings and enforcement measures.
The FBR officials were preparing for a forceful recovery of taxes through the attachment of bank accounts of these two companies falling under the jurisdiction of the LTO Islamabad, as the head offices of both companies are situated in the federal capital.

Both companies had gone to court over tax on equipment import

However, a final settlement between FBR and the companies was reached late Saturday evening, as they agreed to pay the recoverable amount as per court orders.
Telenor Pakistan has recently lost a case against FBR for the payment of Rs6bn in terms of withholding tax in the Islamabad high court.
As the FBR started the process to attach the bank accounts, the top management of Telenor Pakistan agreed to pay Rs6bn in pending taxes against the import of plants and equipment instead of pursuing the matter in the courts.
Similarly, Deodar Pakistan was fighting a case against the FBR over the amount of withholding tax and recently lost the case in the IHC.
The FBR team working for the attachment of Deodar Pakistan bank accounts also agreed with the Jazz management to pay Rs20bn in terms of withholding tax against the import of plants and equipment.
Sources in the tax collecting body said that Jazz Pakistan has agreed not to carry the matter further in the courts.
Deodar Ltd is responsible for establishing and maintaining the company’s cell sites and telecom towers.
However, Jazz has sold Deodar to Engro Corporation and the deal valued at approximately $563 million has been allowed Jazz by the Competition Commission of Pakistan recently, but the deal has yet not been materialised due to certain legal formalities.

Buffett spoke at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, after the conglomerate he built over 60 years showed it remained cautious about markets, allowing its cash stake to grow to a record $347.7 billion.
The 94-year-old billionaire, arguably the world’s most revered investor, had said very little about US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which unsettled many investors and caused big declines in stock markets worldwide.
“Balanced trade is good for the world,” and  “trade should not be a weapon,” Buffett said.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to design a world where a few countries say, ha ha ha, we’ve won,” Buffett added.  “I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, ... the more prosperous we’ll become.”  But despite concerns about the direction of the US economy and the country itself, Buffett retained his traditional optimism, saying criticism of policies and the people who make them is par for the course.
“We’re always in the process of change,” he said.  “I would not get discouraged.... We’re all pretty lucky.”
Berkshire reported its cash stake with its first-quarter results, where insurance losses from January’s wildfires in southern California contributed to a 14 per cent decline in operating profit to $9.64bn.
Net income fell 64pc to $4.6bn, reflecting unrealised losses on stocks such as Apple.
Berkshire’s cash stake grew from $334.2bn at year-end. The company repurchased no stock for a third straight quarter, and was a net seller of stocks for a 10th straight quarter.
Buffett downplayed concern about Berkshire’s cash, saying the company  “came close” to spending $10bn recently, but that buying opportunities don’t come in an orderly fashion.
That should happen over five years, he said, but not necessarily tomorrow.
“We’re running a business which is very, very, very opportunistic,” Buffett said.  “We have made a lot of money by not being fully invested at all times.” 
When asked, Buffett did not address whether Berkshire was hoarding cash for Vice Chairman Greg Abel, his designated successor as chief executive, to invest.
Addressing another questioner, Buffett and Abel also strongly backed five Japanese trading houses in which Berkshire has invested.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Ambassador of the Republic of Turkiye Dr Irfan Neziroglu at the PM House.
The premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said.
“India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s offer to have a credible, transparent and neutral international investigation to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that Pakistan would cooperate fully with such an investigation and would welcome if Turkiye joined it.
The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.
He further said that India’s actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.
PM Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region.
The prime minister noted that Turkiye’s support to Pakistan was reflective of the “historic, deep-rooted and time-tested brotherly relations” between the two countries and their peoples.
He reaffirmed the government’s focus on economic recovery and growth for which it required peace and security in its neighbourhood.
The Turkish ambassador informed the prime minister that Turkiye appreciated Pakistan’s position and expressed its solidarity with Pakistan while calling for de-escalation and urging restraint in the current crisis to maintain peace and security in South Asia.
FM Dar’s diplomatic engagements
Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability while resolutely protecting its sovereignty and national interests in a telephone conversation with Greek counterpart George Gerapetritis.
FM Dar briefed him on current regional developments, categorically rejecting India’s “baseless allegations, disinformation campaign and illegal unilateral measures” that threatened regional peace and security.
“He strongly condemned India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a blatant violation of its international obligations,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release.
Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent investigation to establish the facts.
FM Gerapetritis emphasised the importance of restraint to prevent escalation and preserve peace and stability. He welcomed Pakistan’s proposal for a neutral and transparent inquiry.
Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and global developments, particularly in multilateral forums, including their engagement as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with Swiss Federal Councillor and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.
He briefed FM Cassis on the evolving regional security situation, “expressing grave concern over India’s recent provocative actions, including baseless allegations, inflammatory propaganda, and its unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — an outright violation of international legal obligations”, the FO said in a press release.
Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent international investigation to establish the facts and underscored Pakistan’s commitment to exercising restraint in the interest of regional peace and security, while reserving the right to protect its sovereignty and national interests.
FM Cassis appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and endorsed its proposal for an investigation.
He expressed Switzerland’s readiness to offer its good offices and explore appropriate mechanisms to facilitate an impartial investigation.
The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation.
 






DG ISPR, info minister to brief all political leaders
Separately, state-run broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported that Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar will brief the leaders of all political parties on the situation with India tomorrow.
According to the report, the high-level background briefing will focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the implications of recent developments.
“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.
PM Haq accuses India of maneuvering to create unrest in AJK
Meanwhile, Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said on Friday that India was hatching conspiracies to create unrest in the territory.
In his address to the All Parties Kashmir Conference hosted in the state metropolis, he warned,  “If India attacks Pakistan, we will respond with full force. India is actively plotting to destabilise AJK.”
He emphasised that Pakistan’s political leadership must demonstrate complete solidarity and stand firmly behind the armed forces against the Indian aggression.
Reaffirming his stance on the Kashmir issue, Haq said his narrative drew strength from the people of Pakistan, the armed forces and the country’s military leadership.
He said that a single action by the Indian government had brought the situation back to what it was before August 5, 2019.
“The Liberation Cell is ready to support if the political leadership from the All Parties Kashmir Conference forum wants to participate in the protest demonstration,” the AJK premier said.
“As far as the Kashmir policy is concerned, we are open for debate and ready to remove any shortcomings,” he remarked.
“We have to think about how to take forward the issue of Kashmir, for which we have lost three generations,” he said.
Highlighting the significance of national unity, Haq said, “The enemy attacks you only when he thinks that the nation is divided.”</p><small>2025-05-03 20:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/03230814110858d.jpg?r=230839' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908217/warren-buffett-to-step-down-as-berkshire-ceo-vice-chairman-abel-to-take-over' target='_blank'><strong>Warren Buffett to step down as Berkshire CEO, Vice Chairman Abel to take over</strong></a><br><p>Influential billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, and hand over the reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel.
“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,” Buffett, 94, said at Berkshire’s annual meeting.
He said Abel hadn’t been aware of his plans prior to the announcement.
Buffett also said he had “zero” intention of selling any of his Berkshire stock.
The news was also unexpected, though Buffett said he had told his children about his decision.
During his 60-year run, Buffett managed to transform Berkshire Hathaway from a medium-sized textile company when he bought it in the 1960s into a giant conglomerate, now valued at more than $1 trillion and with liquid assets of $300 billion.
His success, coupled with his ability to explain his thinking in clear soundbites, has made him highly influential in the business and financial communities, earning him the nickname “The Oracle of Omaha”.
Trade ‘should not be a weapon’
Separately, the influential billionaire investor said that “trade should not be a weapon”, in remarks clearly targeting US President Donald Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs against countries around the world.
“There is no question that trade can be an act of war,” the renowned businessman told the annual shareholder meeting.
While he did not mention Trump by name, his meaning was unmistakable, and his comments came as analysts in the United States and abroad have expressed growing concern that tariffs could seriously slow global growth.
 
 

Two months ago, Buffett told a CBS interviewer that tariffs “are a tax on goods” — and not a relatively painless revenue-raiser, as Trump has suggested — adding, “I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ’em!”
Buffett urged Washington to continue trading with the rest of the world, saying, “We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best. That’s what we did originally.”
Achieving prosperity is not a zero-sum game, with one country’s successes meaning another’s losses, he said, adding that both can prosper.
“I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won’t be at our expense; the more prosperous we’ll become, and the safer we’ll feel,” Buffett said.
He added that it can be dangerous for one country to offend the rest of the world while claiming superiority.
“It’s a big mistake, in my view, when you have seven and a half billion people that don’t like you very well, and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they’ve done,” Buffett said.
Compared to that dynamic, the financial markets’ recent gyrations are “really nothing”.
Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported first-quarter profits of $9.6bn, down 14 per cent.
That works out to $4.47 per share, also down sharply.</p><small>2025-05-03 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/031215072bf4cab.png?r=125553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908173/pakistan-envoy-to-us-calls-on-world-to-resolve-kashmir-dispute-terms-it-core-issue-of-enmity-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan envoy to US calls on world to resolve Kashmir dispute, terms it ‘core issue’ of enmity with India</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the “core issue” of the recent complete breakdown of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “ resolute” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
“It could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh said in an interview with Fox News Digital published earlier today.
“This is one nuclear flashpoint,” the envoy said.
 
 

Sheikh’s statement echoes his recent call to Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.
Trump, in his inaugural speech as the US president, had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”
A ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between Israel and Hamas following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with Ukraine and Russia to halt their war.
During his interview with Fox News, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.
He said: “Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully defuse.
“This time, perhaps it would be […] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, […] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.”
 
 

“Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,” the ambassador was quoted as saying. “That is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.”
“We want a peaceful neighbourhood,” Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.
However, he stressed, Pakistan’s desire for peace “should not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness”. “We want peace with dignity.”
Sheikh described India’s response to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.
The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to hold a “neutral and transparent” probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone “unanswered”.
“Within minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,” he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.
The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held “hostage to the war of hysteria” by India’s government and media, who immediately “began beating war drums”.
 
 

On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.
He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing “administrative inadequacies” in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India’s broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.
Speaking about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Ambassador Sheikh said: “That is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.”
Law Minister Azam Naz­eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan’s final response to India’s letters on the IWT would be crafted in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would approach international forums, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty’s suspension.</p><small>2025-05-03 14:04</small></div><hr>
