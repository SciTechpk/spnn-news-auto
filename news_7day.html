Earlier Thursday, the Pakistani leader also addressed the inaugural session of a Gaza peace forum led by President Donald Trump.
The State Department said the US secretary thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for joining the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” as a founding member. He also offered condolences over the Jan 31 attacks in Balochistan and the Feb 6 bombing in Islamabad and reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counter-terrorism.







The talks covered Pakistan’s participation in the recent Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington, with the United States welcoming Islamabad’s engagement and discussing cooperation in developing Pakistan’s energy and mineral resources, as well as commercial opportunities for American companies.
In a post on X, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar thanked Secretary Rubio and said Pakistan values its “longstanding relationship with the United States”.
The foreign minister added that the two diplomats had “meaningful discussions” on advancing peace, cooperation in fighting against terrorism, and expanding bilateral economic and trade ties.
“We look forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership in all areas of shared interest,” said Dar.







Earlier, addressing the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 — Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving durable peace in the war-torn territory.
“The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” he said, adding that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions.
Praising Trump’s role, the prime minister said that through his “untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved” and that it would remain his legacy.
Under its charter, the US government serves as the board’s depository and the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace has been designated as its headquarters.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to help establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following the October ceasefire under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas. The truce, however, has remained fragile with repeated violations.
In his remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz also credited Trump with defusing the four-day Pakistan-India crisis in May 2025, saying his intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people” and describing him as “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”.
Speaking before the Pakistani leader, Trump recalled his contacts with both Islamabad and New Delhi during the conflict, saying he had warned the two countries that the United States would halt trade negotiations and could impose 200 per cent tariffs if the fighting continued.
“I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” he said, adding that the threat of economic consequences helped bring about a de-escalation.
Trump also referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and praised the Pakistani leader for publicly acknowledging his role in stopping the conflict.
The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots.
The Washington engagements underscored Pakistan’s effort to expand economic cooperation with the United States — particularly in the energy and minerals sectors — while aligning with a US-led diplomatic initiative on Gaza and highlighting Trump’s mediation role in South Asia.
PM Shehbaz meets global leaders
The prime minister also held informal meetings in Washington with global leaders who had arrived to attend the inaugural session of the Board of Peace, said a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The premier met with the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto.







The statement added that “important regional and global issues” were discussed during the meeting.
“Pakistan’s participation in the Board of Peace reflects its efforts toward establishing peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives, global peace, and the growing success of Pakistan’s diplomatic policy,” said the statement.</p><small>2026-02-20 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2011540189b78c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974564/tarar-says-pakistan-earned-great-recognition-and-honour-at-board-of-peace-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar says Pakistan earned ‘great recognition and honour’ at Board of Peace meeting</strong></a><br><p>Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had received “great recognition and honour” at the Board of Peace meeting, terming it a moment of pride for the country and its people.
In a video shared on X by Radio Pakistan on Friday, the information minister said that the way US President Donald Trump praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and appreciated Pakistan’s role, had added to the country’s prestige and enabled it to gain wider global recognition.







He added that the praise had raised Pakistan’s stature and that the country had “emerged as an important player on the global stage”.
Tarar described the development as a success of Pakistan’s foreign policy and “the result of teamwork between the prime minister and field marshal”.
He added that PM Shehbaz had consistently raised the Palestinian cause at every platform, especially at the United Nations (UN) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
“Today, he stated three points: that Palestinians have a right to their land, that they should be granted self-determination in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, and that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is essential for lasting peace,” he said, adding that these remarks reflected the heartfelt sentiments of Palestinians and were a source of pride for Muslims.
The minister further said the “confident body language” of both leaders signaled a strong rapport and enhanced Pakistan’s prestige.
“Pakistan’s foreign policy is making significant strides forward; from a time of isolation, the nation’s standing has transformed dramatically, showing that honest leadership yields positive results,” he added.
The inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace was held in Washington on February 19, with US President Donald Trump leading the session at the US Institute of Peace.
PM Shehbaz attended the meeting at Trump’s invitation.
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz called for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, stressing that it was “very important” for achieving long-lasting peace in the war-torn territory.

 

The Board of Peace was first proposed in September 2025. It formed part of a 20-point Gaza peace plan. The plan followed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier that year.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Resolution 2803, adopted in November, authorised international cooperation for Gaza’s reconstruction. The board’s charter includes humanitarian and reconstruction responsibilities. It also allows for broader conflict resolution roles.</p><small>2026-02-20 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/201046478f7b705.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974562/australia-coach-defends-world-cup-planning-puts-blame-on-players' target='_blank'><strong>Australia coach defends World Cup planning, puts blame on players</strong></a><br><p>Australia head coach Andrew McDonald put the blame for the team’s humiliating T20 World Cup exit squarely on the players, rejecting criticism of their preparations and a “false narrative” that the nation is not taking the format seriously.
Australia crashed out of the group stage following losses to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, triggering acrimony on the home front.
Former players and pundits have zeroed in on Australia’s preparations for the tournament which saw members of the squad arrive late to a warmup series in Pakistan after prioritising the Big Bash League.
Australia were thumped 3-0 by Pakistan before failing to qualify for the World Cup’s Super Eight phase.
McDonald dismissed criticism that Australia had not prioritised the tournament, saying the team had been “fully locked into (it) for a period of time”.
“I have heard that sort of narrative that T20 World Cups don’t matter to us,” he told reporters.
“I think all that is a response to the performances of Australian cricket teams in these competitions.
“We won in 2021 and we haven’t been as successful since then. The expectations on the Australian cricket team are high — and rightfully so.
“But to sit back and say that we’re prioritising other formats or other versions of the game and not the T20 World Cup is entirely false.”
Australia were missing leading pace bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood due to injury but McDonald said the available players were good enough but had not performed.
“It shouldn’t be about the players that we’re missing,” said McDonald, who is also a selector.
“It should be looking at the performances and we’re disappointed in those. We need to own those and the critique is fair and reasonable.”
Australia finish their tournament with a dead rubber against Oman in Pallekele later on Friday.</p><small>2026-02-20 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20095555c30ce36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974560/king-charles-brother-andrew-released-after-arrest-over-misconduct-relating-to-epstein' target='_blank'><strong>King Charles’ brother Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein</strong></a><br><p>King Charles’ younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was released from police custody on Thursday evening after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police.
Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement.
A Reuters witness saw the former prince leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT.
A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken.

Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.”
‘The law must take its course’
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement.
“Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.


Members of the media work outside the entrance to the Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate, which is reported to be serving as interim accommodation for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who was arrested this morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Norfolk, Britain, February 19, 2026.

Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment.
He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged.
“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship.
Unmarked police cars
Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothes officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides.
Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king’s Windsor estate where Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deal with the most serious criminal offences.
Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a ‘common law’ offence and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”.
Giuffre lawsuit in 2022
The king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
“Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, said in a statement.

In response to Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.” “I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters.
“It’s very, very sad to me… to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.”
Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences.
His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010.
Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.
US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the United States over what he knew about Epstein.
Meanwhile former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor.
Essex Police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.</p><small>2026-02-20 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2007250323c3393.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974503/pakistans-patience-with-afghanistan-wearing-thin' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s patience with Afghanistan wearing thin</strong></a><br><p>• FO spox says Islamabad cannot let citizens be killed ‘incessantly, mercilessly’• Afghan envoy issued demarche, Kabul told to act against terror outfits operating from its soil
ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday said Pakistan reserves the right to target terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan to protect the lives of civilians and law enforcement personnel amid a spike in cross-border tensions following a deadly attack in Bajaur.
“Pakistan very legitimately demands that Afghan territory should not be used for terrorism inside Pakistan. So, as long as this demand is not met, whilst exercising patience, all options would obviously remain on the table,” FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Attacks in Pakistan that were planned and directed from Afghanistan led to border clashes between the two sides last year. Various UN assessments have indicated that the TTP has benefited from Taliban tolerance and even active support, including access to safe houses such as guesthouses in Kabul for senior leaders, movement passes, weapon permits and logistical assistance.
According to the assessments, these arrangements have persisted despite internal Taliban debates in which some factions viewed the TTP as a liability because of strained ties with Pakistan. Conservative estimates place the number of TTP fighters in Afghanistan at around 6,000, with recruitment from Afghan Taliban ranks and operational enhancements. More than 3,500 terrorist attacks were attributed to the TTP last year, according to Pakistani security officials.
Mr Andrabi said it was a “fact that there is no positive response from Afghanistan.”
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.
Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.

 

Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) also described the assault as a “cowardly” act by the “Indian proxy” TTP.
Mr Andrabi said those statements were “fully endorsed and comprehensible”. Earlier in the day, the FO summoned the Afghan deputy head of mission and delivered what it described as a strong demarche to the Afghan Taliban regime over the Bajaur attack.
Mr Andrabi said “we cannot let our people be killed incessantly, mercilessly”.
“We reserve the right to any action in our right to self-defence, which is given to us under Article 51 of the UN Charter,” Mr Andrabi said. “Any action that we take against these terrorists will be essentially under our right to self-defence and the imperative of protecting the lives of our innocent civilians and the lives of our security forces.”
“When it comes to attacks against Pakistan, when it comes to killing of innocent civilians, a little child that was martyred in Bajaur, seven other women and children — in response to those attacks, what do you expect from us? Our patience is obviously not unlimited,” he said.
The FO said, “The Afghan Taliban regime has been told to take immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership.”

If you’re unfamiliar with Toby Fox, get familiar right now. After 2015’s smash-hit Undertale that rewired modern geek culture, the indie creator is back at it with another absolute banger: Deltarune, which on the surface alludes to its accolade-winning older brother but is in effect a very different, also amazing game. So amazing that I’m struggling to find anything to criticise about it.
The only reason one might not want to play this game right now is that it’s unfinished: just the first four chapters of seven are released. That said, they are phenomenally satisfying and leave me hyped for more to come (and the first two are free!). For a game so full of heart, I’ll wait as long as I need to for the rest, especially since its replayability factor is absurdly high and the wait between chapters has been well worth it so far.

Familiar concept, but fully new game
Let’s get the comparison out of the way. Deltarune features the same gameplay and interfacing concepts as Undertale, complete with an upgraded version of familiar battle mechanics. It also features a lot of familiar characters from Undertale, playing different roles in a different universe, and makes sparing references to the former game. It even has similar ways to play through the story peacefully or violently, although there’s reportedly only one ending regardless.

All in all, familiarity with Undertale acts as a good foundation for this similar universe of monsters and (singular) human and dodging bullets while convincing enemies to be friends. But this is where we can stop comparing the two, because Deltarune is neither its sequel nor its spinoff. It has its own story and gameplay charms, and deserves to be judged on its own terms.
In fact, what really surprised me was the fact that, aside from adding some nostalgia, this game honestly didn’t need to rely on any repurposed Undertale characters at all; it could just as easily have used new original characters. I’m not really sure why it made this choice, except maybe to rope in longtime fans, but ironically this is the one thing that threatened to lessen the experience even marginally for me. The game is not Undertale 2, and it doesn’t have to be. When it shakes off that mantle is when it really starts to shine.

A concept that builds and builds
Without spoiling too much: Deltarune introduces you to Kris — a human raised in a small town of monsters — and antagonistic deuteragonist Susie. Then it throws the two into a strange ‘Dark World’ with a mysterious prophecy at its core. Along with Ralsei, a Dark World prince, they set out JRPG-style to explore new worlds and seal the fountains at their centre — meeting friends and enemies of all kinds as they go.


ALL kinds. — screengrab by author

Every chapter brings a new quest, and while Chapter 1 functions more as a proof of concept, by Chapter 2 the game has firmly found its footing and started sprinting. Everything from the underlying narrative to the zany boss fights just keeps heightening. There are points that I just don’t know how the game can surpass itself, and then it does.

Sound design integrated into everything
Sound is a huge part of Deltarune from both an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. In some areas, it’s integrated thoroughly into gameplay and interfacing itself, to the point where you might want to play with your headphones set to stereo. Elsewhere, it elevates humorous and narratively powerful moments alike, and suffuses every element of the surroundings and interface with life. Close attention to detail here plays a major role in shaping a living, breathing world.
Fox’s soundtrack steals the show in every way, though. Every track is electric, bright, powerful and infuriatingly catchy, making the soundtrack an obvious standout feature. Each new theme compliments its area or battle perfectly, keeping you in the moment during the most tedious of puzzles and holding your attention when tough bosses threaten to get frustrating.
I would love to keep singing praises of the music, but I’ll just provide an example. Have a listen as you read the rest of this review, or after.



Evocative, expert pixel art
The interface is retro and JRPG-esque, with nostalgically pixelly battle screens and movement mechanics. Overall, the visuals are striking, with gorgeously popping colours; there are some plainer elements, but they’re usually used deliberately for dramatic effect.

And the sprites are — mostly — amazing. Some are… not, especially in the first chapter. This might be for visual gags that don’t always land, but I’d guess the reason is simpler — certain aspects of Chapter 1’s art suggest a budget of somewhere between $31 and a handwritten note saying “please”.


A cage of… ‘animals’? — screengrab by author

Thankfully, the visual design gets better every chapter. One must note that the game isn’t particularly ‘cute’, so the art isn’t afraid to get a little creepy, and have its characters pull big faces. I love the unfiltered expressiveness, and I really like it when the visual design breaks boundaries.


One of these sprites is not like the others… — GIF by author

Two standout features are the scenic backgrounds and the incredible sprite animations, both masterclasses in pixel art. The backdrops of your journey are impressively intricate, especially later, and lend a sense of grand scale to offset some flatness in the map.

Meanwhile, sprite animations are super detailed and rendered with astonishing effort and purpose, grounding the characters firmly in the world and making them feel super real. Lead artist Temmie Chang, responsible for the pixel animation, knocks it out of the park.

Battles
At its core, the battle system is a beautiful bullet hell bonanza. But it’s so much more than that.


A typical enemy encounter. — GIF by author

A simplified overview: you can choose to ‘fight’ enemies — using magic or melee — or disavow violence entirely to ‘act’ instead until you gain an enemy’s mercy. Acting looks different for every enemy, and it’s always fun and personality-filled.

A great way to befriend your enemies. — GIF by author

This game is absurdly inventive with its battling, with some really creative ways of utilising the entire battle interface. It never runs out of concepts: gimmick fights and minigames abound as it throws rhythm game mechanics, arcade-style punch-outs, and full-fledged Pac-Man your way as it likes.

There are also secret bosses to reward exploration — they can be hard, but are super worthwhile if only for bragging rights. The challenge is optional, so you never feel stuck.

Although the game supposedly only has one ending, chapters have their own ‘routes’ that can permanently affect the later game. I prefer playing mercifully, but fighting your way through is a perfectly valid way of experiencing the story with its own rewards.
Compelling characters with a fantastically human script
Speaking of which, the story absolutely bangs, with phenomenal narrative and comedic pacing and some of the most interesting and rich characters I’ve encountered in a while. I refuse to spoil too much, but for only four chapters, the narrative is substantial and constantly packed with interesting new turns.
Whatever Kris has got going on as a (creepy, mysterious) player character is a class apart from your typical silent protag. And the core cast is especially vibrant to fill Kris’ silence, blooming quickly into multi-dimensional characters with rich inner lives and a great variety of personality.


Noelle regrets her decisions. — screengrab by author

Everyone is really lovable, and the scripting makes them doubly so: even at its most heroes-save-the-day, it never gets too hammy to take seriously. It’s a script that is fun rather than just funny; more than anything, it captures a human side to the characters that evokes the kind of dumb, playful conversations I might have with my own friends.

Verdict: PLAY IT
Above all, the game is perfectly cohesive. Art, sound, gameplay and narrative all refract off each other in a dazzling interplay, becoming greater than the sum of their parts. Battles have narrative weight and sound design builds humour; music and visuals work in constant harmony to inform gameplay.
I struggle to find anything bad to say about Deltarune. It’s fantastic, and whatever minor nitpicks I had early on were thoroughly steamrolled by massive improvement later. The fact that it’s not yet fully released can’t count against it (I did choose to play it unfinished); in fact, these four chapters are enough to cement it among the best of the best games I’m going to play this year.
The only thing I would ask of Fox is that he embrace his new stories for what they are: new. Undertale nostalgia may have roped in old fans, but Deltarune shines brightest when it steps out of the other game’s shadow. The adventuring party, inventive game design elements and unique emotional core are easily some of its best assets.
Deltarune’s first four chapters are out on Steam for $12.49, with the first two available as a free demo.

At a meeting of the Power Division’s attached entities, the minister was informed that 5,165 consumers had applied for net-metered connections by the cut-off date of Feb 8 — the day the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) notified the Prosumers Regulations 2026, replacing the net-metering framework with net billing and negatively affecting rooftop solar economics for households and industry.
All these applications entailed a net-metering capacity addition of about 250.8 megawatts.

 

“All net metering applications received by Feb 8 be processed under the previous regulations and facilitated by all electricity distribution companies, including K-Electric, under the net metering framework,” the power minister said.
He also issued instructions for immediate implementation to all power distribution companies. “As of Feb 8, a total of 5,165 applications had been submitted across all distribution companies, including K-Electric. The­se applications will collectively add 250.822MW of capacity to the national grid,” an official statement said.
Sources said some of the minister’s close aides opposed the move, arguing it would add to the roughly 6,900MW already installed under net-metering and could encourage litigation by future applicants against the new regulations.
However, the minister contended that net capacity addition in this category was only 250MW, but even if it was 1,500MW equivalent of applications, the government was legally and morally bound to honour its own regulations and commitments.
He was of the view that, within a legal framework, these applicants had accrued rights which could not be denied. However, once the new regulations are notified and in place, citizens will be free to make fresh investments.
The sources said all the Discos and K-Electric were required during the meeting to re-verify their prosumer applications received before Feb 8 and sign respective documents to avoid any exclusions or inclusions on political, financial or other influences.
“The decision by the federal power minister has removed uncertainties surrounding the pending applications,” the Power Division said, adding that the minister directed that transparency be maintained in the processing of all requests. Consumers have also been advised to register any complaints on the issue by calling the helpline at 118.
Earlier, Nepra published draft regulations for public comments on Dec 12, 2025, which prompted the power companies to stop entertaining applications under the previous regulations in place since 2015. The proposal attracted public backlash over both the proposed changes and the retrospective curtailment of benefits
Following widespread criticism, including from parliamentary bodies, the prime minister intervened and restored contractual benefits for existing licensees. How­ever, criticism persisted over the treatment of applications submitted during the period between the draft’s issuance and the formal notification of the new regulations, which took effect from Feb 9.
During public hearings at Nepra, several interveners had also registered their complaints that, despite the regulator seeking only feedback, distribution companies had already stopped accepting new solar applications and were discouraging online registrations through various means.
Nepra Chairman Was­eem Mukhtar and Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar declared such unilateral actions illegal and assured participants they would not be allowed to continue. They said the Power Division should have acted in line with assurances previously given by the power minister, and that the regulator would ensure a reversal of the measures and take strict action against those responsible.

Although the average attendance in the National Assembly has been hovering around 60 per cent for the last many years and the citizenry seems to have made its peace with that, there are statistics which sometimes shock the people. For example, a Fafen report on parliamentarians’ attendance during the 23rd National Assembly session held from Jan 12 to Jan 22 this year indicates that 47 or 14pc members remained absent throughout the session and didn’t attend even a single sitting; 276 or 83pc of the total 332 members skipped at least one session. Similar statistics about the 22nd session indicate that about 70pc of the absent members didn’t seek prior leave from the House.
The system of taking attendance is such that a person marked present might not have been there throughout the sitting and his/her presence for even a fraction of the sitting may be marked as present. Given the fact that the average duration of a sitting ranges from two to three hours (it was two hours during the first year of the present National Assembly), a member attending the sitting may have been present only for a few minutes.
The absence of members from a sitting significantly impacts parliamentary proceedings. Our parliamentary system requires the presence of at least 25pc of the total members which constitutes the quorum. The Assembly proceedings are stopped after a member points out a lack of quorum and the subsequent head count confirms that the minimum required members are not present. A Pildat report indicates that during the past (15th) National Assembly, lack of quorum was pointed out in 105 (23pc) of sittings, and subsequently, 72 or 16pc of the sittings had to be adjourned on this basis. The abrupt termination of a day’s proceedings impacts the productivity of the Assembly as the day’s agenda (order of the day) is left incomplete. During the five years of the 15th National Assembly, on average, less than 50pc (49.47pc to be exact) of the agenda items could be taken up by the Assembly.
Ministers’ absence also impacts the quality of proceedings and some of the agenda items have to be deferred because the relevant minister is not present. During the 23rd session of the current Assembly, for example, 29 federal ministers were supposed to answer members’ questions but a majority (19) of them did not show up on the day allocated for answering questions relating to their ministries. In most cases, the absence of the minister concerned deprives members of the opportunity to ask supplementary questions. Simi­larly, adjournment motions, privilege moti­ons and call-attention notices also require the presence of the minister concerned. The Speaker has repeatedly expressed displeasure at the frequent absence of ministers. Sometimes, ministers of state and parliamentary secretaries do not show up either to fill in for the minister concerned.

Pakistan’s parliament is not the only one which faces issues of low attendance.

Ministers generally take their cue from the prime minister and they are more likely to show up in the House if the PM is particular about his presence. During the life of the 15th Assembly, the attendance of the PM was a mere 13pc (11pc for Imran Khan and 17pc for Shehbaz Sharif).
The attendance becomes more known through the media in the case of plenary sittings but the status of attendance is no different in the case of parliamentary committees. Many meetings are adjourned by the chair because the minister concerned and senior officials of the ministry do not show up at the meeting, leading to a wastage of financial resources spent on convening the meetings.

 

However, one may add that Pakistan’s parliament is not the only one which faces issues of low attendance. Many parliaments face a similar situation and a number of parliaments have waived the condition of the presence of a minimum percentage of members for the validity of the proceedings. For example, the UK parliament and US Congress do not have a quorum requirement. The proceedings of the legislatures continue in these countries even if a single member is present in the House. In the case of the UK parliament, many parliamentary committees hold their meetings concurrently with the plenary. The proceedings of the plenary are watched by the members on CCTV while sitting in their offices or in meeting rooms. Members’ presence is required when a motion or a bill has to be voted on. Bells are rung at that time and members available within parliamentary precincts rush to the chamber to vote. The absence of a member from the precincts during the time of the plenary is, however, rare and frowned upon.
A major reason for our legislators to be casual about their presence during the Assembly sittings has a lot to do with the preferences of a majority of their voters. Most voters are not so keen about their legislators’ performance in the Assembly. A member who works very hard on his parliamentary speeches and, for example, scrutiny of the annual budget, is seldom appreciated by the constituents. People want their elected representatives to attend to their personal issues, which need an influential legislator’s support for resolution due to poor governance. Finding jobs for constituents and their family members is one of the top expectations from legislators. Interceding with the local administration and police on behalf of the constituents to sort out their day-to-day problems is also among the informal responsibilities of legislators. Attending the weddings and funerals of voters’ extended families, too, is a strong preference of constituents. These informal chores are likely to be of greater help to a legislator in his re-election than making a speech in the House. The weak attendance of legislators is, therefore, not because of their lethargy. Instead, it is a reflection of the ground realities of our own governance and culture.

In a social media post, Trump said he would order Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and other agencies to release the information, calling the matter “extremely interesting and important.”







Earlier in the day, Trump, without providing evidence, accused former President Barack Obama of improperly disclosing classified information when discussing aliens publicly, saying Obama “made a big mistake.”
“He took it out of classified information … He’s not supposed to be doing that,” Trump told reporters while traveling to Georgia.
During an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama was asked if aliens were real.
“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in … Area 51. There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said.
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada that fringe theorists have speculated holds alien bodies and a crashed spaceship. CIA archives released in 2013 said it was a test site for top-secret spy planes.
Pentagon investigations
There was no indication in Obama’s remarks that the former president released classified information. Obama’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama said in an Instagram post on Sunday.
In the post, Obama explained his belief that aliens exist by saying the statistical odds of life beyond Earth were high because the universe is so vast. He added that the chances of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth were low, given the distance.
Following his comments on Obama, Trump added that he had not seen evidence that aliens exist, saying, “I don’t know if they’re real or not.”
In recent years, the Pentagon has investigated reports of UFOs, and senior military leaders said in 2022 they found no evidence to suggest that aliens had visited Earth or crash-landed here.
A 2024 Pentagon report said US government investigations since the end of World War Two had found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology and most sightings were misidentified ordinary objects and phenomena.
The website of the National Archives and Records Administration says it has records related to UFOs across numerous collections.</p><small>2026-02-20 04:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6997b4f24ec34.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974529/eyes-wide-shut' target='_blank'><strong>Eyes wide shut</strong></a><br><p>THE eye condition of the former, imprisoned prime minister Imran Khan has become the eye of the storm in national politics. This hot news has flooded all media channels and social media platforms. Parliament was cordoned off and parliamentarians confined for three days in the parliament building. Roads were blocked in the capital and there was rioting at various points between Islamabad and Peshawar. Opposition parties staged a dharna, giving a list of conditions for ending it. Despite sore ties these days, former cricket captains from across the border expressed sympathy for Pakistan’s former skipper. The government first kept its eyes shut to the problem and their spin doctors called it a storm in a teacup. The opposition was up in arms.
The combined effect of the Supreme Court and the report of the amicus curiae, the TTAP dharna and the media, eventually led to the establishment of a medical board followed by the visit of a delegation of specialist public and private doctors. The doctors’ objective assessment has provided some relief that the damage to the eye is not as extensive as first reported and hopefully will improve with treatment. Reportedly, a large number of tests are also being done to look into any systemic underlying cause for venous occlusion. So, things seem to be on track where tackling the medical problem is concerned.

 

But the underlying systemic problem is not just medical; it is also political. The eye affliction is underpinned by a widespread political infection yet to be addressed. It is affecting every sphere of life in Pakistan. As a result, people are becoming poorer, hapless and hopeless. Foreign direct investment is nowhere to be seen. Even local businesses are shutting down because of the very high cost of doing business. Unemployment is high and young professionals are leaving the country in droves.
The continued political instability, accentuated and normalised by the underlying extractive political and economic institutions, is suffocating. When children continue to fall in gutters and die because the government concerned can’t cover the manholes and local government elections are not held, despite a constitutional responsibility to do so, primarily because political juntas have to share political and financial resources with district governments, then it is a case of elite capture.

Treatment lies in the treatment of the cause.

Let me try to return to the eye issue as I am pushing myself to confine this column to the eye ailment which I am finding very difficult. Let me try again.
First, the principle. The healthcare of any prisoner in government custody is the government’s responsibility. This is the established law and practice globally. Even the healthcare of prisoners of war is the responsibility of the captors. Health in Prisons: a WHO guide to the essentials in prison health states that, first and foremost, all those working in the prison system must understand that imprisonment affects human health and that inmates possess the right to the highest attainable standards of health.
Another very important principle is that of the equivalence of care. This means that “prisoners must enjoy the same standards of healthcare available in the community”. This principle is part of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. These were adopted in 2015 and named in honour of Nelson Mandela and his 27 years in prison; they are commonly known as the Nelson Mandela Rules.
However trivial or abstract we consider the global standards, they still remain important as a guide for developing national laws and conducting our affairs.
And now a word about the eye ailment CRVO — central retinal vein occlusion — if this is still the diagnosis. In medicine, anything involving the retina is serious. In the simplest terms, the retina is a very sensitive layer of tissue, made up of specialised cells called rods (for night and peripheral vision) and cones (for colour and sharp central vision) that forms the back wall of the eye. It detects light and converts it into neuronal signals which travel through the optic nerve to the brain where these electrical signals are interpreted as images. If the retinas of both eyes are not functioning then the person cannot see and goes blind.
Arteries carry blood laden with oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and the veins bring the blood back after unloading these. If the central vein of the retina gets blocked, the blood cannot drain properly from the retina. As a result, back pressure builds up and blood and fluid start leaking into the retina. It leads to swelling in the macula (the central vision area) and the vision becomes blurred. If not attended to, the damage can be irreversible but if there is timely assessment and treatment the damage can be minimised and the vision restored.
After proper examination by a group of specialist ophthalmologists, it has been determined, thankfully, that the extent of damage was not that large and that hopefully things will normalise.
But whether they will normalise politically anytime soon is the billion-dollar question. I remember a professor from my medical student days who would repeatedly emphasise in his lectures that ‘treatment is the treatment of cause’. If we continue to treat the symptoms, they may provide temporary relief but the symptoms will keep returning and most of the time with a higher degree of intensity and vengeance, as the underlying disease keeps festering.
Today, it is an inflamed eye, tomorrow it will be something else. We’ll continue to circle in a downward spiral unless all powerful stakeholders start seeing beyond their noses, assess the turmoil we are in and intervene appropriately, effectively and sustainably, before it is too late.

Talking to foreign media outlets recently, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that Pakistan will again strike targets inside Afghanistan if terrorism emanating from that country continues. He has suggested that India and the Afghan Taliban are working in cahoots, waging a ‘proxy war’ against Pakistan.
According to the minister, the present circumstances are the result of “what we did” in Afghanistan during the 1980s and post-9/11, a reference to the Afghan jihad and the foreign invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept 11 attacks. He has made such remarks several times in the past.
While such reactions from officialdom may be expected due to the high number of terrorist attacks, and Kabul’s frustrating lack of action against violent groups based on Afghan soil, military action of the sort the defence minister is advocating should be absolutely the last resort. In particular, making such comments publicly is ill-advised, despite the obstinance of the other side, and will only serve to further vitiate the atmosphere in the region.
That Taliban-ruled Afghanistan has become a hotbed — once again — of global terrorist outfits is beyond dispute. Several UN assessments have confirmed this, with the last Security Council report saying that the TTP may develop into an “extra-regional threat”. The same report points out that no foreign state actually believes the Taliban when they claim they are not harbouring terrorists.

 

Pakistan is not alone in blaming Kabul for not taking action against violent terrorists; Tajikistan has expressed similar complaints. However, while the problem is clear, the solution is not that straightforward. Pakistan and Afghanistan traded fire last year, and while that exchange may have brought down levels of infiltration, the TTP remain ensconced in Afghanistan.
While Pakistan should defend itself resolutely and ensure that no armed actors are able to violate its territory, an active military campaign against Kabul may not deliver favourable results. In fact, it may further complicate matters. Therefore, the best option for Pakistan is to engage with friendly states, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkiye, which also have relations with the Taliban, to, at the very least, get a commitment from Kabul to stop cross-border terrorism.
Afghanistan also desires to be integrated into regional trade networks, and here Pakistan can work with China, Russia and the Central Asian states to convince Kabul that regional commerce will only be possible if it stops ‘exporting’ armed violence to its neighbours. As for the apparent India-Taliban nexus, Pakistan should raise the issue from global platforms so that New Delhi’s machinations are known to the world.

Pakistan, however, was not named among the five nations who have committed troops for the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.

 

Trump brought together allies from around the world — many authoritarians, with few Western democrats who traditionally ally with the United States — to hail his peacemaking at the first Board of Peace meeting.
Presiding with a gavel over the meeting in the gleaming Washington building of the former US Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican, Trump hailed the “powerful people” who joined his board.
“We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We’ll make it successful,” Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme-song “YMCA” came on the speakers.
“We will make it peaceful, and we will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen,” Trump said.
Troops pledges
The Board of Peace came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
The plan’s second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas.
In a first for an Arab country, Morocco announced it was ready to send police as well as officers to the nascent International Stabilisation Force.
The force’s American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo were also sending troops and announced that an Indonesian officer would serve as his deputy.
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, earlier said it was ready to send 8,000 troops — nearly half of the 20,000 sought.
Trump hailed Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who attended, calling the former military officer accused of human rights abuses in East Timor a “tough cookie.”
Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian diplomat named high representative for Gaza by the United States, also announced the beginning of recruitment for a post-Hamas police force in Gaza and said 2,000 people had applied in the first hours.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi was also asked about the ISF and Pakistan’s view on it during a weekly briefing in Islamabad today.
In response, he said: “We understand that a decision is awaited on the contours of the mandate of the International Stabilisation Force, and till such time, we’re not in a position to take any decision on this matter.
“We have identified our red lines quite explicitly. The deputy prime minister and the foreign minister has done so here from this platform, and elsewhere. Pakistan can be part of a peacekeeping mandate, but we would not be part of any disarming/ demilitarisation mandates. This discussion at [the Board of Peace meeting in] Washington might take place today. We will update you as and when these developments take place.”
For his part, Trump said during the moot in Washington that he hoped the use of force to disarm Hamas would not be necessary. He said Hamas had promised to disarm and it “looks like they’re going to be doing that, but we’ll have to find out.”
Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, representing Israel at the meeting, demanded disarmament of Hamas and “a fundamental deradicalisation process” in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Israel that Hamas will be disarmed one way or the other. “Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma - to disarm peacefully or disarmed forcefully,” he said.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must “monitor the ceasefire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression”. Disarmament could be discussed, he said, without directly committing to it.
Gaza reconstruction
Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said the United States would contribute $10bn to the Board of Peace. Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and whether Congress had approved the contribution he announced for the institution, which has drawn criticism for its opaque nature.
He also announced that contributing nations had raised $7bn as an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised at least $1bn. White House Press Secretary said more than $6.5bn was pledged, presumably excluding Trump’s offer.
Trump also said FIFA will raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza and that the United Nations will chip in $2 billion for humanitarian assistance.
“Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering,” said the realtor-turned-president, who has spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.
Trump will wield veto power over the Board of Peace and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently rather than enjoy a two-year stint will need to pay $1bn.
Critics say the Board of Peace remains vague, including how it would interact with existing institutions, including the United Nations, to which Trump has drastically cut support.
“It’s a confused mix of ambition and narcissism, unleavened by any effort at intellectual coherence,” said Bruce Jones, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

The cumulative impact of Israel’s military conduct during the conflict in Gaza and blockade of the territory, has inflicted living conditions “increasingly incompatible with Palestinians’ continued existence as a group in Gaza”, said the UN human rights office.
“Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza,” the office said in a report.
“This, together with forcible transfers, which appear to aim at a permanent displacement, raise concerns over ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank.”
The report covered Nov 1, 2024 to Oct 31, 2025. It highlighted the Israeli security forces’ “systematic use of unlawful force” in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem.
The report also pointed to “widespread” arbitrary detention and the “extensive unlawful demolition” of Palestinian homes. The aim, it said, was to “systematically discriminate, oppress, control and dominate the Palestinian people”.
These actions are altering “the character, status and demographic composition of the occupied West Bank, raising serious concerns of ethnic cleansing”, it added.
‘Inhumane choice’
In Gaza, the report condemned the continued killing and maiming of “unprecedented numbers of civilians”, the spread of famine, and destruction of the “remaining civilian infrastructure”. During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it said.
“Palestinians faced the inhumane choice of either starving to death or risking being killed while trying to get food,” it added. The famine, the malnutrition and the “foreseeable and repeatedly foretold” deaths directly resulted from actions taken by the Israeli government, said the report.
Any use of starvation of civilians as a method of war constitutes a war crime, it said — and depending on the intent, it could also constitute genocide.
During the period covered by the report, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups continued to hold Israeli and foreign hostages seized during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel — dead or alive — as “bargaining tools”.
The rights office said the treatment of the hostages amounted to war crimes. “Israeli forces, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups committed serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza, gross violations and abuses of international human rights law, and atrocity crimes,” the report concluded.
On Tuesday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories. The West Bank would form the largest part of any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel’s religious right view it as Israeli land.

The appellants were convicted of killing six police officials and taking several others hostage during an operation launched by police on April 13, 2016.
The appeals were filed by a number of convicts, including Ghulam Rasool alias Chotu, Ishaq, Nadir and Qasim against the confirmation of their death sentences by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Sept 12, 2024. Earlier, the capital punishment was handed out to the convicts for committing murder by Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Multan.
Through the appeals, the convicts have sought to set aside the convictions and death sentence.
A two-judge Supreme Court ben­ch, headed by Justice Malik Sha­hzad Ahmad Khan and comprising Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, postponed further proceedings until April 7, 2026, due to the unavailability of the third member of the bench, Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
The adjournment was necessit­a­ted because the case was originally scheduled before a three-judge bench, but was later reconstituted.
On Thursday, Punjab Addi­tional Prosecutor General Rai Akhtar Hus­sain represented the prosecution, while Advocate Sardar Usman Khosa represented the petitioners.
During the hearing, Justice Malik Shahzad observed that a two-judge bench could not hear the case since it involved the death penalty.
Rai Akhtar Hussain highlighted that the appellant convicts were members of the infamous Chotu gang. At this, Justice Malik Sha­h­zad recalled that the gang had been infamous in Punjab, but remarked that the Crime Control Department (CCD) might have eliminated most of the criminals by now.
The counsel representing the appellants, however, requested the court to adjourn the proceedings until the following Tuesday or, if that was not possible, to fix a date during the month of Ramazan, describing it as a blessed month and noting that Pakistan had won the World Cup during the same month in 1992.
Justice Aqeel Abbasi told the counsel to refrain from mentioning the World Cup. Justice Malik Shahzad quipped that some people found references to the World Cup unpleasant.
The counsel replied that the Champions Trophy had also been won during Ramazan in 2017.
Earlier, the LHC, in its judgement authored by Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan, recalled that gangs such as the Sikhan Gang, Indhar Gang, Changwani Gang and Chotu Gang, along with several hardened and desperate proclaimed offenders armed with sophisticated weapons, had posed a significant challenge to local authorities and local law enforcement agencies.
These gangs targeted numerous civilians, creating fear among the local population and consolidating their influence.
In his judgement, Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan observed that anti-state activities were rising day by day as criminals were taking the law into their own hands. Such elements were damaging the fabric of society and, therefore, must be dealt with an iron hand.

“Against a current operational surplus of Rs2.4 billion, immediate obligations amount to Rs27.4 billion, highlighting a structural funding shortfall that requires strategic support and long-term financial restructuring to ensure sustainable operations,” Paki­stan Railways’ member of finance told the National Assembly’s Stan­ding Committee on Parli­amentary Affairs, which met here with Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, MNA, in the chair.
The secretary of parliamentary affairs briefed the committee on the status of complaints received about Pakistan Railways pensioners to the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit.







The member of finance told the committee that PR has undertaken active liability management to address longstanding emp­loyee obligations, disbursing Rs5.622bn tow­ards commutation payments (cleared up to 31 May, 2023) and Rs1.103bn towards leave encashment (cleared up to 31 March, 2024).
He said while these measures reflect improved financial discipline and commitment to institutional responsibility, the huge gap between available resources and the obligations warranted some action.
The representative from National Highway Authority (NHA) briefed the committee on the problems caused by traffic congestion on the Motorway Toll Plaza near Phoolnagar, Qasoor district.
The committee was informed that in compliance with the approval of NHA Executive Board for revenue enhancement a new toll plaza was established at Phoolnagar, located at KM 1215-1216 in March 2025.
Initially, a temporary structured toll plaza (3 × lanes on each side) was established on the existing road. Due to limited numbers of lanes, traffic congestion occurred frequently.
Due to establishment of new toll collection regime, the commuters’ response was very slow for toll payments, resulting in long queues of locals at toll booths. Currently, a new 12-lane (6x lanes each side) toll plaza is 90 per cent completed.

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an appeal moved by an individual seeking to establish a marriage with his niece and imposed exemplary costs of Rs1 million for what it termed ‘frivolous and vexatious’ litigation aimed at coercing and intimidating a young woman.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and also comprising Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan and Justice Shakeel Ahmad, the SC bench also disapproved of the use of judicial proceedings as an instrument of coercion and harassment.
Authored by Justice Hassan, the judgement regretted that the present litigation disclosed a sorrowful pattern in which the petitioner, Muhammad Shahzad, despite having failed to establish the alleged Nikah before three forums, persisted in invoking the process of law to pressure and morally intimidate the respondent.
“The record reflects that the respondent, a young woman, has been compelled to undergo repeated, invasive and demeaning scrutiny through a defence which has been concurrently found to be unsubstantiated,” regretted the seven-page judgement.
Muhammad Shahzad had moved the appeal for jactitation of marriage, whereas he instituted a connected suit for restitution of conjugal rights, asserting that a Nikah in accordance with Sharia [Islamic laws] had been solemnised between the parties on April 3, 2020.
Both suits were consolidated and decided through a consolidated judgement dated April 17, 2023, whereby the suit for jactitation of marriage was decreed and the petitioner’s suit for restitution of conjugal rights was dismissed.
Nikah controversy
The appeal preferred by the petitioner was also dismissed. The controversy, in essence, revolved around whether any valid Nikah had in fact been solemnised between the parties and whether the petitioner could establish such marriage through legally admissible and confidence-inspiring evidence.
The high court, while exercising constitutional jurisdiction, examined the record and maintained the findings, thereby dismissing the petitioner’s petition.
“It is evident from the record that the petitioner was declared to be the biological father of a minor child born to the respondent. In any event, even if the petitioner’s version of marriage is discarded, as it has been concurrently by the courts below, the petitioner cannot be permitted to evade the consequences of his own conduct,” the SC judgement stated.
“The minor child is an innocent life and cannot be left unprotected,” it observed, adding that the law did not permit a child to be deprived of sustenance, dignity and lawful support merely because the relationship between the parents was disputed, unlawful or the subject matter of criminal proceedings.
“It must also be emphasised that the dignity of a person is inviolable and enjoys constitutional protection under Article 14 of the Constitution,” the judgement said, adding that the courts could not be passive venues for the perpetuation of social prejudice, nor could they permit their process to become a means of inflicting secondary victimisation upon women who approach the courts for vindication of their lawful rights.
Paramount consideration
“Frivolous allegations and contrived pleas, particularly those aimed at undermining the identity, character and dignity of a woman, cannot be countenanced in any civilised system of justice,” Justice Hassan observed, emphasising that in matters concerning children, the paramount consideration remained the welfare and best interests of the child.
This approach is also consistent with Pakistan’s constitutional obligations under Articles 9, 14, 25 and 35 of the Constitution, as well as Pakistan’s international commitments under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which mandate the protection of children without discrimination.
“Equally, it needs to be reiterated that the welfare and rights of a minor child cannot be made hostage to the unlawful conduct, disputes or defences of adults. Even where the child is alleged to have been born outside wedlock, the law does not permit such a child to be treated as a person without entitlement,” the judgement read.
“The right to maintenance and protection is a right vested in the child, and once biological paternity is established in accordance with law, the corresponding obligation of maintenance follows as a legal and moral consequence,” it added.
“The stigma of illegitimacy cannot be permitted to become a shield for a biological father to evade responsibility, nor can it justify the deprivation of an innocent child,” it stated.

Around two dozen world leaders and senior officials met for the first meeting of the board, which was set up after the United States, Qatar and Egypt negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of war in the Gaza Strip.
“We agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza,” Netanyahu said during a televised speech at a military ceremony on Thursday.
The meeting in Washington will also look at how to launch the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that will ensure security in Gaza. One of the most sensitive issues before the board is the future of Hamas, which fought the war with Israel and still exerts influence in the territory.
Disarmament of the group is a central Israeli demand and a key point in negotiations over the ceasefire’s next stage.
US officials including Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump’s friend and roving negotiator, have insisted that solid progress is being made and that Hamas is feeling pressure to give up weapons.
Israel has suggested sweeping restrictions, including seizing small personal rifles from Hamas. It remains unclear whether, or how, the Palestinian technocratic committee formed to handle day-to-day governance of Gaza will address the issue of demilitarisation.
The 15-member National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) will operate under the supervision of the “Board of Peace”, and its head, Ali Shaath, is attending the meeting in Washington on Thursday.

• Trump says Tehran has ‘10 days’ to make a deal with Washington, or ‘bad things will happen’• Kremlin urges restraint; Germany pulls troops out of Iraq; Poland tells citizens to leave Iran
WASHINGTON: War clouds are looming over the Middle East, as US warplanes and aircraft carriers head toward Iran in preparation for possible military action.
Renewing his threats towards Tehran, President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that the country has around 10 days to reach a deal with Washington, or “bad things will happen”.

 

CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military would be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Lea­vitt warned on Wednesday there were “many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran”.
“Iran would be very wise to make a deal with Pre­sident Trump,” she said.
Trump’s comments came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran saying, “If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine”.
The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that Trump had been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper.
The US has, meanwhile, been building up its military forces near Iran, incl­uding warships, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, laying the foundation for a potentially sustained campaign against Iran — should Trump give the order.
Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.
Speaking at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, Trump even praised the “magnificent” B-2 bombers that “totally decimated the nuclear potential” of Iran last summer, saying they helped bring peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years.
Iran has also sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps holding war games earlier this week in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships.
Amid the escalating warnings, Poland on Thursday ordered all its citizens in Iran to “leave immediately”.
Germany meanwhile moved troops out of northern Iraq, reducing its footprint to the minimum necessary to keep its base there functional, citing escalating regional tensions.
Dozens of German soldiers have been relocated away from the base in Erbil, capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region.
Russia has also called for restraint, with a Kremlin spokesperson saying, “We are currently witnessing an unprecedented escalation of tension in the region, but we still hope that political and diplomatic means and negotiations will continue to prevail in the search for a settlement”.

He was speaking during a meeting with GB caretaker Minister for Information Technology Ghulam Abbas in Islamabad on Thursday to discuss the proposed auction and broader connectivity issues in the mountainous region.
Mr Abbas said GB must not lag behind other parts of the country in access to high-speed internet, stressing that impro­ved digital connectivity was vital for e-governance, online education, telemedicine and IT-based businesses. He noted that limited bandwidth and infrastructure gaps had constrained socio-economic development, particularly affecting youth, students, entrepreneurs and the tourism sector.
The PTA chairman said preparations for the auction of additional spectrum were underway. The authority has written to the GB Council, the AJK Council, and the Ministry of IT and Telecom to initiate groundwork for the regulatory framework in both regions.
He said technical testing, regulatory review and spectrum arrangements would require additional time, necessitating a separate auction for GB and AJK. “Our preference as regulator is that spectrum should be provided free of cost in GB and AJK so that operators can invest their capital expenditure in technical infrastructure,” Mr Rehman said.

 

Amir Shahzad, Director General (Licen­cing) at the PTA, suggested that the GB government follow AJK’s example by abolishing right-of-way (RoW) charges for telecom infrastructure. The federal government has already directed its departments and ministries to provide free access for IT and telecom fibre networks.
The AJK government recently waived RoW charges for IT-related infrastructure across several departments and introduced a one-window facility for no-objection certificates for telecom tower installation and fibre deployment. Applications will be processed by the relevant deputy commissioner’s office within 15 days, and failure to raise objections will be deemed approval.
Officials expect the measures to reduce delays and financial barriers, encouraging faster expansion of broadband infrastructure in AJK.
Mr Abbas told Dawn that he had asked the GB law department to brief him on the region’s RoW policy, adding that he supported abolishing such charges to accelerate internet penetration.

• PM accepts Tariq Bugti’s resignation, Wani named interim president• Outgoing chief imposes two-year ban on captain Ammad Butt before quitting• PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi meets players, hands ‘compensation’ cheques• PSB blames PHF for mismanagement; Bugti alleges board delayed payments• Shake-up follows Australia tour fiasco, when players were left without hotel upon arrival
LAHORE / ISLAMABAD: Amid a deepening crisis in Pakistan hockey, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday accepted the resignation of Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) President Tariq Hussain Bugti and appointed Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) Federal Secretary Mohiy­uddin Ahmed Wani as ad-hoc president of the federation.
The premier also accepted the resignations of PHF Secretary Rana Mujahid and Treasurer Shahid Pervaiz Bhandara. Their replacements had not been announced until late Thursday night.
The developments came amid controversy over the national team’s tour of Australia for the FIH Pro League, where accommodation arrangements could not be secured on time, forcing players to spend several hours on the road.
The team’s overall performance in the Pro League also came under criticism. In addition, PHF elections had been facing delays. Mr Bugti had been appointed by interim prime minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar to hold elections but did not complete the process during his tenure.
Similarly, in his tenure, Mr Bugti-led PHF was accused of inaction over alleged corruption, pointed out by the Auditor General of Pakistan. There are more than 100 audit paras related to the PHF, and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has been probing the matter for over a year.
Speaking after his appointment, Mr Wani said the governance mechanism of the PHF would be improved. “In the next six weeks, we will prepare a business plan for the PHF and take steps to run this federation on professional grounds,” he said.
He added that IPC would form a working group with all sports boards and education bodies to focus on grassroots development and that international trainers and coaches would also be engaged.
“There is no shortage of resources, but the PHF is facing financial management issues. We will work on this,” he said, adding that he would ensure free, fair and transparent elections. “Hockey, being the national game, is close to our hearts and we will take every possible step to bring positive change,” he said.
National captain ‘banned’
Earlier on Thursday, before the prime minister’s decision, Mr Bugti announced his resignation, but not before imposing a two-year ban on national captain Ammad Shakeel Butt, citing findings of a committee regarding alleged misconduct.
“I received a message (from a certain quarter) and I am resigning from the post as it is not a big issue. Had the prime minister asked me six months earlier, I would have left,” Mr Bugti said, appealing to the prime minister and Field Marshal Asim Munir to constitute an independent committee to probe the entire episode. He said he was ready to face any punishment if found responsible.
However, shortly after Mr Bugti’s resignation, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi met the hockey players, including Ammad Butt and Hanan Shahid. In a message on X, Mr Naqvi said: “I am not becoming Hockey Federation President but we will assist players till this turmoil ends.”
Talking to the media after the meeting, Mr Butt said Mr Naqvi directed that a training camp be set up in Lahore from Friday for the World Cup qualifiers to be held in Egypt and that immediate steps be taken to hire foreign coaches. Mr Butt said former Pakistan coach Roelant Oltmans had been contacted and might join the team directly in Egypt.
On the reported two-year ban, Mr Butt said Mr Naqvi told him there was no ban and that the same team which toured Australia would travel to Egypt. The ban had reportedly been imposed under the PHF constitution, raising questions over the process for its reversal.
The PCB later issued a statement confirming Mr Naqvi’s meeting with the players and announcing that cheques of Rs1,000,000 had been distributed to each member of the national team, which took second position in the last six international tournaments.
The cricket board said Mr Naqvi had assured full cooperation in streamlining the affairs of the players and confirmed that tickets, hotel accommodation and kits would be arranged for the World Cup qualifying round.
Outgoing PHF president Mr Bugti told Dawn that arrangements for the qualifiers had already been made through a grant from the Balochistan government.
PSB-PHF blame game
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) issued a statement rejecting allegations levelled by the PHF and placing responsibility for the Australia tour’s mismanagement on the federation.
The PSB said it had fulfilled all financial obligations for the FIH Pro League Phase 2 in Hobart and made timely payments. It alleged that the PHF had submitted visa applications late and with incomplete information, delaying the team’s departure from Feb 2 to Feb 5.

 

According to the PSB, it bore Rs27.1 million in air ticket expenses and an additional Rs9.7m burden caused by the visa delays. It said that, at the PHF’s request, an advance of 49,280 Australian dollars was issued for hotel accommodation, along with daily allowances of USD 1,610 per player and USD 3,000 for miscellaneous expenses.
The PSB also stated that while the PHF had sought a total grant of Rs350m for the Pro League, the government approved Rs250m, with the remaining amount to be arranged by the federation. It alleged that most of the PSB’s grant had been spent on salaries and foreign tours of PHF officials, prompting the board to stop issuing direct grants.
In contrast, Mr Bugti had alleged that the PSB failed to make timely payments for hotel bookings and criticised the formation of a probe committee comprising PSB officials. He also urged the formation of a Pakistan Hockey Board and the transfer of stadium control to the PHF to generate funds.
Meanwhile, Hockey legend Shahbaz Ahmed Senior, who had opposed Pakistan’s participation in the Pro League, said the national game deserved special treatment from the government.
He criticised the heavy expenditure on the league and said the funds should have been directed towards grassroots development in schools, colleges and districts.
Pakistan, a four-time World Cup winner and three-time Olympic champion, has faced a prolonged decline in international hockey over the past 30 years, amid repeated allegations of poor administration and negligence in the PHF officialdom, non-existent planning and upgrading, sheer lack of accountability, nepotism and a high frequency of changes in the federation.

• SBCA chief concedes original documents pertaining to action against building violations not found           
KARACHI: The Gul Plaza Judicial Commission on Thursday summoned the municipal commissioner as an official of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) could not assist it and was unaware about the facts and record of the ill-fated building.
The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court also recorded the testimonies of various officials, including Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) Director General Muzammil Hussain Halepoto, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, Deputy Commissioner (South) Javed Nabi Khoso and Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
At the outset of the hearing on Thursday, Director Land (lease) KMC Syed Adnan Hyder Zaidi turned up to testify before the commission, but he could not offer a satisfactory reply to various questions about the legal status and lease of the plot in question.
The commission summoned the municipal commissioner, who is the top bureaucrat of the KMC administration, to appear in person for recording  statement and provision of relevant records on Feb 23.
‘SBCA has no record of notices sent to Gul Plaza admin over violations’
SBCA DG Halepoto deposed that one Anwar Ali got the building plan approved in 1979, the construction started in 1986, while the lease of the plot had expired in 1983 and the same was renewed in 1991.
A revised plan was approved in 1998, and dozens of unauthorised shops were regularised in 2003, and an application was filed seeking a sale no objection certificate (NOC) in 2005, but in fact all the shops were already sold out apart from the basement, he added. 
He also maintained that permission was sought in 2015 to build additional floors, but the same was turned down. The mezzanine floor of the building was not available in the records of the authority, and there were a total of 18 gates in the building, he added.
When the commission inquired about records and action taken by the SBCA over these violations, the SBCA chief conceded that only photocopies of such documents were available, as the original record could not be found. 
He also claimed that the role of SBCA ended after issuing the completion certificate of a building and therefore, the management of the building was responsible. However, action can be taken if the complaints were filed or on the recommendations made by building inspectors.
The commission also confronted him about the number of notices issued to Gul Plaza management regarding such violations. In reply, the SBCA chief said that no such record was available, and that it was an uphill task to inspect all buildings across the province, as the authority has only 1,381 employees.
KWSC chief says nearest hydrant was 14 kilometres away from shopping mall
KWSC CEO Siddiqui deposed that an emergency was declared at all hydrants soon after receiving information about the blaze from the chief fire officer and the nearest hydrant was 14 kilometres away from the ill-fated building.
Replying to a question of commission about dedicated water lines for fire stations, he stated that water was provided to fire tenders for six hours on a daily basis from the hydrants and a water storage facility was also available at the headquarters of the fire brigade.
DC (South) Khoso testified that he was rushed to Gul Plaza after receiving information about the blaze and contacted the emergency services while many people had managed to come out of the building in 20 to 30 minutes after the fire broke out.
Dr Summaiya Syed testified that initially, eight injured persons were brought to the Burns Centre at the Civil Hospital, and they were discharged after providing necessary treatment.
She also stated that six and 19 bodies were brought on Jan 18 and Jan 19, and therefore, human remains were brought to the hospital in the next five days, and the same were beyond recognition and DNA samples were collected for identification.
Pakistan Infrastructure Development Company General Manager Shafi Chachar informed the commission that the M. A. Jinnah Road has been partially closed due to the Green Line extension project, and hurdles were removed for fire tenders to timely reach the site.
Management doesn’t have sub-lease record: Pasta
Gul Plaza Traders Association president Tanveer Pasta, who had recorded his statement on Wednesday, also turned up on Thursday in pursuance of the commission’s directive and further testified that usually, the plaza was closed between 10:30 to 11pm, and the gates of the building gradually started closing from around 10:30, and it took 20 to 25 minutes for the complete shutdown.
He said that 280 CCTV cameras were installed at the building and in 2003 the parking was shifted from the basement to the rooftop.
He further stated that the record of sub-lease was not available with the management of the building, as it was only collecting maintenance charges and managing the CCTV cameras and watchmen.
The commission asked a provincial law officer to inform it whether the Rescue 1122 service came within the domain of the provincial or city governments. 
Adjourning the hearing till Monday, the commission also handed over questionnaires to these officials/witnesses and directed them to submit the same at the next hearing.

The premier expressed these views during the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump, in Washington.
“The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” PM Shehbaz emphasised in his address.
“The people of Palestine must exercise full control of their land and their future, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions,” he added.







PM Shehbaz further said, “We must work together towards a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination through the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and contiguous state of Palestine in line with relevant resolutions”.
He expressed the hope that under Trump’s “visionary and dynamic leadership, we will ensure a just and lasting resolution to the issue of Palestine”.
“Today is a day which will mark a place in the annals of history, that through your efforts, through your untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved. [It will be your legacy] in all times to come,” PM Shehbaz said, addressing Trump.
The meeting in Washington was held months after the board was initially proposed in September 2025. It was formally established last month.
Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository and Trump has designated the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the Board’s headquarters, where today’s meeting was held.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.
However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations by Israel.
Earlier in his speech, PM Shehbaz said while addressing Trump that “may God reward you and make you successful in your efforts to bring lasting peace in Gaza”.
“We deeply appreciate your unique initiatives and your dynamic leadership in advancing peaceful solutions to conflicts across the globe. Your bold diplomacy has surely brought calm to many international serious hotspots.
“Your timely and very effective intervention to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people. You have truly proved to be a man of peace. And let me say you are truly a saviour of South Asia,” PM Shehbaz said.
Trump praises PM Shehbaz, CDF Munir
Speaking before PM Shehbaz, Trump mentioned him, as well as Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, at the meeting.
Trump said he had been endorsing candidates in the US, but now he was also endorsing foreign leaders, and went on to name PM Shehbaz among the leaders he was acknowledging at the meeting.
“Prime Minister Sharif — I like this man — of Pakistan. Because there was some fighting going on when I got to know him and your Field Marshal, great general, great Field Marshal, great guy.
“I got to meet the prime minister, and he said in front of our Chief of Staff Susie Wiles … that ‘you know nobody knows this, but I believe that President Trump saved 25 million lives when he stopped the war between us and India’,” Trump recalled.

 


Addressing PM Shehbaz, he added, “You made that statement … it was really a beautiful thing.”
Referring to the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025, he said: “That war was raging, planes were being shot down.
“And it was Pakistan and India, and I got on the phone with both of them. And I knew them a little bit. I knew Prime Minister Modi very well, actually. I got to know Pakistan through a little trade. They were trying to make too good a deal, and I got a little upset with them.
“In the end, they got what they wanted, and they made a good deal, and I got to like them — the prime minister, the Field Marshal, who is a tough man, a tough, good fighter, a serious fighter.”
Trump said he called both Pakistan and India after he got to know about the May conflict, during which “many planes were shot down”.
“I called them and said listen, I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up. And they said, ‘No, no no!’ That was both of them … And they do a lot of business with the US and they softened up all of a sudden. A little bit of a pullback by one and then the other, and all of a sudden, we worked out a deal,” Trump said.
He added that he had also warned the two countries of imposing a 200 per cent tariff if they continued to fight.







“One of them, I won’t say which one, said ‘No! You can’t do that’. They both wanted to fight, but when it came to losing a lot of money, they said, ‘We don’t want to fight.’
“And we solved that … in two to three days,” Trump continued, before he thanked Shehbaz.
“That was a very big deal; people have no idea. A lot of them say they weren’t fighting. [But] they were fighting. Eleven jets were shot down, very expensive jets,” he added.
Trump said he believed “a lot of progress was made in the relationship”, adding that Modi was a “great man and a great guy”.
‘Big day’
Trump began his address by saying that “this is a big day”.
“Lots of people watching, especially from other countries […] We have a large group of leaders, and the ones who aren’t here are watching on Zoom. I hope they enjoy it,” he added.
The US president further said, “What we are doing is very simple — peace. It’s called the Board of Peace, and it’s all about — an easy word to say, but a hard word to produce — peace.
“We are going to produce it. We have been doing a really good job, and some of these leaders that are with us have helped me very much.”
He then went on to reiterate his claim of settling eight wars.
“And I think a ninth … turned out to be a tougher one. I thought that was going to be the easiest one. But, with war, you never know what’s easy and what’s not so easy. But, we have had a great relationship, and I became friendly with so many of the people.
“And I appreciate you being here. These are great people, these are great leaders,” he added.
Trump said the Board of Peace was one of “the most important and consequential things I think that I will be involved in”, again reiterating his claim of settling wars.
He said, “Some of which were 32, 34 or 37 years long. That’s a long time. [But] we ended it within about two days, each one of those. But, we have some other work to do, and we are getting it done.”
On the Gaza issue, he said it was “very complex”, commending US envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, among others, for an “amazing job” in this connection.
He then went on to say that the Board of Peace was “the most consequential board”.
“Certainly, in terms of power and in terms of prestige, there has never been anything close because these are the greatest world leaders,” he said, adding that almost everybody had accepted the invitation to join the board, and those had not would do.
“Some are playing a little cute. This doesn’t work. You can’t play cute with me,” he remarked.
“They are all joining, most of them immediately. A few of them we don’t want because they are trouble. Take care of them,” he added.
Trump then again asserted that the Board of Peace was the “most prestigious ever put together. You know, I have seen great corporate boards. I have seen some great boards, period. It’s peanuts compared to this board. Because we have virtually everyone who is the head of a country”.
He thanked the leaders attending the meeting for travelling long distances, saying that “we work together to ensure a brighter future for the people of Gaza, the Middle East, and the entire world”.
Trump noted that the Board of Peace comprised mostly leaders from the Middle Eastern countries and “countries all over the world”.
“And they have been generous with money also … And there is nothing more important than peace, and there is nothing less expensive than peace. You know when you go to wars, it costs you a hundred times what it costs to make peace,” he added.
Trump first proposed the Board of Peace when he announced his plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza. He later made clear the board’s remit would be expanded beyond Gaza to tackle other conflicts worldwide.
The Board of Peace includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives and Trump’s suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the United Nations’ role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
“We’re going to strengthen the United Nations,” Trump said, trying to assuage his critics. “It’s really very important.”
Trump says prospects of deal with Iran will be clear in 10 days
The Board of Peace meeting came as Trump threatens war against Iran and has embarked on a massive military buildup in the region in case Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear programme.
Trump said he should know in 10 days whether a deal is possible. “We have to have a meaningful deal,” he said.
The event had the feel of a Trump campaign rally, with music blaring from his eclectic playlist from Elvis Presley to the Beach Boys. Red Trump hats were given to participants.
PM Shehbaz lands in Washington
PM Shehbaz arrived in Washington DC on Thursday on an official visit to the United States, at the invitation of Trump to attend the meeting.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier as part of the Pakistani delegation.

 


Apart from attending the Board of Peace meeting, PM Shehbaz is also expected to hold meetings with senior US officials during the visit.
According to an official statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the visit reflects Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace, its “effective role for the promotion of global peace” and what it described as the country’s growing diplomatic outreach.
“In addition to attending the inaugural session of the BoP, the prime minister will also engage with senior US leadership, as well as his counterparts attending the meeting,” said a press release by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) dated Feb 18.
It added that the occasion would provide an opportunity for discussions on bilateral matters, as well as global issues of mutual concern.

According to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted an IBO last night on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“During conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, four khawarij were sent to hell,” ISPR said.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
It said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It said that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
In separate statements, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari commended the security forces for the operation, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the report quoted the prime minister as saying.
PM Shehbaz expressed the government’s firm resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism in the country.
The prime minister said that security forces “continue to achieve significant successes under the Azm-i-Istehkam vision”, according to the report.
In a separate statement, President Zardari said, “The relentless efforts of the security forces and law enforcement agencies under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam are commendable.”
The president reaffirmed the nation’s resolve to continue the fight against terrorism until its complete eradication.
He reiterated that the entire nation stands united with its security forces in safeguarding the country’s peace and stability.
The operation in Lakki Marwat has been conducted days after a terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district, martyred 11 security personnel, as per ISPR.
12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision,” ISPR said.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-19 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/192004026567ac1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974378/pakistan-us-sign-pact-to-redevelop-new-yorks-roosevelt-hotel' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US sign pact to redevelop New York’s Roosevelt Hotel</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry said on Thursday that Pakistan and the United States had formally launched a strategic economic initiative, including collaboration regarding the operation, maintenance, renovation and redevelopment of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York.
In a statement, the ministry said that the initiative would include collaboration with the US General Services Administration (GSA) for the redevelopment of the hotel.
“This engagement was negotiated and stewarded by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump,” it said.







“To advance this partnership, both governments have signed an MoU formalising their cooperation,” the ministry added.
The statement said the MoU was signed by GSA Administrator Edward C Forst and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and was witnessed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Witkoff.
“It establishes a structured, time-bound framework for joint evaluation of the technical, commercial, and economic parameters of cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to transparent, disciplined, and mutually beneficial progress,” the statement said.
The statement noted the Roosevelt Hotel’s prime location in Manhattan and the complexity of New York zoning and municipal process, saying the “institutional coordination aims to reduce execution risk, enhance regulatory clarity, and maximize transaction value”.
“Such facilitative frameworks are consistent with international practice in cross-border real estate and infrastructure projects,” it added.
“The objective remains to secure maximum value for this property in alignment with the government’s privatisation strategy while strengthening Pakistan-United States economic ties,” the statement concluded.

 

The GSA primarily manages federal property and procurement for US government agencies, and its publicly stated mandate does not typically include commercial redevelopment of foreign state-owned assets. It was not immediately clear under what authority the agency would facilitate the project.
Named after former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.

According to the HEC, the directive applies to all public and private sector higher education institutions, and universities have been instructed to incorporate the compulsory AI course into their curricula without any delay.
The commission said that every undergraduate and postgraduate degree programme will include a mandatory three-credit-hour course on AI.
According to details, the course may be offered as an elective subject, an interdisciplinary course, or as a supporting subject within the programme structure.
It further emphasised that integrating AI into academic curricula will not merely be an addition but a necessity in today’s rapidly evolving world.
“In the fast-changing landscape of the 21st century, Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a revolutionary force,” the HEC said.
It added that the inclusion of AI education aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to effectively use such tools in their respective fields, enhancing their academic and professional capabilities.</p><small>2026-02-19 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19202506f3539ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974381/india-to-make-rafale-jets-with-france-in-boost-to-defence-ties-macron-says' target='_blank'><strong>India to make Rafale jets with France in boost to defence ties, Macron says</strong></a><br><p>France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, adding France also hopes to sell more submarines to India.
India’s expected order for another 114 Rafales is a “new step forward” in defence ties between the two countries and France hopes to see this replicated with submarines as well, Macron told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to India.
“On Rafale, what we want to do is expand. India confirmed a few days ago its willingness to command a new bunch of Rafales … 114 … and to co-produce in India,” Macron said.
The Defence Acquisition Council of India’s defence ministry last week gave initial clearance to acquire 114 more Rafale jets for the air force, besides other planes and missiles, months after the worst fighting in decades between India and Pakistan.
So far, India has purchased 36 Rafales for its air force and ordered another 26 marine versions of the jet for the navy.
Details of the Rafale deal, including plans for co-production, expected to be sealed after technical and commercial negotiations, are yet to be made public.
Indian media reports have said that the 114 jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation are expected to cost 3.25 trillion Indian rupees ($35.65 billion).
They have also reported that up to 90 of the 114 jets could be produced in India with a joint venture partner who is yet to be identified.
“Rafale is absolutely key,” Macron said. “I hope we will do it on submarines. We offered additional capacities.”
The Indian navy operates six French Scorpene submarines and local media reports say there are plans to order more.
On Tuesday, Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the first H125 helicopter assembly line, made in India by a joint venture between Airbus and Tata Advanced Systems, as well as a plan to jointly produce Hammer missiles in India, by Safran and India’s state-owned Bharat Electronics.
Rafale jets flown by the Indian Air Force were in the spotlight during the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025.
In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust.</p><small>2026-02-19 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191600176b48a58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974336/at-least-15-killed-in-karachi-soldier-bazaar-building-collapse-following-gas-explosion' target='_blank'><strong>At least 15 killed in Karachi Soldier Bazaar building collapse following gas explosion</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: At least 15 people, including women and children, were killed, and 18 others were injured after a gas explosion caused part of a residential building to collapse in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, according to officials.
The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.
Initially, Rescue 1122 put the death toll at 16. However, officials later confirmed that the death toll was 15, while 18 others were injured.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jamshed Asher said the incident occurred at around 4:15am during Sehri, and that the gas explosion took place on the building’s first floor.
East Deputy Commissioner Nasrullah Abbasi told Dawn that the gas explosion occurred at the time of Sehri in a building located in Gul Rana Colony.
He said it was a highly congested locality where a ground plus three-storey building was constructed on 40-45 yards with one small room on each floor. He said that the explosion destroyed the whole building.
Speaking to Dawn, Abid Farooq, an official from the bomb disposal squad, ruled out the possibility of any sabotage. He stated that the incident was caused by a gas leak; the explosion was triggered by someone lighting a match.
He said that the structure in question was a precast building, covered on all four sides with a narrow street. He said that the gas fittings in the kitchen on the first floor were not upto mark, while plastic pipes were installed for providing gas supply everywhere else. Farooq said that an electric gas pump had also been installed.
Quoting residents, Farooq said there was no gas supply in the area for several days but it suddenly increased on Wednesday night.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the residents of the building were buried under the rubble after the explosion, adding that the building was in a dilapidated condition.
He said Gul Rana Colony was spread over two streets in the historic Soldier Bazaar area, with no access for vehicles and tools. He said rescue teams could hear the screams of children and women from the debris. Therefore, they avoided using heavy machinery and preferred to carry out rescue work manually, he said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed that a total of 15 people were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. The police surgeon said most of the deaths occurred due to injuries to the head.
“Some victims were brought with crush injuries while others had multiple wounds,” Dr Summaiya said.
Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer Rizwan Patel said that a first information report of the incident had not yet been registered. He said legal proceedings would be initiated under the directives of higher authorities.
Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told Dawn that the search and rescue operation had been completed.
Speaking to the media, COO Shaikh had confirmed that a gas explosion was the cause of the structure’s partial collapse.
He noted that the ground plus two-floor structure had small rooms, and the limited space made the rescue operation challenging.
“This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” said the senior rescue official, adding that the collapse also damaged surrounding structures.
CM takes notice; temporary rehabilitation ordered
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives, said a statement released by the CM House.
The statement added that Murad directed the relevant authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and provide the victims with the “best possible” medical assistance.
Murad also ordered that all possible support be provided to the affected families and instructed the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause of the incident.







Adviser to CM for Rehabilitation Giyan Chand Essrani, as per a statement from his office, sought reports from Rescue 1122 and the relevant departments over the incident.
“The Rehabilitation Department’s teams are present at the site of the incident to provide immediate relief, temporary accommodation and basic necessities to the affected families,” Essrani said.
He affirmed that his department was working under a “comprehensive plan to provide complete rehabilitation, mental health assistance and necessary facilities” to the affected families.
“The temporary rehabilitation and safe relocation of the affected building’s occupants and nearby residents should be ensured,” Essrani stated.

Condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, expressed their deep grief over the loss of lives in the incident.
In a statement reported by state-run APP, President Zardari conveyed his sympathies to the families of the deceased and directed the relevant authorities to extend the best possible medical care to those injured.
Also directing the acceleration of the rescue operation, the president asked the Sindh government to inspect buildings, ensure the safety of gas cylinders, and strictly enforce building codes.
He said that the provincial government should conduct a thorough investigation into every aspect of the incident and take measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.







In his statement, PM Shehbaz offered condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the speedy recovery of those wounded.
He directed the authorities concerned to provide all possible medical assistance to the injured.







PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also offered condolences to the families of the deceased, as per a statement issued via PPP’s media cell.
Bilawal stressed the need for effective measures to prevent such incidents in the future, the statement added.







Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also expressed grief over the incident. He directed authorities to accelerate the pace of rescue efforts and ensure proper medical care for the injured citizens, said a statement from the minister’s office.
“All updates and details of the relief work should be regularly reported, the home minister directed,” added the statement.
Conveying his condolences, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government shared the grief of the bereaved families.
He urged citizens to be cautious while using gas and to immediately contact the relevant authorities if they suspected a gas leakage.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also expressed his condolences over the gas explosion, assuring the affected people of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) support.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
In July 2025, at least 27 people died and 10 others were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in the Lyari area of the metropolis.
The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure.
In a statement back then, the Sindh Building Control Authority had noted that 588 buildings had been declared dangerous throughout Karachi.
A month later, four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured, with one of them suffering severe burn wounds, when a gas explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town.
In June 2024, following the death of 27 persons, including 19 children, in an explosion in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder filling shop in Hyderabad, the Sindh government had decided to shift all such facilities from residential areas.</p><small>2026-02-19 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191620026bc2f27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974367/pti-says-govts-silence-lack-of-clarity-over-imrans-health-only-adding-to-public-unease' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says govt’s silence, lack of clarity over Imran’s health only adding to public unease</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Thursday once again voiced concerns regarding party founder Imran Khan’s health, taking exception to the government’s alleged “silence and lack of clarity” over the matter.
The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s family and party have been raising concerns about his health since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
In a statement on X, the PTI expressed “profound concern over the growing anxiety spreading among the nation regarding” Imran’s health.
“Any ambiguity surrounding the health of a leader who commands the confidence of millions is unacceptable. The government’s silence and lack of clarity have only intensified public unease rather than alleviating it,” the PTI contended.

 

“This is not merely a political matter; it is a test of national trust, human rights, and the government’s responsibility,” the party asserted.
Stating that “any uncertainty regarding his health and safety is intolerable”, it stressed that if the government had nothing to conceal, then there was no justification for “delaying full transparency”.
The party reiterated its demand that Imran’s personal physicians be granted “immediate and unrestricted access so they may conduct all necessary medical examinations, including blood tests and any other required diagnostic procedures”.
“Should any scans or specialised evaluations be needed, he must be permitted to be taken to a hospital or diagnostic centre of their choosing,” the PTI demanded.
It added: “It is the government’s responsibility to provide the nation with clear, verified, and unambiguous medical facts.
“A significant amount of time has already been wasted regarding concerns over Imran Khan’s health,” it insisted, adding that no further delay would be acceptable.







Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail in recent weeks, but most visits have been blocked by authorities.
The SC’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “15 per cent” vision left in his right eye. This came after it emerged that Imran underwent a medical procedure on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
A report prepared by a medical board formed by the government that visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, the ex-premier’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.

 

The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health, also doubled down on its earlier demands on Friday.
These included Imran’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports.
Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan have previously said multiple times that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.







Imran’s son thanks ex-cricket captains for humanitarian appeal for jailed father
Meanwhile, Imran’s son Kasim thanked former cricket captains, who issued a humanitarian appeal for his incarcerated father.
In a post on X, he said, “I’m incredibly grateful to all the Test captains who’ve called for fair treatment for my father. It’s heartening to see support from these legends of the game.”







The remarks came in response to an article by England’s Mike Atherton in The Times about the appeal for Imran.
On Tuesday, fourteen former international cricket captains, including Atherton and India’s Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, had called for better prison treatment for Imran.
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell, his brother Ian Chappell and compatriots Allan Border, Steve Waugh, Belinda Clark and Kim Hughes signed the petition.
England’s Nasser Hussain, Mike Brearley and David Gower had also signed, alongside Clive Lloyd from the West Indies and John Wright from New Zealand. The campaign was led by Chappell, a former Australian captain and contemporary of Imran
“As fellow cricketers who understand the values of fair play, honour, and respect that transcend the boundary rope, we believe that a person of Imran Khan’s stature deserves to be treated with the dignity and basic human consideration befitting a former national leader and a global sporting icon,” the appeal said.</p><small>2026-02-19 12:35</small></div><hr>
