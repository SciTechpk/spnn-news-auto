According to Rescue 1122 Swat spokesperson Niaz Khan, “Eleven seminary students were injured when a pickup vehicle lost control and crashed near the Kedam police checkpoint in Swat’s Bahrain town.
The students, who hailed from Kalam, were on their way home after their holidays in Batkhela Town.“
He said the Rescue 1122 medical team swiftly arrived at the site of the incident after receiving a report. “After administering initial medical aid, the injured were transferred to nearby hospitals.  Three students, who were declared severely injured, were safely transported to the Civil Hospital in Madyan.”
In another incident, a man was killed while four others sustained injuries when a three-wheeler plunged into a deep ravine after its brakes failed.
The driver died on the spot, Khan said.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
Earlier this month, six members of a family were killed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the Neelum River, officials said.
The accident occurred at a sharp bend on the Neelum Valley road near Chilyana village, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad.
“Shortly after Friday prayers, a vehicle … went out of the driver’s control while negotiating a dangerous curve near Chilyana,” Akhtar Ayoub, the Neelum Valley District Disaster Management Officer (DDMO), told Dawn.com.
“It rolled down the mountain slope but stopped just short of entering the river; otherwise, it would have been swept away by the violent current,” he added.
On June 25, four people were killed and two injured in separate road accidents.
Rahimabad police said a passenger bus collided with a car travelling to Buner near the Odigram area, resulting in the deaths of Altaf Rehman, Yasir Khan and Fida Mohammad, residents of the Deewana Baba Degar area of Buner. Khalil Zada, a resident of Gagra Buner, was injured in the accident.
Meanwhile, two motorcycles collided in the Malaki Dam area of Barikot, resulting in the death of one rider and injuries to another.
The injured individuals from both accidents were transferred to local hospitals for treatment.</p><small>2025-07-07 11:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071409496ddc8bf.jpg?r=141626' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557/sindh-govt-suspends-sbca-dg-over-lyari-building-collapse-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt suspends SBCA DG over Lyari building collapse: minister</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has suspended the director general of the Sindh Building and Control Authority over the recent building collapse in Karachi that claimed 27 lives, a minister said on Monday.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding yesterday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
“Today, the chief minister has also suspended the DG SCBA and has ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR (first information report) on the incident and that strictest action be taken against all those involved,” Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said.
 


He was addressing a press conference in Karachi alongside Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani.
According to Ghani, some other officials who were suspended include the SBCA’s deputy director and building inspectors. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.
Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have condemned the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence”.
They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families, but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.
Noting the loss of 27 lives, Memon said: “The entire province, nation and all of us as the government representatives are saddened and equally share the grief of the bereaved families.”
“The chief minister has taken a very strict notice of this,” he asserted.
 
 

Memon said CM Murad’s notice of the incident was aimed at ensuring strict action “against those who did not fulfil their duties or even if they fulfilled, they were not able to implement them”.
He added that the fact-finding committee formed on the incident, which was given three days to present a report, would submit its report within two days due to the Ashura public holidays over the weekend. The committee will also include the Karachi commissioner, he added.
Ghani asserted that all the SBCA officers since 2022 will be identified and included in the inquiry, adding: “If the committee finds criminal negligence of any employee, they will be included in the FIR and face legal action.”
“The Karachi commissioner has to also provide assessments of the 588 buildings which were declared dangerous within two weeks so that we can decide which of the buildings need to be destroyed and which can be fixed through major repair,” he added.
In a recent statement, the SBCA noted that 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi, with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone.

Gill, who notched a century in a losing cause in the first Test at Headingley, hit new heights in scoring 269 and 161 to set up a crushing victory by 336 runs which leaves the five-match series finely poised.
It was India’s first win in nine Tests at the Birmingham venue, following seven previous defeats and one draw.
“New captain, new India”, The Indian Express newspaper splashed across its front page.
Gill, 25, became the youngest Indian Test skipper to register an overseas win in just his second match in charge following the retirement of Rohit Sharma.
He eclipsed Sunil Gavaskar, who was 26 when he led India to victory over New Zealand at Auckland in 1976.
Gill came into the series with concerns over his batting average overseas, which had been less than 30, but he has shut down all the noise by stroking a remarkable 585 runs from four innings.
Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar called it a “Shublime innings from the man of the moment,” offering his congratulations for “powering India to a brilliant Test victory.”
Tendulkar, writing on social media, added: “India’s approach was to take England out of this game and force them to play differently, making sure that there would only be one winner.”
 






‘Drowning Street’
Fast bowler Akash Deep took a match haul of 10 wickets after replacing the rested Jasprit Bumrah as England were bowled out for 271 in their chase of 608 on day five.
“What impressed me most about the bowlers was the length they bowled”, Tendulkar said.
Deep took 6-99 in the second innings, including bowling the world’s top-ranked Test batsman Joe Root with a delivery that nipped away sharply and was called the “ball of the series” by Tendulkar.
Batting great Virat Kohli, who also retired before the series, said: “Great victory for India at Edgbaston” and wrote that India had been “fearless and kept pushing England to the wall.”
 






“Brilliantly led by Shubman with the bat and in the field… special mention to (Mohammed) Siraj and Akash for the way they bowled,” he added.
Former captain Sourav Ganguly praised Gill’s performance and India’s superior bowling attack, calling Akash and Siraj “workhorses”.
 






Indian newspapers had a field day with an outpouring of joyous puns.
The Times of India said: “Deep’s 10 send Eng to Drowning Street” and “Edg-bastian breached.”
The third Test of the five-match series begins on Thursday at Lord’s.</p><small>2025-07-07 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0712060644e1f04.jpg?r=143835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922539/icc-names-top-indian-broadcaster-jiostars-sanjog-gupta-as-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>ICC names top Indian broadcaster JioStar’s Sanjog Gupta as CEO</strong></a><br><p>The International Cricket Council on Monday named Sanjog Gupta as its new chief executive officer, a senior official at India’s key broadcaster of the game.
Gupta, the ICC’s seventh CEO, succeeds Geoff Allardice, who resigned from the post in January after four years in office.
Gupta was broadcaster JioStar’s chief executive for sports and live experiences.
ICC chairman Jay Shah said Gupta “brings extensive experience in sports strategy and commercialisation, which will be invaluable for the ICC”.
The role attracted more than 2,500 applications from candidates across 25 countries, the ICC said.
 
 

“These are exciting times for the sport as marquee events grow in stature, commercial avenues widen and opportunities such as the women’s game scale in popularity,” Gupta said in a statement.
“Cricket’s inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and the rapid acceleration of technology deployment/adoption could act as force-multipliers for the cricket movement around the world,” he said.
According to the ICC’s website, Gupta was appointed as the JioStar Sports CEO in November 2024 and has “held multiple leadership roles in content, programming and strategy”. He began his career as a journalist in 2010 at Star India (now JioStar).
“Under his stewardship, the sports portfolio at Star India scaled across consumer and commercial objectives with a strong emphasis on long-term growth and operational efficiency,” the ICC highlighted.
Gupta has played a “crucial role in developing and executing multi-language, digital-first, and women-centric sports coverage”, it added.</p><small>2025-07-07 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071156426d961f3.jpg?r=120405' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922543/psx-soars-to-new-high-of-over-133000-points-in-intraday-trade' target='_blank'><strong>PSX soars to new high of over 133,000 points in intraday trade</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) soared to new highs on Monday as shares crossed the 133,000 barrier, with analysts attributing the optimism to a “favourable” taxation regime for equities following the passage of the federal budget.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,771.48 points, or 1.34 per cent, to stand at 133,720.54 points at 11:2am, from the previous close of 131,949.06 points.
The PSX commenced the new fiscal year on a bullish note last week, as the KSE-100 index posted a robust 6.1pc gain during the outgoing week. Continuing that momentum, the market extended its record-setting rally for the seventh consecutive session today.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, noted: “A favourable taxation regime for equities and the increasing likelihood of equities outperforming other asset classes, amid improving macroeconomic indicators and lower inflation, have channelled flows towards equities.”
 
 

He highlighted that there was a “continuation of monetary easing — driven by falling inflation, fiscal discipline, a strong external account and a focus on structural reforms — which will keep equities in the limelight”.
Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com: “We believe the market is firmly in Phase 2 of the bull run, marked by rising retail participation, higher trading volumes, and broad-based gains across sectors.”
He noted that the passage of the Finance Act 2025-26 last week with “minimal surprises”, geopolitical calm, optimism around circular debt resolution, and the potential signing of a trade deal with the United States have all contributed to improving investor confidence.
 
 

“Retail investors should focus on long-term investing, staying consistent with their risk appetite and avoiding overreaction to short-term fluctuations,” Farooq cautioned.
“While pockets of speculation have emerged — typical of a bull market — overall valuations remain reasonable,” he added, advising investors to temper return expectations as “forward returns are likely to normalise compared to the outsized gains seen over the past two years”.
The upbeat sentiment has been supported by stabilising macroeconomic indicators. Inflation eased to a nine-year low of 3.2pc in June from 3.5pc in May. The trade deficit narrowed to $2.3bn for June — down 9pc month-on-month and 3pc year-on-year — while the full-year trade deficit for FY25 stood at $26.3bn, up 9pc from FY24.

Yaum-i-Ashura processions in major cities across the country concluded peacefully on Sunday evening amid tightened security. A total of 4,836 processions and 5,480 majalis were carried out, with 12 processions taking place in Peshawar.
Thousands of police personnel — including constables and police snipers — were deployed across major cities alongside emergency rescue personnel for the safety and security of mourners carrying out processions.
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Qasim Khan told Dawn.com that drone-jamming technology was used for the first time by Peshawar police.
“A drone-jamming gun was used for the first time during the Ashura procession,” he said.
“With the help of Peshawar Anti-Drone System, drone cameras helped in jamming.”
He noted that drones had been used by terrorists in the southern districts of KP. “Now KP police can jam suspicious drones,” Khan said.
“New technology can disable suspicious drones at a distance of up to three kilometres.”
Naqvi praises LEAs for peaceful Muharram processions
Separately, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised law enforcement authorities for their coordinated security efforts to ensure a peaceful and secure environment during Ashura processions across the country.
“All processions and gatherings in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir concluded peacefully,” he said today in a post on X.
 






He paid tribute to the army, Rangers and police for their “hard work” during the Ashura processions and thanked “every soldier, officer, and official assigned to the security of Ashura”.
The interior minister noted that the security forces performed their duties with “dedication and harmony” and provided foolproof security to the mourners’ processions and gatherings.
“From Muharram 1 to Ashura, an effective and coordinated security plan was successfully implemented,” Naqvi said. “All forces and field formations demonstrated exemplary discipline and unity day and night.”</p><small>2025-07-07 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07084358802f2d1.jpg?r=084814' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520/trump-to-host-netanyahu-hopes-for-israel-hamas-deal-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to host Netanyahu, hopes for Israel-Hamas deal ‘this week’</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet on Monday with US President Donald Trump, who expressed hope for a “deal this week” between Israel and Hamas that sees hostages released from the Gaza Strip.
Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday evening in Doha, aiming to broker a ceasefire and reach an agreement on the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
Trump said on Sunday that there was a “good chance” of reaching an agreement.
“We’ve gotten a lot of the hostages out, but pertaining to the remaining hostages, quite a few of them will be coming out,” he told journalists.
 
 

Netanyahu, speaking before boarding his flight to Washington on Sunday, said his meeting with Trump could “definitely help advance this” deal.
Netanyahu said he dispatched the team to Doha with “clear instructions” to reach an agreement “under the conditions that we have agreed to”.
He previously said Hamas’ response to a draft US-backed ceasefire proposal, conveyed through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, contained “unacceptable” demands.
‘Important mission’
Two Palestinian sources close to the discussions told AFP the proposal included a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and several bodies in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel.
However, they said, the group was also demanding certain conditions for Israel’s withdrawal, guarantees against a resumption of fighting during negotiations, and the return of the UN-led aid distribution system.
Netanyahu has an “important mission” in Washington, “advancing a deal to bring all our hostages home”, said Israeli President Isaac Herzog after meeting him on Sunday.
Trump is not scheduled to meet the Israeli premier until 6:30pm (3:30am PKT) on Monday, the White House said, without the usual presence of journalists.
Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas during the 2023 attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27, the Israeli military says, are dead.
 
 

Since Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the massive Israeli offensive in Gaza, mediators have brokered two temporary halts in the fighting. They have seen hostages freed in exchange for some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.
Recent efforts to broker a new truce have repeatedly failed, with the primary point of contention being Israel’s rejection of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 57,418 people in Gaza, with the death toll feared to be much higher due to thousands missing under the rubble.
‘Enough blood’
In Gaza, the territory’s civil defence agency reported 26 people killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, 10 of them in a strike in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.
“We are losing young people, families and children every day, and this must stop now,” Sheikh Radwan resident Osama al-Hanawi told AFP.
“Enough blood has been shed.”
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it could not comment on specific strikes without precise coordinates.
Hundreds killed seeking aid
The offensive has created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip.
A US- and Israel-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took the lead in food distribution in the territory in late May, when Israel partially lifted a more than two-month blockade on aid deliveries.
But its operations have had a chaotic rollout, with repeated reports of aid seekers killed near its facilities while awaiting rations.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns that it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
 
 

The UN human rights office said last week that more than 500 people have been killed waiting to access food from GHF distribution points.
The Gaza health ministry on Sunday placed the toll even higher, at 751 killed.</p><small>2025-07-07 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0712004438757f2.gif?r=120105' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918164/h2no-karachis-water-numbers-dont-add-up' target='_blank'><strong>H2(N)O: Karachi’s water numbers don’t add up</strong></a><br><p>Every summer, Karachi faces a predictable water crisis. As temperatures climb, neighbourhoods across the city brace for dwindling water pressure, erratic supply schedules, and increased dependence on costly private tankers. The city’s water utility, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), insists the primary problem is a stark mismatch between the city’s water supply — approximately 550-650 million gallons a day — and its ballooning demand, assumed to be double that, around 1,200 MGD.
New projects to increase the city’s water supply are thus championed as the silver bullet to the city’s perennial water crisis. Chief among these is the K-IV bulk water supply scheme, a mega-project to double the city’s water supply launched nearly two decades ago that has yet to be completed. Despite repeated delays and cost overruns, the project remains the centrepiece of the city’s water planning strategy.
But the water demand estimates used to justify the massive infrastructure deserve closer scrutiny. Our research group conducted over 600 household surveys and installed several smart water meters (the first scientific study conducted at this scale in Pakistan) to find that actual household water use is far below official estimates. In some cases, less than half of what is assumed.
 
 

If Karachi builds its infrastructure on exaggerated and unsubstantiated estimates, it risks repeating Pakistan’s costly mistakes from the power sector, where inflated demand estimates led to massive overspending and a glut of unused electricity that ordinary citizens are still paying for through soaring electricity bills.
The problem with the numbers
This is the rather simplistic way the KWSC estimates how much water is needed for Karachi: the population of Karachi multiplied by per-person daily water consumption.
The body assumes that each resident of Karachi’s estimated 22 million population uses 54 gallons or 204 litres per day, resulting in a demand estimate of around 1,200 million gallons per day (54 gallons per day * 22 million people).
 

Screen grab from the water utility’s website

However, the estimate for the per-person water consumption (54 gallons per day) is not based on any recent, empirical study for Karachi. In fact, residential connections across the city are unmetered, and no peer-reviewed analysis of actual household water use had ever been conducted until recently. So, because they don’t have any data, the KWSC relies on guesswork.
This isn’t a new problem. Since the 1980s, various studies and government reports have projected dramatically inflated water needs for Karachi. In 1985, a planning study forecasted that water demand would rise to 81 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) by 2025. Another estimate in 1999 projected the city’s total demand to reach nearly 1,340 MGD by 2010. These numbers were never grounded in direct measurement. Instead, they reflected an overly optimistic vision of urban development, with assumptions based on Western-style household consumption and full appliance access, which simply does not reflect how most people in Karachi use water.
These overestimations shape billion-rupee investment decisions. They justify large-scale infrastructure projects and continued borrowing, even when actual consumption may not warrant it. Misjudging demand risks funnelling scarce public resources into costly supply augmentation projects, when more targeted, cost-effective interventions could achieve greater impact.
The second major flaw in Karachi’s water demand projections is the assumption that all residents use water in the same way, regardless of season, income, or neighbourhood. The KWSC’s estimate — 54 gallons per capita per day — is applied uniformly across its entire population, as if every single person in Karachi needs the same amount of water every day. In reality, household water use varies widely across the city and changes substantially over the course of the year.
Our studies, one employing water use questionnaires and the other using high-resolution smart meters, both show that actual usage varies dramatically across different households and seasons. Water use tends to rise during hotter months, particularly when daily temperatures exceed 31 degrees Celsius, and declines in the winter. Wealthier households consistently use more water than poorer ones. Even within a single household, usage fluctuates across the week.
Therefore, treating water demand as a single number flattens all this complexity.
What the evidence suggests
The limits of Karachi’s demand projections become even clearer when we look closely at how water is used in low-income neighbourhoods. In Lyari, a township marked by dense housing, poor infrastructure, and limited piped supply, we surveyed over 600 households across the summer and winter seasons to understand how much water people use. Most households in the neighbourhood rely on a mix of unreliable piped supply, private vendors, and storage tanks.
Across our sample, the average daily use was just 16 gpcd in the summer and 13 gpcd in the winter — less than a third of what is assumed by the KWSC. Clearly, looking at just the current water usage underestimates the true water demand. That is, if more water were available, households would use more. We also test this hypothesis in our work and find that for the subsample of households who reported satisfaction with their water access, usage increases to 23 gpcd and 14 gpcd in the summer and winter months, respectively. These numbers suggest that even when water is fully available, actual demand remains far below official estimates.
 


The findings also reveal stark differences. Not every household is the same. Richer households in one area can invest in infrastructure, secure informal connections, or organise collectively to bring in tankers. Poorer families, in contrast, pay more per unit of water, endure longer wait times, and face greater exposure to unsafe sources.
By portraying Karachi’s water crisis as a system-wide shortfall, the KWSC shifts attention away from its failings in distribution, leakage control, and service reliability. The story of an overwhelming supply-demand gap becomes a convenient excuse, obscuring the fact that many residents are left underserved, not because there isn’t enough water, but because water is mismanaged and unfairly allocated. Solving Karachi’s water crisis will require more than new pipelines — it will require a fundamental shift in how we understand who needs water, how much, and at what cost.
While household surveys help establish broad patterns of water use, they are limited by recall bias and self-reporting. They also represent primarily low-income households. To develop a more robust and holistic picture of water usage in the city, we developed and deployed a low-cost, resilient smart metering system in middle to high-income households across Karachi. These devices recorded actual water flow every 30 seconds, providing millions of data points across 17 months in 23 households. This is the first study of its kind to generate daily-scale water use data in a South Asian city facing intermittent supply.
The findings further undermine the case for uniform, inflated demand projections. We observed significant variation in daily water use both across and within households. Only two out of the 23 households had average water use higher than 54 gpcd. Overall, the average across the entire sample was just 22 gpcd, less than half of the figure used by the KWSC.
The usage also fluctuated with temperature. Once daily highs crossed 31 degrees Celsius, household water use rose sharply, indicating heat-related behavioural changes. Fridays also stood out, with a clear bump in water use likely tied to religious practices. But even during the hottest days or highest-use periods, few households approached the levels that the utility uses in its citywide projections.
 


The sample size of the smart water meters study is not large enough for us to definitively establish Karachi’s true water demand. However, even with the current sample, we have enough statistical power to show that household usage is far lower than the KWSC’s assumptions and varies considerably across seasons and households.
A more holistic accounting of the city’s water needs must survey more households and incorporate commercial and industrial consumption. It is the KWSC’s responsibility to gather this evidence before making multi-billion-rupee infrastructure commitments.
The corporation, like other utilities in the region, estimates total citywide demand by taking residential usage and adding a fixed percentage for system losses and industrial use. But this approach assumes all components grow at the same pace and ignores underlying structural changes. For example, Karachi’s industrial landscape is evolving. Global economic shifts and changing water-use technologies may reduce industrial consumption even as population growth increases residential demand. Yet these trends are not accounted for in the fixed-percentage planning model. Without better data, the city is flying blind.
Moreover, the assumed per capita use in Karachi, 54 gpcd, is higher than what is reported for many cities. In Shiraz, Iran, it is 35 gpcd; in Mumbai, the utility plans for 39 gpcd. Karachi’s assumptions are not just wrong, they are also outliers compared to other cities. If actual usage is lower and more varied than assumed, the projected supply-demand gap narrows significantly. The case for large-scale supply augmentation, such as the K-IV, begins to look far less certain. Its projected cost has ballooned from Rs25 billion to more than Rs190 billion, yet the project remains incomplete.
More concerning than the delays and overruns, however, is the way the K-IV has come to dominate the city’s water planning agenda. It has drawn political attention and institutional focus away from more immediate and manageable reforms like improved billing or equitable distribution. This is the risk with mega-projects: they become both a symbol and a distraction, offering the illusion of progress while sidelining practical solutions.
Refocusing the water agenda
Karachi does face real water shortages, and new supply investments may well be necessary given the impact of climate change. But the case for costly supply augmentation must be grounded in evidence. Additionally, for any water supply project, two important questions must be addressed. First, who will benefit from this new water? Will it go to neighbourhoods that are currently underserved, or will it reinforce existing inequalities? Second, how much will the people of Karachi pay for these projects, and for how long?
The city urgently needs investment, but not only in pipes and pumps. Allocating water more equally across the city and pricing reforms would likely deliver a greater impact on people’s well-being, and crucially, do not need billions of rupees to carry out. These are management challenges, not capacity ones. Prioritising them could improve outcomes for the majority of Karachi’s residents without locking the city into unsustainable capital projects. There are indications that the recently revamped KWSC has started addressing some of these issues.
 
 

Clearly, Karachi’s water crisis is not just about scarcity. For too long, decisions have been based on unsubstantiated assumptions and misplaced priorities. Karachi can either recalibrate its water management strategy based on accurate, data-driven realities, or it can continue down a financially unsustainable path of infrastructure expansion built on misleading assumptions.
The choice the city makes today will determine whether billions of rupees are wisely invested or recklessly wasted.

The conflict, which began in 1984, has cost more than 40,000 lives.
The deaths occurred as the Turkish troops were searching for the remains of a soldier who was shot dead by Kurdish fighters in the area in May 2022 and whose body was never recovered, Turkiye’s defence ministry said.
“Three other of our heroic comrades in arms, affected by methane gas, have died, bringing the total number of victims to eight,” the ministry said on X on Monday.
It did not explain the origin of the methane gas in the caves.
“During a search operation in a cave… previously known to have been used as a hospital… 19 of our personnel were exposed to methane gas,” the ministry said on Sunday.
When the soldier whose body the troops were looking for died in 2022, Turkiye was waging Operation Claw Lock, with its troops seeking to eradicate Kurdish PKK militants holed up in caves along the border.
News of the deaths emerged as a delegation from the pro-Kurdish DEM party was visiting jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan as part of the ongoing negotiations with the Turkish government.</p><small>2025-07-07 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0711061345b20d4.jpg?r=112733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922536/sabalenka-stands-tall-norrie-survives-to-reach-wimbledon-quarter-finals' target='_blank'><strong>Sabalenka stands tall, Norrie survives to reach Wimbledon quarter-finals</strong></a><br><p>Women’s top seed Aryna Sabalenka and men’s defending champion Carlos Alcaraz both survived tough tests to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals and Cameron Norrie kept alive British singles hopes after surviving a five-set thriller on Sunday.
Sabalenka ruined home favourite Emma Raducanu’s dream in the previous round but had the Centre Court crowd cheering her on as she beat Elise Mertens 6-4 7-6(4) in a high-quality duel.
Wimbledon’s new automated line-calling technology came under fire after an embarrassing malfunction robbed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of a point during her last-16 victory over Britain’s Sonay Kartal on Centre Court.
Spaniard Alcaraz came through a ferocious firefight against Russian 14th seed Andrey Rublev 6-7(5) 6-3 6-4 6-4 to stay on course for a third successive title.
“Andrey is one of the most powerful players we have on Tour and is so aggressive with the ball. He forces you to the limit on each point,” Alcaraz, bidding to become only the fourth man to win back-to-back French Open and Wimbledon titles multiple times, said on court.
The 22-year-old second seed extended his current winning streak to 22 matches and will take on Norrie for a place in the semi-finals after the unseeded Briton soaked up 46 aces from towering Chilean Nicolas Jarry to win a feisty Court One battle 6-3 7-6(4) 6-7(7) 6-7(5) 6-3.
While Alcaraz seeks a Wimbledon hat-trick, Sabalenka is eyeing her first title on the London lawns after missing last year’s tournament with injury and the 2022 edition due to the ban on Russian and Belarusian players, and the 27-year-old made a fast start against Mertens.

Sabalenka, who claimed doubles titles at the US Open and Australian Open partnering Mertens, was then put through the wringer before raising her level to prevail.
The victory improved her win-loss record against Belgian Mertens to 11-2 and she said the growing adoration of the crowd made a big difference after fans were on the other side of the fence when she met Raducanu on Friday.
“I definitely felt the support. It was so amazing playing and feeling the support. I didn’t have to pretend that they were cheering for me because they were really cheering for me,” said Sabalenka, who will face the 37-year-old German Laura Siegemund in the quarter-finals.
“What can be better than that? I really enjoyed it. I hope it can stay the same all the way, and they help me energy-wise to stay strong and to face all of the challenges.”

Heavy showers
Siegemund, the second-oldest player to start in the women’s draw this year, swatted aside plucky Argentine lucky loser Solana Sierra with a 6-3 6-2 victory in a Court Two match interrupted by the heavy showers that prompted organisers to shut the roofs for the day’s play on Centre Court and Court One.
While Sierra was the first lucky loser to reach the last 16 in the professional era, Siegemund created her own slice of history by becoming the oldest woman to reach her first Wimbledon quarter-final.
Explaining her run, Siegemund said it was simple. “It’s like you have an opponent. Either you find good solutions and you execute well, you go forward, or you don’t, and you don’t go forward. So it’s very simple,” she said.
Sierra’s fellow South American, Jarry, fought back brilliantly against Norrie after saving a match point in the third-set tiebreak but fell short in a needle match.
Jarry seemed irritated at times during the heat of battle and the players exchanged words at the end.
“Cameron played unbelievable. Not unbelievable, played great. He did his job. He plays like that,” said qualifier Jarry, whose total ace count reached a tournament-leading 111.
Asked what happened, Norrie said there had been no problem.
“I think he just said I was being a little bit too vocal,” he said. “Honestly, nothing but credit to Nico for his performance. I guess we both really wanted to win.”

Norrie, a 2022 semi-finalist, is the last British hope after the unseeded Kartal’s run ended with a 7-6(3) 6-4 defeat by experienced Russian Pavlyuchenkova.
The big talking point in that match was the malfunction of the Electronic Line Calling system, which left the Russian former French Open runner-up seething after being robbed of a game point at 4-4 in the opening set when there was no ‘out’ call despite a Kartal shot landing over the baseline.
Umpire Nico Helwerth sought advice from tournament organisers via telephone and then ruled that the point should be replayed, with Pavlyuchenkova going on to have her serve broken.
“We were waiting for a decision as the system was down, but I was expecting to hear if they said the ball was in or out,” she said. “I expected a different decision. I just thought also the chair umpire could take the initiative.
“That’s why he’s there sitting on the chair. He also saw it (was) out, he told me after the match. I thought he would do that, but he didn’t. I think it’s also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision.”
Organisers said it had been caused by the system being ‘deactivated in error’.
American fifth seed Taylor Fritz marched on after his Australian opponent Jordan Thompson retired with a thigh injury at 6-1 3-0 down in their fourth-round meeting.
Up next for Fritz is a meeting with Russian 17th seed Karen Khachanov who thumped Poland’s Kamil Majchrzak 6-4 6-2 6-3.
Fritz is not the only American to reach the quarter-finals, after 13th seed Amanda Anisimova beat Linda Noskova 6-2 5-7 6-4 in the day’s final action.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07110652f00cb64.jpg?r=110840' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922439/pti-slams-hike-in-perks-of-punjab-assembly-speaker-ministers' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams hike in perks of Punjab Assembly speaker, ministers</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: After the massive raise in salaries, the increase in privileges for the speaker and ministers of Punjab under the guise of leave allowance is absolutely ‘disgraceful’.
In a statement on Saturday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Punjab, media cell chief Shayan Bashir stated that people were being crushed under inflation, unemployment, and skyrocketing electricity bills, to the point where many were driven to suicide. “Yet the indifferent elite continue to enjoy the luxuries of illegitimate power,” he lamented.
The PTI leader said this was the ugliest form of an exploitative system where power had become a means to suck the blood of the public.
 
 

He said the Punjab’s hospitals lack both medicines and basic facilities, where multiple patients were treated on a single bed, as if they were animals.
At such a critical time, for these ‘looters’ who seized power through the backdoor to increase their own perks, he said, “is the height of shamelessness”.
He said the PTI would oppose every bill passed for such luxuries that went against public interest and welfare. “Those looting the nation’s wealth will be exposed on every platform,” he said.

“At this time, we are no longer withholding access in India to your account,” X said in an email to the Reuters social media team, without elaborating.
Representatives for X, Reuters and the Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the restoration of the account.
Earlier on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Indian government’s Press Information Bureau told Reuters that no Indian government agency had required withholding the Reuters handle, adding that officials were working with X to resolve the problem.
A Reuters spokesperson had said the agency was working with X to resolve this matter and get the Reuters account reinstated in India as soon as possible.
Reuters World, another X account operated by the news agency, which was blocked in India, was also restored late on Sunday night.
The main Reuters account, which has more than 25 million followers globally, had been blocked in India since Saturday night. A notice told X users that “@Reuters has been withheld in IN (India) in response to a legal demand”.
 
 

In an email to the Reuters social media team on May 16, X said: “It is our policy to notify account holders if we receive a legal request from an authorised entity (such as law enforcement or a government agency) to remove content from their account.”
“In order to comply with X obligations under India’s local laws, we have withheld your X account in India under the country’s Information Technology Act, 2000; the content remains available elsewhere”.
Reuters could not ascertain if the May 16 email was linked to Saturday’s account suspension, nor could it determine what specific content the demand referred to, why its removal was sought or the entity that had lodged the complaint.
While the email did not specify which entity had made the request or what content they sought to remove, it said X had been advised that in such cases, a user could contact the secretary of India’s Information and Broadcasting Ministry.
The secretary, Sanjay Jaju, did not respond to requests seeking comment.
The 2000 law allows designated government officials to demand the takedown of content from social media platforms they deem to violate local laws, including on the grounds of national security or if a post threatens public order.
X has long been at odds with India’s government over content-removal requests. In March, the company sued the federal government over a new government website that the company says expands takedown powers to “countless” government officials.
The case is continuing. India has said X wrongly labelled an official website a “censorship portal”, as the website only allows tech companies to be notified about harmful online content.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071052391931895.jpg?r=105648' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922443/lhc-refuses-dna-test-in-paternity-suit' target='_blank'><strong>LHC refuses DNA test in paternity suit</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has refused to order an immediate DNA test in a paternity suit, ruling that the welfare of the minor and the current evidentiary stage of the case outweigh the parents’ joint consent for genetic testing.
Justice Ahsan Raza Kazmi dismissed a civil revision petition filed by a man seeking a declaration that he is not the biological father of a minor girl.
The petitioner, Malik Hamid Raza, urged the court to overturn two lower court decisions — dated April 17 and May 21, 2025 — which had declined his application for DNA analysis.
Raza had approached a family court last year, contesting paternity and seeking a declaration of non-legitimacy.

Upholds lower courts decision

He requested a DNA test of the child, and the mother did not oppose the plea; in fact, she formally recorded her consent.
 
 

However, the trial judge termed the request “premature,” noting that no evidence had yet been recorded. The appellate court dismissed the subsequent appeal for the same reason.
The petitioner then invoked the High Court’s revisional jurisdiction, arguing that the two orders were illegal and contrary to natural justice.
In his detailed judgment, Justice Kazmi held that courts have a “proactive and protective role” when a minor is unable to consent. He noted that even parental agreement can be overridden if it risks emotional or psychological harm.
“Even where both parents consent, the court must still ask whether a DNA test is truly in the child’s best interest,” the judge wrote, describing such orders as serious judicial acts — not to be undertaken lightly or on mere request. He stated that the role of the courts is not only to resolve legal disputes but also to protect human dignity, particularly when the rights of a minor are involved.
Justice Kazmi explained that when scientific tools like DNA testing are used to resolve questions of paternity, the courts must act with caution.
He cited repeated Supreme Court rulings which emphasize that DNA testing in civil matters should not be ordered without necessity and a complete evidentiary context.
“Any deviation would conflict with established jurisprudence,” the judge noted.
He stressed that it is not the availability of technology or the consent of parties that justifies such testing, but whether the purpose truly serves the ends of justice. The judge observed that while DNA tests may be valuable, they must not come at the cost of a child’s mental and emotional well-being.
“Furthermore, it is now well-settled that DNA evidence is not conclusive; rather, it serves as corroborative evidence,” he added.
Justice Kazmi noted that a child born during wedlock is conclusively presumed legitimate unless strong rebuttal is provided. He held that the lower courts had applied the correct test by refusing to dislodge that presumption at this preliminary stage.
He concluded that the trial and appellate courts had exercised lawful discretion, and the High Court found “no perversity or illegality” warranting intervention.
Justice Kazmi held that the lower courts had not shut the door on the DNA test altogether, but had rightly deferred the question until the trial court is equipped with a complete evidentiary record.

Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, said 68 people had died in flooding in his county, the epicentre of the flooding, among them 28 children.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott, speaking at a press conference on Sunday afternoon, said another 10 had died elsewhere in Texas and confirmed 41 were missing.
US President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the victims and said he would probably visit the area on Friday. His administration had been in touch with Abbott, he added.
“It’s a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible. So we say, God bless all of the people that have gone through so much, and God bless, God bless the state of Texas,” he told reporters as he left New Jersey.
Among the most devastating impacts of the flooding occurred at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp where 10 Camp Mystic campers and one counsellor were still missing, according to Leitha.
“It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,” said Abbott, who noted he toured the area on Saturday and pledged to continue efforts to locate the missing.
The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on Friday, the US Independence Day holiday.

Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said the destruction killed three people in Burnet County, one in Tom Green County, five in Travis County and one in Williamson County.
“You will see the death toll rise today and tomorrow,” said Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, also speaking on Sunday.
Officials said on Saturday that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain across the region, about 140 kilometres northwest of San Antonio.
Kidd said he was receiving unconfirmed reports of “an additional wall of water” flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday’s rains.
“We’re evacuating parts of the river right now because we are worried about another wall of river coming down in those areas,” he said, referencing volunteers from outside the area seeking to help locate victims.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency was activated on Sunday and is deploying resources to first responders in Texas after Trump issued a major disaster declaration, the Department of Homeland Security said. US Coast Guard helicopters and planes were aiding search and rescue efforts.
 


Scaling back federal disaster response
Trump has previously outlined plans to scale back the federal government’s role in responding to natural disasters, leaving states to shoulder more of the burden themselves.
Some experts questioned whether cuts to the federal workforce by the Trump administration, including to the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, led to a failure by officials to accurately predict the severity of the floods and issue appropriate warnings ahead of the storm.
Trump’s administration has overseen thousands of job cuts from the National Weather Service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving many weather offices understaffed, former NOAA director Rick Spinrad said.
Spinrad said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but that they would inevitably degrade the agency’s ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts.
Trump pushed back when asked on Sunday if federal government cuts hobbled the disaster response or left key job vacancies at the National Weather Service under Trump’s oversight.
“That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup,” he said, referencing his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. “But I wouldn’t blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is 100-year catastrophe.”
He declined to answer a question about FEMA, saying only, “They’re busy working, so we’ll leave it at that,” Trump said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a “moderate” flood watch issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system.
Joaquin Castro, a Democratic US congressman from Texas, told CNN’s “State of the Union” program that fewer personnel at the weather service could be dangerous.
“When you have flash flooding, there’s a risk that if you don’t have the personnel … to do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way, it could lead to tragedy,” Castro said.
‘Complete devastation’
Katharine Somerville, a counsellor on the Cypress Lake side of Camp Mystic, on higher ground than the Guadalupe River side, said her 13-year-old campers were scared as their cabins sustained damage and lost power in the middle of the night.
“Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water. I mean, y’all have seen the complete devastation, we never even imagined that this could happen,” Somerville said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday.
 


Somerville said the campers in her care were put on military trucks and evacuated, and that all were safe.
The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as nine metres.
A day after the disaster struck, the summer camp, where 700 girls were in residence at the time of the flooding, was a scene of devastation. Inside one cabin, mud lines indicating how high the water had risen were at least six feet (1.83m) from the floor.
Bed frames, mattresses and personal belongings caked with mud were scattered inside. Some buildings had broken windows, and one had a missing wall.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07084103c50f0d9.jpg?r=104835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922519/brics-nations-slam-trump-tariffs-condemn-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Brics nations slam Trump tariffs, condemn strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Brics leaders at a summit on Sunday took aim at US President Donald Trump’s “indiscriminate” import tariffs and recent Israeli-US strikes on Iran.
The 11 emerging nations — including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — account for about half the world’s population and 40 per cent of global economic output.
The bloc is divided about much, but found common cause when it comes to the mercurial US leader and his stop-start tariff wars — even if it avoided naming him directly.
 
 

Voicing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures, Brics members said the tariffs risked hurting the global economy, according to a summit joint statement.
Trump fired back at the bloc directly on social media on Sunday night.
“Any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics will be charged an additional 10 per cent Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
 


Earlier, Brics also offered symbolic backing to fellow member Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on nuclear and other targets carried out by Israel and the United States.
In April, Trump threatened allies and rivals alike with a slew of punitive duties, before offering a months-long reprieve in the face of a fierce market sell-off.
Trump has warned he will impose unilateral levies on partners unless they reach “deals” by August 1.
In an apparent concession to US allies, such as Brazil, India, and Saudi Arabia, the summit declaration did not criticise the United States or its president by name at any point.
No show
Conceived two decades ago as a forum for fast-growing economies, the BRICS have come to be seen as a Chinese-driven counterbalance to US and Western European power.
But as the group has expanded to include Iran, Saudi Arabia and others, it has struggled to reach meaningful consensus on issues from the Gaza onslaught to challenging US global dominance.
Brics nations, for example, collectively called for a peaceful two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict — despite Tehran’s long-standing position that Israel should be destroyed.
An Iranian diplomatic source said his government’s “reservations” had been conveyed to Brazilian hosts. Still, Iran stopped short of rejecting the statement outright.
In perhaps a further sign of the diplomatic sensitivities, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister skipped Sunday’s discussions entirely, according to a Brazilian government source.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s leading beneficiaries of high-tech US military exports and is a long-standing US partner.
 
 

The political punch of this year’s summit has been depleted by the absence of China’s Xi Jinping, who skipped the meeting for the first time in his 12 years as president.
The Chinese leader is not the only notable absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, charged with war crimes in Ukraine, also opted to stay away, participating via video link.
He told counterparts that Brics had become a key player in global governance.
The summit also called for regulation governing artificial intelligence and said the technology could not be the preserve of only rich nations.
The commercial AI sector is currently dominated by US tech giants, although China and other nations have rapidly developing capacity.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071017501d5aa54.png?r=102905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922528/at-least-2-dead-hundreds-injured-as-typhoon-danas-lashes-southern-taiwan-with-record-winds' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 dead, hundreds injured as Typhoon Danas lashes southern Taiwan with record winds</strong></a><br><p>Typhoon Danas lashed southern Taiwan with record winds and strong rain early on Monday, killing two people and injuring more than 330 in a rare hit to the island’s densely populated west coast, where businesses and schools were shut.
Taiwan is regularly struck by typhoons but they generally land along the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific.
Typhoon Danas, at one point listed by Taiwan’s weather authority at the second-strongest level, headed north towards the Taiwan Strait after making landfall along its southwestern coast late on Sunday.
 


It has greatly weakened since and was forecast to hit eastern China later this week.
“The typhoon track is rare… the whole of Taiwan will be affected by the wind and rain one after another,” President Lai Ching-te said in a post on Facebook, urging citizens to make preparations.
Power to more than half a million homes was cut and over 300 domestic and international flights were cancelled, government data showed. The north-south high-speed rail line scaled back services.
The National Fire Agency said one person was killed by a falling tree while driving and another died after their respirator malfunctioned due to a power cut.
Record winds of around 220 kilometres per hour were recorded in the southwestern county of Yunlin, while more than 700 trees and street signs were blown over across western cities and towns, government data showed.
There was no major report of damage in the Tainan Science Park that houses tech giants such as TSMC.
Maritime officials in eastern China’s Zhejiang province raised their emergency response to the second-highest level on Monday, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
As of 10 am (7am PKT), 121 passenger vessels and 64 ferry routes had been suspended across the province, CCTV reported. Authorities also halted 181 construction projects, including wind farms, as a precaution.
Danas is expected to gradually approach the coastal areas between Zhejiang’s city of Taizhou and Fuzhou city in neighbouring Fujian province, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
The typhoon is forecast to make landfall along the stretch late on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/062034108787d95.jpg?r=203547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully' target='_blank'><strong>Ashura processions in major cities of country conclude peacefully</strong></a><br><p>Yaum-i-Ashura processions in major cities across the country safely concluded on Sunday evening amid tightened security.
Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.
So far, processions in Karachi, Hyderabad and Punjab have culminated, according to statements from senior officials.
The Ashura procession in Karachi safely culminated at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah, with a police update sharing that the head of the procession reached the imam bargah at 6:20pm.
Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho praised the Karachi Police for excellent security arrangements during Muharram, according to a statement from his office.
“Majalis and processions were organised at several places in Karachi, including Nishtar Park,” he was quoted as saying, expressing appreciation for the Traffic Police for arranging alternative routes for the convenience of the general public during the main procession.
Additional IG Odho also thanked media representatives, procession organisers, mourners and other institutions for their cooperation, according to the statement.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his satisfaction over the peaceful end of Ashura and thanked the interior minister, police and Rangers for “foolproof” security arrangements and the local government minister, Karachi mayor and relevant staff for providing facilities, according to a statement from his office.
“The peaceful conclusion of Ashura processions across Sindh is the government’s success,” Shah was quoted as saying. “Despite high security concerns, the Sindh Police did an excellent job, and the government made every effort to provide all facilities to the mourners.”

Shah praised the role of religious scholars in maintaining religious harmony, calling their role “commendable”.
“Sindh is the land of Sufis. We are advocates of peace,” Shah stated.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also congratulated Sindh Police for their excellent security strategy and performance during Ashura.
“During this important occasion, security measures taken by all units of the Sindh Police, including the Traffic Police and Special Branch Police at the provincial level from Muharram 1 to Ashura, are commendable at every level,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.
Lanjar also praised and appreciated the performance of Rangers Sindh and other security agencies on this occasion.
Meanwhile, the central Ashura procession in Hyderabad culminated peacefully at Karbala Dadan Shah.
Every year, the procession departs from Qadam Gah Maula Ali and is managed by Anjuma-i-Hyderi, which was founded in 1948.
The entire route was sealed since the early morning with barbed wire, while police and Rangers personnel were deployed.
The procession reached St Mary’s Convent School roundabout, where mourners performed zohrain prayers. Subsequently, a majlis was addressed a small distance from the roundabout by Syed Wasim Hyder Zaidi, according to an Anjuman-i-Hyderi spokesman.
A majlis was also addressed by Allama Irfan Ali Kazmi before the procession departed from Qadam Gah.
The procession was delayed by over an hour at St Mary’s Chowk and passed the area at 5.15pm instead of the usual time of 4pm. This area also connects the route of the tazia procession from the city.
Police arrangements for security were also weak. No strict checking was seen and everyone was allowed to reach the procession route, especially from Universal Book Depot point. Some policemen who were initially seen for security purpose disappeared subsequently.
Deputy Inspector General Tariq Dharejo, Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio and Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abidin monitored the proceedings in the control room set up in the City police station.
Meanwhile, a statement from the Punjab government stated that processions were culminating safely in multiple cities across the province. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif congratulated her team, including Salman Rafique, ministers, institutions and others, for the “excellent arrangements”.

A briefing delivered to Aurangzeb confirmed that the processions were being monitored in real-time through 7,500 cameras across Punjab and that 113,000 personnel were deployed.
Additionally, more than 1,600 “hate-spreading accounts” were reported by the Cyber ​​Patrol Cell of the Home Department and 170 people were arrested, according to the briefing.
Aurangzeb was also briefed on the provision of clean water and clean procession routes, where water was sprinkled to cool mourners amid the heat and the spraying of disinfectants was continuous. Mobile toilets were also provided and rescue personnel were on standby in case of emergency.
A coordinated plan was also prepared with the Water and Power Distribution Authority (Wapda) and other institutions for uninterrupted power supply during Yaum-i-Ashura.
Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.
In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”
In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”
He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p><small>2025-07-06 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0618170583cf3f3.jpg?r=181916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922498/6-die-in-flash-floods-rains-in-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>6 die in flash floods, rains in KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>Six people were killed while one person was injured on Sunday amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMA) in both provinces.
At least 22 people have been killed and 11 others have been injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.
Additionally, PDMA warned on Friday that the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) — the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake — has increased in glacial areas of the province due to increasing temperatures, which in turn has raised the risk of additional flooding.
Today’s report from the PDMA outlined that four people were killed in KP while another was injured due to heavy rainfall and flash floods, according to the PDMA’s reporting officers in Malakand and Hazara divisions.
The PDMA said that three rooms in a house in the Buner district’s Teenolo Dheri village collapsed, killing a woman and injuring a man. Separately, in Buner, a temporary bridge pillar at Faizabad Khwar was swept away.
In Malakand, a flash flood caused by heavy rainfall swept through the Heero Shah union council, killing three people.
According to the PDMA report, one woman and two children were swept away. The woman and one of the children drowned.
“Rescue 1122 recovered [a] female body, while two children are still missing,” the report read, adding that a rescue operation was underway.
Rescue 1122 later issued an update stating that one of the children had been rescued.
Meanwhile, Dargai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Shahbaz Khan told Dawn.com that a woman and her grandson drowned in the Zor Mandi nullah as they were crossing it.
“Both bodies were recovered by Rescue 1122 and moved to Dargai hospital,” he stated.
Dargai Additional AC Waheedullah told Dawn.com that there was heavy rain in the mountains of Kot and the Hiro Shah Dargai area in the morning.
“Flash floods occurred in small, dry nullahs originating from the mountains and leading to small streams,” he said. “A nine-year-old boy was swept away by the flash flood in a small dry nullah. His grandmother, around 55-years-old, tried to save him but was also swept away.
The additional AC said that a rescue operation was launched immediately and that the boy’s body was recovered from the Pir Kalay Harichan Charsadda/Badragga Malakand boundary, while the body of the woman was recovered from the Zormandi Quaidabad area.
Additional AC Waheedullah further said that he was present in the field and people were discouraged from approaching or crossing the nullahs through announcements and the deployment of Levies personnel.
Additionally, three cows were rescued from flash floods in the Zormandi area.
“The bodies are being transported to Arang Bajaur and an ambulance from Rescue 1122 was arranged,” Waheedullah added.
In Mansehra, the PDMA stated in its report that an an 18-year-old resident of Rawalpindi had drowned in a flash flood in Putwar Halqa Jabba which was caused by heavy rain.
Amir Khadam, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Mansehra, told Dawn.com that the young man drowned when he was crossing a nullah in the Mansehra district with his motorcycle on Sunday morning.
“The body of the deceased was recovered from floodwater in the Ghotar area and was turned over to his heirs,” Khadam said.
The PDMA added that due to the heavy rainfall, landslides were reported in Buner’s Pandriks union council and Torghar district’s Tharala area. Both events caused traffic blockages and heavy machinery was deployed to clear the roads.
Heavy rain continues to lash Punjab
Meanwhile, a PDMA report on monsoon rains in various districts of Punjab, including Lahore, was released today.
According to a PDMA spokesperson, dilapidated and decaying houses collapsed amid heavy rain, with two dead and six injured in various accidents.
“A woman and a child were killed due to the collapse of dilapidated and decaying buildings in Rawalpindi and Gujranwala,” said the spokesperson. “Two dilapidated and mud houses were affected due to monsoon rains.”
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said in a statement that he expected heavy rain to persist in Punjab until July 10.
“Heavy monsoon rains are expected in most parts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said. “Stay in safe places during thunderstorms and do not shelter in mud houses or dilapidated buildings.
“During rain, slow down the speed of your vehicle and maintain a reasonable distance,” he urged.
He also instructed medical institutions to provide the best medical assistance to the injured.
“As per the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, citizens’ losses will be compensated,” Kathia instructed. “Assistance will also be provided to the relatives of the deceased as per government policy.”
According to the report, Lahore recorded the highest amount of rainfall in Paniwala Talab, at 74 millimetres (mm).
Similarly, 72mm fell in Lakshmi Chowk, 57mm on Jail Road, 52mm in Nishtar Town, 52mm in Farrukhabad, 51mm in Gulberg, 37mm at the airport, 33mm in Mughal Pura and 44mm at Qurtaba Chowk.

Warnings issued
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued a warning today for widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers expected across several regions of the country from July 6-8 (Sunday to Tuesday), The Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The wet spell is likely to bring very heavy rainfall at various locations, with the risks of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides, particularly in the northern and hilly areas.
The PMD said that rain, wind and thundershowers are likely in KP, Punjab, northeast and southern Balochistan, southeast Sindh, Kashmir, and Islamabad. Additionally, isolated heavy downpours are expected in upper Punjab, the Potohar region, Islamabad, KP, Azad and Jammu Kashmir (AJK), and northern Balochistan.
The Met Office warned that heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in local streams and nullahs in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan, northeast Punjab, AJK, and parts of Balochistan.
It added that the risk of landslides and mudslides is high in vulnerable mountainous areas like KP, Murree, Galliyat and AJK, which may cause road closures and travel disruptions.</p><small>2025-07-06 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06224021b574630.jpg?r=224242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922506/deep-strikes-as-india-hammer-england-in-second-test' target='_blank'><strong>Deep strikes as India hammer England in second Test</strong></a><br><p>Akash Deep took 10 wickets in a Test match for the first time as India thrashed England by 336 runs at Edgbaston on Sunday for a series-levelling win.
Deep was playing in the second Test of the five-match series after India rested outstanding quick Jasprit Bumrah.
The 28-year-old took 6-99 as England, set a mammoth 608 runs to win, were dismissed for 271 on the fifth day.
Deep’s match figures of 10-147 were far and away the best of his eight-Test career.
Jamie Smith was the lone England batter to pass fifty in the second innings, with the wicketkeeper’s 88 following his brilliant 184 not out the first time around.
A crushing victory gave India their maiden Test win in nine matches at Edgbaston following seven defeats and a draw at the Birmingham ground.
This game was also a personal triumph for India captain Shubman Gill after he became the first batsman in Test cricket to post scores of 250 and 150 in the same match.
The 25-year-old’s majestic 269 in the first innings was followed by a dashing 161 off 162 balls in the second.
Gill has now scored three centuries in his first two Tests as captain following his 147 during India’s five-wicket loss in the series opener at Headingley.
History was against England when they resumed at 72-3 after rain delayed Sunday’s start by more than 90 minutes.
No Test side has made more in the fourth innings to win than the West Indies’ 418 against Australia at St John’s in 2003.
Early blow -
India, bidding for just a fourth series win in England, struck an early blow when Ollie Pope failed to add his overnight 24 by deflecting a Deep ball of extra bounce onto the stumps.
His exit brought in England captain Ben Stokes, on a king pair after his first golden duck in Tests in the first innings.
But Stokes, without a Test hundred in two years, avoided the embarrassment of two noughts in the same match with a legside flick.
England were soon 83-5, however, when Harry Brook was lbw for 23 to a Deep delivery that hit him on the back knee.
Brook, who made 158 in England’s first innings while sharing a stand of over 300 with Smith that kept the hosts afloat, optimistically reviewed.
But the confirmation of his dismissal was greeted by raucous cheers from the large number of India fans at Edgbaston.
Smith helped Stokes briefly keep India at bay during a sixth-wicket partnership of 70.
But in the last over before lunch Stokes was lbw for 33 to off-spinner Washington Sundar, the first India bowler other than Deep or Mohammed Siraj to take a wicket in the match.
England were 153-6 at the interval and after lunch Smith defiantly hit 17 off a Sundar over, including two soaring straight sixes.
But Chris Woakes fell tamely for seven when a miscued pull off Prasidh Krishna lobbed gently to midwicket.
Smith pulled Deep for two successive sixes to go to 88.
But it was a case of third time unlucky for the 24-year-old when trying to repeat the shot next ball, he holed out to Sundar at deep backward square leg off a well-disguised slower delivery to give Deep his fifth wicket of the innings.
At 226-8, the writing was on the wall for England.
Tailender Josh Tongue was brilliantly caught by a diving Siraj at midwicket before Brydon Carse holed out off Deep to cover where Gill, the player of the match, fittingly took the clinching catch.</p><small>2025-07-06 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/062207086e6899f.jpg?r=221128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922505/tiktok-building-new-version-of-app-ahead-of-expected-us-sale-report' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok building new version of app ahead of expected US sale: report</strong></a><br><p>TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the United States ahead the social media platform’s planned sale to a group of investors, The Information reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.
This comes as US President Donald Trump said on Friday he will start talking to China on Monday or Tuesday about a possible TikTok deal. He said the United States “pretty much” has a deal on the sale of the TikTok short-video app.
TikTok has developed a plan to launch the new app in US app stores on September 5, the report said.
Last month, Trump extended to September 17 a deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok.
The report added that TikTok users will eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, although the existing app will work until March of next year, though the timeline could change.
TikTok did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
A deal had been in the works earlier this year to spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new US-based firm, majority-owned and operated by American investors. That was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump said the United States will probably have to get a deal approved by China.</p><small>2025-07-06 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/062116277193d0c.jpg?r=212011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922502/mclarens-norris-wins-home-british-grand-prix' target='_blank'><strong>McLaren’s Norris wins home British Grand Prix</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris won a treacherous rain-hit British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday from his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.
Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg took third for the veteran German’s first-ever podium in 239 race starts.
Briton Norris returned to a rapturous reception from his home fans as he moved to within eight points of Piastri in the drivers’ standings.
“It’s beautiful, everything I ever dreamed of, this is everything I wanted to achieve, aside from winning the championship this is as good as it gets,” beamed Norris.
Piastri, who finished less than seven seconds behind Norris, threw away the win after the Australian was hit with a 10-second penalty for a safety car infringement.
As last week’s heatwave gave way to a more typical British summer’s day — spells of blue sky mixed with torrential showers — drivers had to keep their wits about them with puddles forming on the track.
Norris emerged from the chaos all smiles as he added to his wins already this season in Austria, Monaco and Australia.
Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton came in fourth ahead of polesitter Max Verstappen for Red Bull.
Piastri fell foul of the stewards when braking heavily before the safety car peeled off, a decision that left Piastri feeling robbed.
“I’m not going to say much, I don’t want to get myself in trouble,” he said in the post-race interview. “Apparently, you can’t brake behind the safety car anymore.”
For Hulkenberg, 37, this was a day to remember as he climbed the podium for the first time since joining the F1 grid way back in 2010.
“Podium — P3 baby!” said his ecstatic race engineer on the team radio after he crossed the line.
“I don’t think I can comprehend what we’ve just done,” replied the German.

Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.
“The rescue operation was completed on Sunday evening,” Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com. “No more human casualties have been found; thus, the total death toll stands at 27 people, whose bodies were earlier recovered and transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.”
The spokesperson added that acting Rescue 1122 Director General Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh remained on the ground for over 30 hours, directly commanding the rescue operation.
Khan said that the exact cause of the collapse would be determined later, but suggested it was “because the building was dilapidated”.
“A day before the collapse, residents felt a ‘shock’. It can be said now that it was not an earthquake, but the building’s structure being shaken or dislocated,” Khan said. “There were 12 families, though some families had already left the building after the tremors.”
Difficulties
The Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a lack of coordination among different rescue organisations and that staffers from two private rescue organisations fought during the operation.
“They sustained injuries to the head during the scuffle,” Khan said. “It would have been more appropriate if one organisation had been given command, under which all rescue institutions could have worked.”
Another problem, according to Khan, was that relatives remained at the site as they were not willing to be moved to any government or private shelter. The rescue workers faced “immense pressure” from the relatives, he added.
Khan added that there was difficulty in moving heavy machinery like cranes due to the narrow streets.
“We used the same high-tech equipment that was used during the recent earthquake in Turkiye,” Khan told Dawn.com. “The use of such high-tech equipment, like life detectors helped rescue several people safely with some minor injuries. Without this equipment, the use of heavy machinery might have caused further injury.”
He said that over 100 personnel took part in the operation for three days, working in different shifts.
At around 1:30pm, Khan told Dawn.com, “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.
A total of 27 bodies were recovered, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.
Ten people who were injured have been discharged.
While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.
“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.
He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.
The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.
He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.
“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.
CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.
He also urged the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.
He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.
While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p><small>2025-07-06 14:35</small></div><hr>
