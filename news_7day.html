Anthems

The Indian anthem is being played next.
Pakistan openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan make their way to the crease.

Analysis by Dawn’s Umaid Wasim: Pakistan wanted to bat first and set an above-par total. India wanted to bowl first. Both sides will be quite happy with the outcome of the toss. Pakistan, though, face a trial by spin. The pitch is the same as the one for India’s opening match against the UAE. India skipper Suyakumar Yadav said at the toss that batting got easier in the second stanza of the UAE game, and perhaps that is why he wanted his side to be batting second.

Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “We’re very excited for the match.”
According to the captain, Pakistan’s rationale behind batting first is that the surface looks to be on the slower side.
His Indian counterpart, Suryakumar Yadav, said this team was really looking forward to this game.
Both teams are unchanged since their last encounters in the tournament.
Pakistan batter Saim Ayub said on Saturday that the team was not just focusing on the Pakistan-India match, but winning the men’s Asia Cup.
 

Pakistan and India fans cheer before the start of the Asia Cup 2025 Twenty20 international cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 14, 2025.

While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan to win the final of a tri-series and Oman in the lead-up to the contest.
The two teams last faced each other in February, in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the ODI format.

Zardari, who is on a 10-day trip to China, asserted this during a visit to the  the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — the country’s aerospace and defence conglomerate engaged in the design and production of a wide range of military and civilian aircraft,  including J-10C fighter jets that Pakistan employed during an escalation with India in May.
The use of these aircraft is said to have played a crucial role in shooting down India’s fighter jets, including Rafales, during the four-day escalation that ended with a ceasefire on May 10.
The statement by the President’s Secretariat today said: “On the 128th day since the ceasefire with India, President Asif Ali Zardari, constitutionally the supreme commander of the armed forces of Pakistan, visited the Aviation Industry Corporation of China”.

According to the statement, the president toured the sprawling complex in its entirety and met the AVIC’s engineers and scientists, “listening to their insights on innovation, production and future technologies”.
He was briefed on the AVIC’s “advanced capabilities, including the J-10 fighter jet, the co-production of the JF-17 Thunder with Pakistan, as well as progress in the J-20 stealth 5th-generation fighter aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, fully automated units, and integrated command-and-control systems for modern multi-domain operations”.
The statement quoted the president as saying that “J-10 and JF-17 have greatly strengthened the Pakistan Air Force, a fact clearly demonstrated during May 2025’s Maraka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.

He hailed the AVIC as “a symbol of China’s technological advancement and of the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and China”.
The statement said Zardari’s visit to the facility was also historic as “no foreign head of state had previously visited the AVIC complex”.
Zardari was accompanied by his son PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, his daughter MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who will be travelling with the president throughout the visit, it added.

The president later arrived in Shanghai. On his arrival at the airport, the president was warmly received by Chen Qun, vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Committee, and Ma Yinghui, director general of the Foreign Affairs Office of Shanghai Municipality, according to another statement.
President Zardari reached China on Friday, where he will hold meetings with the Chinese leadership and senior officials to further strengthen Pakistan-China relations, enhance cooperation in diverse fields, and advance shared objectives.
He will also visit Shanghai and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and hold meetings with the leadership there, according to an earlier statement by the Foreign Office.
The discussions will encompass Pakistan-China bilateral relations, with a particular focus on economic and trade cooperation, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and future connectivity initiatives, the statement said, adding that the visit underscores the tradition of high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China, reflecting the deep commitment of the two countries to strengthen their relations.</p><small>2025-09-14 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141514126e4a113.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941924/calls-for-boycott-in-india-ahead-of-asia-cup-match-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Calls for boycott in India ahead of Asia Cup match with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Some Indian politicians and former cricketers have called on their country to boycott its matches with Pakistan in the ongoing Asia Cup tournament, as the two arch-rival teams are set to face each other in Dubai today.
An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster. Still, emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who fought a four-day military conflict in May. The countries have been at odds in various matters since then, including claims of downing jets, ceasefire requests, geopolitical narratives and of course, cricket.
Several former Indian players and politicians have urged the BCCI to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy, saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, head of the Shiv Sena-UBT party, has announced that his party will organise protests across the state against the game, Hindustan Times reported.
“Our prime minister said blood and water cannot flow together, so how can blood and cricket flow together? How can war and cricket be at the same time? They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match,” he was quoted as saying.
 






Later, Indian news agency ANI shared on X a video, with a caption saying, “Shiv Sena (UBT) burns Pakistani national flag in front of Thiruvananthapuram AG’s office in protest against India vs Pakistan match today in Asia Cup.”
Ahead of today’s game, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal posted on X: “Playing a match with Pakistan is treason against the country. Every Indian is extremely angry about this.”
He was commenting on a post by AAP’s Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, who wrote: “Blood and sports cannot go together.”
 


ANI also talked to a Congress leader, Ajay Rai, on that matter, who urged the Supreme Court of India to stop the country’s team from playing against Pakistan in accordance with “public sentiment”.
A day ago, the AAP protested against the match between Men in Blue and Green Shirts, with Bharadwaj and party workers burning an effigy symbolising Pakistani players, The Hindu reported.
Former cricketer Kedhar Jadhav, also a part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the India-Pakistan fixture should not go ahead.
“I don’t know what will happen, but I have already said that according to me, this match should not be played,” Jadhav was quoted as saying by The Times of India.
The matter had also reached the Indian top court as four law students filed a petition against the match, contending that it was “against national interest”. But the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the plea.
Indian news anchor Shiv Aroor said Asia Cup was “precisely the opportunity the [Government of India] should have taken to signal that Pahalgam & [Operation] Sindoor = new rules on terror”, referring to New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which Pakistan strongly denied.
“‘Multilateral tournament’ excuses are pathetic, embarrassing. We make the rules,” Aroor said on X.
 


Meanwhile, a video clip of Indian anchorperson Arnab Goswami has been doing rounds on social media where he is calling for the match’s boycott and and saying that this match should garner the lowest television rankings. He went on to question the Indian cricket board and Sony TV, which has the broadcasting rights for the Asia Cup, that who gave “permission for the match”.
Ex-cricketer and politician Manoj Tiwary told ANI he was boycotting the match, as well as the entire Asia Cup. “It needs to be understood that this is just a sport; this is not life. We are comparing human lives to sports; this should never be done.”
He also questioned the BCCI’s “justification” for playing the matches, adding that the team could have forfeited today’s face-off and reached the finals by winning other games.
 






‘A compulsion’
On the other hand, BJP lawmaker and former sports minister Anurag Thakur defended the BCCI’s stance on playing against Pakistan in the Asia Cup.
“When multinational tournaments are organised by ACC or ICC, it becomes a compulsion, a necessity for nations to participate,” he told ANI.
“If they don’t do that, they will be eliminated from the tournament, they will have to forfeit the match, and the other team will get the points,” he added, before pointing out that India does not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan.
 






Actor Suniel Shetty, father-in-law of cricketer KL Rahul, echoed similar sentiments: “It’s a world sporting body. They have to abide by those rules and regulations because there are a lot of other sports and a lot of athletes who are involved in them.
“As Indians, I think that is our personal call that we have to take, whether we want to see it, whether we don’t want to see it […] and that’s a call India has to take, but you cannot blame cricketers for playing because they are sportsmen, they are expected to represent the country,” he told reporters.
 






On this side of the border, former captain Wasim Akram has urged Pakistani and Indian cricketers to ignore the noise and “enjoy” the game. “Forget about everything other than cricket. One team will win, and one team will lose,” he told AFP.
BCCI defends stance, citing future hosting risks
However, Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) Secretary Devajit Saikia defended his country’s decision to play against Pakistan. He told Hindustan Times that it was an international tournament and that a boycott would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.
“Had it been a bilateral tournament, we could have always said that we would not play against any hostile country. And so far as Pakistan is concerned, we are not playing any bilateral tournament since 2012-13 onwards,” he added.
 
 

India’s fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the team has been instructed to strictly follow the directives of the BCCI and the Indian government. He added that head coach Gautam Gambhir, who in May had also called for a boycott, has called for focus on cricket.
“Our thing is, you separate sports and politics,” he said. “I understand the sentiment, but we are following the directives of BCCI and the government. We are going by what the government and BCCI told us.
“The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time, and we didn’t think we’d be coming at one stage, but obviously the Indian government stance in it and now you have to put the sentiment and emotions behind … it’s something we addressed in the team meeting today,“ ten Doeschate added.
Still, Hindustan Times, citing a report in Dainik Jagran, said “most” BCCI officials have decided to distance themselves from the upcoming India-Pakistan match. The report claimed that a BCCI official would only be seen on-camera if India won.
Today’s clash could be the first of three as both India and Pakistan are favourites to qualify for the Super Four stage and possibly for the September 28 final.
In May, the BCCI had denied reports of withdrawal from all Asian Cricket Council (ACC) events amid recent tensions with Pakistan.</p><small>2025-09-14 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14181232b2a1976.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941947/chinese-officials-hold-talks-in-spain-on-trade-irritants-tiktok-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese officials hold talks in Spain on trade irritants, TikTok deadline</strong></a><br><p>United States and Chinese officials began talks in Madrid on Sunday on their strained trade ties, a looming divestiture deadline for Chinese short video app TikTok and Washington’s demands that its allies place tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer arrived shortly before Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, at the baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz, which houses Spain’s foreign ministry in the Spanish capital.
The talks mark the fourth time in four months that the delegations have met in European cities to try to keep a fractured US-China trade relationship from collapsing under US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The delegations last met in Stockholm in July, where they agreed in principle to extend for 90 days a trade truce that sharply reduced triple-digit retaliatory tariffs on both sides and restarted the flow of rare-earth minerals from China to the United States.
Trump has approved the extension of current US tariff rates on Chinese goods, totalling about 55 per cent, until November 10.
Trade experts said there was little likelihood of a substantial breakthrough in the talks hosted by Spain, which has sought to improve ties with Beijing in recent years.
The most likely result of the Madrid talks is seen as another extension of a deadline for the popular TikTok app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its US operations by September 17 or face a US shutdown.
A source familiar with the Trump administration’s discussions on TikTok’s future said that a deal was not expected, but that the deadline would be extended for a fourth time since Trump took office in January. Trump last month launched a TikTok account.
TikTok has not been discussed in previous rounds of US-China trade talks in Geneva, London and Stockholm.
But the source said the issue’s public inclusion as an agenda item on the Treasury’s announcement of the talks gives the Trump administration political cover for another extension, which may annoy both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who mandated TikTok’s sale to a US entity to reduce national security risks.

Wendy Cutler, a former USTR trade negotiator and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, said she expected more substantial “deliverables” to be saved for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year, perhaps at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul at the end of October.
These may include a final deal to resolve US national security concerns over TikTok, and a lifting of restrictions on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and reduction of fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods, and the Madrid discussions may help lay groundwork for such a meeting, Cutler said.
But she said resolving core US economic complaints about China, including its demands that China shift its economic model toward more domestic consumption and rely less on state-subsidised exports, could take years.
“Frankly, I don’t think China is in any rush to do an agreement where they don’t get substantial concessions on export controls and lower tariffs, which are their key priorities,” Cutler said. “And I don’t see the United States in a position to make major concessions on either, unless there’s some breakthrough on its demands to China.”
Russian oil pressure
The treasury has said the Madrid talks also would cover joint US-Chinese efforts to combat money laundering, a reference to its longstanding demands that China clamp down on illicit shipments of technology goods to Russia that aid its war in Ukraine.
Bessent urged Group of Seven (G7) allies on Friday to impose “meaningful tariffs” on imports from China and India to pressure them to stop buying Russian oil, a move aimed at bringing Moscow into Ukraine peace negotiations by curbing its oil revenues.

The G7 finance ministers said on Friday they discussed such measures and agreed to speed up discussions to use frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine’s defence. Bessent and Greer said in a separate statement that G7 allies should join the United States in imposing tariffs on buyers of Russian oil.
“Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,” Bessent and Greer said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The US has imposed an extra 25pc tariff on Indian goods over the country’s purchases of Russian oil, but has so far refrained from imposing such punitive duties on Chinese goods.
China’s Ministry of Commerce has said the Madrid talks will cover economic and trade issues such as US tariffs, the “abuse” of export controls and TikTok.
Spain’s moment
Spanish Foreign Minister Jos Manuel Albares publicly greeted the two delegations before the start of talks.
A Spanish government source said the choice of Spain for the latest round of the “delicate” talks was evidence that Madrid was consolidating itself as a seat of high-level and strategic negotiations. Madrid has sought to be a venue for an international peace conference to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The source said Spain’s government also takes advantage of the event to reinforce its own bilateral relations with the US following a series of tense engagements with the Trump administration.
Spain has criticised Israel’s offensive in Gaza and refused to commit to spending 5pc of its budget on defence, along with other Nato members.
Bessent himself has also criticised Spain for declaring Beijing a “strategic partner” at the height of Trump’s tariff offensive in April, saying that a closer relationship with the Asian giant was akin to “cutting your own throat”</p><small>2025-09-14 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14173545c15f523.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941943/former-world-boxing-champion-ricky-hatton-dies-at-age-46' target='_blank'><strong>Former world boxing champion Ricky Hatton dies at age 46</strong></a><br><p>British boxer Ricky Hatton has died at the age of 46, the BBC reported on Sunday.
Former world champion Hatton won titles at light-welterweight and welterweight, before retiring in 2012. He had been due to make a comeback for an event in Dubai later this year.
Greater Manchester Police said in a statement that a body had been found on Sunday morning at an address in Hyde in the northern English city.
A police spokesman said: “Officers were called by a member of the public to attend Bowlacre Road, Hyde, Tameside, at 6:45am (0545 GMT) today (Sunday) where they found the body of a 46-year-old man. There are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances.”
Hatton had 45 wins in 48 bouts over his career but in the years after he retired he said he had tried to kill himself several times and had been open about his struggle with depression, drink and drugs.
“I was coming off the rails with my drinking and that led to drugs. It was like a runaway train,” he told BBC radio in 2016.
Hatton’s best performance came in 2005 when he stopped Australian Kostya Tszyu to add the IBF light-welterweight title to the WBU belt he already held.
He had a perfect 43-0 record until he was floored by Floyd Mayweather Jr in Las Vegas in 2007 and was never the same again.
Britain’s former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury paid tribute to Hatton.
“Rip to the legend Ricky Hatton may he rip,” Fury posted on Instagram.
“There will only ever be 1 Ricky Hatton. Can’t believe this so young.”
Another former world champion, Britain’s Amir Khan, described Hatton on X as a “mentor, warrior and one of Britain’s greatest boxers”.
 






Khan added: “As fighters, we tell ourselves we’re strong – we train, we sweat, we take hits, we get up. But sometimes the hardest fight happens in silence, in the mind.
“Mental health isn’t weakness. It’s part of being human. And we must talk about it. We must reach out. We must lean on each other.
“Ricky, thank you for everything. For your fights, your moments of glory, your grit. Thank you for pushing us, showing us what’s possible.
Matchroom Boxing said: “(We are) saddened to hear the news of Ricky Hatton’s passing. Our thoughts and condolences are with Ricky’s friends and family at this tragic time. There’s only one Ricky Hatton.”</p><small>2025-09-14 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14113336ddc5832.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941905/fm-dar-discusses-regional-international-developments-in-phone-call-with-marco-rubio' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar discusses regional, international developments in phone call with Marco Rubio</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call on Saturday night, the Foreign Office (FO) said, adding that the two leaders reaffirmed the commitment to strengthen bilateral ties and discussed regional and international developments.
“Deputy Prime Minister/ Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar received a call tonight from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.
“The two leaders expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of Pakistan-US ties and discussed recent regional and international developments. They reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations across multifaceted areas of cooperation,” the FO said.
 






The phone call between Dar and Rubio has taken place against the backdrop of improving Pakistan-US ties and amid significant developments in the Middle East.
Last month, it was noted in an analysis published by Dawn that the “positive signals” between Islamabad and Washington, “which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie”.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counter-terrorism cooperation in the arrest of an militant organisation IS-Khorasan’s operative to claiming credit for a ceasefire between Pakistan and India following their May conflict, Pakistan has perhaps featured more in incumbent US President Donald Trump’s “day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’”, it was observed in the analysis.
After the May escalation, Pakistan’s army chief also met President Trump at the White House. This was followed by a series of cabinet-level engagements, culminating in a breakthrough tariff agreement that set a uniform duty of 19 per cent on Pakistani exports to the US.
“After securing what seems to be a major discount in tariff negotiations, attracting US investor interest in its oil and mineral reserves and signalling that its currency market is receptive to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Pakistan seems to be in the driving seat as far as South Asia is concerned,” the analysis said.
Earlier this month, Pakistan also signed a memorandum of understanding worth $500 million with an American metals company, the US Strategic Metals.
Saturday’s phone call between Dar and Rubio also took place before the latter left for a visit to Israel and the former to Qatar.
Recently, there has been a rift between Israel and Qatar, both of whom are US allies, following Tel Aviv’s strikes targeting the leaders of Palestinian group Hamas in Doha.
Israel’s action has drawn widespread international condemnation, and Dar reached Doha today to attend a ministerial meeting ahead of an emergency summit of Arab and Muslim leaders on the attack in Qatar’s capital.</p><small>2025-09-14 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14163343b0c4f26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941939/commerce-minister-reaches-iran-on-three-day-visit-to-boost-economic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Commerce minister reaches Iran on three-day visit to boost economic ties</strong></a><br><p>Federal Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan reached Tehran on Sunday for a three-day official visit to boost economic relations between Pakistan and Iran, according to a press release from the commerce ministry.
Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade.
According to the press release, Khan is expected to lead the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission and Business Forum during his visit.
“He was received at Imam Khomeini International Airport by Mr Amin Tarfa’a, adviser to Iran’s Ministry of Roads and Urban Development,” the press release read.
“During the visit, [Khan] will lead the 22nd Session of the Pakistan–Iran Joint Economic Commission and co-chair the Pakistan–Iran Joint Business Forum. He is also scheduled to hold meetings with key Iranian ministers and senior officials to strengthen bilateral trade and investment cooperation.”
Khan’s visit aims to give fresh momentum to economic and commercial ties between the two nations through the Joint Economic Commission and the Business Forum, the commerce ministry stated.
In August, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited Pakistan, where 12 agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed.
During the bilateral meeting both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.
“The agreements and MoUs included cooperation for plant protection and plant quarantine, joint use of Mirjaveh-Taftan border gate, collaboration in science, technology and innovation, cooperation in information and communications technology,” Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2025-09-14 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141540198a93e72.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941933/veteran-sports-journalist-syed-muhammad-sufi-passes-away-at-80-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Veteran sports journalist Syed Muhammad Sufi passes away at 80 in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Veteran sports journalist Syed Muhammad Sufi has passed away in Karachi on Sunday. He was 80 and died after a prolonged illness.
Sufi is survived by his wife and four sons.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), among others, expressed grief and sorrow over Sufi’s death in a condolence message.
“The PCB management, along with its staff, extends heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved family and prays that the Almighty grants the departed soul eternal peace and gives strength to the family and loved ones to bear this irreparable loss.”
Separately, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi also paid a tribute to the late journalist,
describing his passing as the end of a golden era in sports journalism.
Naqvi lauded Sufi’s lifelong dedication to promoting sports, particularly cricket, and said that his journalistic legacy would be cherished and remembered.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also expressed grief over Sufi’s death in a statement.
Former cricketer Shahid Afridi also condoled his death, remembering him as a “man of fine personality”.
He posted on X that Sufi had always been vocal for the betterment and promotion of the game and the betterment of players.
“Personally, he was always very supportive of me. His death marks the end of a great chapter in sports journalism in Pakistan,” he added, praying for the veteran journalist.
 






Similarly, sports journalist Faizan Lakhani also dubbed Sufi’s death an “end of an era”.
“Syed Muhammad Sufi, Geo’s Sports Editor and a towering figure in sports journalism, has passed away. For 60 years, he served the profession with dedication, guiding and mentoring generations of journalists. A huge loss. May Allah bless his soul,” he posted on X.
 






According to Geo News, where Sufi was a sports editor, the veteran journalist  had worked with several media outlets. These included Geo News and Daily Jang, with which he had been associated for more than 30 years, according to the news website.

Israel targeted Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Dar will “lead Pakistan’s delegation to the ministerial meeting ahead of the Emergency Arab-Islamic Summit”, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
Upon arrival, the deputy PM was received by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer, Pakistan’s envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and senior officials of the Qatari government.
 






The Arab-Islamic summit — held under the umbrella of the 57-member OIC — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world. PM Shehbaz Sharif is also set to attend the high-level moot.
“The summit, cosponsored by Pakistan, has been convened in the wake of Israel’s airstrikes on Doha and the escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians,“ an FO statement said yesterday.
 
 

Diplomats said more than 50 OIC member states are expected to attend the Doha summit, where leaders may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian and Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim are confirmed to attend the summit, Doha-based Al Jazeera reported.
On the sidelines of the preparatory foreign ministers’ meeting, Dar today met with Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty.
“They condemned illegal Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them blatant violations of sovereignty and international law. Both reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and stressed the urgent need for unity across the Muslim ummah,” FO said in a statement.
 






‘Matter of grave concern’
Analysts say tomorrow’s Arab-Islamic summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Pakistan has been vocal in its criticism of Israel, especially taking the centre stage at a recent United Nations Security Council meeting, where it engaged in a heated debate with Israel.
“Repeated Israeli attacks against sovereign states in the region are a matter of grave concern, not only for the Muslim ummah but also for the wider international community,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters on Friday.
Following the attack, PM Shehbaz undertook a one-day visit to Doha, where he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli action and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
 
 

Qatar plays a mediation role in Israel’s recent war on Gaza alongside the US and Egypt. It hosts the largest US base in the region, and also recently gave US President Donald Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 UNSC members in condemning the Israeli strike during Thursday’s emergency meeting. The US has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
Despite ongoing tensions, Trump on Friday held a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York.
The US president has said he was “very unhappy” about the Israeli attack on Qatar. However, earlier today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.</p><small>2025-09-14 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141604145935943.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941936/new-nepal-pm-vows-to-follow-protesters-demands-to-end-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>New Nepal PM vows to follow protesters’ demands to ‘end corruption’</strong></a><br><p>Nepal’s new leader vowed Sunday to follow protesters’ demands to “end corruption” as she began work as interim prime minister, after “Gen Z” youth demonstrations ousted her predecessor.
Sushila Karki, the 73-year-old former chief justice, has been tasked with restoring order and addressing protesters’ demands for a corruption-free future ahead of elections in six months.
Protests, sparked by a ban on social media and feeding into long-standing economic woes, began on Monday and quickly escalated, with parliament and key government buildings set ablaze.
 
 

“We have to work according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation,” Karki said in her first public comments since taking office on Friday.
A fifth of people in Nepal aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita standing at just $1,447, in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.
“What this group is demanding is the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality,” she added.
‘From the streets’
Karki held a minute’s silence on Sunday for those killed in the unrest, before meetings began in the key government complex of Singha Durbar — where several buildings were set on fire during mass protests on Tuesday.
At least 72 people were killed in two days of protests and 191 were injured, the government’s chief secretary Eaknarayan Aryal said Sunday, increasing an earlier toll of 51. It was the worst unrest since the end of a decade-long civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.

The appointment of Karki, known for her independence, came after intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Ram Chandra Paudel, including with representatives of “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
Thousands of young activists had used the Discord app to name Karki as their choice of leader.
“The situation that I have come in, I have not wished to come here. My name was brought from the streets,” Karki said.
Parliament has been dissolved and elections set for March 5, 2026.
“We will not stay here more than six months in any situation; we will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers,” she added, in a speech to the nation.
Ordinary Nepalis said they were hopeful the government would bring change, but were aware the challenges were heavy.
“This government’s list of responsibilities and issues to address isn’t easy,” said grocery shopkeeper Satya Narayan, 69, in Pharping village, about an hour outside the capital.
“It also needs to ensure unity and harmony in the country by taking all sections along”.
‘Challenging times’
President Paudel, who swore Karki into office, said late Saturday that “a peaceful solution has been found through a difficult process”.
Soldiers have scaled back their presence on the streets, where they had been deployed in large numbers after the protests. But more than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails during the chaos are on the run, and present a daunting security headache.

Regional leaders have congratulated Karki, including Nepal’s two giant neighbours, India and China.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi supported “peace, progress and prosperity” in Hindu-majority Nepal, while Beijing’s foreign ministry said it wanted to “push China-Nepal relations steadily forward”.
Buddhism is the country’s second-largest religion, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, wished Karki “every success in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the people of Nepal in these challenging times“.</p><small>2025-09-14 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14161612b6d3428.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941935/uk-police-charge-man-with-criminal-damage-to-jewish-worship-places' target='_blank'><strong>UK police charge man with criminal damage to Jewish worship places</strong></a><br><p>British police charged a 37-year-old man with religiously-motivated criminal damage after several attacks on synagogues and Jewish premises in north-west London.
Seven Jewish premises have been targeted in separate incidents over the last ten days, police said, including four synagogues being smeared with a substance, while a liquid was thrown towards a school and over a car.
The substance and the liquid were bodily fluids, Sky News reported. Police called the acts “revolting and appalling”.
Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians in Gaza in retaliation for the kidnappings of 251 Israeli citizens by Hamas.
According to a February statement from the Community Security Trust (CST) charity, which advises Britain’s estimated 280,000 Jews on security matters, “more than 3,500 antisemitic incidents” were recorded in the country since Tel Aviv launched its onslaught on Gaza.
Police said they charged Ionut-Cristian Bold of no fixed address with six counts of racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage, three counts of damaging property, plus other offences, and he is due to appear at Willesden Magistrates Court on Monday, where he will enter his plea.

“The HRCP strongly condemns the reported decision by community elders in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to form a committee aimed at expelling transgender persons from the district. Such actions are unconstitutional, discriminatory and amount to incitement to violence against an already marginalised community,” the HRCP said in a statement on X.
It added that “no citizen can be deprived of the right to reside, work or earn a livelihood anywhere in Pakistan on the basis of gender identity”.
The human rights body called on the provincial and district authorities to “immediately ensure the safety and dignity of transgender persons in Swabi and uphold their fundamental rights under the Constitution and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018”.
The committee of elders in question comprises the tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani and others.
From the committee, Maulana Samad has said that they want transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihoods elsewhere “because as long as they live here, music shows will [continue to] be arranged, negatively impacting the youth”.
Similarly, another committee member, Yasir Khan, has said that in the first phase, transgender persons would be asked to peacefully leave the district, and if that doesn’t happen, district police would be approached.
Committee members have also said that they would likely meet in the next few days and separately would also hold a meeting with the district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgender persons from the district.
The development came after police arrested more than 200 individuals, including two transgender persons, in Swabi for allegedly resisting a raid and participating in a music programme. The participants of the event have also been accused of using “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
Responding to the 11-member committee’s demand for transgender persons’ expulsion, some individuals from the transgender community released a video asserting that the expulsion would never happen.
Saying that they respected and followed local norms and values while earning a living, they stressed that the committee members should not take the law into their hands.
The transgender persons said they were “aware of the law and the Constitution, and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing at functions.”
They added that they should be viewed keeping humanity in mind.</p><small>2025-09-14 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141238064740da5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941917/supporters-of-slain-us-influencer-charlie-kirk-shut-down-critics' target='_blank'><strong>Supporters of slain US influencer Charlie Kirk shut down critics</strong></a><br><p>For some Americans on the far right, Charlie Kirk died a “martyr”, and any criticism of the hugely popular conservative activist must be punished.
Online vitriol and grassroots persecution have exploded in the wake of the assassination of the 31-year-old who had been an electrifying presence on the US right, with the killing further deepening fraught political divisions in the country.
Laura Sosh-Lightsy, assistant dean of students at a university in the southern state of Tennessee, found herself in hot water after posting on social media about Kirk’s death.
“Hate begets hate. ZERO sympathy,” she said on Facebook after the killing, which happened Wednesday in front of a large crowd at a university in Utah.
Republican US Senator Marsha Blackburn quickly called out the comment — and Sosh-Lightsy.
“This person should be ashamed of her post. She should be removed from her position,” the Tennessee lawmaker said.
Middle Tennessee State University’s president announced that same night an employee’s firing for a “callous” comment about Kirk.
Kirk, who rallied his millions of followers to help President Donald Trump win a second White House term, was both revered and reviled for his pro-gun, anti-abortion and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
Shooting suspect Tyler Robinson, who was arrested Thursday, is said to have engraved anti-fascist messages on his bullet casings. This has led to a large part of the American right labelling him a “far-left” killer.
 
 

Some Kirk supporters have turned into online sleuths, searching out accounts that praised or celebrated Kirk’s murder.
“If they have their picture on their profile, even without a name, download the picture and reverse image search it,” conservative influencer Joey Mannarino said.
“Cross-reference it with their LinkedIn profile and find their place of employment. Call the place of employment, leave Google reviews.”
These efforts have targeted teachers, firefighters and even military personnel, some of whom have lost their jobs.
Kirk’s murder has been condemned by both sides of the political aisle. But Trump quickly blamed the country’s “radical left,” even as authorities were only just launching a manhunt for the killer.
Online trackers have targeted an Oklahoma teacher, who posted on social media: “Charlie Kirk died the same way he lived: bringing out the worst in people.”
That teacher has since been investigated by the state’s Department of Education, which described his comments as “abhorrent.”
Stadium memorial service
Trump, who praised Kirk as a “giant of his generation,” has led the US government in memorialising the activist, with high-ranking US officials working to weed out critics of Kirk and his legacy.
Trump ordered flags lowered to half-staff in honour of his ally, and Kirk’s body was flown from Utah to his home in Phoenix, Arizona, aboard Air Force Two, escorted by Vice President JD Vance.
 






Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered members of the military to identify colleagues who mocked or celebrated Kirk’s death.
US Under Secretary of State Christopher Landau declared that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.”
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action,” he said in a post on X.
“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so the @statedept can protect the American people.”
 






Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has Trump’s ear, has been one of the most high-profile attackers of Kirk’s critics.
She denounced an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), who had expressed disgust on Instagram that flags would be lowered for “the literal racist homophobe misogynist.”
Loomer shared the staffer’s LinkedIn profile and said: “These people hate us. They don’t belong near the levers of our National Power.”
Following Loomer’s post, FEMA said the employee was placed on leave for making “revolting and unconscionable” comments.
On Saturday, Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, announced that a memorial service for its founder will be held on September 21 in a suburb of Phoenix.
The chosen venue hints at the expected turnout: a stadium normally home to a professional football team, with a seating capacity of more than 63,000.</p><small>2025-09-14 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1410363915e8249.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941758/elders-form-body-to-expel-transgenders-from-swabi' target='_blank'><strong>Elders form body to ‘expel’ transgenders from Swabi</strong></a><br><p>SWABI: Elders formed an 11-member committee here on Saturday, declaring all transgender persons will be expelled from Swabi district.
The development came after a Wednesday incident when the transgender people and participants of a music programme used “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
The police later launched a crackdown, leading to the arrest of 226 people, including two transgender persons.
 
 

The 11-member committee comprises tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani, religious leader Maulana Abdul Hadi, Gul Nabi Khan, president of Islahi Jirga Maneri Payyan, Bakhtiar Khan, general secretary, Bashir Khan, president, Islahi Jirga Maneri Bala, Gul Rehman, general secretary, Yasir Khan, president of Anjuman-i-Dokandaran, Swabi city, Irsalan Khan, senior vice-president, Zamin Shah Bhutto president of traders Link Road Swabi and two transgender.
Maulana Haqqani said: “We don’t want our youth to get involved in wrong activities and wish to create an environment where everyone earn livelihood with dignity and honour.”
Maulana Samad said the committee wanted transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihood elsewhere because as long as they lived here, music shows would be arranged, negatively impacting youth.
Yasir Khan said that in the first phase, transgender persons would ask peacefully to leave the district and if that act didn’t work, then the district police would be involved for the purpose.
 
 

“We are determined to achieve our target,” he said.
Meanwhile, the transgender persons said in a video message that they respected elders and treated everyone with respect and did not speak against anyone but the circumstances forced them to raise their voice.
They said the explusion would never happen.
They warned elders against taking the law into their own hands and said they respected and followed local norms and values while earning livelihood.
They complained that the people blamed them for their children’s act of watching their performances.
The transgender persons said they were aware of the law and the Constitution and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing in functions.
They said that none of transgenders was involved in the sale of ice-drug or liquor but various illegal activities continued in the district, needing attention.
They said elders should look at them from the perspective of humanity as they’re part of the Pakhtun society. Meanwhile, members of the committee said that they were expected to meet in the next few days and would also hold a meeting with district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgenders from the district.

Now, imagine being born into a home that does not acknowledge your reality.
That is only a vague reflection of how the life of a transgender person begins. The term “transgender” has received much attention in recent years, yet it remains widely misunderstood.
Many conflicting definitions circulate around it. Some believe that only individuals born with ambiguous genitalia are truly transgender. Others connect the term with the traditional Khwaja Sira culture of the Subcontinent. Some even make harsh and unfounded claims that transgender persons are simply men or women cross-dressing to attract the opposite gender for physical relationships.
What is often overlooked is that behind every transgender person’s life experience lies a medical condition — that of gender dysphoria. It is a deeply misunderstood and rarely discussed condition, even among qualified medical practitioners. To understand it, imagine being forced to wear shoes that are too small for your feet. They hurt with every step, but you are told you must keep wearing them.
 
 

Now imagine that the pain is not just physical; you are judged, shamed and even abandoned by your family and friends for wanting to take them off. You are told that this discomfort is your duty, justified by culture, religion or tradition. Now take that feeling and apply it to your own body. Imagine that the thing causing you pain is not just a pair of shoes, but your own body not matching who you truly are. That is what a gender dysphoric person lives with every day.
In 2011, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took a significant step by recognising the rights and dignity of gender-diverse communities, offering long overdue visibility to those pushed to the margins. The judgment not only called for an end to invasive gender verification by medical boards, but also urged institutions such as the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to abandon the dehumanising labels once suggested for transgender persons.

Pakistan’s transgender and Khwaja Sira communities are navigating a shifting legal landscape that alternates between recognition and rejection. An identity meant to affirm dignity has been reduced to a bureaucratic checkbox. Eos presents, with permission, an essay commissioned by the Human Rights of Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) that looks at the human cost of erasure, the cultural myths that sustain discrimination and the everyday resilience of gender minorities determined to be seen as they are…

As a result, Nadra eventually introduced a neutral ‘X’ marker through the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules of 2020. However, this single-option marker stands in contradiction to the true spirit of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018, which upholds a person’s right to self-perceived identity, allowing them to be recognised as male, female or transgender.
 
 

For many, the ‘X’ marker feels alienating, as it erases specific identities and reinforces segregation rather than fostering inclusion. The early hope that followed these legal reforms was shaken by the 2023 Federal Shariat Court (FSC) ruling that struck down self-perceived identity as the basis for legal recognition.
By reinstating the requirement for medical and biological verification, the FSC ruling has placed transgender and Khwaja Sira individuals back under institutional scrutiny. This has not only created legal confusion for Nadra and other state bodies, but it has also reopened pathways for discrimination in education, employment and public life spaces.
FIGHTING FOR A PLACE
While the law continues to shift between progress and regression, the lived realities of transgender individuals unfold quietly in everyday moments, far from courtrooms and official directives.
In a quiet corner of a community office in Lahore, 30-year-old Khan adjusts the strap of his camera before heading to the gym. A passionate photographer and fitness enthusiast, Khan exudes the quiet confidence of a young man rooted in purpose. But beneath his steady demeanour lies a history few care to ask about — one shaped by being assigned female at birth and raised under the rigid control reserved for girls in patriarchal households.
 
 

“Transitioning was never just about changing how I looked,” he says. “It was about reclaiming who I always was, after years of being told not to speak loudly, not to sit a certain way, not to dream like a boy.” For many transgender men in Pakistan, such as Khan, life is a constant act of stitching visibility into a society that refuses to see them — a society that equates gender with genitalia and silence with safety.
While transgender men such as Khan struggle to be seen at all, Khwaja Sira persons, such as Faizi, are forced to fight even harder to be recognised on their own terms, especially when the system refuses to see beyond rigid gender binaries.
In the dusty district of Toba Tek Singh, where tradition often stands firmer than the law, Faizi sits at her desk in a crisp police uniform, fixing her dupatta with practised ease. Today, she is a victim support officer with the Punjab Police — a respected figure who offers support to survivors of abuse with the kind of empathy only lived pain can shape. But Faizi is more than her job title. She is a Khwaja Sira person who made legal history in Pakistan.
When her application for an Urdu lecturer post was rejected by the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) in October 2020, on the grounds that she was neither male nor female, she did not retreat. She fought. Faizi took the matter to the Lahore High Court, filing a petition that challenged not just institutional discrimination but the broader erasure of third-gender persons from state systems.
On January 21 2021, the Lahore High Court stayed the entire lecturer recruitment process in response to her petition. Justice Faisal Zaman took notice. For the first time, in February 2021, the PPSC’s hiring processes were suspended as a human rights violation case unfolded in the courtroom. Lawyers argued on principles of dignity, equality and inclusion. Faizi stood her ground. And she won.
Since her victory, every PPSC job advertisement now includes a third gender category. It was a personal triumph as much as a milestone for the entire Khwaja Sira community, a segment of society so often celebrated in cultural folklore yet marginalised in civic life.
 
 

Today, Faizi represents the visible face of Pakistan’s third gender struggle. The Khwaja Sira community, more than any other gender minority group in the country, enjoys a relative degree of visibility and partial acceptance. Between 7,500-9,000 CNICs with the ‘X’ gender marker have been issued, primarily to Khwaja Sira individuals and a few transgender women.
But an ‘X’ on a card does not guarantee a livelihood. Despite the government’s repeated announcements to include Khwaja Siras in the public sector workforce, the vast majority still work within the development sector, especially in community-based organisations. Even these spaces, though more inclusive, are far from representative or stable.
THE KHWAJA SIRA EXPERIENCE
Khwaja Sira persons, such as transgender women, are mostly assigned male at birth, but later transition into a third gender identity. What sets them apart is their deep-rooted affiliation with a centuries-old subculture that predates colonial constructs of gender.
The Khwaja Sira tradition has its foundations in South Asia’s classical past, drawn from ancient Sanskrit texts and social roles that existed within royal courts and Sufi shrines. Unlike transgender women, who often identify within the binary gender, Khwaja Sira persons embrace a separate, traditional identity complete with its own rituals, guru-chela systems and codes of conduct.
But the visibility of this community has brought with it both opportunity and confusion. Pakistani society, which can barely accommodate non-binary ideas, continues to misunderstand who Khwaja Siras are.
Many believe they are born with intersex variations or ambiguous genitalia — a belief stemming more from myth than medical truth. Some Khwaja Sira elders perpetuate this narrative as a means of survival in a society that refuses to understand how someone assigned male at birth could reject masculinity. This misunderstanding bleeds into workplaces, where Khwaja Sira persons are mis-gendered, mocked, or quietly excluded — even by the media that celebrates their inclusion.
 
 

In reality, only a small fraction of Khwaja Sira persons work in formal organisations. The overwhelming majority are still bound to one of three professions — a system of labour shaped by appearance and societal prejudice.
If a Khwaja Sira person is not considered “aesthetically appealing”, she is likely to be seen begging at traffic signals or marketplaces. Those with striking features or refined dance skills often find employment at celebratory functions — especially in south Punjab, central Punjab and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — performing in secretive, high-paying gigs. The most conventionally attractive are often coerced into or voluntarily enter sex work, where they can earn in one night what government jobs pay in a month.
Despite efforts by the development sector and provincial governments to promote their inclusion, most Khwaja Sira individuals remain economically dependent on a system that pays more, asks fewer questions, and offers a twisted sense of dignity, even at the cost of safety.
Many serve as the silent backbone of their families, sending money for siblings’ schooling, parents’ medicine, or wedding dowries for sisters and, in a few cases, for daughters also, even if those families once rejected them. While they work, they are denied the right to love and partnership, as Pakistani law only permits marriage between a man and a woman, rendering third-gender persons outside the legal definition of companionship and care.
One of the most haunting yet overlooked socio-economic realities shaping Khawaja Sira lives is the concept of the Girya: a male romantic partner who, within Khwaja Sira culture, is often seen as a husband offering protection, financial support and a semblance of belonging. These relationships carry deep emotional weight and cultural significance. But outside this fragile Khwaja Sira circle, they are invisible. The state does not recognise this relation. There is no legal marriage, no formal commitment, only affection navigating through silence. And in that silence, danger thrives. Without recognition, there is no recourse.
Many men enter these relationships for sexual access, cloaked in promises of loyalty, only to abandon the Khwaja Sira partner, leaving behind emotional wreckage and renewed instability. Worse still, these Giryas — so-called protectors — often turn violent. Physical, emotional and financial abuse is common but no court acknowledges the crime because no law acknowledges the relationship. The state sees the Girya as a stranger. The Khwaja Sira sees him as family. And between those two truths lies a justice system that does not speak their language.
Faizi knows this betrayal intimately. Before she ever wore the crisp uniform of a police officer, she too lived in the shadow of such a love, where tenderness and terror blurred, and where the silence around her suffering was deafening. Her rise is not just a personal victory; it is a symbol of resistance from a community forced to live between symbolism and survival.
Faizi stands tall in the Punjab Police today — but how many others like her still wait, bruised by love, betrayed by silence, unseen by law and unrecognised by the nation that calls them its citizens?

THE STRUGGLE OF TRANSGENDERS
Khan shares the story of a fellow trans man — one whose journey lays bare the intersections of gender, family honour, and economic exclusion. Assigned female at birth and denied the chance to transition, this transgender man was forcibly married to a cis-gender man, subjected to years of marital rape, and bore two children before the marriage collapsed. Today, he lives with his children, having finally socially and medically transitioned. His children now call him “Abu”, fully accepting him as their father.
However, without a male CNIC reflecting his identity, he is unemployable in the formal sector. “He looks like a man, lives like a father but, in the eyes of the state, he is neither,” Khan explains. This bureaucratic erasure is compounded by social ignorance: workplace harassment, gendered ridicule, and relentless questions about bodies and “what is in your pants.”
Khan shared an experience of another fellow transgender man hired by a corporate company. Once his colleagues learned of his trans experience, he was no longer seen as himself — he became the “guy who was once a girl.”
While transgender men such as Khan’s friend are punished for asserting their identity, transgender women such as Wafa often survive by erasing theirs.
I met Wafa in her mother’s modest home in Islamabad, where she was visiting from the UAE. Over cups of tea and quiet pauses, she shared the story she rarely speaks aloud, the story behind the woman she has become, far from home. In the corridors of a sleek corporate building in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Wafa sits behind a desk in the marketing department of a regional firm. With a degree in marketing and a talent for strategic campaigns, she is well-regarded by her colleagues, and known for her professionalism and creative edge.
She earns a stable income, supports her family in Pakistan, and manages her sibling’s education and parents’ medical expenses. But behind the polished presentations and confident smile lies a journey laced with sacrifice, isolation and one of the truths of being a transgender woman from Pakistan: to survive, one must hide who one really is — that’s the only survival tactic.
 
 

Assigned male at birth, Wafa has always identified as a woman. In the absence of community support, she relied entirely on her savings to undergo gender-affirming surgeries in Thailand. Every dirham she earned in the Gulf, she saved meticulously. “I wanted to come home as myself,” she says. “With dignity. With truth.”
Upon returning to Pakistan, she approached Nadra in 2023 to have her identity documents legally updated to reflect the woman she had always been. She was hopeful. After all, the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench had issued a historic ruling in 2011 allowing gender-affirming surgery and subsequent changes to identity documents to an applicant from Rawalpindi. Moreover, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018 recognised a person’s right to self-identify. But what followed was an experience she describes as “more violent than surgery.”
Nadra referred her to Services Hospital Lahore for a medical examination. There, a urologist questioned her about her romantic life while examining her. But worse was still to come. The gynaecologist, who was also the head of department at the Services Institute of Medical Sciences, invited 40 medical students to examine Wafa’s surgically constructed genitalia, without her consent.
“I begged them to at least use gloves,” she recalled. “I just wanted some dignity.” Days later, she developed a vaginal infection. With her health deteriorating and her emotional well-being shattered, Wafa left the country once again — travelling back to the UAE, this time on the same male passport she had tried so hard to update.
Nadra had offered her an ‘X’ gender marker, but she refused. For transgender women such as Wafa, the ‘X’ category is not an option but an erasure. “If I take the ‘X’ marker,” she explains, “I can never return to the UAE. Gulf countries do not accept ‘X’ as a gender. I will not even be allowed to enter for Umrah or Hajj.” For many transgender persons and Khawaja Sira individuals, this exclusion is not just bureaucratic — it is spiritual. “Imagine wanting to pray in Mecca and being told your gender disqualifies you,” she says.

CHANGING SOCIETAL ATTITUDES
Wafa’s story reflects a critical shift in the transgender community in Pakistan. More and more transgender women are actively disassociating themselves from the traditional Khwaja Sira culture.
While some still take refuge in deras [homes owned by Khwaja Sira elders] and guru-led households for survival, many do not identify with the centuries-old customs and rituals. Their disassociation is not disrespect — it is about identity. Transgender women identify as women, not as a third gender. Their transition is often shaped by medical processes and gender-affirming treatment, and their struggle is to be recognised as female, not as “other.”
Despite similarities in lived discrimination, transgender women lack the community safety net that Khwaja Sira culture provides. Without a guru or a traditional support circle, many are left to face violence, homelessness and economic exclusion alone.
Wafa recalls that many transgender women apply for jobs under their legal male name, because changing it legally is nearly impossible without accepting the ‘X’ gender marker. But, at the workplace, they are ridiculed, questioned, or worse — sexually harassed. One woman interviewed during this research described being sexually propositioned during her job interview for a receptionist post, simply because her appearance did not match her official documents.
 
 

Family rejection is almost a certainty for transgender women in Pakistan. Many are pushed out of their homes the moment they begin to express who they truly are. With nowhere else to go, they often end up in Khwaja Sira deras, not out of choice but out of desperation. Some do not even identify with the traditional Khwaja Sira culture but are forced to adapt just to survive.
While working on this very piece, I met a transgender woman who had gone through full gender-affirming surgeries here in Pakistan. She was in love and wanted nothing more than to marry her partner and live a quiet life as a wife. She showed me her medical reports and kept asking for help to get her CNIC changed to female so she could marry legally. Her eyes were full of hope and fear at the same time. But there was nothing I could offer her. Nothing except to hold her hand as she cried, not because she doubted who she was, but because her country refused to see her the way she saw herself.
One of the most painful struggles transgender women face is mis-gendering. Wafa explains it best: “We work so hard to pass as women. We reshape our bodies, change our voices and live in fear of violence. But one wrong pronoun from a doctor, an officer, or even a friend, and it is like none of it ever mattered.” Mis-gendering is not a mistake — it is a rejection of truth. It reinforces the idea that gender is dictated by birth, not by identity, and invalidates the tremendous physical and emotional labour transgender women invest in becoming themselves.
What complicates the transgender woman’s struggle, which is already marred with complexities, is rejection by both the state and society. While Khwaja Sira persons are more culturally accepted — celebrated in media and recognised in rituals — transgender women remain misunderstood, seen by many as “Western imports” or as rejecting their biological role. But, in truth, they are simply asking to be seen for who they are. The law may offer them rights, but the practice of those rights in Nadra offices, hospitals or workplaces remains rooted in cruelty and ignorance.
Transgender women in Pakistan are fighting for inclusion and to be recognised as women. Until that simple truth is honoured, no policy, act or surgery will be enough to make them feel safe in their own country.
INCLUSIVE LAWS, EXCLUSIONARY SOCIETY
As he speaks, Khan’s voice shifts from exhaustion to quiet defiance. “I do not want an ‘X’ on my CNIC. I am not a third category. I am a man.” He laments the aftermath of the 2020 rules that hijacked the spirit of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018, reducing the hard-won right of self-identification to a meaningless bureaucratic checkbox.
“No transgender man I know wants the ‘X’ marker. Why would we volunteer for a lifetime of stigma and scrutiny on every job form, at every airport, outside every Nadra office?” For Khan and many others, the fight is not just for recognition — it is for dignity, documentation, and the right to live without having to explain one’s existence at every turn. “People think we are opening a Pandora ’s Box,” Khan sighs. “But the truth is, we have been locked inside one our whole lives.”
These are not stories of the exotic or the extreme. They are the daily lived experiences of citizens who pay taxes, raise families, care for parents and seek dignity in Pakistan. They are photographers, marketers, survivors of abuse and seekers of love. Yet they face violence at police checkpoints, ridicule in waiting rooms, neglect in census forms and erasure from employment.
Pakistan may have progressive laws recognising the third gender on paper, but hearts, minds and systems have not caught up. Until schools teach respect, employers show compassion, and government officials practise empathy, gender minorities in this country will continue to survive, not live.
The burden does not rest solely on the transgender community — it rests squarely on the shoulders of our institutions, media, mosques, schools and each of us. The struggle for inclusion is about restoring what is rightfully theirs — their voice, their body, their future.

He knew exactly what to say.
“There’s no such message to the players,” he responded when asked at the Asia Cup captains’ press conference if he had instructed his men to keep their cool against India on Sunday — their first meeting since the brief armed conflict between the two countries in May.
“My players are more than welcome to show aggression whenever they want,” Salman went on. “As far as it remains within the field.”
It was a breath of fresh air for Pakistan cricket fans — both casuals and diehards. Honesty, assertiveness and an unapologetic tone have defined Salman’s early days as Pakistan’s Twenty20 International captain. His arrival has coincided with Mike Hesson’s appointment as white-ball head coach, and together they’ve tried to instil a structure long missing from Pakistan cricket.
“Salman’s appointment as Pakistan’s captain has raised expectations,” Ali Zaki, a 22-year-old fan, told Dawn on Saturday. “Although our team is inexperienced, the intent from the players is evident. Before this, I had no expectations from the team.”
 



The new vibe is fearless, loud, and unapologetic

As many as 15 matches into their partnership, Salman and Hesson may not have perfected their messaging, but both have been clear and consistent. Hesson has taken bold decisions — most notably moving on from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan — and backed younger talent while stressing squad culture over individual reliance.
 
 

Salman, meanwhile, has spoken with refreshing honesty. “You can’t make the Pakistan team without merit,” he reminded during a podcast recently. “You have to clear tough hurdles and perform consistently at every level.”
The contrast with the timid, hesitant era that preceded them is stark. Pakistan’s last year T20 World Cup campaign ended in a first-round exit, complete with an embarrassing loss to the USA, and exposed the costs of mediocrity. Even during brief spells of stability, there was reluctance to change and an unwillingness to match the approach of top sides.
Now, the signs suggest something different. Emerging names like Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan and Hasan Nawaz are encouraged to take on games without fear.
For Salman, the shift is about resetting Pakistan’s cricketing identity.
“We can’t afford to play with fear anymore,” he said in the same podcast. “Our job is to take the game on, no matter who the opposition is.”
 
 

That confidence is trickling into how Pakistan carries itself. Media interactions have grown sharper, less about protecting reputations and more about clarity. The stump mics too, have captured Salman’s slip-field chatter — quips, sledges and the occasional harmless expletive — giving fans a glimpse of a dressing room no longer shy of character.
For once, Pakistan’s “aura”, as the Gen Z fans put it, feels like it belongs to the present, not the past.

It’s a question that has gripped Washington, the small town in Utah where the suspect grew up. The 22-year-old arrested after a 33-hour manhunt reportedly confessed to killing Kirk, whose popularity among young conservatives helped Donald Trump win the presidential election last November.
Robinson grew up the eldest of three boys in a mid-sized house on a winding street with manicured lawns, in a neighborhood that backs up to a church. He was  “quiet, respectful, kind of stayed to himself. But he was really, really smart,” 66-year-old Kris Schwiermann, the retired head custodian at the local primary school, said.
Jaida Funk, a 22-year-old who attended elementary and middle school with Robinson, gave a similar assessment. “I always though he would become a businessman or a CEO someday, rather than what I’m learning about him now,” she said.
“He was quiet, but not weird, he had friends and he talked to all the different cliques.” After graduating with flying colours from high school in 2021, Robinson briefly studied at university before enrolling in an electrical apprentice progra­mme at a technical college closer to home.
Hunting and camping
His father sells granite kitchen countertops, his mother is a healthcare provider for handicapped people — and they are members of the Mormon church, but inactive, according to Schwiermann. Family photos on social media depict a family that loved travelling, camping and hunting.
On Wednesday, authorities say, Robinson used a sniper rifle to shoot Kirk with a single bullet to the neck from a rooftop, as the 31-year-old activist spoke at Utah Valley University, about four hours north of Washington.
 
 

While his parents are Rep­ublicans, Robinson registered as unaffiliated but did not cast a ballot in 2024. Utah Governor Spencer Cox told CNN on Friday that the suspect was radicalised  “in a fairly short amount of time.” Robinson had spoken disparagingly of Kirk with family members, and his father urged him to turn himself in, authorities said.
Markings Cox said were found on unused bullet casings in the weapon Robinson is believed to have used have sparked speculation about his politics. One cartridge had  “Hey, fascist! Catch!” written on it, while another featured  “Bella ciao,” — a World War II-era Italian anti-fascist song that reports said has recently been repurposed in niche online circles. Other cartridges were marked with symbols and wording that appeared to be from online gaming culture.
‘Cool car guy’
Former school buddies recall an avid fan of first-person shooter video games like  “Halo” and  “Call of Duty.” And he didn’t talk politics with Jay, who met Robinson in Jan­uary in a group for big car ent­husiasts.
“He was just a cool car guy,” said the perplexed 40-year-old, who declined to give his last name.
“We just talked about our love for muscle cars and the way they sound and drive.” Rob­inson’s shiny gray Dodge Cha­llenger was the only thing nei­ghbours knew about him in the nondescript apartment building where he lived in Saint George, about ten minutes from his parents.
Heather McKnight, a 50-year-old nurse and his neighbour for more than a year, described a solitary, sullen-looking stranger who, in her opinion, drove too fast.
“He would just never say hi, he didn’t want to talk or start a good neighbour relationship… He was just creepy,” she said.
“Who would have known that this little skinny guy getting in and out of his car would be able to commit such a heinous act?”

Entire settlements of Ramzan Mallah, Usman Khaskheli, Urs Mallah, Allah Dino Mallah, Haroon Mallah, Ghulam Mallah, Haji Shahdad Khaskheli, Haroon Khaskheli, and Suleman Mallah have been encircled by water, cutting off their road access to nearby towns. The villagers are now using boats to receive food and other essentials.
As the lake swells with Indus waters, reverse flow has begun, inundating vast tracts of the riverine belt. The Ghar Marhu canal, which irrigated hundreds of thousands of acres through Udero Lal Barrage on the river, was blocked near the GBU dyke last week in a desperate attempt to preempt damage from the rising floodwaters.
But preparedness on ground remained questionable. Near Isa Khaskheli village, the irrigation department has set up only a makeshift hut manned by a few junior staffers.
 
 

A bulldozer stationed on-site stands idle for lack of fuel. During a visit by journalists, the dyke was found abandoned, with no senior irrigation officials in sight.
“The bulldozer has just been parked here for show. It has no diesel,” said the machine’s operator, adding that repeated appeals for fuel had been ignored by the officers concerned.
For villagers in Isa Khaskheli, Basar Khaskheli, Ali Muhammad Khaskheli, and Gheel Mori town, anxiety grows by the day. With their homes under water and escape routes severed, they fear the dyke could collapse in the absence of urgent intervention.
 
 

Local communities demanded immediate action against negligent irrigation officials and deployment of trained staff and resources at the Baghar Ochto dyke to prevent what they warned could become a humanitarian disaster.
Irrigation officials busy strengthening dykes
In Larkana, the officials had foc­us­ed on taking maximum possible measures to ensure the deluge safely passed under Sukkur Barrage and flowed down to the sea with minimum and no damage.
Presently, Moria Loop Bund, New/Old Abad Loop Bund and Hakra Loop Bund managed by Northern Dadu division were declared highly sensitive where irrigation officials were vigilant and busy strengthening the existing structures.
Reports from Naudero on Saturday suggested that the Indus was continuously rising at Burira Ferry point forcing villagers in riverine area to shift to the dykes. As soon as water receded they would return to their dwellings.
A number of few families, who had taken shelter on Larkana-Sehwan dyke near Dodo Sanhari village, complained to this reporter about lack of assistance from the district government.
At Larkana-Khairpur bridge alongside the ‘Palija bund’, floodwater was coming close to the dyke while the irrigation department had temporarily built huts manned with staff to keep an eye on the situation.
A large number of dumpers and trucks loaded with stones were being unloaded at Moria Loop dyke where the river was striking with full force and mounting pressure.
MPA Mir Nadir Magsi had on Friday said the New/Old Abad dyke was highly sensitive. Northern Dadu Division’s superintendent engineer Jamil Sangi, assistant engineer Riaz Abbasi and sub-engineer Nadeem Jaffery told journalists at the dyke on Saturday that work was going on to strengthen the dyke.
This dyke was located four kilometers upstream near the structure of Larkana-Khairpur bridge and was part of Larkana-Sehwan dyke, said Mr Sangi.
The river at this point had created an island and shifted its main current about one mile away from the main dyke while stagnant water was also staying there. The irrigation officials said that main current could at any moment shift, as it all depended on the behaviour of the river.
Sources in the irrigation department disclosed that Japan International Coope­ration Agency (JICA) had committed to strengthen the New/Old Abad dyke. The work would only start once the required studies as per JICA’s criteria were completed, said the sources, adding that two years had passed since the commitment.
The sources said that the dyke was not in good shape and a team of experts from JICA was due to arrive on Monday to visit the site along with the irrigation officials concerned.
Almost all depressions close to the dyke were filled with floodwater but surprisingly the dwellers were still reluctant to leave their houses and move up to the dyke or to safer place.
At Hakra Loop dyke six kilometers from Mohenjo Daro irrigation staff were posted in temporarily built huts. Work on apron and stone pitching was under way from 13/0 miles to 22/2 miles where floodwater struck the dyke. Presently 16/1 mile of Hakra dyke was risky, said the irrigation staff stationed there.
There are five spurs to protect the Hakra Loop dyke however it was seen that residents of riverine area were trying to reach the dyke after wading through stagnant water inundating their land, crops and houses.

Speaking at a session on Adopting Digital Currency and Cryptocurrency in Pakistan: Possibilities and Concerns, organised by the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) on Saturday, Mr Zaidi outlined the risks and opportunities surrounding digital currencies.
He said a law enabling cryptocurrency regulation has been passed and is under discussion in parliament. However, he stressed that digital or virtual currencies, by design, are difficult to regulate.
“Cryptocurrencies flourish because they leave no trail. A currency born unregulated cannot be regulated,” he argued. While the US market has seen widespread adoption, he noted, the difference lies in the freer foreign exchange regime. In Pakistan, commercial banks cannot buy and sell dollars without the State Bank’s permission.

Says Pakistan cannot regulate virtual currencies under current system; nearly 9m Pakistanis hold digital assets

Trust and acceptance
Mr Zaidi estimated that around nine million Pakistanis hold or trade virtual currencies, primarily Bitcoin, a decentralised digital asset where transactions are recorded on a blockchain and issuance is independent of any central bank.
 
 

He added that digital currencies are already being used to settle transactions, including under-invoicing in trade with China, in ways similar to the hawala system. “This is not about being too fast or too slow in adoption. The reality is that our system cannot regulate it,” he said.
He emphasised that all currencies are built on trust, pointing to the US dollar today and the British pound in the past. Similarly, a trusted digital currency could emerge as a medium of payment worldwide.
He suggested that asset-backed cryptocurrencies could, in theory, be issued, but demand would remain weak since unregulated digital assets allow holders to convert black money into white.
Citing examples abroad, he noted that India had formally rejected cryptocurrencies, while in the US, they continue to grow in popularity.
He also linked cryptocurrencies to political debates in the US, claiming that former president Donald Trump’s administration supported them after facing resistance from the Federal Reserve. Mr Zaidi quoted a banker as saying the Trump family earned $2.4bn through virtual currencies during their time in office.
Digitisation versus crypto
While acknowledging Pakistan’s progress in digitising its financial system, Mr Zaidi underlined that crypto belongs to a different domain.
“Digitisation is about documentation and traceability. Crypto thrives on the opposite — anonymity and lack of control,” he said.
Experts at the session noted that the use of virtual currencies in Pakistan is likely to continue growing, particularly as tight foreign exchange controls limit other avenues for cross-border payments.

“During Covid-19 we expanded rapidly, launching four verticals in 18 months instead of one in two years,” he recalled. “Impulse purchases defined that period — snacks, cigarettes, small-ticket items.”
Average order sizes have since increased. Grocery baskets have risen from Rs800-900 during the pandemic to Rs2,000-2,200, while food deliveries average Rs1,200. The blended average per order now stands at Rs1,400-1,500.
“The pandemic was about habit creation. Now we’re working to shift customers from impulse buys to weekly grocery missions,” Mr Peracha said, adding that monthly shopping is still largely done offline.

Online orders move from impulse to grocery top-ups

Food delivery continues to generate about 70pc of the platform’s topline, with groceries contributing the remainder.
 
 

The company is active in 35 cities for food deliveries and 12 for groceries, with dark stores operating in seven. Product assortments are tailored by locality.
A subsidiary of Germany’s Delivery Hero, foodpanda entered Pakistan in 2016. An Economic Impact Assessment by Lahore University of Management Sciences estimates its investment at $100m over the past decade, including €2.3m in kitchen infrastructure. Tax contributions in FY24 amounted to Rs9.76bn.
The company plans to double business in three years by scaling up kitchens, expanding marts through owned and franchised outlets, and broadening its shops platform.
Employment & entrepreneurs
foodpanda’s operations rely on 50,000 registered riders, of whom 17,000-18,000 are active daily. Full-time riders earn Rs48,000-50,000 per month, though fuel and maintenance costs are borne by them. Compensation rates adjust with fuel price swings.
 
 

Female riders remain few, but Mr Peracha recounted examples such as a young woman commuting daily from Sheikhupura to Lahore on a 125cc bike.
Women, however, dominate the home-chef segment. The impact report notes over 7,000 home-based entrepreneurs on the platform, 75pc of them women, earning an average of Rs120,000 per month. About half are first-time earners.
Thin margins
Foodpanda charges an average 25pc commission, with variations depending on order volumes. Restaurants also pay sales tax once revenue crosses the legal threshold. Only 15–20pc of eateries on the platform are currently GST-registered.
Provincial governments have reduced service tax rates for home chefs — to 8pc in Sindh and 5pc in Punjab. Even so, commissions and taxes can consume around 30pc of revenue. With food costs at 30pc, about 40pc remains for other expenses and profit.
Dark kitchens, which share facilities, pay commissions plus rent or a revenue share, depending on volumes.
Coping with internet shutdowns
The company faced a sharp setback in May 2023 when mobile internet was suspended for nearly three days. Foodpanda lost 70pc of its gross merchandise value.
“It wasn’t just us — Daraz, Careem, everyone was hit,” the CEO said.
To adapt, foodpanda shared Wi-Fi passwords of partner restaurants with riders in major cities to keep deliveries going, though the absence of Google Maps made navigation difficult.

• Meets CPC leader Li Shulei; conveys commitment to political, economic, and cultural cooperation.
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to work with China and other natio­­ns to expand cultural exchanges, strengthen creative industries and promote understanding and a culture of tolerance.
He said culture remained a vital bridge to peace, prosperity, and a shared future for humanity.
The president addressed the Second Golden Panda Awards International Culture Forum in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, where he highlighted the power of art and culture in uniting people and connecting civilisations.
 
 

The forum was attended by senior Chinese leaders, cultural representatives, artists and international delegates, President Secretariat Press Wing said in a press release.
 






President Zardari underlined that the enduring Pakistan-China friendship stood as a model of mutual respect and cooperation.
As the two countries prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year, he recalled that this partnership remained not only strategic but also a living testimony of the deep bonds of friendship between their peoples.
He reiterated Pakistan’s full support for China’s vision of civilisational exchange and mutual learning. He also emphasised the significance of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), noting their focus on sustainable development, regional stability, and inclusive international cooperation.
 
 

The president underscored the importance of the GGI, which promotes respect for the diversity of civilisations, equality among cultures, people-to-people exchan­ges, and cultural dialogue as a counter to narratives of a clash of civilisations.
He observed that the world was undergoing dramatic changes, and praised China under President Xi Jinping for offering a path of cooperation and win-win solutions instead of confrontation.
He said that he was immensely impressed by how these initiatives served the common values of humanity.
President Zardari congratulated the award winners and appreciated their creativity, noting that such artistic endeavours transcend borders and bring people together through shared human values.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with Li Shulei, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and Minister of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee in Chengdu, China.
 






During the meeting, the president emphasised the importance of expanding cooperation betw­een Pakistan and China in political, economic and cultural fields, underlining Pakistan’s commitment to deepening people-to-people contacts and public diplomacy.
He thanked the CPC leader for hosting him in Sichuan and felicitated him and the organisers on the successful holding of the Second Golden Panda Awards International Culture Forum.
 
 

Mr Shulei said that President Xi Jinping had sent his best wishes and greetings to President Zardari and recalled their meeting during the president’s visit in February this year.
He also appreciated President Zardari’s recent article in China Daily, underlining the high regard in which Pakistan’s perspectives were held in China.
He further observed that both he and President Xi highly valued the leadership shown by President Zardari in strengthening the Pakistan-China partnership.
The world is changing, but China and Pakistan will remain iron-clad brothers.
“Today, the world needs and deserves the fragrance of books rather than the smell of gunpowder,” he said.

Federal Interior Minis­ter Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday instructed officials to identify suitable land for the new headquarters and sought a master plan for the facilities, according to a statement released after a meeting at the Capital Development Authority.
He emphasised that while identifying the land, the requirements for both headquarters and training facilities should be given special consideration.
The meeting was also attended by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, the federal secretary of interior, the chairman of the CDA and senior police and constabulary officials.
“The Federal Constabu­lary will be developed on modern foundations with the aim of transforming it into a well-structured and highly effective force,” Mr Naqvi said.
The move follows Presi­dent Asif Ali Zardari’s promulgation in July of the Frontier Constabulary Reorganisation Ordinance 2025, which officially renamed the force.
 
 

The ordinance extends the Federal Constabu­la­ry’s jurisdiction across the entire country, including all four provinces, Isla­m­abad, Azad Jammu and Ka­­shmir, and Gilgit-Bal­tis­tan. Under the new fra­mework, the federal government will appoint the inspector general of the Federal Constabulary.
Each division will also have a wing commander, who will hold a rank eq­­uivalent to a deputy ins­pector general. Further­­more, officers from the Police Service of Pakistan will command the force.
The force’s responsibilities will include riot control, internal security, counter-terrorism and protection services. It will also have powers under the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997 and the Police Order of 2002.
The federal government will control the force and can deploy the constabulary as a reserve force to support Islamabad police, provincial police and other law enforcement agencies.
The effort to reform the force is not new. In 2018, then-interior minister Ahsan Iqbal said the federal government was considering a proposal to upgrade the Frontier Constabulary to bring the force and incentives for its personnel on par with those of other civilian law enforcement agencies.

Addit­ional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Bal­och has ordered the initiation of proclamation proceedings against Bahria Town founder Malik Riaz and his son Ali Riaz Malik in two cases pertaining to alleged money laundering of the housing giant’s funds abroad.
During Saturday’s hearing, the court adjourned further proceedings aga­inst the real estate tycoon and his son until September 30, while moving to formally declare them as absconder in the cases.
Last week, the same court distributed copies of the challan among three other accused, including retired Colonel Khalilur Rehman, personal staff officer of Malik Riaz, along with Mushtaq and Imran.
 
 

According to court proceedings, Mr Rehman received the challan in person. Mushtaq appeared physically, while Imran’s attendance was marked via video link. Both Mushtaq and Imran are expected to appear in person at the next hearing.
The FIA’s money laundering wing registered the case, alleging that the accused illegally transferred large sums abroad to finance Malik Riaz’s Dubai property project.
The court’s move comes at a time when Mr Riaz is facing mounting legal troubles.
Last month, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar revealed that investigators had found “incontrovertible proof of large-scale money laundering and corruption by Mr Riaz and his company.
He disclosed that the FIA raided Safari Hospital in Rawalpindi, which was allegedly used as a “front office” to conceal cash and records.
According to the minister, hospital ambulances were used to transport money and documents to avoid raising suspicion.
The raid unearthed evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering, while investigators expect further amounts to surface as the probe deepens. Mr Tarar also alleged that Bahria Town’s chief financial officer and finance director were linked to hawala and hundi operators engaged in sending funds abroad. He added that Bahria Town staff attempted to destroy documents during the raid, but investigators managed to seize most of the records.
The minister clarified that the government’s inquiry was focused on Mr Riaz, his family, and company officials, and not on residents of Bahria Town.

The move, announced on Friday, is part of efforts to ensure prudent use of public resources and to rationalise security arrangements in line with official entitlements.
The security regime for serving judges has also been regulated suitably, making it rational and aligned with the entitlements under the rules.
In the same spirit, security for retired judges has also been regulated in accordance with applicable rules, established security protocols and entitlements, including the relevant presidential order that provides lifetime security to retired judges, considering the sensitive nature of their past office and continuing security concerns.
In order to operationalise these security protocols, without conferring any extraordinary benefit, added concession or privilege, a circular has been issued to scale down deployment of force in excess of entitlement, reaffirming compliance with rules, and to facilitate coordination between the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior and provincial authorities for implementation.

Private finance mobilised by MDBs for climate action also climbed sharply, reaching $134bn in 2024 — a 33pc increase from the previous year.

High-income states got $51.5bn in support

The report, released by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), said climate finance remains central to MDBs’ efforts to advance sustainable development worldwide. By supporting investments in renewable energy, green cities, clean transport, water and food security, MDBs are helping countries move closer to achieving the Sustain­able Development Goals.
Of the total climate finance last year, $85.1bn went to low and middle-income economies. Climate finance to these countries has more than doubled over the past five years and rose 14pc year-on-year. Of this, $58.8bn, or 69pc, was allocated for climate change mitigation, while $26.3bn, or 31pc, was directed to adaptation.
 
 

Mobilised private finance for climate investments in these economies amounted to $33bn.
In high-income countries, MDBs’ climate finance reached $51.5bn in 2024, of which $46.5bn (90pc) supported mitigation and $5bn (10pc) backed adaptation. Mobilised private finance for climate-related inves­t­ments in these countries stood at $101bn.
 
 

The 2024 climate finance data was compiled by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Deve­lo­pment and includes contributions from the Afr­ican Development Bank, Asian Development Bank,  Council of Europe Develo­pment Bank, European Inve­stment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank Group, Islamic Development Bank, New Development Bank and World Bank Group.

• Netanyahu says getting rid of Hamas key to deal on ending war
GAZA CITY: Israeli air strikes hit two UN schools sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City with more than 40 people killed since dawn on Saturday throughout the war-battered Strip, Al Jazeera reported.
Gaza’s Government Media Office says more than 1.3 million Palestinians, including 350,000 children, remain in Gaza City and the north, despite Israel’s relentless bombardment and forced evacuation orders.
Israeli forces fired artillery shells and smoke bombs at the al-Nafaq and Yarmouk areas.
In August, Israel announced plans for a military takeover and occupation of the largest city in the enclave, where about 1.3 million Palestinians are currently sheltering in fear and without water, food and medicine.
Three Israeli air strikes targeted the public prosecution building, southwest of Gaza City, Al Jazeera reported.
Israeli forces destroyed one residential tower, three shelters and more than 20 buildings since the morning.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged on Saturday that getting rid of Hamas chiefs living in Qatar would remove the main obstacle to releasing all prisoners and ending the war in Gaza. Israel on Tuesday targeted the Hamas leadership in Doha.
The Israeli military also said on Saturday that more than 250,000 people had fled Gaza City since it began intensifying operations there, as Palestinian officials reported many had been unable to evacuate south due to overcrowding.
The United Nations estimated in late August that about one million Palestinians lived in and around Gaza’s largest urban centre, where it said a famine was unfolding after months of worsening conditions.
The world body and members of the international community have urged the military to abandon its plans to capture the city, warning the assault and ensuing displacement could worsen the already dire humanitarian situation.
 
 

On Saturday, Arabic-language army spokesman Avichay Adraee said on X that “more than a quarter of a million residents of Gaza City have moved out of the city for their own safety”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency, however, reported a much lower figure, saying fewer than 70,000 had managed to leave.
The Israeli military dropped leaflets on Saturday urging residents in western districts to evacuate, as the civil defence reported continuous air strikes.
“The Israeli army is operating with very intense force in your area and is determined to dismantle and defeat Hamas,” the leaflets read, urging people to evacuate south. “You have been warned.”
Mohammad Abu Salmiya, head of the Al-Shifa medical complex, told AFP that displacement was continuing inside Gaza City, with residents moving from east to west, but “only a small number of people have been able to reach the south”.
“Even those who manage to flee south often find no place to stay, as Al-Mawasi and Deir al-Balah are overcrowded,” the senior official said, adding many had returned to Gaza City.
South ‘not safe either’
“The actual number of displaced people from Gaza to the south is approximately 68,000 only,” civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.
“Many residents are still holding their ground, and many others cannot find space in the south.” Bakri Diab, who fled western Gaza City for the south, said Israeli strikes continued there as well.
“Bombing happens here too — the south isn’t safe either,” said the 35-year-old father of four. “All the occupation has done is force people to crowd into places with no basic services and no safety.”
Israel has come under mounting international pressure to halt its Gaza City offensive, but says it is determined to dismantle what it describes as one of Hamas’s last strongholds.

Sialkot ranks first with 1,069 Mauzas (villages), including some urban areas, affected by flood and rainstorms. A population of 1.773 million people has been impacted, while 24 people lost their lives. 
Narowal stands second with 908 Mauzas affected, where 180,000 people were hit by floods and four deaths were reported. In Jhang, 313 Mauzas were affected, though no deaths or injuries were reported. 

PDMA report says 4,744 Mauzas across Punjab affected so far; Sialkot tops list with 1,069 villages

In Gujrat, 214 Mauzas, including urban areas, were affected by floods and four people were reported dead. Other affected districts include Gujranwala/Wazirabad (74), Mandi Bahauddin (78), Hafizabad (165), Sargodha (41), Chiniot (144), Khanewal (158), Multan (138), Muzaffar­garh (147), Sheikhupura (96), Lahore (26), Nan­kana Sahib (97), Kasur (163), Okara (141), Toba Tek Singh (80), Fai­sal­abad (41), Sahiwal (91), Pakpattan (77), Lodhran (20), Vehari (103), Bahawalnagar (143) and Bahawalpur (121).
Over 4.5m impacted 
The report states that a total 4,744 Mauzas have been affected so far, inc­l­uding 2,489 by the Che­nab, 1,458 by the Ravi, 701 by the Sutlej, and 96 by the Indus. More than 4.57 million people have been impacted by the floods in the aforementioned rivers. Overall, 101 people have died and eight have been injured. 
However, Lahore Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza clarified that the one death reported in Lahore was incorrect and had been mistakenly recorded by Rescue 1122. “I will get it corrected soon, as no casualty was reported in the entire Lahore district,” he told Dawn.
The report further claims that over 2.5 million people have been evacuated from flood-hit areas, while more than 2 million animals have been shifted to safe pla­ces. 
A total of 392 relief camps have been set up by district administrations, where 81,810 people are currently residing. In addition, 493 med­ical camps have treated 383,976 people, while 422 veterinary camps are also operational.

• Entire union council of 40,000 submerged in Alipur tehsil
• 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts affected; relief and rehabilitation underway
LAHORE: While water levels have begun to recede significantly in some areas of south Punjab, with the Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils of Multan declared safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad, officials said evacuation and relief efforts continued from low-lying areas along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
As many as 12,427 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the three rivers in what authorities claimed one of the largest operations in recent history, involving a fleet of 1,517 rescue boats.
According to Punjab Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, the districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan were among the hardest hit, with 3,274, 2,392 and 414 people rescued, respectively.
Evacuations extended across numerous other districts, including Lodhran, Bahawalpur and Kasur, illustrating the widespread nature of the crisis. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported that a staggering 2.5 million people have been evacuated from Punjab so far, with the floods claiming 101 lives and necessitating the rescue of 2.19m cattle heads.
 
 

Officials confirmed that water levels have begun to recede significantly in some areas. The government declared the tehsils of Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad, where water flow dropped dramatically from 684,000 cusecs on Friday night to 492,695 cusecs by Saturday evening, a decrease of nearly 200,000 cusecs in 24 hours.
The PDMA said that flows at most major headworks on all three rivers were “steady”.
Despite the improving situation, the humanitarian crisis remains severe. The entire union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, with a population of 40,000, was completely submerged.
Lati Mari resident Syed Kausar Shah told Dawn that around 15,000 people of his basti Azeem Shah evacuated on their own as the water started approaching their union council.
He said that all their houses and crops were destroyed due to an extremely high flood, and two people from the families who could not evacuate in time were drowned.
He said that a private boat was hired to evacuate the people. “Most of them were living in the houses of their relatives in Alipur city, some were also sitting on the dyke under the sky while others shifted to government relief camps,” he added.
The flood-affected people also suffered losses of cattle heads, as most of them could not evacuate their cattle. He said that six to seven feet of water is still flowing in their union council and they could not take away their belongings and also were not able to check whether it was safe or not.
Multan DC Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that 100,000 people were evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala in the the last three days. He said that efforts were being made to fill the breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala and helicopters and drones were being used to transport medicine and dry food to remote areas.
He said that Jalalpur city was made safe, and the major flood wave of the Chenab and Sutlej rivers was crossing the Head Panjnad. He said that relief and rehabilitation of the flood-affected people had started, and food was being distributed through boats in rural areas of the city.
High-level flooding
Addressing a press conference in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that Panjnad Headworks is facing extremely high flood, with the water flow reaching 575,000 cusecs. He said that 80,000 cusecs of water receded at Panjand in some hours, and a maximum of 700,000 cusecs crossed three days ago.
He said that the Sutlej River had swelled to 385,000 cusecs this season, and all three rivers of the province simultaneously created high-level flooding.
He said that there was no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities and water would also recede in Bahawalpur in the next 24 hours. A “historic” evacuation operation was conducted in Jalalpur Pirwala, and forced evacuation would have been conducted in the district of Multan, he added.
 
 

The DG said that 4,447 mouzas of 28 districts were affected due to flood water and 2.5m people were evacuated from Punjab. He said that 101 people lost their lives in floods and 2.19m cattle heads were also evacuated in the province and shifted to safe places.
Water flow
According to the Flood Forecasting Division’s data released at 9pm on Saturday, the water flow across major rivers was largely normal and steady.
On the Chenab River, flows are steady at all key locations, including Marala Headworks (62,081 cusecs), Khanki Head­works (65,049 cusecs), Qadirabad Headworks (64,588 cusecs) and Tri­mmu Headworks (100,645 cusecs). The flow at Panjnad Headworks was at 492,695 cusecs but was falling. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 517.20 feet, which was steady and below its maximum level of 525 feet.
On the Ravi River, the water outflow was normal at Jassar (13,797 cusecs), Shahdara (14,906 cusecs) and Balloki Headworks (27,970 cusecs), but it was in low flood at Sidhnai Headworks at 40,809 cusecs.
On the Sutlej River, the water flow was in medium flood at Ganda Singh Wala Headworks (95,000 cusecs) and Islam Headworks (82,155 cusecs), while it was in low flood at Sulemanki Headworks (69,019 cusecs).
