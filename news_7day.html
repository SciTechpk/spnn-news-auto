Air Force One returned to Joint Base Andrews out of an abundance of caution, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. It landed shortly after 0400 GMT.
Journalists traveling with Trump reported that lights in the cabin went out briefly after takeoff.
With its classic blue and white livery, Air Force One is arguably the world’s most iconic plane and an instantly recognisable symbol of the US presidency.
Trump has long been unhappy with the current Air Force One jets - two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that entered service in 1990 under president George H.W Bush.
Last year, Trump said his administration was “looking at alternatives” to Boeing following delays in the delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft.
In May, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth accepted a Boeing 747 that the Gulf emirate of Qatar offered to Trump for use as Air Force One.
The jet - worth hundreds of millions of dollars - has raised huge constitutional and ethical questions, as well as security concerns about using an aircraft donated by a foreign power for use as the ultra-sensitive presidential plane.</p><small>2026-01-21 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21092819dc7aa01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968203/search-operation-continues-at-karachis-gul-plaza-three-more-bodies-identified' target='_blank'><strong>Search operation continues at Karachi’s Gul Plaza; three more bodies identified</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The search operation at Gul Plaza continued on Wednesday after a devastating fire, which has so far claimed 28 lives, with medical authorities identifying three more bodies.
The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
According to a statement by Edhi, three of the 21 unidentified bodies at the Edhi morgue have been identified. The remains belong to a 15-year-old girl and two men.
The bodies were identified using DNA samples, the statement added.
On Tuesday, a large crowd gathered at the scene, with law enforcement creating temporary barriers to prevent people from approaching the plaza. Smoke could still be seen emanating from the building’s rubble.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the death toll had reached 28.
She said the dead also appeared to include five women. The police surgeon said that officials had conducted a post-mortem examination of “fragmentary human remains”.
All Gul Plaza records available, SCBA maintains
The SBCA, a day earlier, also rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”.
“The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”.
According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998.
“Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said.
“A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.”
The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.
It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire.
“The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body.
“The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.

The campaign was inaugurated at Azadi Chowk by Commissioner Maryam Khan, Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana, and Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Dr. Athar Waheed.
A road safety camp was set up on Yadgar Road, Azadi Chowk, where free safety rods were installed on motorcycles. The commissioner, CCPO, and CTO reviewed the installation process and emphasised strict enforcement of safety measures during Basant.

 

On the other hand, the Punjab government on Tuesday directed all public sector universities and colleges in Lahore to place their buses at the disposal of the district administration to ensure free transport for the public during the three-day ‘Safe Basant’ celebrations from Feb 6 to 8.

Colleges, universities told to provide buses along with drivers to administration to ensure ‘Safe Basant’ activity

According to officials, the Punjab Higher Education Department (HED) issued instructions to vice chancellors, principals, and administrations of public sector universities and colleges to provide buses along with drivers for three days. The move aims to facilitate citizens, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance public safety during the cultural festival.
The HED deputy secretary conveyed the directions to educational institutions through official communication, including WhatsApp messages, asking them to fully cooperate with the government initiative.
The decision comes as part of a broader ‘Mehfooz Basant’ plan being implemented by the Punjab government, Lahore district administration, and law-enforcement agencies to ensure safe and regulated celebrations within the limits of Lahore district.
Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Commissioner Maryam Khan said free ride services would be available across the city during the three-day festival and made it clear that no motorcycle would be allowed on Lahore’s roads without a safety rod. She reiterated that ‘Safe Basant’ would be celebrated strictly within Lahore district on Feb 6, 7, and 8, and kite flying would not be permitted before Feb 6.

 

She further stated that the sale of kites and strings would be allowed only from Feb 1 to 8, while manufacturing of kite-flying material would be restricted to Lahore district alone. Only registered manufacturers, traders, and sellers would be allowed to operate, and all must display valid NOCs. Online registration of businesses is underway through the “e-Biz” app, with licences being cleared within three days.
CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana warned that strict legal action would be taken against violations of Basant-related laws, including aerial firing and non-compliance with safety regulations. “Ensuring the safety of citizens is our top priority, and there will be zero tolerance for violations,” he said.
CTO Lahore Dr. Athar Waheed said 100 road safety camps have been established across the city, where safety rods are being installed on 50,000 to 60,000 motorcycles daily. He added that more than one million safety rods would be installed to ensure maximum protection for motorcyclists during Basant.
Officials said all departments, including police, traffic police, district administration, and educational institutions, would work in close coordination to ensure that ‘Safe Basant’ is celebrated peacefully, safely, and in accordance with the law.

Calling the move a deliberate “weaponisation of water,” Pakistan’s representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, said India’s actions amounted to material breaches of the landmark 1960 treaty.







Speaking at the Global Water Bankruptcy Policy Roundtable hosted by Canada and the United Nations University on Tuesday, Ambassador Jadoon said that since April last year, India had committed several serious violations of the treaty, including unannounced disruptions of downstream water flows and the withholding of critical hydrological data.
“Pakistan’s position is unequivocal; the treaty remains legally intact and permits no unilateral suspension or modification,” he said.
He stressed that for more than six decades, the Indus Waters Treaty had provided a time-tested framework for the equitable and predictable management of the Indus River basin, which sustains one of the world’s largest contiguous irrigation systems.
The basin, he noted, provides over 80 percent of Pakistan’s agricultural water needs and supports the lives and livelihoods of more than 240 million people.
Ambassador Jadoon said water insecurity had emerged globally as a systemic risk, affecting food production, energy systems, public health, livelihoods, and human security.
“For Pakistan, this is a lived reality,” he said, describing the country as a semi-arid, climate-vulnerable, lower-riparian state facing floods, droughts, accelerated glacier melt, groundwater depletion, and rapid population growth — all of which are placing immense pressure on already stressed water systems.
Highlighting Pakistan’s response, he said the country was strengthening water resilience through integrated planning, flood protection, irrigation rehabilitation, groundwater replenishment, and ecosystem restoration.
He cited initiatives such as ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ as key national efforts. However, he emphasized that systemic water risks could not be managed by any country in isolation, particularly in shared river basins.
Predictability, transparency, and cooperation in transboundary water governance, he said, were matters of survival for downstream populations.
Ambassador Jadoon further called for water insecurity to be formally recognised as a systemic global risk in the lead-up to the 2026 UN Water Conference, urging that cooperation and respect for international water law be placed at the center of shared water governance to ensure real protection for vulnerable downstream communities.</p><small>2026-01-21 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/696ffe37e4b76.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968188/islamabad-under-siege' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad under siege</strong></a><br><p>THE assault comes from multiple directions, each more brazen than the last. Consider what happened barely a stone’s throw from Parliament House itself: while legislators debated inside, Shakarparian contractors were busy deforesting a beautiful tract of land within sight of the nation’s seat of power. The trees fell and the earth was cleared, primed for mudslides once the monsoon arrives. Nobody in authority raised an alarm. The symbolism is almost too perfect: as we talk about governance, the very ground beneath our feet is being stolen.
This is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern. The Islamabad Wildlife Board, established precisely to protect the Margalla Hills National Park, has been neutered. Rina Saeed Khan, the champion who stood guard over these hills, now faces harassment through bogus cases, a punishment for the ‘crime’ of doing what the law mandates. When protectors become the persecuted, the capture is complete.
The physical transformation of the city tells the same story. Those cascading contours that once defined Islamabad’s character, giving it a topography distinct from the concrete monotony of other urban centres are being systematically flattened. This destruction is now cascading beyond the capital territory, driven by influential housing societies in the surrounding hilly areas. Contractors fill in these natural undulations to create level plots and farmhouses, erasing in months what nature took millennia to create. The model city is being reduced to just an­­other flat, characterless expanse of development.
The city has been further bifurcated by signal-free corridors that have killed its walkability. Islamabad was designed as a city where I could once move between sectors on foot or bicycle, where neighbourhoods connected organically. Now, massive thoroughfares carve through the urban fabric, making it impossible to cross without risking one’s life. We have prioritised cars over people and speed over liveability, destroying the pedestrian character that once made the city humane.

The capital now appears regularly on pollution indices it once escaped.

Construction in green belts now proceeds with impunity. These areas were once the oxygen veins of the city, meant to ensure that development never became suffocating. Today, we allow construction there and needlessly expand roads, parking lots, and seminaries. Semi-permanent camps for law-enforcement agencies further narrow the spaces that let the city breathe. Each road-widening project claims more green spaces — the very things that made Islamabad different.
We have carved the E sectors out of what was supposed to be the Margalla Hills National Park. These areas were intended as habitats for leopards, pangolins, barking deer and grey goral. Instead, we authorised cricket pavilions, university campuses, golf courses, and private housing, turning ecological corridors into real estate opportunities. The wildlife that once roamed freely now finds itself trapped in shrinking pockets, leading to the conflicts we wring our hands about when a leopard ventures into the encroached areas. We took their home and act surprised when they show up at ours.
Meanwhile, garbage chokes the tributaries of the Lai nullah, and invasive species like paper mulberry are spread in the name of landscaping, driving away indigenous birds which need indigenous trees for nesting, mating and chirping.
The consequences of this reckless development play out in tragic ways. We once took pride in a gravity-based drainage system where every manhole bore the Mohenjo Daro seal, a symbol of inherited excellence in urban planning. Now, the CDA and its approved housing societies have encroached upon natural channels, narrowed nullahs, and built roads over storm-water drains. When the rains come, the water has nowhere to go. The floods in E-11 in 2021 and G-11 in 2025 were the price of denying water its right of passage. This is manufactured urban flooding, and it persists because nobody is held accountable.

 

While rainwater harvesting is ignored, all sources of natural recharging are being flattened. This run-off adds to pollution, while ad hoc population growth depletes the groundwater, allowing the ‘tanker mafia’ to emerge. Even our ancient heritage is not spared; we allowed encroachments on caves where Buddhist monks once meditated. We cut through the heart of our ecosystem to construct corridors like Alexander Road, ostensibly for connectivity, but really to open up land for developers who see only profit where there should be preservation.
Perhaps the most stunning revelation of the current mindset was the proposal to mortgage F-9 Park for a sukuk bond worth Rs500 billion. The federal government actually considered pledging this 750-acre public park as collateral for debt. Though the proposal was withdrawn after a public outcry, the fact that it was seriously entertained reveals a disturbing truth.
Meanwhile, the air tells its own story of decline. Islamabad’s air was once distinctively crisp, and a part of its identity, as were its tree-lined avenues. That air is gone. Unchecked vehicular emissions, construction dust, and the burning of waste have transformed the atmosphere. The capital now appears regularly on pollution indices it once escaped, joining Lahore in the unenviable club of Pakistan’s toxic cities. Every infrastructure project extracts its tribute; highways and metro extensions demand the sacrifice of mature trees that functioned as carbon sinks. The arithmetic of ‘compensatory’ saplings never adds up to the restoration of a lost ecosystem.
At the heart of the capital sits Rawal Lake, a prize waterbody that is slowly dying. Industrial effluents mix with sewage, and solid waste accumulates at the edges. Expanding irregular housing societies in Banigala, Bhara Kahu, and Chak Shahzad discharge waste into the lake, treating a strategic asset like a dumping ground.
This environmental siege exposes a fundamental disconnect between what we claim to value and what we actually protect. The institutions exist and the laws are on the books, but the political will to enforce them is missing. Islamabad was built as a statement that Pakistan could create a capital worthy of a great nation. That vision is being betrayed through internal surrender. The ‘Asian Geneva’ is becoming just another casualty of unchecked development. Unless accountability is restored and the protectors are themselves protected, the siege will continue until there is nothing left worth defending.

His idea of the ‘Board of Peace’ goes beyond its original UN mandate of overseeing the rehabilitation of Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israel’s genocidal war. Reportedly, so far nearly 60 countries have been invited to join the ‘board’ chaired by the American president. It is supposed to operate as a “more nimble and effective international peacebuilding body”. It will cost $1 billion for nations to buy a permanent seat on the so-called board. Many heads of government and state representing potential member countries have been invited to join. The full list of the invitees is still not known.
Interestingly, there is no mention of Gaza in the Board of Peace charter. Last year, a UN Security Council resolution had authorised the formation of the board to oversee the post-war administrative transition of the enclave. Trump has separately named an 11-member executive board for Gaza as part of the 20-point peace plan for the enclave.
But the charter reportedly sent out by the Trump administration to potential members projects the Board of Peace as an international conflict resolution body along the lines of the UN. One wonders under what mandate this international body is being set up. It is the brainchild of the American president who seems to consider himself as the sole arbiter of the global order.
According to international media, the charter gives wide-ranging powers to Trump as the board’s chair, allowing him to appoint and remove member states — a decision that could only be overturned by a two-thirds majority of members. It also provides him with the “exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfil the Board of Peace’s mission”.

The so-called Board of Peace is meant to be used to advance US hegemony.

Trump has been a fierce critic of the UN and under his presidency America has pulled out of several of its agencies. His Board of Peace is also meant to undermine the global body. He aspires to create a new world order dictated by American military might.
Interestingly, the charter says the objective of the board is “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”. It is ironic that this talk of lawful governance comes from an administration that recently kidnapped the president of a sovereign state (Venezuela) and his wife in a military operation that trampled over all international laws. Trump has dismissed international law, saying only his “own morality” can curb the aggressive policies he is pursuing across the world.
Trump has also threatened to use military force against other South American countries and has bombed Iran last year. It aided Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians and destroyed the entire enclave. The same administration, whose imperialistic designs have been fully exposed, claims to uphold the idea of a rules-based world order.
Describing the need for setting up a new international organisation, the charter maintains: “Durable peace requires pragmatic judgement, common sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”. It doesn’t, of course, talk about the fact that America’s own disdain for the rule of law has been the main reason for the failure of the UN and other international institutions. This board cannot provide global peace and stability. It is meant to be used to advance America’s hegemony.

 

Curiously, the idea of this American-led multinational organisation has been floated as the Trump administration prepares to take over Greenland, which has brought Washington into conflict with its European Nato allies. He has imposed an initial 10 per cent tariff on European countries opposing his plan to seize the Danish-controlled autonomous island.
In a recent message to Norway’s prime minister, Trump reportedly said that one reason why he is pushing to acquire Greenland is that he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize. “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace…” was Trump’s message.
Trump’s anger over not getting the Nobel Peace Prize seems to be driving him to take the world down. He no longer distinguishes between rivals and allies. Nothing could be more dangerous for world peace than such a megalomaniac at the helm of the world’s biggest power. His plan to create and chair an international organisation as a rival to the UN will be the final nail in the coffin of an already collapsing global order.
Strangely, neither the Board of Peace nor the Gaza Executive Board under it has Palestinian representation. Instead, the executive board is stuffed with American officials whose pro-Zionist bias is well known. Besides Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and America’s Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff are also included in the executive board. There are also officials from Qatar and Egypt and an Israeli businessman, according to media reports.
One of the most controversial founding members of the Gaza board is Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who is accused of war crimes for his decision to join the American war in Iraq.
As a part of the peace plan, an International Stabilisation Force will be raised to lead security operations, support comprehensive demilitarisation and enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid. Pakistan and some other Muslim countries have been approached to join the force that will be led by an American military officer. Given its dubious mandate, there is a real danger that the ISF will find itself fighting the Palestinian resistance group. Pakistan needs to think through any decision to join the ISF.

Zafar Khan, a fire officer, has not left the site of this shopping mall in Karachi since the night of January 17, when the iconic building caught fire. The raging blaze claimed 28 lives, while rescue teams continue to search for more than 60 missing people amid the charred rubble.
Being the most visible part of the response, much of the blame has fallen on the firefighters. But days later, with smoke still seeping from the building, Zafar can still be seen standing amid the blackened debris and angry murmurs, explaining again and again why it has been such an uphill task to douse the fire.
Amid the accusations and smoke, lies a quieter truth that must not be forgotten: fires may erupt in minutes, but the conditions that allow them to rage unchecked fester over years and years.
Where plastic or similarly inflammable material is present, he says, fire has a habit of re-erupting the moment it receives oxygen. “That is why, even now, firefighting and cooling continue side by side.”

When asked how he copes with public accusations of “incompetence” and “undue delays”, he barely pauses. “We are here to save people’s lives and property. It is part of our training not to get too emotional as we focus on our work while being confronted by people who are freaking out. We understand that ours is also a thankless job. People also yell at and curse doctors in hospitals who are caring for their loved ones.”
The Gul Plaza inferno and its aftermath have given rise to a storm of allegations, with the first finger pointed squarely at the firefighters.
Citizens, angered, frustrated and left helpless by the tragedy, accused the fire crew of arriving late, running out of water, lacking equipment and skill, and failing to control a fire that broke out around 10.15pm on Saturday but continued to smoulder until Tuesday morning.

Smoke billowing from the building’s eastern side fuelled public suspicion that something inside was still burning, but firefighters had left it “unchecked”.
Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s Chief Fire Officer, Humayun Khan, however, explains his crew’s side of the story, one that rarely surfaces or makes news.

“We responded to the distress call about the fire at Gul Plaza almost immediately and reported here within 10 to 12 minutes of receiving that call,” he tells Dawn.
By the time fire tenders reached the site, however, a crowd of 10,000 to 12,000 people had gathered at the site, turning panic into a physical obstacle. “Yes, we understand their anxiety, but coming in our way in their panic is not right. In fact, it is a violation,” he adds.
He further explains how each distress call made to the helpline is digitally registered with the caller’s ID, followed by a confirmation call, a process which leaves little room for dispute over response time.

He also says how, upon arrival, firefighters had to face competing demands from shopkeepers, each insisting their shop be saved first, while ambulances that had reached the site earlier blocked the access routes for the fire trucks.

“There is a need to keep ambulance routes separate,” the fire chief says. “Ignoring such standard operating procedures [SOPs] can make even small incidents big.”
What puzzled him most was that many shopkeepers decided to stay inside the burning building instead of running outside immediately.

Even after 12 fire tenders and three snorkels were deployed, he recalls, his crews had to struggle to manoeuvre hoses amid pressure from shopowners, which created a lot of confusion. “Still, we were able to help the shopkeepers grab their valuable documents that were left behind, along with cash worth millions,” he shares.
According to members of the fire crew, people also questioned them about their tactics. Would foam or chemical agents not have been more effective against a fire that kept flaring up?

Officer Zafar agrees in principle, but said that there were limitations. “Foam needs to reach the precise area, which we were unable to reach in this case. It is ineffective if sprayed from afar,” he explains.
When asked why all firefighters were also seen wearing plain disposable masks and not specialised ones or helmets with torches, Fire Chief Humayun quickly shook his head.
“We are not short of such equipment,” he says. “But we use them when needed. The fumes carry particles that choke the gas masks. Putting them on to take off again and go back to have them cleaned will take too much time.”
Besides, he says, his team wore disposable masks and plain helmets when firefighting from outside. “We will use whatever is needed after going inside. We have already started doing that now, as the fire is more or less under control. We are just waiting for the building to cool.”

It is also a structure in danger of collapsing, he says, explaining, “We also need to be careful as we have already lost one firefighter when a portion of the building fell on him.”

The martyred fireman, Furqan Ali, 36, was associated with the Nazimabad Fire Station and had been serving in the KMC Fire Department since 2018. He was appointed on a deceased quota after his father, also associated with the fire department, passed away while in service.
For those on the ground, the deeper problem lies far beyond a single blaze. According to Sub-Fire Officer Sajid Ali Khan, the commercial complex, which was spread over nearly two acres of land, had not a single fire hose reel or extinguisher.

“It is life insurance to have an extinguisher. You only need to refill it once a year, which costs about Rs1,000. Gul Plaza generated revenue in millions each day, and no one there thought about this?”

“If they had a fire extinguisher in the first shop where the fire initially erupted, they could have put it out there and then,” he maintains.
Leading Firefighter Riazuddin points to a systemic failure. He says that large buildings that lack fire exits, smoke alarms, or sprinkler systems pose serious risks. “There is a lack of awareness regarding fire safety here. There are no fire drills, so people don’t know what to do if a fire breaks out,” he says.

He explains that in the past, there used to be civil defence training in schools, which was no longer imparted to students. “Do you know that fire doesn’t kill, but smoke and suffocation do?”

“If you stay low during a fire (stay close to the ground), you can easily crawl out to safety because smoke gathers about a foot above the ground,” he points out.

“But who’s to spread such awareness in a land where you have no time or use for fire drills?”
Back at the front of the blackened plaza, Zafar remains at his post, watching the structure exhale wisps of smoke. For him and his fellow firefighters, the work is not about public approval or blame, but about staying long enough to make sure the fire does not return, and leaving only when it is finally safe to do so.

The current account has slipped back to a $1.17bn deficit in the first six months of the year — following a surplus of $957m in the same period last year and $2bn over the full year. But the gap remains within the FY26 target of $2.1bn, or 0pc-1pc of GDP.
The gap is blamed on the widening trade deficit that rose from $14.5bn to $19.2bn in July-December, despite continued demand compression. It underlines the extent of the growth challenge that lies ahead for policymakers and the State Bank amid dwindling foreign private and official flows. It also shows that the balance-of-payments problem is not a one-off event but a structural issue even if the immediate triggers remain a massive rise in food imports and a significant decrease in rice exports. The Afghan border’s closure, too, has played a part.
The saving grace for the external account so far has been increased remittances and lower global oil prices. However, these cushions still leave us vulnerable to geopolitical shocks in the Middle East, as they may evaporate in case of regional escalations, particularly involving Iran. Undoubtedly, the containment of the current account deficit and last year’s surplus has played a critical role in anchoring foreign exchange market sentiments, preventing speculative pressure on the home currency.

 

Now that the return to a current account deficit has dented this sentiment, if not eroded it altogether, we may see renewed pressure on the exchange rate and the SBP further tightening legitimate currency outflows if this trend continues. The emerging situation may force the SBP to again halt the monetary easing it just restarted after several months. A current account deficit is not a disease; it is rather a symptom of what ails the economy: falling agricultural and industrial productivity and policy failures holding exports down and scaring away foreign private investors.
Recent data shows that both outbound shipments and non-debt-creating, long-term foreign investment are plummeting. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has set up an inter-ministerial committee to recommend a strategy to exit the IMF programme. Obviously, such a strategy would focus on building up growth momentum in the next two years.
The committee must understand that there are structural weaknesses in agriculture, manufacturing and investment feeding into external imbalances. Unless growth is anchored in productivity, exports and sustained investment inflows, we will remain stuck in low-growth mode and be vulnerable to the next balance-of-payments shock.

ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Tuesday moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet incarcerated leader Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in Adiala jail, as well as an order by the court to end their unlawful solitary confinement.
On the other hand, the Punjab police used force to disperse a PTI protest in Rawalpindi after the former ruling party wrapped up its sit-in outside the prison and decided to stage a rally in the garrison city. The PTI, in a statement posted on X after midnight, said the police crackdown resulted in several arrests and injuries.







A group of about 17 senators, including Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, approached the high court under Article 199 of the Constitution, making the Punjab Home Department and the Adiala jail superintendent respondents.
The petition challenged the alleged unlawful and unconstitutional use of solitary confinement and other inhumane practices against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in jail. According to the petition, the continued solitary confinement amounts to torture and violates fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
Barrister Zafar said the senators approa­ched the court in discharge of their constitutional duty of parliamentary oversight and to safeguard human dignity and the rule of law.
The petition maintained Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi had been kept in prolonged isolation for the last two months without any judicial order or statutory justification under the Pakistan Penal Code or the Prisons Act.
It alleged denial of basic prisoner entitlements, including access to books, news­­papers, TV, family visits, and confidential meetings with counsel, as well as the arbitrary refusal to allow lawmakers to meet them.
The senators contended that these measures were punitive, politically motivated, and part of a broader pattern of coercive treatment of political detainees, undermining constitutional democracy and parliamentary oversight.
Separately, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also arrived at the IHC to seek the fixing of cases related to Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi.
According to sources, the PTI leadership requested a meeting with the IHC chief justice, but the meeting could not take place.
Speaking to the media, Barrister Gohar said he had gone to the chief justice’s chamber to request early fixation of the cases but was unable to meet him. He added that another attempt would be made later.
Barrister Gohar said the PTI had approa­ched the IHC about 15 times but could not secure a hearing date, stressing that a woman’s appeal should be heard expeditiously.
Crackdown on PTI rally
The PTI supporters and family members of Imran Khan staged a sit-in outside the prison for a few hours after they were barred from meeting the former prime minister in the morning. In the late evening, they decided to stage a rally in the garrison city, prompting the police to disperse the crowd.
A video posted by the PTI on X showed several cars leaving the jail area, with party workers and supporters moving on foot. “Even today, Chairman Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were not granted a meeting with the family. Khan sahib’s sisters and party workers have set off for a protest rally in Islamabad,” the post’s caption read.







However, the rally was scuttled by the police, with videos of the crackdown posted on X by the PTI. These videos could not be independently verified.
The PTI claimed that its workers were also injured in the action, and several, including minors, were allegedly rounded up. It also alleged that the police roughed up the sisters of Mr Khan and other party leaders.
Visit to Adiala
In the morning on their way to the prison, the PTI leaders were stopped at ‘DHA Naka’ instead of ‘Factory Chowk’, but were allo­wed to move a little further after some time.
Imran’s sister Uzma Khanam said that it has been decided that wherever the police stop them, they will hold ‘Quran Khwani’ there. She said that on February 8, the entire country “will be jammed” to protest the alleged rigging in the 2024 elections.
She urged the party supporters to fly kites with the name of Imran Khan on Basant so that “his name and picture would be on land and in the skies”.
Replying to a question, Aleema Khan said they wanted the release of Imran Khan instead of just meetings.
PTI leader Shafiul­lah Jan said that in the past, the authorities used to stop PTI workers three kilometres from the jail, but on Tuesday, they were stopped eight kilometres from the jail.

ISLAMABAD: In a loud and clear message, the Supreme Court on Tuesday affirmed its appellate hierarchy under the 27th Amendment by holding that civil petitions concerning rent and family matters, previously adjudicated by high courts under Article 199, are maintainable before it.
The controversy emerged from an office objection regarding the maintainability of a civil petition on the ground that the impugned judge-ment had been rendered by a high court under Article 199 in a rent matter and, thus, was not maintainable before the SC under the constitutional dispensation introduced through 27th Amendment.
The office objection further contended that following the insertion of Article 175F(1)(c) by the 27th Amend­ment, high court functions as the final judicial forum in rent matters, and as such, no appeal against a judgement pertaining to a rent matter lies before the SC.
The office also argued that while Article 185(3) confers general appellate jurisdiction upon the SC, Article 175F(1)(c), being a specific provision introduced subsequently, excludes rent matters from all appellate forums beyond the high court.
A three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, overruled the office objection through a short order on Dec 12, 2025, while hearing the case of Messrs Moon Dental Clinic, Islamabad.
In the detailed reasons authored by the CJP, the court cited Article 175-F(1) of the Constitution, which provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
From a plain and textual reading of Articles 185(3) and Article 175-F(1)(c), the judgement explained that Article 185(3) operates as a general source of appellate jurisdiction of the SC in respect of judgements, decrees, orders or sentences of the high courts, subject only to the exclusion contained within it — namely, cases to which clause (1) of Article 175F applies.
Article 175F(1), in turn, sets out the appellate jurisdiction of the FCC and, by virtue of the proviso to clause (1)(c), expressly excludes cases relating to rent and family matters from its jurisdiction.
The core question before the court, therefore, was whether judgements or orders of a high court pertaining to rent and family matters, which stand expressly excluded Article 175F(1), are removed altogether from the appellate framework beyond the high court, including the Supreme Court, or whether such exclusion places them outside the scope of Article 175(1), thereby attracting the appellate jurisdiction of the SC under Article 185(3).
The judgement clarified that the proviso to Article 175F(1)(c), which states that “no appeal shall lie against a judgement or an order of a high court made under Article 199 in a case relating to rent and family matters,” operates as a true proviso and qualifies the general scope of clause (1)(c) by expressly excluding such matters.
By this exclusion, rent and family matters are removed from the operative field of Article 175F(1)(c).
Read in conjunction therewith, the proviso to Article 185(3), which provides that “no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in cases to which clause (1) of Article 175F applies”, it becomes evident that the bar on the appellate jurisdiction of the SC applies only to cases that actually fall within.
Article 175F(1).
Since rent and family matters are expressly excluded from the applicability of Article 175F(1)(c), such cases cannot be regarded as falling within Article 175F.
Consequently, petitions arising out of rent and family matters are not barred from the appellate jurisdiction of the SC under Article 185(3), it explained.
The court held that the office objection, premised on the petition arising from a rent matter, was misconceived and rightly overruled.
Accordingly, the SC ruled that the present petition was maintainable and would be proceeded with in accordance with law.

Six Afghans and one Chinese national were killed, and several others were injured in the blast at a Chinese restaurant in a heavily-guarded part of the city centre.
Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign minister, told a press briefing on Tuesday that China has requested the Afghanistan government to spare no effort in treating the injured.
On Monday, videos shared on social media showed smoke billowing from a large hole torn in the facade of the restaurant building, while debris littered the street outside.

Demand comes after militant group Islamic State claimed the Kabul blast

“We have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, the Afghanistan director of humanitarian group EMERGENCY, said in a statement, adding that seven were dead on arrival.
“Among the wounded are four women and a child.”
The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the Islamic State group.
Militant group Islamic State claimed the Monday’s blast that tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in the commercial Shahr-e-Naw area, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said.
The Afghan branch of Islamic State militant group said in a statement it was carried out by a suicide bomber.
The restaurant serving the Chinese Muslim community was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim man, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, Zadran said. “The nature of the explosion is unkn­own so far and is being investigated,” he said.
The Amaq news agency said the domestic arm of Islamic State had put Chinese citizens on its list of targets, citing “growing crimes by the Chinese government against Uyghurs”. Rights groups accuse Beijing of widespread abuses of Uyghurs, a mainly Mus­­lim ethnic minority group numbering about 10 million.

JERUSALEM: Israeli bulldozers began demolitions at the headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem on Tuesday, in what the organisation called an “unprecedented attack” and a “serious violation of international law”.
UNRWA spokesman Jonathan Fowler said that Israeli forces “stormed into” the compound shortly after 7am and ejected security guards from the site, before bulldozers entered and began demolishing buildings.
“This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises. And it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” Fowler said.

 

“What happens today to UNRWA can happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission around the world,” he warned.
The demolition of the UNWRA headquarters comes at a time when a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition after being threatened by Israel, despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report.
Roland Friedrich, the agency’s director in the occupied West Bank called the move political, saying “it seems the intent is to seize the land for settlement construction as has openly been stated by Israeli officials for many years in the media and elsewhere”.
AFP photos showed heavy machinery demolishing structures at the UNWRA compound, where now an Israeli flag fluttered overhead.
An AFP photographer reported that far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had made a brief visit to the site. “For years, these supporters of terrorism were here, and today they are being removed from here along with everything they built in this place. This is what will happen to every supporter of terrorism,” the Israeli minister said.
A series of investigations, including one led by France’s former foreign minister Cath­e­rine Colonna, found some ‘neutrality-related issues’ at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation.
‘Ownership’
In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry defended the de­­molitions and said Israel “owns the Jerusalem compound”.
The compound in Israeli-occupied territory has been empty of UNRWA staff since January 2025, when Israel “banned” its operations in the Gaza Strip.
“UNRWA-Hamas had alrea­­dy ceased its operations at this site and no longer had any UN personnel or UN activity there,” the foreign ministry asserted.
“The compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law,” it insisted.
UNRWA’s Friedrich said the UN rejected the Israeli claim, explaining that the compound “remains United Nations property and is protected by the privileges and immunities of the UN, regardless of whether it is currently in use”.
Though the UNRWA ban applies in east Jerusalem due to its occupation by Israel, the agency still operates in Gaza.
Attempt to erase identity
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini denounced the demolitions on X, saying it was yet another attempt by “Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine Refugee identity”.







Meanwhile, a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces im­­minent demolition despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report.
Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players, particularly those living in the nearby Aida refugee camp, while Israel declared it illegal.
On Nov 3, 2025 the children found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field. It was followed soon by a demolition order.

According to the rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) based on interbank exchange rates, the world gold market has surged by $43 per ounce to $4,713.
As per Reuters, gold climbed to a fresh record high as escalating geopolitical tensions boosted safe-haven demand. Gold, seen as a safe store of value during economic and political instability, soared 64pc in 2025 and has added another 10pc since the start of the year. The metal’s rally has also been supported by expectations of US interest rate cuts, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said that investors have intensified their purchases of gold worldwide, including in Pakistan, since US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on European countries.
He said gold jewellery buying in the country continues to get weaker with every fresh increase in local rates. “Families come to the shops for gold, polishing their silver jewellery for their daughters’ wedding instead of purchasing pure gold jewellery,” he said.
Qasim claimed that gold in Pakistan is selling below cost by Rs30,000 per tola compared to Dubai rates.

DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was ‘no going back’ on his goal to control Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies as European leaders struggled to respond.
Trump’s ambition — spelled out in social media posts and mock-up AI images — to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow Nato member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades.
It has also threatened to reignite a trade war with Europe that rattled markets and companies for months last year, though Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against what he called “hysteria’ over Greenland.
“As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back On that, everyone agrees!” Trump said after speaking to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
To drive home the message, Trump posted an AI image of himself in Greenland, holding a US flag. Another showed him speaking to leaders next to a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States.
Separately, he leaked messages including from French President Emmanuel Macron, who questioned what Trump was ‘doing on Greenland’. Trump, who has vowed to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way, had earlier threatened to hammer French wines and champagnes with a 200pc tariff.







‘New independent Europe’
The European Union has threatened to hit back with trade measures. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($109 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on Feb 6 after a six-month suspension.
Another option is the “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), which has never yet been used. It could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services, the sector in which the US has a surplus with the bloc, including the lucrative digital services provided by US tech giants.
Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told parliament in Copenhagen on Tuesday the worst may still lie ahead. “We can negotiate about everything political, including security, investments and the economy, but we cannot negotiate our most fundamental values: sovereignty, our country’s identity, our borders, our democracy,” she said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is also due to attend this week, sought to rally leaders around building a “new independent Europe”.
“The seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact a necessity to build a new form of European independence,” she said.
“We will only be able to capitalise on this opportunity if we recognise that this change is permanent,” she added.
Bessent pushes back against ‘hysteria’
Bessent, also speaking at the Davos gathering of the world’s political and business elite, said a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe.
“It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.”
Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the US and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.”
Danish sovereignty over Greenland questioned
Protesters marched in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Monday, carrying a giant banner saying: “TRUMP NOT WELCOME. NO WEF! NO OLIGARCHY! NO IMPERIALIST WARS!”, Swiss newspaper NZZ reported.
The foreign minister of Russia, which has been watching with glee as Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe, said that “Greenland is not a natural part of Denmark” and also denied that Moscow had any designs on the island.
“It was neither a natural part of Norway nor a natural part of Denmark,” Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “It is a colonial conquest. The fact that the inhabitants are now accustomed to it and feel comfortable is another matter.”

Briefing the media on Tuesday, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain said the conference would contribute to increased bilateral agricultural trade, expanded investment in priority sub-sectors, modernisation of production and processing systems, and the establishment of commercial partnerships between private sector entities of the two countries.
Cooperation across 10 priority sub-sectors of agriculture includes collaboration in seed production technology; export of heat-treated beef; construction of grain storages and warehouses; strengthening ties for cheese production and export; improvement of local milk processing machinery; export of heat-treated offal; collaboration in buffalo UHT milk and camel milk powder; poultry machinery and technology; chemicals and bio-pesticides; feed mill equipment; renewable technologies in irrigation; value addition in mango pulp and tea; efficient fodder production; fish and shrimp feed technology; fruit processing; development of sweet and seedless Chinese citrus orchards in Pakistan; value addition of rice; soya milk packaging; and exchange of best citrus varieties with mango (chaunsa) variety.

 

Of the 78 agreements signed, 37 were business-to-business investment agreements, 24 joint ventures and 14 partnership agreements. The 10 priority sectors identified were agri-chemicals and inputs; agri-machinery; food processing and value addition; meat and poultry industry; dairy products; fruits and vegetables; animal feed; fisheries and aquaculture; cold chain systems; and food-grade packaging and equipment.

Agriculture formally included as priority area under CPEC 2.0

To ensure implementation of the MoUs, dedicated units were being established in the ministry as well as at the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing to oversee follow-up, the minister said. He added that enhanced cooperation in agriculture would help boost Pakistan’s exports. Currently, Pakistan exports agricultural products worth $8bn, and the government aims to double this figure over the next three years.
Mr Hussain explained that the conference was conceived as a targeted, investment-focused platform rather than a general consultative forum. Its design emphasised direct private sector engagement, investment matchmaking and facilitation support, aligned with national priorities for agricultural modernisation and export-led growth.
He said 116 Chinese companies and 165 Pakistani companies were invited to participate, enabling business-to-business matchmaking between shortlisted firms from both sides. Pakistan also showcased investable projects, value chains and policy reforms. He added that Pakistan had already signed a protocol for milk products with China.
Documents revealed that the food security ministry plans to sign more than 25 sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and export protocols with key partners, including China, in 2026. Pakistan plans to introduce a new seed policy and a national agricultural biotechnology policy to create pathways for GMO seeds.
Proposals are under consideration to allow the export of pesticides and fertilisers under specific conditions, particularly targeting regional and African markets.
The participants of the conference were informed that Pakistan’s annual fruit production exceeds 10 million tonnes, while vegetable production stands at over 9m tonnes. With a rising population, domestic demand is growing at more than 5pc annually.

Speaking for more than an hour before taking questions from reporters, Trump said the UN had potential but added that he had never considered turning to the organisation to help resolve conflicts. Asked whether his envisioned Board of Peace could supplant the UN, he replied that it “might”.
Earlier in the day, Tru­mp released a list of what he described as major achi­e­vements from his first year back in office, highlighting what he portrayed as successes in both domestic and foreign policy.
Public opinion polls released around the same time showed growing voter dissatisfaction with the administration’s immigration policies.
Against that backdrop, the first 15 minutes of Trump’s appearance in the White House briefing room appeared aimed at reshaping public opinion. Holding a stack of printouts detailing immigrants with criminal records detained by US authorities in Minnesota — labelled “the worst of the worst” —the president sought to argue that his immigration policies were producing concrete results.

Presiding over the 22nd meeting of the provincial cabinet at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, Mr Bugti said that despite similar or higher numbers of such cases in other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the issue in Balochistan had been politically exploited for years without any serious effort to find a lasting solution.

 

The chief minister stressed that from Feb 1 onw­ards, no enforced disappearance would take place under the authority of the state or the government.
He maintained that the new legislation would help dispel allegations of enforced disappearances and counter negative propaganda directed at Pakistan. The chief minister said that security forces in Balochistan often operate in grey zones and conduct intelligence-based operations where suspects are detained for investigation. However, he added, the new legal framework would ensure transparency and accountability.

Balochistan cabinet okays detention rules, witness protection bill

Mr Bugti clarified that if individuals were abducted by terrorist groups or went into hiding on their own, the responsibility could not be attributed to the state. He noted that courts and relevant commissions already existed to examine claims of enforced disappearance, but allegations were often amplified without verification to fuel anti-state narratives.

 

To address this, the cabinet approved the rules for the Balochistan Prevention of Detention and De-radicalisation Act, 2025. Under the law, designated centres have been established where suspects will be investigated under the supervision of authorised police officers, along with counselling aimed at countering extremism and anti-state indoctrination.
Families of those under investigation will be informed within 24 hours, allowed visitation and provided medical facilities. No individual will be shifted outside these centres.
During the meeting, the provincial cabinet also approved the Balochistan Witness Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Mr Bugti said that in the past, the absence of an effective witness protection mechanism had led to extremely low conviction rates in terrorism and serious criminal cases. Under the new reforms, witnesses will testify through faceless courts, with their identities kept fully confidential, a measure expected to significantly improve convictions.
The cabinet expressed satisfaction over merit-based recruitments conducted through online testing in the Finance Department and decided to gradually digitalise recruitment processes across all provincial departments.
Among other decisions, the cabinet approved the abolition of the Religious Affairs Department, with staff to be adjusted in other departments, the creation of two new divisions (Pishin and Koh-i-Suleman), administrative realignment of Ziarat with Loralai, and the establishment of Municipal Committee Karbala in Pishin district.
The cabinet also approved policies related to the evaluation of law officers, amendments to grant-in-aid rules for minority affairs, measures to curb child labour, the declaration of higher technical education as an essential service and verification of academic credentials of contract teachers.
The chief minister directed the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team to initiate verification of degrees, warning that FIRs would be registered against holders of fake credentials, starting from Nasirabad and Dera Bugti.
Education-related decisions included adopting the national curriculum as part of the provincial syllabus from the academic year 2026-27, launching the Chief Minister Academic Excellence Programme and hiring ad-hoc teachers for mathematics, science and English at middle, high and higher secondary levels.
In the social sector, the cabinet approved the Balochistan Protection and Promotion of Reproductive Health Rights Bill, 2026, aimed at improving maternal and child health, expanding access to family planning services and safeguarding basic reproductive health rights.

The report, released on Tuesday, invited leaders to facilitate “honest, science-based adaptation to a new reality” amid chronic depletion of groundwater,  over-allocation of water, land and soil degradation, deforestation, and pollution — all compounded by global warming.
Titled “Global Water Bankruptcy: Living Beyond Our Hydrological Means in the Post-Crisis Era”, the report was produced by the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health. 
It noted that in many regions, water systems were already in a “post-crisis state of failure”.

Leaders urged to wake up to ‘new reality’ as the world is living beyond its ‘hydrological means’  

Over decades, societies have extracted more water than climate and hydrology can provide, drawing down not only the annual ‘income’ of renewable flows but also the ‘savings’ stored in aquifers, glaciers, soils, wetlands, and river ecosystems.  
At the same time, pollution, salination, and other forms of degradation have reduced the fraction of water that is safely usable, the latest UN report observed.
In the Middle East and North Africa, high water stress, climate vulnerability, low agricultural productivity, energy-intensive desalination, and sand and dust storms intersect with complex political economies. 
Decline in water table
In parts of South Asia, groundwater-dependent agriculture and urbanisation have produced chronic declines in water tables and subsidence; and in the American southwest, the Colorado River and its reservoirs have become symbols of “over-promised water”.
“The consequences of water bankruptcy are now visible on every continent: rivers no longer reach the sea; lakes, wetlands, and glaciers have shrunk or disappeared; aquifers pumped down until land subsides and salt intrudes; forests and peatlands are drying and burning; deserts and dust storms are expanding, and cities are repeatedly brought to the brink of ‘day zero’,” the UN study said.
Drawing on global datasets and recent scientific evidence, the report presented a stark statistical overview of trends, the overwhelming majority of which are caused by humans.

The UAE’s foreign ministry said it had accepted an invitation to join the board. It added that the country stood ready to contribute actively to the mission of the Board of Peace, supporting greater cooperation, stability, and prosperity for all, marking Abu Dhabi’s formal alignment with Washington’s new conflict-resolution effort.







Bahrain’s foreign ministry said it had accepted Trump’s invitation to the Board of Peace as a founding member.
Separately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed an agreement to join the Board of Peace.
A presidential Telegram channel published a video of Lukashenko signing the document, and quoted him as saying he hoped to contribute towards peace in Ukraine.







Trump had originally proposed establishing the Board when he announced his plan last September to end the conflict in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlines a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.
A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.
The inclusion of a ‘charter’ in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
The board would be chaired for life by Trump. Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board’s activities and earn permanent membership, the letter states.
“This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity,” the White House said in a post on X.







Meanwhile, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik told daily Aftenposten on Tuesday that Norway will not take part in the initiative the way the plan is currently presented.
The Norwegian foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Further, the United Kingdom said it was “concerned” that Trump invited his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to join the Board.
“We are concerned about reports that Putin and Lukashenko could be members of that board,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said, referring also to Putin’s ally, Belarusian President Lukashenko.
“Putin is the aggressor in an illegal war against Ukraine, and he has shown time and time again he is not serious about peace,” the spokesperson added.</p><small>2026-01-20 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/202225574be8784.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968018/death-toll-of-fire-at-karachis-gul-plaza-reaches-28' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll of fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza reaches 28</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A committee formed by the Sindh government to investigate the circumstances that led to the devastating fire at the Gul Plaza shopping mall initiated its probe on Tuesday as the death toll reached 28.
The Sindh chief secretary had formed the body on Monday, comprising Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi and the Karachi additional inspector general, directing that a report be submitted within seven days.
Sources told Dawn that the committee held its first meeting on Tuesday, led by the Karachi commissioner. They said the committee called officials from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Fire Brigade, Rescue 1122 and the owner of the mall and sought details from them.
Meanwhile, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that based on the KMC’s audit of various buildings, the SBCA had started to “take action”.
“A letter with a list of non-compliant buildings has been sent to the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad),” he said on X.
The SBCA letter attached with the post and addressed to the Abad chairman said that the KMC’s fire department had conducted a fire safety audit and identified owners/builders who had failed to meet safety requirements.
It called on the Abad chairman to direct its members to comply with the deficiencies highlighted within three days. “Immediate action is expected in the interest of public safety and the city at large, please,” the letter said.







The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Death toll reaches 28
On Tuesday, a large crowd was seen gathered at the scene, with law enforcement creating temporary barriers to prevent people from going toward the plaza. Smoke could still be seen emanating from the building’s rubble.
Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the death toll had reached 28. She said the dead also appeared to include five women. The police surgeon said that officials had conducted a post-mortem examination of “fragmentary human remains”.
She said that so far, a total of eight bodies had been identified. She said that doctors had collected 48 samples from relatives for DNA profiling and cross-matching.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that out of a total 75 missing persons, the locations of 38 were found to be at Gul Plaza through geo-fencing. He said the location of the remaining could not be confirmed.
He added that DNA samples were sent to the Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology laboratory at the University of Karachi’s International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences and they expected the process of cross-matching to continue for the next two to three days.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hasssanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that rescue workers had finally accessed the building’s basement, first and second floors, where both rescue and search operations were underway.
He asserted that the rescue operation would continue until the last missing person was recovered. The spokesperson said that a small portion of the nearby Rimpa Plaza high-rise was “partially” affected by the continuous exposure to heat.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by Keamari police said that the merchandise salvaged from the rubble was being shifted to the KMC Ground, adding that a contingent had been deployed to ensure security.

 


All Gul Plaza records available, SCBA maintains
The SBCA also rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”.
“The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”.
According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998.
“Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said.
“A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.”
The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.
It is worth noting that DIG Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire.
“The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body.
“The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.
Governor Tessori meets traders
Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met with traders to discuss the tragedy’s impact on the businesses housed in Gul Plaza. He was flanked by multiple business leaders, including Jawed Bilwani, former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).
Tessori thanked business tycoon Rafiq Pardesi, who he said called him to pledge his services for reconstructing Gul Plaza on a cost-to-cost basis, without any profit.
“We should not play the blame game. Once an incident has occurred, we must pay and compensate for it. We must bring forward those mistakes, but we all must console the traders’ community that has suffered,” the governor said.



While appreciating the Sindh government’s announcement of Rs10 million compensation for the families of the deceased, he underscored the need to take steps to prevent such incidents.
Tessori thanked the Pakistan Navy for sending their fire brigade “within 20 minutes, as well as the police for their efforts. He stressed the need to consult the president of the charred mall’s association and inquire about the management’s role.
“Those involved in such acts, the lower staff, the inspectors who take money for clearing these shops and ignoring safety measures — that money is payment for murder, not bribery,” the governor asserted, pointing out the lack of adherence to safety protocols.
Tessori said he listened to a phone call that a Baloch man made to his seven-months pregnant wife, who was inside the plaza and crying for help.
“Plazas can be reconstructed and everyone will get money. But we all should be afraid of the wails emanating from this city,” he said.
“We must learn lessons from this incident. If such a murderous plaza stands or is about to be built, we must prevent it,” he asserted. The governor noted that legislation stopping such buildings from being constructed existed but lacked implementation.
He called on the KCCI to form a committee to seek reports from the management of plazas, offices and other public spaces about potential safety hazards.
Tessori also said that he would write a joint letter with the Saylani chief to the Karachi mayor proposing that all traders from Gul Plaza be immediately moved to an abandoned parking plaza near Empress Market to return to work.
Meanwhile, Bilwani thanked Tessori and noted that he was the “first” official to reach the site.
He recalled that when the blaze erupted, he urged people to help each other instead of questioning who or what caused the fire. “Karachi’s people are at the forefront in such things [to help others].”
The businessman said he also told CM Murad that traders will prioritise helping those in need after the fire incident instead of blaming others for it.
KP CM conveys condolences to Murad Shah
Meanwhile, in a letter to Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday, his Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counterpart Sohail Afridi conveyed his “heartfelt condolences” over the fire incident.
Stating that he was “deeply saddened” by the incident, the KP CM noted that the blaze “led to the loss of precious lives and caused immense distress to many families”.
“My thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this hour of grief, and I sincerely hope for the swift recovery of those who were injured,” the chief minister wrote.
CM Afridi added, “I also wish to convey my sympathies to the Government of Sindh which is confronted with the difficult task of responding to the aftermath of this tragedy.
“At moments like these, the sorrow of one province is felt by the entire nation, and the people and Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stand with the people and Government of Sindh in solidarity and compassion.”







The KP CM’s letter comes after his visit to Karachi earlier this month, when he was accorded a warm welcome by the Sindh government, but the journey ended with him decrying the “treatment” meted out to him by the provincial administration.
During the visit, a meeting with CM Murad was on CM Afridi’s agenda but it did not take place, with both sides placing the fault on the other.
‘65 people remain missing’
On Monday, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Mayor Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing.
“Others are saying there are 77 missing, but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies, but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said.
He said that firefighting operations had concluded, and cooling work was ongoing.
“We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said.
The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received, but when rescuers accessed those areas, there were no signs of life. He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution.
He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged that need to be investigated for negligence,” Wahab said.
The provincial government has set up an inquiry committee, led by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, to probe the causes of the fire.
CM Murad on Monday had announced a relief, inquiry and fire-safety reform package, saying the government would support both bereaved families and affected shopkeepers.
The chief minister said the family of each deceased victim would receive Rs10 million in compensation. He also promised assistance for the shopkeepers, saying a special committee had been constituted to help those affected.</p><small>2026-01-20 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20230831add93e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968025/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-davos-for-world-economic-forum' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Davos for World Economic Forum</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday arrived in Davos, Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF).
In a post on X, PM Shehbaz wrote that he arrived to advance Pakistan’s engagement at the WEF with global trade and investment partners.
A video included with the post showed him disembarking from his plane, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.
“Pakistan’s ongoing economic reform journey is unlocking profound opportunities, driven by a resilient and entrepreneurial workforce and significant potential across energy, agriculture, minerals, and emerging technologies,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that Pakistan was “ready to harness this potential into mutually beneficial economic cooperation and long-term investment”.







A separate post from the Foreign Office (FO) said that Dar, in addition to participating in WEF sessions, would also hold “sideline bilateral meetings with counterparts to advance Pakistan’s diplomatic and economic priorities”.







Meanwhile, the information minister said that PM Shehbaz had been invited to the WEF to “interact with world leaders and global CEOs”.
“This will be beneficial for Pakistan’s ongoing economic reform programme. Pakistan’s standing in the comity of nations is further strengthened by the resilience of its people and the potential for growth,” he said on X.







Earlier in the day, the FO said the annual WEF meeting would be held from January 20-22.
The statement added that the prime minister’s programme included “multiple substantive engagements”, including participation in the WEF’s Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders (IGWEL) session on “Restoring a Spirit of Dialogue in a Divided World”.
It added that the prime minister would also host and chair a Pakistan-specific “High-level Business Roundtable” with different corporate leaders.







“On the sidelines, the prime minister is expected to interact with several world leaders, including business executives,” it said.
“Articulating Pakistan’s perspective on global and regional peace and development and highlighting the government’s vision and achievements in the areas of economy, trade and investment opportunities will be part of the prime minister’s key messages during the visit,” the statement added.
According to the FO statement, the WEF Annual Meeting brings together political leaders, business executives, heads of international organisations and civil society representatives. It deliberates on contemporary geopolitical, economic, social and environmental issues.</p><small>2026-01-20 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/202158559eccb6a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968033/senate-opposition-leader-abbas-expresses-solidarity-with-imaan-hadi-says-dissent-has-been-made-a-crime' target='_blank'><strong>Senate opposition leader Abbas expresses solidarity with Imaan, Hadi; says dissent has been made a crime</strong></a><br><p>Hours after he was notified as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas met lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chattha, expressing solidarity with them and ruing that “dissent has been made a crime” in the country.
The meeting took place at the office of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president, following which a statement on Abbas’s X account detailed his media talk after his interaction with the lawyers.







The post quoted him as saying that Pakistan was currently going through a “severe crisis”.
“Unfortunately, the country seems to be heading in a direction where fundamental rights of people, constitutional guarantees and human dignity are being continuously violated. The real tragedy is that those who have the power and authority are the ones ruthlessly crushing the state’s soft power.
“Today, civil society, lawyers, human rights organisations and every other voice that raises awareness and questions is being pressurised in the country. Dissent has been made a crime and anyone who dares to speak up has to face imprisonment, cases and violence. The Constitution of Pakistan gives the people the right to choose their rulers, but here public decisions are trampled and elections are stolen,” Abbas was quoted as saying.
He said the people of Pakistan had several grievances and reiterated that the country was mired in political, economic and social crisis.
“When people are deprived of justice, they approach the court. But unfortunately, they often face disappointment there as well,” he added.
Abbas further stated that the “wounds of people of Balochistan are still fresh”.
“But instead of dialogue, rapprochement and political wisdom, force and operations were chosen as the first options for the resolution of issues there. Even though surgery should always be the last resort,” he continued.
“The question remains that after decades of ongoing operations, which issue has been resolved,” he said, adding that when injustice becomes common, countries start disintegrating.
He said the rulers need to “have mercy on Pakistan and should not further harm its international standing because they will not be able to contain the destruction that they are unleashing today”.
Abbas said millions of people in the country could not even afford two meals a day. And “if someone raises their voice against this, should they be responded to with bullets, batons and cases? Those who are not getting their rights and justice, where should they go?”
The Senate opposition leader said Mazari and Chattha were the voices of the oppressed. “They have the spirit of freedom, and the rulers are truly wise, they should promote awareness and liberty among the youth rather than trying to silence every free voice with bullets and imprisonment”.
“These young people raise their voices against cruelty and that is why they are being targeted,” he added.
He said that a first information report was being registered against Mazari “after six months”, in which she was accused of beating policemen. Abbas alleged that the intent behind this was to put Mazari behind bars at any cost.
“This conduct is not just blatant oppression but is also extremely damaging for the judiciary’s dignity. When people are disappointed by courts, they are compelled to strive to get justice for themselves on their own. This is a dangerous situation for any state,” he added.
“You cannot suppress truth by putting someone in jail. These voices grow stronger and more wide-reaching if they are held captive for days or even months,” he said.
“I sincerely advise the rulers to refrain from such oppressive actions, because Pakistan no longer has the capacity to bear any more,” he said.
In his remarks to the media, he criticised what he described as a broader crisis of justice in the country, stating that people approach courts in the hope of relief but were instead subjected to repression.
Terming the proceedings against Imaan and Hadi a grave injustice, he warned that such actions would furtther erode public confidence in the judiciary.
He added that accountability must not turn into revenge and emphasised that the constitution guarantees citizens the right to life, liberty, and freedom of expression.
Separately, a case registered against Imaan and Hadi in July 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday pertaining to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Council. The two subsequently filed pre-arrest bail applications which could not be heard on an urgent basis as the couple struggled to avoid arrest.
IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani later took the two to his office and assured them of complete safety, stating that no arrest would take place from within the bar premises. He further informed them that their pleas would be scheduled later in accordance with the court’s roster.
The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, while a large number of police officials, including a female station house officer remained outside the premises.
IHC reinstates bail, right to defence for Imaan, Hadi in social media posts case
Separately, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday reinstated the bail of Imaan and Hadi in the controversial social media posts case, after it was cancelled by a sessions court on January 15.
In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production.
During today’s hearing, the IHC judge reinstated the bail from earlier, suspending the arrest warrant issued by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka.
He further directed them to complete the cross-examination in three days and reinstated their right to defence.
At this, the couple’s legal counsel, Kamran Murtaza, requested the court to grant one week. “I will look into it. You should proceed with the trial,” the judge remarked.</p><small>2026-01-20 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20201227afe5e80.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968057/time-to-call-it-a-day-shoaib-malik-announces-retirement-from-psl' target='_blank'><strong>‘Time to call it a day’: Shoaib Malik announces retirement from PSL</strong></a><br><p>Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik on Tuesday announced his retirement from Pakistan Super League (PSL).

“My passion and motivation to serve for the betterment of cricket will always stay. Thank you, PSL,” he said.







Last year in May, Malik had announced his resignation from the role of Domestic Cricket Mentor, saying he believed it was “time to move on” to ensure fairness and pay attention to multiple personal and professional responsibilities in his life.
During his PSL career, he represented Karachi Kings, Multan Sultans, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators, playing a total of 93 matches and scoring a total of 2350 runs, according to ESPN Cricinfo.</p><small>2026-01-20 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2019243722c55a7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968055/flash-flood-warning-issued-for-kabul-river-from-jan-22-23-amid-rain-snowfall-in-upper-parts-of-country' target='_blank'><strong>Flash flood warning issued for Kabul River from Jan 22-23 amid rain, snowfall in upper parts of country</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) has issued a flash flood warning for the Kabul River and its tributaries for January 22 and 23, with the possibility of upper parts of the country getting affected
In its alert on Tuesday, the FFC said a “strong westerly wave is likely to affect the upper parts of the country from the evening of January 21 to January 24, 2026. Consequently, flows in River Kabul, along with its associated tributaries, may rise from January 22 to January 23, 2026”.
The alert said that  “on account of expected moderate to isolated heavy rainfall coupled with snowfall over the upper parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Swat, Chitral, Buner, Shangla, Lower and Upper Dir, Malakand, Bajaur, Chitral, Mardan, Swabi, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, Haripur, Kolai-Palas and Kohistan) and Kashmir, the risk of flash flooding cannot be ruled out”.
In view of the situation, all organisations concerned, particularly the Provincial Disaster Management Authority in KP, relevant district administrations and KP Irrigation Department’s field formations are  advised to “remain alert and ensure all necessary precautionary measures well in time to avoid any loss of precious human lives and damages to private and public property, besides the irrigation and flood protection infrastructure”.
According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), flash floods “begin within six hours, and often within three hours, of heavy rainfall”.
“A flash flood is generally characterised by raging torrents after heavy rains, a dam or levee failure or a sudden release of water in a previously stopped passage that rips through riverbeds, urban streets, or mountain canyons, sweeping away everything in its path,” the UNDRR’s website states.</p><small>2026-01-20 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20192918c64355a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968056/pakistan-extends-airspace-ban-for-indian-aircraft-until-february-24' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace ban for Indian aircraft until February 24</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority has extended the airspace ban for Indian aircraft until February 24 for another month, according to a Notam (notice to airmen) issued on Tuesday.
The extension in the ban has been notified just three days before the restriction, last extended on December 17, was set to expire on January 23.
India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.
According to the latest Notam, Pakistan’s airspace will remain closed for India-registered aircraft until 5am on February 24, extending the restriction that is already in place.
The restriction applies to all India-registered aircraft as well as any aircraft operated, owned, or leased by Indian airlines or operators, including military flights.
The airspace closure applies from ground level up to unlimited altitude.
Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022.

The senator made the remarks during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, where he said: “All of Pakistani nationals’ data is on the dark web. And it is the latest data.
“And it is such good data that we might not have such well-processed data. For example, they have consolidated data from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and banks into a dataset,” he said.
“And you can get anyone’s data for Rs500, and if you want that of the entire country, you will get it for Rs70-80 billion. Data worth Rs70-80bn is [available] on the dark web,” the senator said.
He pointed out that when the data of any individual was stolen, it could be used for any purpose, including obtaining passports and identity cards for others.
“Why is Pakistanis’ data stolen time and again?” he asked.
Addressing Immigration and Passports Director General Mustafa Jamal Kazi, he added: “Let me tell you one thing; without the [involvement of] people inside the organisation, data theft at such a large scale is not possible. It is impossible. The data of 240 million people cannot be stolen just like that.”
Later, speaking to Dawn, the PML-N senator asserted that this data could not have been leaked without the involvement of officials in the Nadra and Immigration and Passports Directorate General.
In the meeting, Committee Chairperson and PTI Senator Faisal Saleem Rahman had asked Kazi whether any investigation had been carried out in this regard.
Kazi responded that a probe had been conducted and officials had also been removed.
Senator Rahman also stressed the need for ensuring the protection of law enforcement bodies’ data. “Who will be responsible if their data is leaked?” he said.
Proposal to ban social media platforms
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry also attended the meeting, where he raised the issue of the use of social media by terrorists.
“Previously, terrorists used guns. Now, they are using social media,” he said, adding that social media companies would not even share the Internet Protocol addresses of users operating accounts being used for terrorism.
Speaking on the matter, Senator Rahman suggested that the government should enter into a contract with social media platforms. He further advised that platforms that did not cooperate with the government should be banned.
PPP Senator Palwasha Khan endorsed these views, saying: “A ban should definitely be imposed.”
Senator Rahman further pointed out that China had its own social media platforms and said, “There is no need to employ the services of those [companies] that are not cooperating.”
Chaudhry responded to the suggestion, saying: “This is a big decision, you can take it. If we take it, it will be called an attack on the freedom of expression.”</p><small>2026-01-20 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20174351a46fad1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968051/diplomatic-row-between-india-and-poland-after-jaishankar-criticises-ministers-visit-to-pakistan-report' target='_blank'><strong>Diplomatic row between India and Poland after Jaishankar criticises minister’s visit to Pakistan: report</strong></a><br><p>A diplomatic row has erupted between New Delhi and Warsaw after Indian Foreign Minister Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar took aim at Polish Deputy Prime Minister Radoslaw Sikorski’s recent visit to Pakistan, Indian media reported.
According to The Hindu, the visit by the Polish minister was the first since Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Warsaw in August 2024, from where he travelled to Ukraine as well.
The report added that Jaishankar, in televised remarks, said he wanted to discuss Sikorski’s “recent travels to the region”, calling it a direct reference to the Polish minister’s visit to Pakistan in October last year.
During Sikorski’s two-day visit to Islamabad, Pakistan and Poland had agreed to deepen their political and economic ties during talks in Islamabad, with both countries pledging to transform their relationship into what they called a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership”.
The Hindu reported that during the meeting between Jaishankar and Sikorski, the former said, “Poland should display zero tolerance for terrorism and not help fuel the terrorist infrastructure in our neighbourhood.”
According to the report, this was a “direct reference to the Polish FM’s visit to Pakistan in October 2025, where he had met Pakistan’s top leadership”.







The report further quoted Jaishankar as saying that Sikorski, a former journalist who covered Afghanistan in the 1980s, was “no stranger to the region” and would be “certainly familiar with the longstanding challenge of cross-border terrorism”.
The Indian minister also took exception to the Polish minister’s previous comments about Delhi’s import of Russian oil; the report noted that Sikorski had stated in Paris earlier this month that he was “satisfied” by India’s reduction of Russian oil imports “because this is financing the war machine of Putin”.
“I have repeatedly underlined that the selective targeting of India is both unfair and unjustified. I do so again today,” Jaishankar told Sikorski, according to The Hindu.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting at Hyderabad House, Sikorski said that while the two sides agreed on concerns over terrorism, India’s participation in “Zapad 2025” military exercises in Russia and Belarus was seen as “threatening”, the report said.
India had taken part in Russia’s Zapad (West) joint drills with Belarus in September 2025, part of which took place close to Nato borders.
“We all have regional concerns and we all have neighbours, and with neighbours you have opportunities and challenges,” Sikorski was quoted as saying, adding that India and Poland were of “one mind” as far as terrorism was concerned.
“We also have concerns. India took part in the Zapad exercises in Russia that we find threatening,” Sikorski was quoted as saying.

US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Saturday on imports from European allies that oppose the United States taking over Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark.
European countries say new tariffs would violate a trade deal reached with Trump last year, and EU leaders are set to discuss possible retaliation at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday.
One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension.
Bessent said the issue had only recently emerged and a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe.
“It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” Bessent told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
“I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.”
Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the United States and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.”
Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.
Bessent dismissed the possibility that the EU would for the first time tap its Anti-Coercion Instrument, a powerful trade measure which could limit US access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services.
“Well, having worked with the Europeans, my guess is their next move will be to form a working group, the dreaded ‘European working group’,” Bessent said in an interview with CNBC.
“We’ve seen a lot of working groups.”
In his earlier briefing, Bessent also dismissed market speculation that European governments might sell US Treasury bonds they own as reserves, making it more expensive for the US government to finance itself.
“(US government debt) is the most liquid market, it is the basis for all financial transactions and I am sure that the European governments will continue holding it,” Bessent said.</p><small>2026-01-20 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/201351035068c0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968040/na-echoes-with-calls-for-empowering-local-govts-following-deadly-fire-at-karachis-gul-plaza' target='_blank'><strong>NA echoes with calls for empowering local govts following deadly fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly on Tuesday echoed with calls for empowering local governments (LGs) as lawmakers stressed the need for reforms in the wake of the Gul Plaza fire.
Besides members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city administration.
Speaking on the floor of the NA today, MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units” for better governance and strengthening local government systems.
“Such a huge burden can not be shouldered by a chief minister alone,” he said. “These powers should instead be handed over to the mayor, town chairman, UC (union council) chairman”.
He recalled that MQM-P had also advocated for the inclusion of a clause aimed at strengthening local government bodies in a probable 28th Constitutional Amendment.
“Creating an administrative unit is not the division of geography; it is an administrative division, a division of justice and resources,” Sattar maintained.
He assailed the Sindh government for its “inaction, apathy, and corruption spanning over two decades”, which he said led to the Gul Plaza inferno.
The fire, which erupted at the Karachi shopping centre on Saturday night, has left at least 23 dead, with over 60 reported missing. A search operation was underway on Tuesday, with rescue teams scouring through the rubble after parts of the building collapsed as the fire had raged on for over 24 hours.
Urging people not to politicise the issue of LGs, the MNA asserted that it was “the right of the people of Karachi to question the Sindh government as well as the Centre over where exactly Karachi lies on their list of priorities”.
Sattar claimed that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah arrived at the site of the incident “22 hours” after the fire broke out. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also arrived late, he said.
“This shows how apathetic they are,” he added.
“For the past 18 years, the [provincial] government has been led by one party, which does not hold Karachi’s mandate but that of the rest of Sindh, so how are they allowed to dictate the fate of Karachi?” Sattar said.
“What kind of democracy is this?”
Criticising authorities in Sindh, Sattar said: “Someone will have to take responsibility and ask for forgiveness from the people for their inaction. Three years of their mayorship […] they are building futsal and padel grounds.”
He held that Karachi remained “undercounted, underrepresented, and underfunded”. The MQM leader further said that the city’s firefighting capability and resources were not in accordance with its size.
He called on the Sindh government to “take ownership of Karachi” and further requested that the “there should be a consensus that this (Gul Plaza fire) is a national tragedy”.
The MQM leader said, “This fire was not only in Gul Plaza but in the hearts of the people of Karachi as well”.
Sattar also paid tribute to the firefighter Furqan Ali, who lost his life while battling the deadly blaze.
Give representation in neighbourhoods: Asif
Across party lines, lawmakers stressed that coordinated action by federal and provincial governments was essential to ensure that such tragedies were not repeated, and that public safety must be strengthened through enforceable laws and effective urban governance rather than temporary expressions of grief.
Defence Minister Asif, speaking during the session, echoed Sattar’s proposal, stating that it is “not humanly possible to manage Karachi in its present structure”.
“If we want to empower the people in a true sense, we will have to bring in the local government system,” Asif said.
He stressed that due to the 18th Amendment, all powers regarding administration had been assigned to the provincial government.
“If there is any local government, they do not have any powers,” he added.
The minister recalled that in the 27th Amendment, “we proposed that there should be a system for local government … but the clause was withdrawn”.
“If we truly want to represent the people of Pakistan, then provide them representation in their own neighbourhoods,” the minister said.
He held that, “if local government systems are not strengthened, then the defence ministry, the navy and the aviation will be doing your work for you”.
He claimed that “local government elections were not even allowed to be held”.
He maintained that this was done so that the “power could not be transferred to the grassroots level”.
He went on to say, “This incident and the subsequent collapse of the fire brigade system are a clear signal that the country needs a system — across tehsils, neighbourhoods, and provinces — where people feel empowered and can hold their representatives accountable.”
‘Sindh only province with functional LGs’
On the other hand, PPP leader Shehla Raza clarified: “There is an impression being made that there is no local government system in Sindh.
“[But] Sindh is the only province where local government systems are working.”
She also objected to the claims made by MQM-P’s Sattar, stating that “it is not necessary for ministers to show up when such an incident happens”.
Rather, she maintained, it was more important to handle the situation.
“At 10:26pm, the incident was reported, and one fire vehicle each from Central Fire Station and the Saddar Fire Station was dispatched,” she said.
Raza continued: “Around 10:45pm, the first responders informed the chief fire officer of the scale of the fire and that more fire tenders should be sent”.
“Sixteen fire tenders, four snorkels, and two water bowsers were sent,” the PPP lawmaker said.
She admitted that there was a delay due to traffic in the area.
“I am not defending anything, but such fires have been reported before in states like California as well,” she said.</p><small>2026-01-20 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2016195050cccae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968027/pti-nominated-mwm-chief-raja-nasir-abbas-appointed-senate-opposition-leader-after-months-long-delay' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-nominated MWM chief Raja Nasir Abbas appointed Senate opposition leader after months-long delay</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was appointed as the opposition leader in the Senate on Tuesday.
Abbas — vice chairman of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — had been chosen by PTI founder Imran Khan as the opposition’s choice for the seat, which had been vacant since August 2025.
“In pursuance of sub-rule (3) of Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, the chairman Senate has been pleased to declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as leader of the opposition in the Senate, with immediate effect,” said a notification issued by the Senate Secretariat.







Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani also announced Abbas’s appointment as the opposition leader during Tuesday’s session in the House.
As the proceedings began, he said: “I want to give a ruling. Before proceeding further, I consider it necessary to place on record the legal and procedural background relating to the declaration of the leader of the opposition in the Senate.
“Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 mandates that the chairman Senate should declare as leader of the opposition the member who commands the support of the majority of the members in opposition.
“Following the disqualification of former senator Syed Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification dated August 5, 2025 and the consequential notification of the Senate Secretariat dated August 8, 2025, the office of the leader of the opposition stood vacated.
“The said notifications were challenged before the honourable Peshawar High Court, which issued restraining orders prohibiting further action in the matter. In view of the pendency of judicial proceedings, the matter remained under consideration of the Senate Secretariat for legal examination and procedural guidance, in accordance with the established parliamentary practice and constitutional discipline so as to ensure that no step was taken which might conflict with or render infructuous the proceedings before the honourable court.”
Gilani explained that the “earlier deferment [of the appointment] was therefore procedural, occasioned by institutional prudence, due deference to judicial authority and rule of law”.
He further stated: “There being no legal bar, I now proceed in accordance with Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012 and hereby declare Senator Raja Nasir Abbas as the leader of the opposition in the Senate …”
At this point, Gilani was interrupted by the thumping of desks and slogans in favour of incarcerated ex-premier Imran.
Meanwhile, Gilani continued: “… Having secured the support of 22 members out of 32 members on the opposition benches. The secretary is directed to issue a formal notification accordingly right now.”
He then requested parliamentary leaders in the House to “assist the opposition leader on his seat”, following which Abbas rose and changed his seat amid applause, shaking hands with several senators on his way.
Later, before giving the floor to Senator Abbas, Gilani congratulated him for becoming the opposition leader.
Abbas’s maiden address as opposition leader
In his maiden address in the House as the opposition leader, Abbas credited Imran for “making me a senator”.
He asserted that he was “his (Imran) loyal companion, will never compromise on principles” and never violate his oath taken as a senator.
Abbas also expressed his commitment to making all-possible efforts and playing his role to ensure the security, betterment and national interest of the country.







He thanked treasury members for showing him respect and welcoming him. “It was a good gesture,” he said, adding that “we will try that this Senate play a role in addressing the difficulties of the people” and that legislation benefits the people.
The opposition leader then went on to elaborate on the significance of the Constitution, highlighting that it was a social contract with the people and represented people’s views and expectations.
“Laws are made in light of the Constitution, and under those laws, institutions and pillars of the state are established .”
He added that under the Constitution, it had been established that the three pillars of the state — ostensibly a reference to the legislature, judiciary and executive — would not interfere in each other’s affairs.
“The Constitution is sacred,” he remarked, adding that when laws are not respected, society “becomes a jungle”.
Abbas continued: “Presently, Pakistan is facing various difficulties. One among them is lawlessness.”
The senator said it was the government’s and the rulers’ job to ensure law and justice, adding that people also had a role to play in this regard.
But, he continued, people no longer “trust our system as there is no law and justice. Look at what has become of the judiciary. People are losing confidence in Parliament and they no longer trust the executive as well. The people of Pakistan do not trust this system”.
Abbas stressed that whenever a government loses the trust of the people, it loses its “soft and national power” as well. “And national power or soft power is not acquired through bullets, tanks or jets. […] That is why it is impossible to keep people united when there is no rule of law, justice and supremacy of the Constitution.”
He went on to say that the consequences of injustice were visible in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Is it not injustice to displace people just to find a few terrorists? Had you taken the people’s help, the terrorists might not have been able to enter that region. How can you eradicate terrorism and restore peace without the support of the local people? How will there be peace if people do not get justice?”
This part of Abbas’s speech seemed to be a reference to the displacement of residents from KP’s Tirah for a military operation against terrorists.
The opposition leader also emphasised that it was the House’s responsibility to stand up for ensuring justice.
He also stressed the need for ending the political crisis in the country, adding that economic difficulties and law and order problems also could not be resolved until the political crisis was brought to an end.
The senator said the political crisis originated from what happened on February 8, 2024 — the day when general elections, which the opposition alleges were rigged, were held in the country.
He also alleged that TTAP members were subjected to violence when they recently visited Punjab.
“What law is this? Did we have weapons? We were peaceful,” he said, adding, “Why is this happening? Why is there lawlessness? Will we be able to run the system by suppressing, pressuring and harassing people? […] Let people speak. […] If people protest within the limits of the law and Constitution, it makes the country more powerful.”
He then said that the only solution to the ongoing political crisis was to release Imran from jail, claiming that progress on cases against Imran had been stalled.
“The country cannot progress if you keep a popular leader in jail,” he asserted, claiming that he had the support of 90 per cent people in the country.
He further called for the Senate to speak up for the release of “political prisoners”.
“We want these innocent people to be released from jail so that political instability in Pakistan ends.”
Moreover, he said under the Constitution, only those had the right to rule the country who were voted into power by the people, not those who were rejected by the people.
“Today, Imran Khan is a popular leader. The presence of a popular is necessary today for nation-building,” he said, adding that he could sacrifice his life for the country but would also impede any efforts to harm the country.
The senator then mentioned that ruling the country was only politicians’ job, recalling that some from the establishment had said that they had nothing to do with politics. “Can we swear about this on the Holy Quran?” he questioned, adding that “we all will salute” the army if it operated within its domain.







Addressing treasury members, particularly PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, he said let’s steer the country towards a better political situation. “May no one have to face the injustice that Imran Khan is facing. The case against you was unjust, and you know who is behind those cases. When will we stop them? […] Politicians have built this country with the support of the people. Under the Constitution and law, only politicians have the right to run this country,” he said.
He stressed the importance of collective wisdom in Parliament and called for progress on cases against Imran. Moreover, he said Pakistan should take a stand against US President Donald Trump over his threats to Iran.
“We should call a session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation […] we should call a session of neighbouring and other countries and decide that no one will be allowed to attack any country in this region.”







Speaking after Abbas, Sanaullah addressed the House and began his speech by congratulating the new opposition leader.
He said Abbas had expressed “balanced and positive views” and even chose suitable words to express his disagreement on various issues. The PML-N leader said he expected that this practice would continue in the future as well.
Responding to Abbas’s remarks regarding February 8, 2024 elections, he recalled that allegations of electoral rigging at also surfaced in relation to 2018 elections, following which the PTI had come to power.
Sanaullah said neither could the opposition walk back on its allegations regarding the 2024 elections nor could it agree to the then-opposition’s stance on the 2018 elections.
“Then why don’t we agree that electoral [exercises] in Pakistan could not be fully trusted? … And if we agree on this, then we should sit together, ponder over these matters and make the [electoral] system better. […] We can talk about electoral rules. We can talk about the election commission,” he suggested.
Moreover, Sanaullah said he agreed with Abbas that politicians should be involved in politics, “that politicians should sit together and politicians should resolve political issues in a political manner”.
In this connection, he also mentioned the Charter of Democracy signed by former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto in 2006. But then, he continued while referring to Imran, “who began harping that he will not spare anyone?”
Sanaullah further questioned: “Does the establishment carry out long marches against politicians? Does the establishment stage months-long sit-ins against politicians?”
Concluding his speech, he stressed the need for dialogue between the opposition and government, saying that solutions to problems would only come through talks and Parliament.
Months-long delay
The opposition leader’s slot in the Senate had been lying vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of the then-opposition leader, PTI’s Shibli Faraz. At the same time, PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the opposition leader in the National Assembly (NA) back then, was also disqualified.
The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023, riots.
The PTI had then nominated in October last year Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot.
On Monday, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said Gilani had informed him that Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by Tuesday (today).
Zafar had submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas. In a post on X, Zafar had said that he also had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader.
