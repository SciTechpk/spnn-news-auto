The development comes a day after a request for an ‘urgent’ meeting — submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa — was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for Tuesday (today).
The two-member bench resumed the hearing today, during which CJP Afridi appointed Safdar as “friend of the court”, with the court directing him to visit Adiala jail today and submit a written report regarding Imran’s living conditions by tomorrow.
PTI counsel Latif Khosa and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, CJP Afridi barred Khosa from speaking, while AGP Awan said that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of August 24, 2023”.
In 2023, SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Imran’s “living conditions in jail”.
He informed the court that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order.
“We had submitted a written report to the chamber on August 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report from August 5 to August 18 was also included.
In response to this, CJP Afridi said, “After the August 24, 2023 order, there has not been any order on record which was satisfactory to the SC”.
In the court order, available with Dawn, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the former premier was imprisoned in the District jail, Attock, in 2023.
Hence, it maintained that the court “considered appropriate that a report regarding the present ‘living conditions of the petitioner in jail’ be submitted by the Superintendent, Central Prison, Rawalpindi.”
Subsequently, the court appointed Safdar as amicus curiae.
“Salman Safdar should go to Adiala as a friend of the court,” CJP Afridi said.
“We have full faith in Salman Safdar,” he further remarked.
“He should be given full access to the PTI founder so he may be able to file a written response,” he added.
Justice Afridi directed that Safdar should “not be kept waiting outside Adiala”, assuring him that in case he encounters any issues, the CJP’s personal staff will be available.
Safdar, addressing the court, asked “if the scope of the report was limited to living conditions only”, citing concerns regarding Imran’s health in light of a recent medical procedure.
“Submit a report of the living conditions only,” CJP Afridi responded.
AGP Awan also requested the court to “include in the order that a report had already been submitted”.
Towards the end of the hearing, Khosa took the rostrum again, seeking that his request to meet Imran be accepted as well. However, the request was again rejected.
The court then adjourned the hearing till February 12.
Raja terms conversation with court as ‘beneficial’
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja recalled his meeting with the chief justice last Friday, adding that Imran’s incarceration and health came under discussion.
He termed the conversation with the court as “beneficial” and that progress had been made as a result of it.
However, the PTI leader clarified, “We are not declaring anything as final. We are not saying everything is good [and] we have gotten everything. This is not the case.”
Raja said the lawyers will head to the Adiala jail today to meet Imran.
“We will see what demeanour is adopted towards us,” he said.
The PTI leader called for the “system to […] return to humanity”. “It is humanity and piousness that we are demanding right now,” he stated.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
According to a two-page memorandum filed by PTI last week to the SC registrar, the party had requested immediate jail visitation rights for Imran with his family, doctors, lawyers and friends.
In the memorandum, it was alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.</p><small>2026-02-10 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1013164662c7d7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-from-exile-to-edge-of-power' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman: From exile to edge of power</strong></a><br><p>Less than two months after returning from nearly two decades of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman could win one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.
If opinion polls hold, Thursday’s election would mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the soft-spoken 60-year-old, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his release from detention under a military-backed caretaker administration. He had been held after a crackdown on corruption.

He returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas after a youth-driven uprising uprooted his Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s arch-enemy, long-time premier Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, in August 2024.
Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.
Rahman has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.

Events have unfolded so quickly since Rahman landed in Dhaka with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter that he said he has scarcely had time to reflect.
“I don’t know how we have passed every minute since we landed,” Rahman said on the sidelines of an interview with Reuters in his party office, flanked by his daughter Zaima, who has been trying to drum up support for her father.

Image makeover
The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agricultural products.
Since his return, Rahman has tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina. Gone is the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister. Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.
“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”

Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many.
He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.
From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappearing, and offices shuttered.

Since returning, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring people’s ownership of the state and rebuilding institutions — a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.
Further helping to soften his image, the family’s fluffy Siberian cat, Jebu, has gone viral on social media.
“She’s 7. She’s half Siberian. We adopted her,” Rahman’s daughter Zaima told Reuters.
Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders say he is directly overseeing candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.
He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.
“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”</p><small>2026-02-10 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101240240ad867c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
According to an ISPR statement, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.
Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.







Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.
“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.
ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.
The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.
“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.
It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.
This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.
Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.
The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.
“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.
Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.
He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10133726b5437a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972262/sindh-govt-notifies-single-judge-commission-to-investigate-gul-plaza-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt notifies single-judge commission to investigate Gul Plaza inferno</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Tuesday formally notified a single-member commission formed to further investigate the cause, among other things, of the deadly Gul Plaza inferno.
While the government had issued a notification appointing Justice Agha Faisal — who was nominated by the Sindh High Court (SHC) — as the judge for the task on February 4, the notification was officially published in the provincial Gazette today.
“The Commission of Inquiry will complete the inquiry within eight (08) weeks,” read the notification.
The office of Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi would provide secretariat support to the commission, it added.
It should be mentioned that the Sindh government had announced it would approach the SHC chief justice for a judicial inquiry into the fire, which took nearly two days to be fully extinguished and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
As outlined in the Home Department’s notification earlier, the commission’s terms of reference (TORs) include assessing “if the construction of Gul Plaza was in violation of the approved building plan, leading to difficulty in evacuation of people”.
The SHC judge was also expected to examine whether building approvals and lease extensions from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), its predecessor organisations and the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) were granted in accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations.

“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”

 


The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.
The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge JF-17 Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.
“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.

 

“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.
“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”
According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.
The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.
Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.
Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10124939ce0509e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972250/pakistans-ranking-in-global-corruption-perceptions-index-edges-up-score-rises-to-28' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s ranking in global corruption perceptions index edges up; score rises to 28</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2025 improved by one point, moving from 135 out of 180 countries in 2024 to 136 out of 182 countries in 2025.
At the same time, the country’s CPI score increased by one point, from 27 in 2024 to 28 in 2025, according to Transparency International’s report published on Tuesday.
While Pakistan is undertaking commendable efforts in governance and institutional reforms, it is imperative that the recommendations of the IMF Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment are implemented effectively. This is essential to sustain Pakistan’s upward momentum in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in the coming years, said the Chair of Transparency International Pakistan, Justice Zia Perwez.
The Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) notes that corruption is worsening globally, with even established democracies experiencing rising corruption amid a decline in leadership.
The 2025 index shows that the number of countries scoring above 80 has shrunk from 12 a decade ago to just five this year.

 

The score has changed since 2012: 31 countries improved, 50 countries declined, while 100 countries stayed the same.
This year’s CPI ranks 182 countries and territories according to the levels of public-sector corruption perceived by experts and business people.
Chair of Transparency International, Francois Velerian, said: “Corruption is not inevitable. Our research and experience as a global movement fighting corruption show there is a clear blueprint for how to hold power to account for the common good, from democratic processes and independent oversight to a free and open civil society.”
“At a time when we’re seeing a dangerous disregard for international norms from some states, we’re calling on governments and leaders to act with integrity and live up to their responsibilities to provide a better future for people around the world.”
The highest-ranked nation was Denmark, for the eighth time in a row, with a score of 89. Only a small group of 15 countries, mainly in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific, managed to get scores above 75. Of these, just five reached scores above 80.
Meanwhile, over two-thirds of countries (68 per cent) fell below 50, indicating serious corruption problems in most parts of the planet.
At the bottom of the index, the countries scoring below 25 are mostly conflict-affected and highly repressive countries, such as Venezuela, and the lowest scorers, Somalia and South Sudan, which both scored nine.
Data show that democracies, typically stronger on anti-corruption than autocracies or flawed democracies, are experiencing a worrying decline in performance. This trend spans countries such as the United States (64), Canada (75) and New Zealand (81), to various parts of Europe, such as the United Kingdom (70), France (66) and Sweden (80).
Another concerning pattern is increasing restrictions by many states on freedoms of expression, association and assembly. Since 2012, 36 of the 50 countries with significant declines in CPI scores have also experienced a reduction in civic space, TI says.
The CPI shows the stark contrast in controlling corruption between nations with strong, independent institutions, free and fair elections, and open civic space, and those ruled by repressive authoritarian regimes.
Full democracies have a CPI average of 71, while flawed democracies average 47 and authoritarian regimes just 32. Although a very small number of non-democratic countries score relatively well compared to their regional peers, and are perceived as managing a limited range of corruption types successfully, they remain exceptions.
Similarly, countries where civic space is guaranteed and protected tend to control corruption better. Those where the freedoms of expression, assembly and association are duly safeguarded are generally more resilient against corruption and score better on the CPI.
However, countries where these freedoms are lacking are more likely to lose control of corruption: 36 of the 50 countries where the CPI scores have significantly declined have also seen a reduction in civic space.
TI is calling on governments and leaders across the world to take action to strengthen justice systems, ensure independent oversight of decision-making and public spending, guarantee transparency about how political parties and election campaigns are funded, and protect civic space, democracy and media freedom.
This year, governments that fail to address their citizens’ concerns may find themselves toppled by popular protest movements. By choosing to act for the public interest, not private gain, governments and leaders can live up to their responsibilities to shape and nurture safe, fair and healthy societies where everyone can thrive, TI says.
TI CEO Maira Martini commented that at a time of climate crisis, instability and polarisation, “the world needs accountable leaders and independent institutions to protect the public interest more than ever – yet, too often, they are falling short.”
Some powerful nations have an indirect impact on corruption levels that extends well beyond their borders.
The Russian state has been accused of interfering in other countries’ elections by spreading disinformation and buying votes with the intention of influencing voters and driving instability, democratic backsliding and the narrowing of civic space.
The US government’s decision to temporarily freeze and then degrade enforcement of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act – a key anti-corruption law that prohibits corporate bribery of foreign officials – sends a dangerous signal that bribery and other corrupt practices are acceptable.
At the same time, US aid cuts to funding for overseas civil society groups that scrutinise their governments have undermined anti-corruption efforts around the world. Political leaders in various countries have also taken this as a cue to further target and restrict independent voices, such as NGOs and journalists.
The report recommended that, in order to function properly, deter potential offenders and protect people who speak out against corruption, countries’ justice systems must be shielded from interference by political or economic interests.
This includes protecting appointments and promotions from external pressure. These systems also need to be properly resourced, prosecutorial decisions must be reasoned and reviewable, and courts should publish decisions and data.
Fundamental freedoms – including a free press and the right to information – enable the active engagement of individuals and groups to promote transparency and integrity in government and business activities. Decision-makers must fully protect civil society groups and people reporting corruption, such as whistle-blowers.
They should also create a regulatory framework that enables, rather than restricts, the work of civil society organisations – including giving them access to both domestic and international funding. This will strengthen the fight against corruption by allowing civic actors to expose abuse, assist victims, foster public participation and build accountability.
When journalists are attacked or killed for investigating corruption, power cannot be held to account effectively and corruption tends to worsen.
Since 2012, in non-conflict zones worldwide, 829 journalists have been murdered. 150 were killed while covering corruption-related stories, five of them in 2025. Over 90 per cent of these killings happened in countries with a CPI score lower than 50, including Brazil, India, Mexico, Pakistan and Iraq, which are particularly dangerous for journalists reporting on corruption.

 

Citizens deserve to know who funds political parties and candidates, or who influences decisions. It is important that political finance, conflicts of interest and lobbying are regulated, documented and subject to public scrutiny to ensure that democracy is protected against potential corruption.
Transparency and limits on political donations stop rich and well-connected industry groups from being able to unfairly influence policies, budgets and public institutions to suit their own goals, rather than the public interest.
The report recommended that robust checks and balances at home, together with strong national and international prevention and detection measures, are essential to block and uncover large-scale, high-level corruption and major cross-border money laundering.To deter and punish these serious crimes, more effective enforcement systems are essential.
Overcoming pervasive and deep-rooted state corruption will require strong national coalitions to rebuild democracy and the rule of law. International enforcement in states with effective justice systems can also play a vital role by prosecuting wrongdoers and seizing stolen assets hidden abroad, to cut off their ability to operate.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10111423245fc4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972249/great-for-competition-and-cricket-reactions-pour-in-to-pakistans-decision-to-play-india-in-the-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>‘Great for competition and cricket’: Reactions pour in to Pakistan’s decision to play India in the T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Cricket commentators, journalists and political figures reacted on Tuesday to the government’s announcement that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.
Pakistan had previously vowed to boycott the match, in support of Bangladesh after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected its plea to let it play its matches against India in Sri Lanka.
However, Pakistan’s decision to play India was made after an ICC delegation arrived in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match. Sri Lanka had also urged Pakistan to play India.
In the wake of the decision, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath thanked PM Shehbaz, as well as Pakistan’s government and Foreign Office (FO), on social media for “positively considering Sri Lanka’s request” to play its T20 clash against India.
“I also appreciate the PCB and Pakistan’s sports authorities for their cooperation. A gesture that reflects sportsmanship, friendship, and the strength of our bilateral ties,” he said.







Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz yesterday, had expressed delight at the decision and thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
Journalist Faizan Lakhani reposted the statement, commenting, “When a head of state publicly thanks Pakistan for agreeing to play a match that doesn’t even involve his own team, it’s clear this was bigger than sport.”
He said that the statement by the Sri Lankan president highlighted Pakistan’s importance in world cricket and showed that “government-level intervention was needed to resolve a serious standoff” and keep the game on course.







Meanwhile, former cricketer Shahid Afridi praised the decision, saying, “The spirit of cricket has prevailed.”
He said that the government of Pakistan had “protected the sanctity of the T20 World Cup and ensured the game’s global stability” with their decision to participate.
“Cricket wins, which means it will continue to play its pivotal role of bridging the widest of divides.”







Former English cricketer Michael Vaughan termed the decision to play “great for the competition and cricket”.
“We need them to somehow play a Test series soon as well … “[the] UK would be a great place to host a three-match series,” he added.







Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle suggested that the decision to play had been inevitable, saying, “Pakistan were always going to play.
“It was clear as daylight. Withdrawal was never even a possibility.”







Veteran Indian journalist Pradeep Magazine told AFP “good sense has prevailed on all sides”.
Financial considerations would have been taken into account, he added.
“India-Pakistan is not just about cricket revenue — it also means wider commercial revenue,” he said.
“Everyone realised that losing the revenue from an India-Pakistan match would have been a loss-loss situation for all ICC member nations.”
He also posted on social media on Tuesday morning, “India may be the economic driver behind cricket and generate revenues and huge money for the game but it needs teams to play against to do so. Sports does not exist in a vacuum.”







Meanwhile, former India cricketer Madan Lal told AFP: “Pakistan did shake up the ICC by repeatedly saying they would not play.
“Eventually, the ICC had to send officials to Pakistan to sort out the issue” and that was ‘good for cricket’.
“We want strong teams to play so that the charm of the World Cup is not lost,” he added.
Lal also posted on X that “Bangladesh solved the problem for ICC. They told Pakistan to play the game on the 15th. What happened behind closed doors nobody knows.”

PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui said that Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar called party MPAs Wajid Hussain and Sajjad Ali Soomro to inform them of the government’s decision.
“So we hope that our workers will be released by tomorrow [Tuesday] after all government formalities are completed,” she told Dawn.
She claimed around 300 party workers and leaders from different tiers were arrested in raids that began last Sunday and continued ahead of the Feb 8 protest call. “We have already challenged their detention in court.”
Meanwhile, government sources confirmed the PTI’s claim and said that the government had, in principle, decided to release all PTI workers and that the “documentary process” in this regard had already begun.

“So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source.
Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance.
On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating public to block roads, highways and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”.
The party challenged the alleged detentions in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the very next day.
On Friday, the Sindh High Court directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance.
A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhary, also issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh in around 35 identical petitions, fixing Feb 10 for hearing.
Earlier on Monday, the PTI said that even after passing the Feb 8 protest call, its Karachi President Raja Azhar and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan were arrested by law enforcement authorities.
Condemning the move as unconstitutional and politically motivated, the party spokesperson said that both leaders were shifted to the Central Prison and that even their families were unaware of the cases against them and their whereabouts.
“We have been informed that both leaders were moved to the Central Prison on Monday evening. We were not allowed to meet them, nor were their families permitted to do so. This is open barbarity, which we strongly condemn,” she alleged.

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of Jan 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed.

 

On Monday, the investigating officer of the case brought the four prosecution witnesses before Judicial Magistrate (South) Aasim Aslam for recording of their statements under Section 164 of the criminal procedure code.
One of the witnesses, 13-year-old Aryan, son of a shopkeeper, deposed that he saw 11-year-old Huzaifa, son of the flower shop owner, playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly broke out on Jan 17.
He stated he went to the flower shop at around 10pm to meet Huzaifa before leaving the plaza. He said Huzaifa was alone at the shop and was playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly erupted.
Besides Aryan, three salesmen also recorded their statements before the judicial magistrate.
Waleed stated that on the night of the incident he was inside a shop when he heard someone’s shout that a fire had broken out. He said he stood up and saw that the fire was already raging in the artificial flower shop.
He added that he, along with some other shopkeepers, tried to remove the artificial flowers from the shop but found that they were fixed with screws.
“The fire intensified and the place was filled with smoke,” he said, adding that till then the market committee members had arrived at the spot.
He added that as the fire became uncontrollable, he stepped back and managed to escape from the plaza.
Another salesman, Hamza, 29, said that while he was busy doing the accounts of his shop, he saw a fire erupted in Shop No 193 (artificial flower shop). He said when the blaze did not subside despite attempts to douse it with water, he ran towards an exit to save his life.
Talha, 28, said that he was talking with his colleague when the fire suddenly broke out in the flower shop. He added that he and other shopkeepers tried to extinguish the blaze, but realising its intensity, they decided to save their lives.
A manslaughter case was registered on the complaint of the SHO of the Nabi Bux police station against unknown persons.

Maxwell, 64, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, was subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee to discuss her relations with Epstein.
Rather than answer the committee’s questions, however, the former British socialite invoked her Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate herself.
A recording of the deposition released by the committee showed Maxwell speaking via video link, her eyes cast down at the table she was seated in a Texas prison.
She was asked about her and Epstein’s co-conspirators, whether they surrounded themselves with the rich and famous in order to “curry favor” and avoid scrutiny, and whether Trump ever engaged “in sexual activity with an individual introduced to him by you or Jeffrey Epstein.” Wearing a drab, beige uniform, Maxwell repeated the phrase “I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to silence” until the committee gave up and called off their questioning early.

 


Maxwell’s attorney, David Markus, said she would be prepared to speak publicly if granted clemency by Trump.
“If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path,” Markus said in a statement.
Markus also said that Trump and former president Bill Clinton — both of whom were once friendly with Epstein — are “innocent of any wrongdoing.”
“Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation,” he said.
Maxwell is the only person convicted of a crime in connection with Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.
She was convicted in 2021 of supplying underage girls to Epstein, who had ties to powerful business executives, politicians, celebrities and academics.

 

Her deposition comes amid the recent release by the Justice Department of millions of documents related to the government’s investigation into Epstein, many of which have been heavily redacted.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) passed by Congress in November compelled the Justice Department to release all of the records in its possession related to Epstein.
It required the redaction of the names or personal identifying information about Epstein’s victims, who numbered more than 1,000 according to the FBI.
But the EFTA said no records could be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
Congressional access to unredacted files
Members of Congress were given access to unredacted versions of the files Monday, though only under strict, in-person visits at secure Justice Department viewing locations.
“I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, told reporters, including “people who were enablers and cooperators.” The Justice Department has said no new prosecutions are expected.
Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, said he discovered the names of six men whose identities have been redacted from the publicly released documents and who “are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files.”
Massie declined to provide their identities but said one “is pretty high up in a foreign government.” He also posted on X a sordid 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video.”







Massie said the email exchange appeared to be with “a Sultan” and that the Department of Justice should make his identity public.
Later, on CNN, Massie said prominent businessman Les Wexner was listed as a “co-conspirator” in a 2019 child sex trafficking case, in a file that had been improperly redacted. Wexner is the billionaire behind women’s retailers and lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret.
The House Oversight Committee has also summoned Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, to testify about their interactions with Epstein.
The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.
Trump was once a close friend of Epstein but has not been called to testify by the Republican-controlled committee.</p><small>2026-02-10 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/100939035f024a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972243/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-trumps-board-of-peace-meeting-in-washington-on-feb-19' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend Trump’s Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Feb 19</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first leaders’ meeting of President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
The meeting is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.
The inaugural meeting will focus on Gaza’s post-war reconstruction. The official invitation underlines the expected presence of “heads of state, heads of government, and international figures”.
The summit is also expected to formalise the board’s mandate and structure.
Eight Muslim-majority countries are expected to participate in the meeting. They include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and the UAE. Muslim participants are expected to adopt a unified position on Gaza-related issues.
These include halting Israeli ceasefire violations and securing durable peace guarantees. Such guarantees are seen as essential for reconstruction efforts to proceed. The meeting may also address mechanisms to support long-term stability.
All 22 invitees have already joined the Board of Peace. Pakistan joined the board in late January, and it signed the founding charter during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The charter was signed on January 22 alongside representatives from two dozen countries.
Pakistan’s participation reflects its diplomatic engagement on Gaza as Islamabad continues to support Palestinian rights and international law. Officials stress that this position remains unchanged.
The Feb 19 meeting is described as organisational and financial in nature and is also expected to function as a fundraising conference. Discussions will define the board’s structure, mandate, and secretariat.
Operational direction is also expected to be clarified. Diplomatic sources said troop contributions may be discussed and any decision would follow completion of the board’s framework.
President Trump launched the Board of Peace late last month. It is part of his broader Gaza peace and transition plan. Trump will chair the meeting in Washington. He has framed the initiative as a vehicle for reconstruction and cooperation.
Analysts have welcomed the stated objectives of the board, while others have raised concerns about its wider implications. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to meet President Trump on February 18, is expected to attend the talks; however, his participation has not yet been officially confirmed.
The moot will focus on the implementation of the ceasefire and Gaza’s future governance.
The Board of Peace was first proposed in September 2025. It formed part of a 20-point Gaza peace plan. The plan followed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier that year.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Resolution 2803, adopted in November, authorised international cooperation for Gaza’s reconstruction. The board’s charter includes humanitarian and reconstruction responsibilities. It also allows for broader conflict resolution roles.
This expansive mandate has drawn mixed global reactions. Several Western allies have expressed reservations. Concerns focus on structure, financing, and long-term authority.
Some countries have chosen not to participate. Islamabad has adopted a cautious approach to engagement. Officials stress Pakistan’s participation is not unconditional.
Pakistan aims to advocate Palestinian self-determination.
Diplomats say Islamabad seeks alignment with UN resolutions, and international law remains central to its position.
Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi earlier outlined Pakistan’s stance, stressing a lasting ceasefire, humanitarian access, and reconstruction.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán confirmed his attendance, along with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto, who has also indicated that he will attend. So have half a dozen other Muslim states.
Some countries, including India, are expected to skip the meeting.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1010142190a8231.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972246/massive-fire-at-textile-factory-in-rawalpindis-rawat-area-extinguished-after-16-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Massive fire at textile factory in Rawalpindi’s Rawat area extinguished after 16 hours</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: A massive blaze at a textile factory in Rawalpindi’s Rawat industrial estate was extinguished on Tuesday after a 16-hour effort, according to a statement from Rescue 1122.
The fire broke out on Monday evening. No loss of life was reported in the incident.
More than 80 personnel and 21 emergency vehicles were engaged in the overnight firefighting efforts, said the statement.
It added that more than 200,000 litres of water were used, along with foam, to control the blaze. Fire tenders and firefighters from neighbouring districts were also summoned.
Firefighters, after extinguishing the blaze, continued cooling efforts. The statement added that cracks have developed in the structure and there is a risk of collapse.
The cause of the fire had yet to be established, as it was too early to determine; however, fire investigators and rescuers were present at the scene.
A day earlier, the fire, which was initially declared a second-degree blaze, caused extensive property damage and sparked panic in the area.
Up to 45 firefighters, along with 13 emergency vehicles, struggled to control the fire.
Fire services from Bahria Town and Islamabad, along with Wasa Rawalpindi, were also called in to assist the firefighting operation.
Huge plumes of thick black smoke billowed over the industrial area and could be seen from miles away.
Earlier this month, it had emerged that all high-rise buildings in the garrison city had been served notices to adopt fire safety measures within 30 days.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698a95a8c1fe8.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972211/two-books-and-other-stories' target='_blank'><strong>Two books and other stories</strong></a><br><p>ON Aug 1, 2025, a Facebook post showed Ajay Bisaria, former Indian envoy to Pakistan, alongside a video of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reading in parliament from the diplomat’s book about difficult relations with the neighbour. Last week, however, the defence minister was taking an opposite stance about quoting from books and published articles in parliament. He took umbrage at the opposition seeking to cite the memoirs of former army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi aimed to show with the help of the extracts how the Modi government’s macho image of itself was in fact pretentious and hollow when it came to confronting China.
The defence minister insisted, wrongly, that it was against parliament’s rules to quote from the printed but as yet unpublished book. Rajnath Singh was livid because Gandhi cited some troubling passages showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a shirker when it came to confronting China. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla ad-libbed to tell an unsurprised Gandhi that he could neither quote from the book nor from an article about the book. And he wouldn’t be permitted to even describe its contents.
The impugned book — Four Stars of Destiny — was written by the former army chief over a year ago, and has been ready for release for months. But its publication stands withheld without clearance from the defence minister’s office. The ministry has not responded to reminders from the publishers as to why it was not being cleared. The answer may lie elsewhere.
On Jan 31, ace defence analyst Sushant Singh published excerpts from Naravane’s book in Caravan magazine. Some passages from the book do something unusually courageous. They unintentionally challenge Modi’s self-cultivated image as a tough nationalist who brooks no nonsense from India’s neighbours, chiefly Pakistan but also China, albeit in a muffled way. Naravane was alarmed, in Sushant’s version of a passage, when the chief of the Northern Command reported that Chinese tanks were moving speedily towards an Indian post on the disputed Himalayan border. The chief woke up everyone from the national security adviser to the foreign minister and the defence minister, but got no response. Hours later, the defence minister called to tell him pithily, according to the book, that Modi’s instructions were to deal with the situation as Naravane deemed fit. In other words, as Naravane writes, he was handed a hot potato.

Rahul Gandhi cited some troubling passages from an as yet unpublished book showing Modi as a shirker when it came to China.

According to Sushant’s reading of the book, Lt-Gen Yogesh Joshi, the chief of the Indian Army’s Northern Command, received a phone call at 8.15 pm on Aug 31, 2020. The information he received alarmed him. Four Chinese tanks, supported by infantry, had begun moving up a steep mountain track towards Rechin La in eastern Ladakh. Joshi reported the movement to Gen Naravane who immediately grasped the severity of the situation. The tanks were within a few hundred metres of Indian positions on the Kailash Range, the strategic high ground that Indian forces had seized, hours earlier, in a dangerous race with China’s People’s Liberation Army. “In this terrain on the disputed Line of Actual Control — the de facto border between the two countries — every metre of elevation translates to strategic dominance,” says Sushant Singh.

 

The Indian soldiers fired an illuminating round, a kind of warning shot. It had no effect. The Chinese kept advancing. Naravane began making frantic calls to the leaders of India’s political and military establishment, including Rajnath Singh, the defence minister, Ajit Doval, the national security adviser, Gen Bipin Rawat, the chief of defence staff and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. “To each and every one my question was, ‘What are my orders?’” Naravane writes.
The situation was deteriorating dramatically and demanded clarity. There was an existing protocol. Naravane had clear orders not to open fire “till cleared from the very top”. His superiors did not give any clear directive. Minutes ticked by. At 9.10 pm, Joshi called again. The Chinese tanks continued to advance and were now less than a kilometre from the pass. At 9.25 pm, Naravane called Rajnath again, asking “for clear directions”. None came.
“My position was critical.” Naravane was caught between “the Command who wanted to open fire with all possible means” and a government committee “which had yet to give me clear-cut executive orders”.
To cut the story short, Rajnath Singh called back at 10.30 pm. He had spoken to the prime minister, whose instructions consisted of a single sentence: “Jo uchit samjho, woh karo” — do whatever you deem appropriate. This was to be “purely a military decision”. Modi had been consulted. He had been briefed. But he had declined to make the call. “I had been handed a hot potato,” Naravane writes.
In the Indian system, the decision to wage war belongs to the prime minister at the head of the cabinet committee on security. The military chiefs then decide on how best to carry out the orders. Did Modi abdicate his responsibility of dealing with what was shaping up like a military threat with the potential to lead to a hot war with China? There are other unflattering references to the government’s handling of border ties with China, which were not allowed to be discussed in the world’s largest democracy.
Ajay Bisaria’s book on the other hand was deemed kosher to be quoted since it made the BJP government look better against the Congress to his followers. The excerpt in the video clip showed the defence minister claiming that in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attack in November 2008, Congress foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee ignored the advice of his foreign secretary to respond with a missile attack on an alleged terror hub in Pakistan. Mukherjee folded the meeting without any further follow-up. Fortunately so, speaking from hindsight of Operation Sindoor.

ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Monday expressed concern over delays in the execution of road infrastructure projects across the country and urged the formulation of a mechanism to avoid the simultaneous execution of multiple projects.
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Communications, headed by Pervaiz Rashid, suggested that initiating and completing projects one at a time would help prevent cost escalation and ensure timely completion.
It further recommended consultation with the Planning Commission in devising such a mechanism.
The committee chairman directed that clear responsibility be fixed for project delays and that escalation costs be borne by those responsible.
The committee reviewed the budgetary allocations and releases for the current financial year and examined the proposed budget for the next financial year. It was informed that a major portion of the National Highway Authority (NHA) budget consists of PSDP-funded projects.
Senator Jam Saifullah Khan emphasised that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway should be treated as a priority project and directed that progress updates be presented at every committee meeting.
The Senate body also discussed issues related to the dilapidated condition of roads raised during Senate proceedings, received a briefing on ongoing NHA projects, and reviewed the implementation status of the approved Escalation Price Adjustment Formula.
The committee also discussed issues concerning the deteriorating condition of motorways and the Lowari Tunnel. Serious concerns were raised regarding safety, ventilation and quality standards, particularly in view of the strategic importance of the tunnel.
The committee was also briefed on the progress of the Chakdara-Chitral and Gilgit-Shandur road projects.
The Senate body received a briefing on the implementation of the PM-approved Escalation Price Adjustment Formula for ongoing projects. The committee noted that delays in the implementation of the formula could further increase contractors’ claims and termed such delays contrary to the prime minister’s directives.
The chairman directed the NHA chief to address the matter promptly and sub­­mit quarterly progress reports to the committee.
Corruption at KPT
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Maritime Affairs on Monday observed that annual corruption worth $40 million has been reported through various sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT), mainly linked with container clearance.
Chairman of the committee, Senator Faisal Vawda, stressed the need to vacate encroached land.
“We have received information that 239 containers are delayed at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), mainly due to customs delays, and it is estimated that corruption worth approximately $40m annually is linked to container clearance,” he said. He added that informants have alleged that Rs112,000 in bribes is taken per container.
The committee directed the KICT to clear the backlog and eliminate corruption.
Senator Vawda also raised concerns regarding the Fisheries Harbour Authority, stating that transparency is lacking and significant land mismanagement has taken place at Korangi Fisheries.
Senator Rubina Qaim Khani pointed out that the KPT faces dwell time issues in container clearance.
Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar told the committee that it is not possible to eliminate all systemic issues at once, but the ministry is adopting a step-by-step approach.

Arabia, Somalia ink defence agreement</strong></a><br><p>MOGADISHU: Somalia and Saudi Arabia signed a defence agreement, as the Horn of Africa becomes an arena for proxy wars between Gulf monarchies, with Abu Dhabi at loggerheads with Riyadh.
The region, strategically located between the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal on one of the world’s busiest trade routes, has increasingly attracted the interest of the Gulf states.
The agreement comes a month and a half after Israel recognised Somaliland, a self-proclaimed republic that seceded from Somalia in 1991 but which Mogadishu still considers to be under its control.
Somali Defence Minister Ahmed Moallim Fiqi and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Khalid Bin Salman, signed a “military cooperation agreement” on Monday, according to a message on X from the Somali defence ministry.







“This agreement further strengthens defence and military cooperation between the two nations, while covering various areas of mutual interest for both countries,” it said.
In a separate post on X, Prince Khalid Bin Salman said he had “signed and witnessed the signing” of “several” agreements on the sidelines of a military exhibition in Riyadh. He did not provide further details.







Meanwhile, in Somaliland, the Emirati giant DP World has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the deep-water port of Berbera, which it uses with little regard for the government in Mogadishu. This port includes an airport strictly controlled by Abu Dhabi, according to several witnesses and local sources. Saudi Arabia, once a staunch ally of Abu Dhabi, is now a vocal critic of the UAE, particularly on the Sudanese and Yemeni issues.

ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday strongly condemned the recent suicide attack in Tarlai, demanding a thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation to bring the perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism to justice.
Through a unanimously adopted resolution moved by PPP Senator Syed Wa­­qar Mehdi, the House urged the strengthening of intelligence coordination and security arrangements, especially in the federal capital and at sensitive locations.
The resolution condemned the suicide attack on civilians, stating it violates Islamic values, humanity, and Constitution. It expressed deep condolences to the victims’ families and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured.
The House paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies, emergency responders, and medical personnel for their prompt professional response. It also suspended its routine to discuss the tragedy, affirming national unity amidst a blackout on TV and the Senate’s YouTube stream.
However, the debate turned heated as opposition criticised Lahore’s Basant celebrations following major terror attacks in Balochistan and Islamabad.
With incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan facing accusations re­­garding the resettlement of the Taliban in Pakistan, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called for a joint session of parliament. He demanded that the former military and spying age­ncy chiefs be summoned to explain who brought the Taliban back to the country.
Senator Abbas regretted the dances performed as part of Basant celebrations in Lahore while dozens of families mou­rned. “This cold-heartedness would only benefit the terrorists,” Abbas remarked.
He claimed timely hospital transfers could have saved lives. He argued that a collective funeral attended by the prime minister would have sent a necessary message of national unity.
PTI’s parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the Tarlai tragedy had brought tears to the eyes of every citizen, reminding the House that the time for politics and excuses had already passed.
“This is the time for a decisive action,” he asserted, adding that Pakistan comes first.
Barrister Zafar emphasised that unity needs public trust, which the government undermines by opposing Imran Khan. He urged dismantling terrorist net­­works completely, not just isolated arrests.
“If Daesh or any other terrorist organisation is operating within the country, it must be dealt with immediately and decisively,” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman criticised federal ministers’ absence during the debate and praised the armed forces’ sacrifices, while condemning the opposition for setting conditions during a national crisis.
“What our army has done against terrorists, no other army in the world has done,” she said. Ms Rehman criticised Imran Khan for alleged sympathies with the Taliban, noting there was a reason many referred to him as “Taliban Khan”.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took strong exception to criticism directed at the armed forces.
“All of us politicians and parties have made mistakes. Our security agencies are fighting a war against terrorism. We have to stand firmly with our institutions,” the law minister said.
However, JUI-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman argued the nation could not be satisfied by simply blaming a neighbouring country. “We trained the youth under an institution and today we are calling them wrong,” he regretted. He contended that a policy distinction persisted where those who commit terrorism on institutional orders are considered “good Taliban”, while those who do not are labelled “bad Taliban”.
Framing of cultural event
Rejecting criticism of the cultural festival, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid framed the event as an act of defiance. “The terrorists want to make us mourn all the time but we will give a message to the terrorists, we will celebrate and destroy you,” he said.
However, the session ended in pandemonium when PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali chided the PTI over the May 9 incidents, leading to intense verbal clashes.
Lawmakers from both sides blamed one another for the ongoing menace of terrorism.

The head of state’s tightly secured, four-day visit was aimed at consoling Australia’s Jewish community in the wake of the December shooting at Sydney’s Bondi Beach that killed 15 people at a Hanukkah festival.
But he was met with protests in Australia’s two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne on Monday evening, with the Sydney rally turning violent as police hit protesters and members of the media with pepper spray.
The visit has attracted the ire of a large number of Australians, who accuse Herzog of being complicit in civilian deaths in Gaza.

Israeli president’s visit to Sydney sparks massive protests in two major cities

Pro-Palestine groups have organised protests in cities and towns across the country on Monday evening.
In Sydney, thousands gathered in a square in the city’s central business district, listening to speeches and shouting pro-Palestine slogans.
“The Bondi massacre was terrible but from our Australian leadership there’s been no acknowledgment of the Palestinian people and the Gazans,” said Jackson Elliott, a 30-year-old protester from Sydney.
“Herzog has dodged all the questions about the occupation and says this visit is about Australia and Israeli relations but he is complicit.”
There was a heavy police presence with a helicopter circling overhead and officers patrolling on horseback.
Pepper spray, arrests
Police repeatedly used tear gas and pepper spray to push back thousands of protesters who were trying to breach the line and march ahead. Several protesters were arrested as police claimed they clashed with the law enforcers.
Palestine Action Group
spokesman Josh Lees said on Instagram the police had repeatedly charged us with horses and pepper spray.
Thousands of people also gathered in the centre of Melbourne demanding an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.
New police powers
The New South Wales state government invoked new powers giving police greater powers to control demonstrations prior to the rally.
An attempt by protesters to overturn those powers in the state’s Supreme Court failed just before the rally began, local media reported.
Not far from the protests, Herzog took part in an event on Monday evening titled “An Evening of Light and Solidarity” for the victims of the December 14 killings.
Earlier, the Israeli president paid homage to the victims under rain and grey skies as he laid a wreath outside the beachside Bondi Pavilion.

But a demand from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar for him to quit, and the departure of a second senior aide in as many days ,did little to stop the questions over his judgement and ability to govern.
Earlier on Monday, the British leader sought to raise spirits and encourage unity when he addressed staff at his Downing Street office, and he later received messages of support from his top ministers and some potential leadership rivals.
Tim Allan, 10 Downing Street’s communications chief, said he was resigning to make way for a new team to support the PM, a day after Starmer’s closest aide Morgan McSweeney stepped down over Mandelson’s ties to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Police probe whether Andrew passed secret info to Epstein; Kensington Palace says ‘deeply concerned’ by revelations

But Sarwar, speaking in Scotland where Labour has seen its support slump since the 2024 election, said it was with a heavy heart that he had to call for a change of leader in London.
“The distraction needs to end and the leadership in Downing Street has to change,” he told a press conference.
In response, a Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer had “a clear five-year mandate from the British people to deliver change, and that is what he will do”.
Did Andrew share secrets?
Amid the troubles facing the Labour government, Thames Valley Police are said to be assessing a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, over the alleged sharing of confidential material by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with Jeffrey Epstein, BBC News reported.
According to emails recently released by the US government, a sender thought to be the former prince passed on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
According to material seen by the BBC, the emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.
After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.
William in S. Arabia
Meanwhile, Prince William began his first official visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, aimed at deepening economic cooperation but already overshadowed by his disgraced uncle Andrew’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.
Ahead of his arrival in Riyadh, Kensington Palace broke years of silence over Andrew’s links to Epstein by saying William and his wife Catherine were “deeply concerned by the continuing revelations”.
The short statement, which did not directly reference the ex-prince, came as the monarchy faces renewed pressure over allegations stemming from the tarnished royal’s ties to Epstein.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.
The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who returned in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.
The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.
Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.
“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.
“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.
Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.
‘Justice’
Hasina was overthrown on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.
The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.
“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.
“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.
“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”
‘Long live the revolution’
Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.
“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.
“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.
“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”

ISLAMABAD: In a rapid move, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
The contractual changes were introduced through a predetermined set of regulations that had been published as draft for public opinion but were notified without any change after a public hearing. The notification effectively terminates the existing net-metering regime and replaces it with net-billing for all.
As a result, earlier public pronouncements by officials and ministers that the terms of contracts with existing prosumers would remain unchanged until completion of their seven-year terms have proven incorrect. Under the new regulations, the existing registered prosumers will be shifted immediately to net-billing instead of net-metering, and their export units will be credited for one month only instead of the current three months. All other existing terms will remain unchanged until expiry of their seven-year contracts.
New prosumers will be granted only five-year contracts, and their export units will be accepted at Rs11 per unit compared to Rs26 under the existing contracts. Consumers’ import units from distribution companies (Discos) will now be billed separately at Rs37-55 per unit, depending on the relevant slab, excluding taxes, surcharges and duties.
Surplus generation exported to Discos will be calculated separately — at Rs26 per unit for existing and around Rs10 per unit for future prosumers. The net difference will be billed to consumers, unlike the existing system of unit-for-unit exchange in import and export.

 

Nepra held a marathon public hearing on Friday evening but restricted dozens of relevant consumers, independent think tanks and business representatives from suggesting alternative solutions. By the afternoon of the first working day, the regulator notified the same draft without changing a single clause, indicating a predetermined conclusion.
Earlier, the Power Division had proposed similar changes multiple times but withdrew after public criticism over unilateral changes to consumer-financed contracts under a properly announced renewable policy in 2015.
Both the government side and the regulator have blamed prosumers with higher-than-approved solar capacity and non-metered solar homeowners for grid challenges and higher capacity charges. However, the new regulations appear silent on both counts.
The Power Division claimed on-grid (metered) solar capacity had reached 7,000MW and off-grid exceeded 13,000MW. The power minister said millions of consumers had installed hybrid systems without meters to remain in subsidised categories, pushing capacity beyond 19,000MW outside metering. The new rules target only metered solar consumers.
Under the regulations, at the end of each billing cycle following the interconnection of a distributed generation facility, Discos will raise bills after accounting for electricity generated and consumed by the prosumer “under a net-billing arrangement”. Units supplied by Discos to prosumers will be billed at the applicable tariff (Rs37-55 per unit excluding taxes), while units supplied by prosumers to Discos will be billed at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
Net-billing means electricity generated by a prosumer’s distributed facility is purchased by Disco, and a bill is raised on consumption at Rs37-55 per unit after credit for electricity supplied by the prosumer at NAEPP. “In case the billed amount of the units supplied by prosumers exceeds the billed amount of units supplied by Disco, the net billed amount shall be credited against the prosumer’s next billing cycle or shall be paid by the licensee to the prosumer quarterly,” Nepra stated. Discos, however, have not made such payments in the past.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will not be allowed to install solar systems for net-metering beyond their original sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Existing prosumers’ contracts will remain valid until expiry of their current seven-year term, after which they may request a five-year extension, subject to Discos’ willingness. The new regulations apply to systems ranging from one kilowatt to one megawatt (1kW to 1MW) under Nepra’s direct regulatory and licensing domain.
At present, consumers below 25kW are licensed directly by Discos.
The solar regulation changes have been notified despite Nepra itself repeatedly blaming power companies for unaffordable and inefficient supplies.
“Compounded by heavy taxes, levies and surcharges, particularly the Debt Servicing Surcharge, these factors collectively inflate electricity costs for consumers. The result is a shifting of consumers towards decentralised or off-grid solutions, further weakening demand for grid-based electricity,” Nepra said recently.
The regulator stated that the new prosumer regulations provide clearer procedures, stricter technical requirements and a shift in billing methodology, aiming to better integrate small-scale generation into the national grid while safeguarding system stability.
Another restriction is a capacity cap at the transformer level. Discos are barred from entertaining new applications if the cumulative distributed generation capacity connected to a particular distribution transformer reaches 80pc of its rated capacity, to avoid overloading and technical instability in local distribution networks.

“The operating environment continues to recover, but only gradually, supported by the country’s slowly improving economic and fiscal outlook, and strengthening external position”, the New York-based one of the top three global rating agencies said. “However, banks’ financial performance will be stable over the next 12-18 months as they continue to face asset quality and profitability challenges,” it added.
The bank sector outlook aligns with that of the Government of Pakistan (Caa1 stable), given banks’ substantial holdings of government securities, which account for around half of total banking assets.
“Pakistan’s long-term debt sustainability remains uncertain, because of its still weak fiscal position, high liquidity and external vulnerability risk”, the agency said and estimated real GDP growth of around 3.5pc for 2026, up from 3.1pc in 2025, supported by ongoing reforms that are improving confidence and gradually strengthening economic activity.

Moody’s flags high exposure to govt securities as a key risk

The improving economic outlook and lower inflation have contributed to easing monetary policy rates. Lower borrowing costs will boost credit demand and keep problem loan ratios broadly unchanged. At the same time, margins will remain steady after a decline following rate cuts, but higher business volumes, non-interest income and stable costs will support profits and safeguard capital buffers.
It was observed that last year’s floods could weigh on agricultural output, but activity in the industrial and services sectors should remain robust. The improving economic outlook and lower inflation have contributed to easing monetary policy rates. “We expect inflation to rise to around 7.5pc in 2026, in part due to base effects”, it said.
Moody’s highlighted banks’ high exposure to government securities as a key risk. Exposure to government securities amounts to around half of banks’ total assets and around 9.4 times their equity, which links their credit strength to that of the Caa1-rated sovereign.
It noted that sector-wide nonperforming loan ratios spiked at the beginning of 2025 following the removal of the advances-to-deposits ratio (ADR) tax, prompting banks to reduce their loan books. Although loans accounted for only 23pc of banks’ total assets as of September 2025, there could be double-digit credit growth in 2026, supported by improving macroeconomic conditions. Borrower delinquencies will persist nonetheless, particularly in more vulnerable sectors such as agriculture and energy, but lower borrowing costs and higher credit demand will maintain broadly stable problem loan ratios.
Although financing growth will rise in 2026 on the back of lower rates, Pakistani banks will continue to increase their holdings of government securities, which do not carry any risk-weighting, further supporting capital metrics. “We expect banks to maintain high dividend payout ratios, but retained earnings — despite slight margin compression — will be sufficient to fund balance sheet growth and maintain capital ratios”, it said, adding that problem loans were fully covered by loan loss reserves, providing additional capital protection.
Lending volumes and non-interest income will offset margin squeeze, Moody’s said and expected Pakistani banks to deliver an average return on assets of around 1.1pc in 2026. Banks will exhibit modest margin compression as the pace of rate cuts slows, while funding costs remain broadly stable, following the removal of the regulatory minimum deposit rate (MDR) previously applied to corporate and institutional deposits.
However, higher business activity and lending volumes, coupled with non-interest income, will balance tighter margins and preserve banks’ operating revenue. A potential deterioration in the loan book would push loan-loss provisioning costs up from low levels, while lower inflation will reduce the strain on operating costs. Elevated taxes will continue to weigh on bottom-line profitability. Funding and liquidity will remain sound.
Pakistani banks are predominantly deposit-funded, with customer deposits accounting for 63pc of total assets as of September 2025, supported by financial inclusion initiatives, strong remittance inflows from non-residents as well as digitalisation efforts. However, competition for low-cost deposits has increased within the system, which has resulted in a rise in banks’ funding costs and migration to savings and time deposits. Positively, banks exhibit limited reliance on market funding, with net loans representing 35.6pc of customer deposits and less-stable funds accounting for 30.6pc of tangible banking assets as of September 2025.

Speaking on the floor of the house, Asif said, “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees.”
Talking about terrorism, he said, “The spike in terrorism in the country; I am sad to say that we are not even united in the condemnation of terrorism.”
He said that in order to protect political interests, some refrained from attending the funerals of martyrs.
“At least on national issues — all of us sitting here, regardless of which party they belong to … this is one thing on which there needs to be consensus on and that is Pakistan and its integrity as well as respect for those sacrificing their lives,” he said.
In his remarks, the minister said that two dictators in the past had joined the war in Afghanistan to please a superpower. He said terrorism was a blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past.

 

The minister said religious hatred was being fanned in Pakistan under an international conspiracy. He said the last four presidents of the United States were responsible for the killings of millions of Muslims.
“But we always try to get support from the world powers,” he added.
He said India was sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, adding that it was the need of the hour that all Pakistanis be united to foil India’s plan.
He said that the Afghan government in the past had agreed with Pakistan’s stance but now were reluctant to give any guarantee for controlling terrorism.
“Now, India is using Afghan terrorists against us. India is fighting a proxy war in Pakistan,” he added.
He said there were differences among our religious sects which could be sorted out in Parliament instead of in mosques and imambargahs.
“Let us make this parliament functional in a real manner,” he added.
“History gives us an opportunity for course correction but we have to be loyal to the Constitution. All issues can be resolved here. All problems can be addressed if our politics becomes subservient to the state. Our loyalties to the motherland should not be conditional,” he said.
Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai, in his speech, said that a three-day debate should be held on terrorism. He said all stakeholders should sit together to find solutions to the problems plaguing the country.
He also offered unconditional support to the government for strengthening Parliament.
“If today we decide that Parliament will be the hub of power and all decisions will be taken here, all our problems will be resolved,” he added.
He also urged the government to ask the United Nations secretary general to hold an international conference on Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the NA also passed a resolution condemning the suicide bombing at the imambargah.
The resolution — tabled by PML-N lawmaker Hameed Hussain — called the attack “a direct attack on the Constitution of Pakistan, religious freedom, national security and interfaith harmony”.
“This house demands that the suicide bombers, facilitators, planners and patrons involved in this incident be exposed and brought to justice,” it said.
It further demanded indiscriminate action be taken against banned organisations and their networks, social media propaganda and public activities.







“Effective and permanent arrangements should be made for the security of places of worship, especially mosques and imambargahs,” the resolution added.
“Immediate and adequate financial assistance should be provided to the families of martyrs, while the injured should be provided with the best medical facilities,” it further demanded.
The resolution further called for an effective counterterrorism strategy at the national level, which should be practically implemented by authorities.
“This house reiterates its resolve that terrorism, sectarianism and hate-based violence will not be tolerated in Pakistan, and will ensure the protection of lives and property of the citizens at all costs,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0919162606f69a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.
At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.







Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.
“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.
Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.
“Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi sahib; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.
In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.
“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.
Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.
Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.
“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.
“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.
The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.
“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.
When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was sold for Rs1.85bn.
To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.
“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.
Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.
Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their website, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.
The Multan franchise, started in 2017, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, winning the league in 2021.
Last November, the franchise was left ownerless after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would take over the franchise for the upcoming tournament.
Bids were invited on January 14 and their technical evaluation was completed by February 3.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/092320265cdc3e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup match against India, govt announces</strong></a><br><p>The government announced on Monday that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.
The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC arrived in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.
In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.







“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.
It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.
“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.
“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.
“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.
“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.
Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game on hai (the game is on)!”
“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.







Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.







“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.
Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to play match
Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.
“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.







The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.
“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not cancelling the tour of Pakistan,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.
Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run PTV on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.
He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.
“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.







Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.
“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.
No penalty on Bangladesh for opting out of World Cup: ICC
Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.
In a statement, the ICC said that it had concluded an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.
“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.







The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.
Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.
It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.
The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.
“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.
The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.
Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.
“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.
It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.
“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read
ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.
“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.
He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.
Earlier this month, the government had given the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1000015537caa75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972093/iran-says-it-could-dilute-enriched-uranium-if-all-sanctions-are-lifted' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says it could dilute enriched uranium if all sanctions are lifted</strong></a><br><p>Iran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted, its atomic chief said on Monday, one of the most direct indications so far of its position at talks with Washington.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks through Omani mediators in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after US President Donald Trump positioned a naval flotilla in the region, raising fears of new military action.
The talks follow a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in Iran last month.
Trump joined an Israeli bombing campaign last year and hit Iranian nuclear sites. He also threatened last month to intervene militarily during the protests, but ultimately held off.
Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile — estimated last year by the UN nuclear agency at more than 440 kilogrammes — of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90pc that is considered weapons grade.
The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said on Monday: “The possibility of diluting 60pc enriched uranium … depends on whether, in return, all sanctions are lifted or not”.
Eslami, whose remarks were reported by Iran’s ISNA news agency, said, however, that another proposal, sending Iran’s highly enriched uranium abroad to another country, had not been discussed at the talks with US officials.
Khamenei adviser to visit Oman
Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and secretary of its national security council, will visit Oman on Tuesday following the US-Iranian talks there, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
“During this trip, (Larijani) will meet with high-ranking officials of the Sultanate of Oman and discuss the latest regional and international developments and bilateral cooperation at various levels,” Tasnim said.
The date and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be announced.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that a new round of talks would be “an appropriate opportunity for a fair and balanced resolution of this case,” and that a desired outcome could be reached if the US avoids maximalist positions and respects its commitments.
Iran would continue to demand the lifting of sanctions and insist on its nuclear rights, including enrichment, he said.
Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process breaking down mainly due to disputes over uranium enrichment inside Iran.
Since Trump struck Iran’s facilities, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity. It has always said its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
The United States wants to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out.
In a televised statement aired on Monday, Khamenei called on Iranians to participate in the coming anniversary of the 1979 revolution.
“The presence of the people in the march and their expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will cause the enemy to stop coveting Iran,” Khamenei said.</p><small>2026-02-09 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09212947e3ae7fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972077/death-toll-from-suicide-attack-on-imambargah-in-islamabad-reaches-38-hospital-data-shows' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from suicide attack on imambargah in Islamabad reaches 38, hospital data shows</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Data from hospitals showed that the death toll of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad reached 38 on Monday.
Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that 33 people were killed in the attack while more than 150 were injured. However, hospital records show that the toll has increased.
On the day of the incident, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil said that 28 dead bodies were brought to the hospital. On the other hand, Polyclinic said that four dead bodies were brought to the hospital, which added up to 32 deaths, as reported by the media.
A day later, on Saturday, the Pims Spokesperson confirmed that a patient had died. The same day, it was also learnt that some of the injured were shifted to the HBS Institute of Healthcare and Allied Health Sciences, out of which three had died.
The hospital’s representative, Dr Riaz Janjua, told Dawn that three deaths were reported at his hospital. He informed that as many as 67 injured were brought to the medical facility.
Therefore, with the addition of three deaths at the private hospital, the death toll reached 36.
On Monday, two more deaths were confirmed; one of the injured died at Polyclinic while another, who was shifted from Pims to a private hospital, also breathed his last, taking the toll to 38.
Moreover, a document from Polyclinic shows that five deaths involving the incident have been recorded so far, with the first four being on Friday and the latest on Monday. The document also showed that seven patients were in critical condition and one was on the ventilator.
According to the Pims spokesperson, 40 of those injured were still being treated at the hospital. Out of these, seven were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She said that 29 deaths had been recorded at the hospital so far.
Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah was the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration.

 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that four facilitators behind the incident, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2026-02-09 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6987a9d8d26d9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971509/athletics-the-running-child' target='_blank'><strong>ATHLETICS: THE RUNNING CHILD</strong></a><br><p>When nine-year-old Kainat Khalil finished ahead of adult runners on Pakistan’s road-running circuit, her performance should have been recognised as an extraordinary display of talent. Instead, it ignited a controversy that has exposed deep inconsistencies in sports governance, weak child-safeguarding mechanisms and the selective enforcement of age-eligibility rules.
Kainat was recently stopped from officially competing in the 21-kilometre half marathon at the recent BYD Karachi Marathon 2026, despite having been registered and allowed to start the race. 
Although she recorded one of the strongest times on the course, organisers later declared her ineligible, awarding her an honorary prize instead and publicly criticising her coach for entering a child in a long-distance event.
The incident followed an earlier episode at the National Games 2025, where Kainat was barred from competing in the 5,000-metre race after having already won a bronze medal in the 10,000 metres. In both instances, intervention came only after the child had competed — and succeeded.

Kainat Khalil recently won a half-marathon but was not awarded a medal. She also won a bronze in a 10,000m event but was stopped from competing in the 5,000m event. The reason: she is only nine years old. Why are sports rules being enforced only once a child wins?

AN EMERGING ATHLETE
A third-grade student, Kainat has been running competitively for just over a year. In that time, she has participated in several high-profile events, finishing third in the 5km race at the Governor House Karachi Marathon and securing podium positions at the Green Karachi Marathon, the Pakistan Day Marathon, the Maarka-i-Haq Marathon and the Shuhada Run.
Most controversially, she completed and won a 21km half marathon — a distance typically reserved for fully developed adult athletes.
“I want to win a gold medal for Pakistan,” Kainat says briefly, reflecting the ambition driving her rapid rise.
Her performances drew widespread attention and media coverage. They also attracted scrutiny — but only after she began outperforming established runners.
RULES APPLIED AFTER THE FINISH LINE
According to Kainat’s coach, Abu Bakar, objections surfaced only when the child defeated institutional teams.
“She won bronze in the 10,000 metres against runners from Wapda, Navy and Army,” he says. “That is when questions about her age suddenly became an issue.”
Despite being cleared during trials, Kainat was subsequently barred from the 5,000-metre race. Officials cited age restrictions and health concerns — rules that, critics note, had long existed.
“Young children take part in trials regularly,” Mr Bakar said. “No one raises objections until a child wins.”
Several athletics officials, speaking privately, acknowledged that age-eligibility rules are applied inconsistently. Kainat had competed in multiple races without objection, including events where significant prize money was awarded.
This inconsistency raises a critical question: are regulations being enforced to protect children, or to preserve competitive hierarchies?

GENDER, CLASS AND MEDICAL RISK
Kainat’s father, Khalil Ahmed, a driver earning approximately 30,000 rupees per month, believes social attitudes may also have shaped how his daughter’s case was handled.
“We were told many times to focus on a son instead of a daughter,” he says. “I asked them, if a son has rights, does a daughter not?”
Sports analysts note that children from lower-income backgrounds — particularly girls — often lack institutional backing, sponsorship and access to elite training environments that might otherwise offer protection or guidance.
Sports medicine experts, however, caution against romanticising early success in endurance sports. Dr Ucksy Mallick, a sports medicine specialist, explains that children under 12 are biologically unprepared for long-distance competition.
“They have open growth plates, immature cardiovascular systems and limited heat regulation,” he says. “Events such as 10,000 metres or half marathons carry serious health risks at this age, regardless of performance.”
These risks include growth plate injuries, chronic overuse damage, heat illness and cardiac strain. Medical clearance, he stresses, cannot substitute for age-appropriate competition structures. “Physical ability does not mean biological readiness,” Dr Mallick says.
However, experts emphasise that these concerns highlight administrative failure rather than justifying post-race disqualification.
A SYSTEM THAT INTERVENES TOO LATE
By allowing a child to register, compete and finish — and then intervening publicly — authorities failed to protect the athlete at the point where protection mattered most.
Psychologists warn that repeated disqualifications after competition can cause confusion, anxiety and emotional distress in young athletes, particularly when they do not understand why success results in punishment.
Kainat’s case reflects not over-regulation, but delayed and selective intervention.
Following the controversies, her coach says Kainat’s future participation will be limited to shorter distances, with a focus on long-term junior development. Medical experts, however, caution that even 10,000 metres may be excessive at her age — underscoring the absence of clear, nationally enforced youth-distance guidelines.
Ultimately, Kainat Khalil’s case is about more than one gifted child. It exposes systemic weaknesses in Pakistan’s athletics ecosystem: inconsistent rule enforcement, lack of child-centred policy, weak medical oversight and persistent gender and class disparities.
If age rules exist to protect children, critics ask, why are they enforced only after a child wins?
Until that question is answered — through transparent eligibility checks, consistent enforcement and robust safeguarding — Pakistan risks failing both its most-talented young athletes and its fundamental responsibility to protect them.
