The ministry said in a statement that Trump’s call for peace is in conflict with his actions towards Iran.
“Mr Trump can either be a President of Peace or a President of War, but he cannot be both at the same time,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a separate comment on X on Tuesday.
 






In June, the US joined Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities after five rounds of indirect nuclear talks with Tehran that stalled over issues like domestic nuclear enrichment.
The foreign minister reiterated his position that Tehran has always been open to “respectful and mutually beneficial diplomatic engagement”.
US demands that Tehran stop enriching uranium were rejected earlier this year as “excessive and outrageous” by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said Tehran’s issue with Washington was currently “unsolvable” as the other side wants “Iran to be obedient to America.”
Western countries accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, but Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes.</p><small>2025-10-14 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141400001db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948846/phc-directs-kp-governor-kundi-to-administer-oath-to-cm-elect-sohail-afridi-by-4pm-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PHC directs KP Governor Kundi to administer oath to CM-elect Sohail Afridi by 4pm tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) directed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday to administer the oath to Chief Minister-elect Sohail Afridi tomorrow by 4pm.
PHC Chief Justice (CJ) S.M. Attique Shah issued the directive, further instructing that KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati should administer the oath if the governor did not.
The court’s decision, which was reserved earlier today, came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath to Afridi.
Afridi’s election on Monday was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position. The two resignations submitted to KP Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who is also from the PTI and stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — have been returned over “disparate signatures”.
 
 

But, the PTI maintains that a chief minister’s resignation does not require the governor’s approval under the Constitution. With this contention, the party elected Afridi in a session boycotted by the opposition.
The same day, in a pre-emptive move, it approached the PHC with the request pertaining to Afridi’s oath-taking.
In its written order on the application released today, the court noted that Gandapur had “unequivocally affirmed” on the floor of the provincial assembly that he had tendered his resignation on Oct 8. “In light of the certified copy of the transcript of the speech, […] it is manifest that the office of the chief minister stood vacated with effect from” Oct 8, the order stated.
It further said that consequently, a new chief minister was elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Constitution.
Citing Article 130(5) of the Constitution, the court observed that it required a newly elected CM to be sworn in by the governor before assuming office.
“Correspondingly, it is the constitutional obligation of the worthy governor to administer the oath of office to the newly elected chief minister without delay or obstruction.
“Certainly, upon his failure to administer oath to the newly elected chief minister within a reasonable time, it would be construed that such circumstances have arisen rendering the administering of oath to the newly [elected] chief minister impracticable in terms of Article 255 of the Constitution,” the order read.
It further stated that keeping in view the assurance given by Additional Attorney General (AAG) Sanaullah, who was representing the governor, the court expected that Kundi would fulfil his “constitutional obligations” and administer the oath to Afridi in accordance with the Constitution without further delay.
“This forum further trusts that no impediment shall be caused in the administration of oath, and that the process will be completed without any further delay.”
It added that if the governor failed to administer the oath to the CM-elect by 4pm tomorrow, in terms of the authority conferred under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, the PHC chief justice was nominating the KP Assembly speaker to administer the oath to Afridi tomorrow.
“This direction is issued to uphold the sanctity of the Constitution, to ensure continuity in governance, and to prevent the constitutional vaccuum in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the order said.
The hearing
The court had directed AAG Sanaullah yesterday to confirm whether the KP governor had received the summary related to Afridi’s oath-taking from the assembly secretariat and submit a reply today.
The AAG informed the court today that the governor was out of city. He said the governor had told him that his flight to Peshawar was scheduled for tomorrow. “He said he does not have a private plane […] and the provincial government could send him helicopter to arrive in the city today.”
Moreover, the advocate general requested the court to nominate a person to swear Afridi in and ensure that the oath-taking took place today.
Counsel for the PTI Salman Akram Raja and the KP governor’s lawyer, Amir Javed, also presented their arguments.
Raja contended that why did the governor want to verify Gandapur’s signatures. Accusing the opposition of intending to “create difficulties”, he argued that after a CM’s election, matters could not be delayed any further.
CJ Shah, who was presiding over the proceedings, observed that Article 255 of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of oath of office, had been amended to address issues as the one presently under consideration.
For his part, Kundi’s counsel Javed informed the court that he spoke to his client multiple times over the phone yesterday. The lawyer told the court that the governor stated that he would decide on Gandapur’s resignation if legal conditionalities were met.
The chief justice then enquired whether the opposition parties had not participated in the election. He observed that the opposition had boycotted the election at the last minute.
Javed requested the court to wait until 3pm tomorrow on the matter.
At that, the PHC CJ observed that under Article 255, a chief minister’s resignation did not require any approval.
Then, addressing Javed, he asked: “Can you guarantee that the governor will be present tomorrow and administer the oath?”
He went on to observe that the governor had raised objections over Gandapur’s signatures on his two resignation letters. “[Even though], Ali Amin Gandapur confirmed on the assembly floor that he had resigned.”
Arguing further on this, Javed cited multiple provisions from the Constitution.
He said “everything is clear” in Article 130(7), which states: “The chief minister shall hold office during the pleasure of the governor, but the governor shall not exercise his powers under this clause unless he is satisfied that the chief minister does not command the confidence of the majority of the members of the provincial assembly, in which case he shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence from the assembly.”
Moreover, he said the governor’s powers were also made clear in Article 48 (president to act on advice, etc.).
He assured the court that the governor would make a decision tomorrow in accordance with the Constitution.
At that, the CJ asked, “Who is running the province at the moment?”
He also enquired whether the election schedule for the CM’s post had been challenged.
Saturday and Sunday were off days for the court, which was why the schedule wasn’t challenged, Javed replied.
Eventually, the court reserved its decision on the matter and later ruled that the KP governor should administer the oath to Afridi by 4pm tomorrow.
Kundi says never refused to administer oath
Following the court’s decision, Kundi said while speaking to the media in Karachi that he had been saying he would abide by the Constitution. “I never said that I would not administer the oath,” he added.
Kundi said he was in Karachi on an official engagement, and “as governors don’t have special planes, I have requested the [Sindh] chief minister for one.”
Asked whether he would reach Peshawar tonight, he replied: “God willing, I will reach any time tonight.”
PTI hails ‘great news’
Meanwhile, PTI leaders hailed the court decision, with party Chairperson Barrister Gohar Ali terming it “great news from [the] judiciary”.
In a post on X, he expressed the hope that the transition would be completed tomorrow and the new KP government would “stay focused on public issues”.
 






Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail, he said the chief minister’s election was a democratic process and the PTI’s mandate in KP should be respected with the process completed smoothly.
He said the PTI delegation met Imran for the first time since the transition in KP, adding that the PTI founder appreciated the fact that everyone showed unity throughout the process.
PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said every child in the province knew the chief minister’s election was in accordance with the law and the Constitution.
“In the current situation, we want everyone to move forward together, but if someone thinks that they will snatch our mandate from us, it would be their wishful thinking,” he said on X. “No matter how much they try, they cannot break a single worker of Imran Khan.”
 






Speaking to the media outside the PHC, he said democracy and the law had won today.
He thanked the PHC chief justice for serving “justice”, saying that if the courts would issue rulings with such “courage”, the entire nation would stand with them.
 






Plea filed in PHC against chief minister’s election
Earlier today, JUI-F leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman also filed a petition in the PHC, requesting that the election of Afridi as the KP chief minister be “set aside” and declared null and void.
Rehman was one of the four people in the race for the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Afridi.
In a petition filed today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, Governor Kundi, the KP Assembly through Speaker Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, Gandapur and Afridi.
In his petition, he requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as the it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”
Rehman questioned how an election could be held if Gandapur’s resignation had not yet been accepted. Citing Article 130(8) of the Constitution, he stressed that elections for the post can not be held unless it was vacant.
Article 130(8) states that “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the governor, resign his office”, and is the same clause that the PTI has been citing to contend that the CM’s resignation does not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
Rehman’s petition further asked the court to declare decisions taken by the assembly and the speaker with regard to the chief minister appointment as “without lawful authority, void, and of no legal effect.”
 


The petition further urged the court to “declare all consequential notifications and actions, including the impugned notification, as illegal, arbitrary, capricious, without jurisdiction and having no legal effect.”
Rehman requested the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.
The petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”
It concluded by requesting the PHC to suspend the election result in order to “prevent chaos and ensure preservation of the rule of law.”
Speaking to the media outside the court, Rehman reiterated the opposition’s stance over the validity of the elections.
“We said this yesterday as well that the former chief minister’s resignation has not been accepted yet, and the governor has summoned him on Oct 15.
“Until the seat becomes vacant, the election can not be held,” he said.
Responding to a question that why the opposition chose to field candidates for the CM election if it believed the election was not in line with the law, he said, “At first, we were under the impression that the resignation had been finalised, but then the governor’s letter came to light, detailing that the resignation had not yet been finalised.”
From resignation to election
The barely two-year-old KP Assembly presently seems to be facing a constitutional crisis, which originates from Imran’s decision on October 8 to change the command at the helm in the province.
 
 

In line with his directive, Gandapur resigned from his role the same day while the party’s general secretary confirmed that the party had picked Afridi as his potential replacement.
The resignation letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House initially denying ever receiving it.
But, a copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff.
Subsequently, Gandapur sent another handwritten resignation to the governor, which was acknowledged by Kundi on Oct 11. He said in a post on X that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added.
Late at night the next day, Governor Kundi returned the two letters submitted by Gandapur over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (tomorrow) to settle the matter.
For his part, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X, stating: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further said that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
By that time, Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
The opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election yesterday. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N recieved zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.</p><small>2025-10-14 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141830220d4b3f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948894/indias-tamil-nadu-cancels-licence-of-cough-syrup-maker-linked-to-child-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Tamil Nadu cancels licence of cough syrup-maker linked to child deaths</strong></a><br><p>India’s southern state of Tamil Nadu has cancelled the licences of a cough syrup-maker linked to the deaths of several children over the past month, it said on Monday, as authorities search some of the firm’s sites on suspicion of money-laundering.
At least 19 children died in the central state of Madhya Pradesh after taking the syrup, which was banned after a test this month showed it contained nearly 500 times the permissible limit of diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical.
The medicine was only sold domestically but the incident revives quality concerns about India’s pharmaceutical industry, a major global exporter whose syrups were linked in 2023 to the deaths of 10 children in Cameroon, Gambia and Uzbekistan.
“The manufacturing licenses of Sresan Pharmaceuticals have been completely cancelled, and the company has been shut down,” the state government said in a statement.
Financial crime-fighting agency the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is searching seven premises linked to the company in Chennai, the state capital, on accusations of money laundering, a source said.
Some of these are homes of top officials of the state’s drug control office, said the source, who sought anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak to media.
Telephone calls to seek comment from G. Ranganathan, owner of the Tamil Nadu-based firm, Sresan Pharmaceutical Manufacturer, who was arrested last week, went unanswered.
The ED did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
India, known as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, supplies 40 per cent of generic medicines used in the United States, and more than 90pc of all medicines in many African nations.
Indian law requires drugmakers to test each batch of raw materials and the final product, but exports of cough syrup must undergo further testing at government-mandated laboratories since 2023.
Last week, the World Health Organisation flagged India’s “regulatory gap” in screening domestically-sold medicinal syrups.
Indian authorities, who have stepped up scrutiny of such syrups since the recent deaths, have also warned against consumption of two more sold domestically, Respifresh and Relife, which were found to contain the same toxic chemical.
These are made by Shape Pharma and Rednex Pharmaceuticals, based in the western state of Gujarat, but officials of neither company responded to calls from Reuters seeking comment.</p><small>2025-10-14 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14175328df0215b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948844/finance-minister-aurangzeb-sees-imf-staff-level-agreement-on-12bn-payout-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>Finance Minister Aurangzeb sees IMF staff-level agreement on $1.2bn payout this week</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is poised to sign a staff-level agreement (SLA) on a review of its loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.
Last week, an IMF mission led by Iva Petrova concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of the implementation of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The programme’s performance as of the end of June this year — the period under review — has been mixed.
The mission left Pakistan without signing an SLA on the second review of the EFF — agreed in 2024 to shore up the economy after a severe financial crisis — and the first one of the RSF climate loan. However, the Fund said “significant progress” had been made towards reaching the staff deal.
“During the course of this week, we’re hoping that we can get the SLA done,“ Aurangzeb told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the IMF World Bank annual meeting in Washington.
“The mission was on the ground for a couple of weeks, we had very constructive dialogue with them around the quantitative benchmarks, the structural benchmarks, and we’ve been having some follow-up discussions,” the finance minister said.
Earlier today, Aurangzeb met with IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department Director Jihad Azour and discussed Pakistan’s reform agenda. Before leaving for the United States, the finance minister had expressed optimism that the SLA would be finalised during his visit to Washington.
The SLA is a key step required to pave the way for another $1.24 billion payout from the lender. Countries under IMF lending programmes need to pass regular reviews, which, once signed off by the Fund’s executive board, trigger a payment of the next tranche of IMF funding.
 
 

Official sources claimed that there was no immediate need for additional tax measures to bridge shortfalls, although the tax target might have to be revised depending on the first-quarter GDP data, due in the last week of December.
At that time, the question of fresh measures or changes in rates would become due with effect from Jan 1, 2026, to cover lapses in the first half of the fiscal year in view of the biannual nature of the review.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its review for the country.
Pakis­tan and the IMF reached the three-year $7bn aid package deal in July last year, giving much-needed respite to the nation. The programme aimed to enable Pakistan to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
In May this year, the IMF board approved a fresh $1bn loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters. However, the disbursement of funds is contingent upon successful completion of reviews under the EFF.
‘Quite hopeful’ on PIA privatisation
The privatisation push — part of a long-delayed sale of state assets under an economic reform and fiscal stabilisation agenda — was expected to gain traction in the fiscal year to end-June after disappointing results last year.
“This is something which is very important as part of our economic roadmap,” Aurangzeb said.
Pakistan was also making progress on the sale of three power distribution companies and the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
“We are quite hopeful,” Aurangzeb said, citing prospects for qualified bidders for PIA after lucrative routes to Europe and Britain were opened, which made it “a very good proposition for the investors“.
 
 

The transaction would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades.
A previous attempt collapsed last year after a single lowball offer was received, but the government has since drawn interest from five domestic business groups, including Airblue, Lucky Cement, investment firm Arif Habib and Fauji Fertiliser. Final bids are expected later this year.
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb expected the government would launch a green Panda bond — the first one denominated in Chinese yuan for Pakistan — before year-end and return to international markets next year with a bond sale of at least $1bn, though details were still to be decided.
“Euro, dollar, Sukuk, Islam Sukuk — we’re keeping our options open,” he said.
Aurangzeb meets with IMF, World Bank delegations
Aurangzeb and IMF’s Azour held delegation-level talks in Washington, where they exchanged views on Pakistan’s reform agenda, a press release by the finance ministry said.
The ministry said Aurangzeb had a “busy first day” of his official visit to the United States, attending high-level meetings on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank (WB) annual meetings.
“The finance minister and his delegation had a key meeting with Azour. Both sides exchanged views on Pakistan’s reform agenda and reaffirmed their shared commitment to sustaining the current momentum of reforms,” the press release said.
 






It added that the meeting also reviewed progress under the 2nd EFF review and acknowledged the “importance of maintaining macroeconomic discipline”.
In a separate meeting, Aurangzeb had “extensive engagement” with WB Senior Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg, where he appreciated the Bank’s continued commitment to Pakistan’s national development agenda.
“The minister reiterated that the climate crisis remains an existential challenge for Pakistan, referencing the devastation caused by recent floods and their severe impact on the agriculture sector and GDP growth,” the statement said.
“He emphasised the need for enhanced investment in climate adaptation and mitigation measures and agreed on the importance of mobilising additional resources to manage future natural calamities,” it said.
 






The minister is visiting the US capital for the IMF and WB plenary meetings from October 13 to 18. The meetings bring together global finance ministers, central bankers and development leaders, offering Pakistan a crucial platform to secure the next IMF tranche, advance economic reforms, and engage international partners on growth, investment, and resilience.
Flurry of meetings to bolster partnerships with global financial institutions
Following Aurangzeb and his team’s meetings with officials of various international business stakeholders, the finance ministry said the engagements in Washington reflected the “government’s resolve to deepen economic cooperation, strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions, and accelerate Pakistan’s transition from stabilisation to sustainable, inclusive growth”.
“The visit aims to further strengthen Pakistan’s engagement with key international financial institutions, development partners, and private sector stakeholders,” the statement added.
According to the press release, Aurangzeb attended the Commonwealth Finance Ministers’ Meeting, where he underscored the importance of “prioritising concrete actions to advance a resilient and prosperous Commonwealth”.
 






He voiced support for the operationalisation of the Commonwealth Infrastructure and Financial Resilience Hub, as well as the Technical Assistance Fund for peer review and capacity building.
He reiterated the central importance of climate financing for developing countries like Pakistan and emphasised the urgent need to operationalise mechanisms such as the Loss and Damage Fund, the statement said.
 
 

Aurangzeb was also hosted by the leadership and members of the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC). He briefed participants on the positive trajectory of Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, calling private sector growth “vital to sustaining economic momentum”.
According to the press release, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing business challenges and providing maximum relief, highlighting the recent trade deal with the US authorities and “expressing optimism for enhanced government-to-government and business-to-business engagements in key sectors, including mining, agriculture, information technology, and pharmaceuticals”.
 






Aurangzeb also met with Robert Kaproth, US assistant treasury secretary for international finance, and Counsellor Jonathan Greenstein. During the discussion, he highlighted the “strong economic fundamentals” of Pakistan, underpinned by the ongoing IMF programme.
He welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations with the US administration leading to a tariff deal and apprised the officials about Pakistan’s recent legislation to regulate virtual assets. He further invited US companies to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s oil and gas, mineral, agriculture, and information technology sectors, the release said.
 






Aurangzeb also met with representatives of Citi Bank, where he “acknowledged Citi’s longstanding partnership with Pakistan and appreciated its continued engagement”.
“The minister shared an overview of Pakistan’s stabilising macroeconomic outlook, driven by ongoing structural reforms and validated by international credit rating agencies. He also highlighted Pakistan’s growing role as a regional hub for digital innovation and financial services, assuring that the government would give due consideration to Citi’s proposals,” the statement said.
 






The statement added that the minister also interacted with US and international media, including interviews with the Associated Press and Reuters, and attended a dinner in honour of the Pakistan delegation by Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.

Muthusamy took a maiden 10-wicket match haul to help bowl Pakistan out for 167 in their second innings on another day dominated by spin to give South Africa a target of 277 for victory.
But Noman, following up his 6-112 in the first innings, dismissed captain Aiden Markram for three and Wiaan Mulder (nought) to keep the visitors down to 51-2 at the close.
 






Ryan Rickelton, 29 not out, and Tony de Zorzi, unbeaten on 16, fought till stumps with South Africa needing another 226 runs.
Pakistan need eight wickets for a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.
With the threatening spin duo of Noman and Sajid Khan the home team will fancy their chances.
As a gripping match approaches its climax, Muthusamy destroyed Pakistan with figures of 5-57 to add to his 6-117 while fellow spinner Simon Harmer took 4-51 as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 17 runs.
The hosts were fairly well placed at 150-4 but Saud Shakeel holed out for 38 off Muthusamy to trigger a collapse in the last over before tea.
Harmer bowled Mohammad Rizwan for 14 before Muthusamy ran riot.
He dismissed Salman Agha for four, Noman Ali for 11 and Shaheen Shah Afridi for nought to finish with match figures of 11-174, taking four wickets off 21 balls.
Harmer ended Pakistan’s sloppy batting display by removing Sajid Khan for one.
Earlier, South Africa were dismissed for 269 an hour before lunch, conceding a lead of 109 after Pakistan’s first-innings 378.
Noman took 6-112 for his ninth haul of five wickets or more in Tests.
With the Gaddafi Stadium taking big turn, South Africa tossed Harmer the new ball in Pakistan’s second innings.
The 36-year-old had Imam-ul-Haq stumped by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne for nought before trapping captain Shan Masood lbw for seven.
Muthusamy then had Abdullah Shafique for 41 and pacer Kagiso Rabada trapped Babar Azam leg-before for 42.
Azam has now failed to score a hundred in 28 Test innings dating back to December 2022.
Earlier, South Africa’s De Zorzi resumed on 81 at the start of the day and carried the fight to Pakistan, completing his second Test century with a six and two singles off Noman.
The left-hander finally holed out for 104 to long-on off Noman, where Shaheen Shah Afridi took a low catch, ending a 208-minute innings containing 10 fours and two sixes.
Noman, who bowled a probing 35 overs, also removed Prenelan Subrayen for four during the session.
Fellow spinner Sajid took the first wicket of the day when he had Muthusamy caught by Salman Agha for 11.
He then wrapped up the innings when he bowled Rabada for nought to finish with 3-98 off 33 overs.</p><small>2025-10-14 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14162817272ff29.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948876/big-win-for-rano-shc-directs-karachi-zoo-to-move-distressed-brown-bear-to-sanctuary-within-2-days' target='_blank'><strong>‘Big win for Rano’: SHC directs Karachi Zoo to move distressed brown bear to sanctuary within 2 days</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday ordered the Karachi Zoo administration to move the female brown bear Rano to a sanctuary within 48 hours, amid uproar over her worsening condition.
On October 7, a two-judge SHC bench directed the senior zoo director and Sindh Council for Conservation of Wildlife (SCCW) secretary to appear in court today along with a report about the health of the brown bear.
Animal rights activist Jude Allen Pereira petitioned the SHC and submitted that he approached the court in the public interest to seek a declaration of recognition of animal cruelty to the female brown bear, currently confined at Karachi Zoo, in violation of relevant law.
A two-member bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and including Justice Syed Fiazul Hassan Shah, resumed hearing the petition today.
Justice Kalhoro expressed his anger at the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
“How could the bear be kept in such conditions,” he asked, in reference to Rano’s condition, and ordered the handing over of the bear to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
The petitioner’s counsel told the court that the “bear had been kept in one place for seven years.”
The counsel further argued that Rano was in “extreme distress, as a result of which she often hits her head on the cage, causing injury.”
“Rano has developed worms in her wound,” the counsel added.
 
 

Earlier this month, it had emerged that Rano had suffered a head injury, and the wound was infested with maggots due to a lack of care.
Addressing the respondents, Justice Kalhoro questioned, “What was the fault of this speechless animal that she has been kept in the same place for seven years?”
Criticising the conduct of the respondents, the judge further said, “Why do you need to wait for a court order to do your work?
“Why was the bear not transferred to a better place, and why was she not treated at the zoo?”
Responding to the judge’s comments, the SCCW secretary blamed KMC, saying “SSCW has no authority over the Karachi Zoo as it is under the management of KMC.”
Activist Jibran Nasir appeared as the counsel for Pereira, while Advocate Hasnain Abidi attended as the lawyer for KMC. The hearing was adjourned till October 17 (Friday).
In a post on X, Nasir said: “KMC extended the argument that if the bear is shifted, it will impact the entertainment avenues for citizens of Karachi. On this, the Honourable Bench remarked that ‘KMC must realise we live in the 21st century and we should act civilised and with empathy’.
“Animals are not a source of entertainment. Animals belong in national parks or jungles and forests. Cruelty to animals is also forbidden in Islam,” Nasir quoted the bench as saying.
 






‘Big win for Rano’
Speaking to Dawn.com, petitioner Pereira termed the decision a “big win for Rano.”.
“Today is a big win. But not for me. It’s a big win for Rano,” he said, expressing the hope that Rano would not be subjected to noise pollution, exploitation, and disease anymore.
“She will learn to smell grass, play, get genuine love and an environment best suitable for her well-being,” Pereira said.
 
 

“We owe her that. It’s the least we could do.”
He continued, “I am not here to get involved in politics. I don’t have a fight against government institutions. I’m only here to ensure captive wildlife get a chance at freedom…because freedom cannot be selective. It’s their right.”
Rano ‘under stress’ in barren cage
Languishing in a barren cage, Rano, a Himalayan brown bear, was reportedly brought to Karachi Zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Earlier this month, the bear was undergoing treatment for a head injury, with a zoo official saying that she had been treated earlier for the same wound, which she probably suffered after hitting the metal bars of her cage.
In January, the KMC, on the mayor’s directives, had notified a three-member committee to assess Rano’s condition, in a bid to address concerns regarding her well-being.
The committee, in its report, recommended that “the species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar“ — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan — and suggested that Rano’s DNA testing be carried out to identify its exact species.
 
 

While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and finding no wounds/injuries on her body, it observed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.
The team also noticed “heavy noise” during the visit, and said it seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.
Earlier this month — nearly eight months after the committee’s recommendations — it emerged that KMC still had no plans to implement any of the recommendations made by its own committee, as per sources.</p><small>2025-10-14 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1411560473a1160.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948849/shares-at-psx-rebound-as-kse-100-index-climbs-by-7000-points' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX rebound as KSE-100 index climbs by 7,000 points</strong></a><br><p>A day after experiencing a significant downturn, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 index rebounded by 7,000 points on Tuesday, recouping the previous day’s losses.
Bearish sentiment had taken hold of the market on Monday, with the 100-Index plummeting 4,600 points, wiping out Rs534 billion from market capitalisation, amid rising tensions with Afghanistan, political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and violent protests in Punjab. The market had closed at 158,443 points, lower by 4,654 points, or 2.85 per cent.
Today, the KSE-100 index surged 7,032.6 points, or 4.44pc, to close at 165,476.02 points.
Of 483 active scrips, 391 advanced , 69 declined while 23 remained unchanged.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market had rebounded today as “tensions with Afghanistan and domestic unrest following the breakup of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protests had eased overnight”.
“After entering a corrective phase following the trade data released on October 2, participants are now focused on next week’s current account print and progress toward a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund,” he said.
Stating that 12,334 new investor accounts were opened in the month of September, Farooq suggested that retail investors take a “long-term approach, build positions gradually, and consider exchange-traded funds or mutual funds if inexperienced”.
“While valuations are reasonable, potential slippage on the current account and fiscal side could pose near-term headwinds, and a repeat of the last two years’ returns over the next two years appears unlikely,” he added.
 
 

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market had “rebounded after correction”.
He also said the “easing of geopolitical conditions” had supported the market.
Intense border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse yesterday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Separately, a crackdown against protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in multiple cities and political uncertainty in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had added more pressure.</p><small>2025-10-14 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14140707e50307a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948868/levies-constable-shot-dead-while-guarding-polio-team-in-kps-swat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Levies constable shot dead while guarding polio team in KP’s Swat: police</strong></a><br><p>A Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Tuesday, according to the police.
The attack comes a day after the government launched a nationwide polio eradication campaign, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children. A special order was issued for the campaign, with the deployment of 285 police personnel across the country to provide security to the vaccination teams.
According to Swat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan, the martyred Levies constable was performing his duty along with a polio team comprising two female health workers.
“The workers were administering vaccines inside a house while the constable was standing guard outside when he was attacked,” he said. “The assailants fled the scene after the incident.”
 
 

Khan added that police and law enforcement officials had reached the area and launched an investigation.
“The area has been cordoned off, and a search operation is underway to arrest the culprits. No anti-state elements will be allowed to sabotage peace in Swat,” he said, adding that those involved in the attack would be brought to justice.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and paid tribute to the official who was martyred in the shooting. In a statement, he expressed his heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the family of the deceased.
“The assailants who fired on the team that was securing the future of children do not deserve any concession,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP.
Data from September showed that the number of vaccine refusals in KP dropped in the most recent immunisation drive. However, in some areas, such as Lowi Mamund tehsil, residents announced a boycott of the drive.
In May, a policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was martyred in a gun attack by unidentified assailants in Balochistan’s Noshki district, while another was killed in KP’s Bajaur district in February.
Meanwhile, in August, two more polio cases were reported in KP, bringing the national tally to 23 this year.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had previously claimed similar attacks on polio teams, falsely portraying the inoculation campaigns as a Western conspiracy to sterilise children.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.</p><small>2025-10-14 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1413573700726f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948867/there-is-no-insurgency-in-balochistan-but-so-called-separatist-movements-cm-bugti' target='_blank'><strong>There is no insurgency in Balochistan but so-called separatist movements: CM Bugti</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Tuesday dismissed the presence of an insurgency in the province, blaming “India-backed so-called separatist movements” for the worsening security situation.
In recent months, Balochistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
Addressing participants of the 17th National Workshop in Quetta, the chief minister maintained that there was “no insurgency in Balochistan but so-called separatist movements” in the province.
“The purpose of these anti-state elements is to harm and divide Pakistan,” he said.
He added that the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was behind the deterioration of the security situation in the province.
“The Indian agency RAW has a clear role behind the deteriorating situation in Balochistan,” he said. “Separatists are pleased with India but want to harm Pakistan.”
 






CM Bugti added that the war against terrorism was not only the armed forces’ prerogative but “the whole nation’s joint fight”.
He added that a “false impression of uneven development” was deliberately created in the province to sow division, adding that terms like “disgruntled Baloch were coined to justify terrorism”.
“A person who resorts to violence and takes up arms is not angry but a terrorist,” he said.
The chief minister also said that distances were created between the youth and the state through social media propaganda. “The government is going to universities and every forum to hear the grievances of the youth,” he maintained.
Bugti said that in order to improve the security situation in the province and deal with terrorism, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD)’s capacity was being enhanced.
“For this purpose, Rs100 million has been allocated. Security forces are conducting operations in areas where it is difficult to distinguish between friends and foes,” he said.
According to recent reports issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the first three quarters of 2025 in the country saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.
In 2024, KP recorded the highest number of terrorist incidents with 295 attacks; meanwhile, attacks by various outlawed Baloch insurgent groups, primarily the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), saw a staggering 119 per cent increase, accounting for 171 incidents in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-10-14 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1411402065ee6af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948847/after-gaza-summit-pm-says-pakistan-will-continue-to-express-admiration-for-trumps-unique-contribution-to-peace' target='_blank'><strong>After Gaza summit, PM says Pakistan will continue to express admiration for Trump’s ‘unique contribution’ to peace</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated his praise for United States President Donald Trump, stating that Pakistan would continue to “express admiration” for the American leader’s “unique contribution” to peace.
The statement comes a day after Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye had signed a declaration meant to cement a ceasefire in Gaza, hours after Israel and Hamas exchanged hostages and prisoners.
PM Shehbaz had also attended the ceremony held at the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. At a later press conference, the US president had especially mentioned the premier and the army chief.
In a post on X, the premier said: “As I board the plane to return home after the Gaza peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, I want to share some reflections on the potentially transformational nature of what took place and why Pakistan has been so deeply involved.”
 
 

He stated that Pakistan’s biggest priority was the “immediate cessation of the genocidal campaign imposed on Gaza”, which he said he had “stated and reinforced consistently” alongside other nations.
“Our gratitude to President Trump is anchored in him promising that he would make it stop, and delivering on that promise,” he said.
“We will continue to express our admiration for President Trump’s unique contribution to peace,” the premier said.
“The Palestinian people’s freedom, dignity and prosperity remain a primary concern for Pakistan,” Shehbaz said, adding that the establishment of a “strong and viable” Palestinian state, with pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital, would remain the “bedrock of Pakistan’s Middle East policy”.
 






Addressing the ceremony after the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and his “favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders.
Invited to give his own address, PM Shehbaz had thanked Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal.
“Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity,“ he had said.
 
 

In his speech, he had again expressed his desire to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded on Friday to Venezuela’s opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.
’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team,“ the premier said.
“And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-14 10:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141241211017963.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948836/26th-amendment-case-cjp-has-power-to-form-full-court-lawyer-tells-constitutional-bench' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: CJP has power to form full court, lawyer tells Constitutional Bench</strong></a><br><p>Senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi on Tuesday told the Supreme Court’s (SC) Constitutional Bench (CB) that the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) had the power to form a full court as it took up a set of petitions against the 26th Amendment.
The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the CJP’s term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Thus far, Zuberi, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments. They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
 
 

Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment.
The case was initially taken up in January, and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings were being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8.
The hearing
Zuberi, also a former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, continued his arguments in the case today. The hearing was later adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
 


The live-stream for the hearing began with a delay of about 40 minutes due to internet issues. The Pakistan Telecommunications Limited (PTCL) has said users would experience degraded internet services today as a submarine cable is being repaired.
“There are internet issues today. The live stream will not be possible,” Justice Aminuddin said at the outset of the hearing. Justice Mazhar also said the livestream YouTube link was down and asked staff to check this.
Zuberi then cited various past court verdicts to support his arguments.
“A party cannot raise an objection on the judge. The judge has the authority [to decide] whether to hear a case or not,” the former SCBA president said.
“On the one hand, you are saying 16 judges and on the other, you also talk about ‘collective knowledge’,” Justice Mandokhail remarked when Zuberi sought a full court comprising pre-Amendment judges. The judge asked the lawyer to clarify what his request was.
“Do not say a full court; say ‘those judges who were present from before the Amendment’,” Justice Mandokhail said. Zuberi referred to the case upholding Practice and Procedure Act 2023 and contended that the current eight-member bench would not give the petitioners the right to appeal.
“The number of judges nominated as part of the Constitutional Bench is 15, whereas at least nine more judges are needed for hearing an appeal,” Zuberi said.
Here, Justice Ayesha observed that it was now the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s prerogative whether to give someone the right to appeal or not. She said the JCP could “give the right to appeal by nominating additional judges, [but] if it did not wish so, then the right to appeal can also be taken away”.
“This is simply a matter of the judiciary’s independence,” she remarked. Justice Mandokhail then pointed out that even a 16-member bench, as sought by Zuberi, would not have the right to appeal.
Zuberi said the SC had declared that the right to appeal was not mandatory for “decisions based on collective knowledge”.
Justice Mandokhail questioned how Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the SC, could be ignored, as it was a part of the Constitution.
Justice Ayesha noted that there were past verdicts present on “how the challenged provisions are kept aside”, at which Justice Mandokhail said to let Zuberi answer the question.
The lawyer contended that benches will be formed under the newly framed Supreme Court Rules 2025, explaining that a committee will form the benches as per Order 11 of the Rules.
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “Nowhere in these rules is it written that only the chief justice will form the benches.”
Zuberi contended that the full court was not a bench. “Your judgment is also present on how full courts have been constituted until now.” Justice Mandokhail replied that the SC Rules 2025 should have mentioned the procedure for a full court.
The hearing also witnessed a disagreement between Justice Mandokhail and Justice Ayesha over the procedure for adopting the SC Rules 2025.
Justice Mandokhail remarked that all “24 judges” had convened regarding the SC Rules, which were “made in front of them”.
Justice Ayesha interjected: “They were not made in front of everyone. My note exists.” She was among four judges who expressed their reservations regarding the process being adopted for rules’ approval and stayed away from a September full court administrative meeting.
 
 

In response, Justice Mandokhail asked that the meeting notes be brought. “All judges were told to give their input. This case will not proceed further unless this matter is clarified.”
The exchange prompted Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, who was present during the hearing, to urge the judges not to discuss the matter in court as it was their “internal matter”.
Justice Mandokhail said, “I am being called a liar here. A meeting of [all] 24 judges was held. The matter regarding some provisions was referred to the committee. A few judges gave their input and some did not.”
Justice Ayesha then said that the Practice and Procedure Committee, which comprises senior judges who form benches for constitutional matters and suo motu notices, had “been made to constitute benches [and] it has not been given the powers to make a full court”.
“[…] That vests in the Supreme Court; that’s the inherent jurisdiction,” she added.
“And the power of the [Practice and Procedure] Committee is not the power of the chief justice. They are two different entities,” Justice Ayesha said, which Zuberi agreed with. “We are not talking about benches, but full courts,” the judge said.
Here, Justice Aminuddin asked Zuberi whether the CJP had the authority to form a full court comprising CB judges, to which the lawyer replied: “That inherent power of the chief justice is still available to the honourable chief justice.”
 
 

The ex-SCBA president cited several past judgments and asserted that the CB could issue directives to form a full court.
Justice Aminuddin remarked, “You are asking us to tell the chief justice that he may constitute a full court, but in that [case], he formed it himself.”
Zuberi referred to a paragraph in the 1998 Malik Asad Ali case and argued that a three-member bench “had directed the acting chief justice to constitute the full court”. He added that the acting chief justice declined, at which the matter was sent to the then-senior puisne judge, who formed a full court.
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
The petitions
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-14 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141350406fc32e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948862/iran-condemns-trumps-baseless-remarks-us-complicity-in-israeli-crimes' target='_blank'><strong>Iran condemns Trump’s ‘baseless’ remarks, US complicity in Israeli crimes</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Tuesday denounced “baseless claims” made by United States President Donald Trump, calling Washington “the largest sponsor of terrorism”.
Addressing Israel’s Knesset on Monday ahead of joining an international peace summit in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, Trump said that Iran wants to reach a peace deal with the US “even if they said, ‘We don’t want to make a deal,’”.
In a statement carried by the state news agency IRNA, the foreign ministry said: “The US, as the world’s largest generator of terrorism and supporter of the terrorist and genocidal Zionist (Israeli) regime, has no moral authority to level accusations against others.”
“The repetition of false claims regarding Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme can in no way justify the joint crimes of the US and the Zionist regime” in violating Iran’s soil, the ministry said.
 






Israel launched a surprise attack on Tehran on June 13, targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites as well as senior military commanders and nuclear scientists.
Tehran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, while the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. The 12-day conflict came to a halt under a US-sponsored ceasefire that took effect on June 24.
 
 

The ministry called for holding Washington accountable for its role “in the impunity” of Israel, “including by preventing any effective action against Israel in the UN Security Council and obstructing international judicial processes aimed at prosecuting Israeli criminals.”
Since October 2023, Israeli attacks have killed more than 67,800 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, leaving the enclave largely uninhabitable. The first phase of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas came into force on Friday.</p><small>2025-10-14 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14123406f75daae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948848/when-flattery-becomes-foreign-policy' target='_blank'><strong>When flattery becomes foreign policy</strong></a><br><p>Ceasefire, reconstruction plans and the weary diplomacy of war’s aftermath — this is what the summit hall in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh was meant for. Yet when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took the microphone, the air shifted — solemnity gave way to spectacle. Before a room of world leaders convened to discuss the future of Gaza, the Pakistani premier delivered not a statement of statecraft, but a volley of high praise … for US President Donald Trump.
He called Trump a “man of peace”, spoke of nominating him for the Nobel Prize, and credited him with averting a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. And as Trump looked on with a grin of self-satisfaction, the rest of the hall seemed to freeze between disbelief and bemusement. The applause was hesitant; the headlines were instant.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

By conventional diplomatic standards, PM Shehbaz’s remarks were absurd. No leader in that room — not Sisi, not Macron, not Erdoğan — matched that tone of unrestrained flattery. In a forum built for multilateral gravity, the premier’s effusive praise seemed theatrically misplaced, bordering on parody. Yet, paradoxically, it worked — at least for the one audience that mattered most: Donald Trump himself.
Humiliating or rare?
For Trump, whose politics feeds on validation, Shehbaz’s words were not embarrassing — they were energising. In the transactional theatre of Trumpian diplomacy, flattery is not deception; it is currency. A line of exaggerated praise buys more goodwill than a paragraph of policy. To a narcissist’s ear, devotion sounds like diplomacy.
Political psychologists call this the ‘narcissistic reward loop’ — a psychological feedback cycle through which praise reinforces cooperation, regardless of substance. In that moment, the prime minister may not have advanced Pakistan’s strategic interests, but he accomplished something equally potent: he made himself, and by extension Pakistan, relevant in Trump’s narrative of peace. The absurdity of the speech became its mechanism of success.
 
 

What unfolded in Egypt was, in rhetorical theory, a perlocutionary misfire — a statement that produces an effect different from the speaker’s intent, yet still yields a positive outcome. Sharif likely sought to flatter his host and secure visibility in a crowded summit. Instead, he became the viral centrepiece of a geopolitical sideshow — mocked by commentators, but noticed by Trump.
While the rest of the world saw a gaffe, Trump saw a loyal echo. And in the asymmetric world of ego-driven diplomacy, that distinction is everything.

This dynamic — when meaning misfires but outcomes succeed — is known in public relations as beneficial misinterpretation. The speaker’s intention and the audience’s perception diverge, yet the misunderstanding amplifies the speaker’s visibility or favour. It is the strange success of miscommunication in an age of media saturation.
PM Shehbaz’s performance may not have persuaded policy circles, but it dominated headlines, especially in neighbouring India, and secured a rare moment of Pakistani relevance in a summit largely overshadowed by US and Egyptian choreography.
To many observers, the moment seemed humiliating: a prime minister of a nuclear-armed state reduced to flattery before a reality-TV-styled president.
Optics > outcomes
But politics, especially in the 21st-century media arena, rarely obeys the old hierarchies of decorum. What matters now is not intent but impression. Trump, a man whose self-image eclipses ideology, responded not as a statesman but as a celebrity basking in praise. He smiled, joked, and gestured that nothing more needed to be said. The world laughed — but he listened.
And therein lies the paradox. The very absurdity that alienated PM Shehbaz from traditional diplomats aligned him, if only briefly, with the emotional logic of Trump’s world: a stage where applause substitutes for alignment and validation stands in for vision. What appeared as a diplomatic faux pas was, in psychological terms, a strategic hit — an appeal tailored perfectly to a narcissist’s need for affirmation.
 
 

The episode also exposes something larger about our age of performative diplomacy. The modern summit is as much about optics as outcomes. Leaders speak less to each other than to their publics — and sometimes, to a single man’s ego. Flattery, once a soft art of persuasion, has become a broadcast tool. In this environment, even a speech that shocks the world can achieve its purpose if it captures attention and secures a headline. Substance has ceded ground to spectacle; diplomacy has turned theatrical.
The PM’s words in Sharm el-Sheikh will not change the course of Gaza’s reconstruction, nor will they rewrite Pakistan’s foreign policy. But they reveal the shifting grammar of international politics — where absurdity can be effective, and missteps can become media strategy. In the classical sense, his performance was not diplomacy; it was a case study in how flattery, when amplified through a narcissist’s lens, morphs from weakness into leverage.
The hall buzzed with disbelief. Diplomats whispered; social media mocked. Yet the only man who mattered in that room smiled. And in geopolitics, sometimes one man’s applause outweighs a world’s laughter.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141224353b99a56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948852/google-to-invest-15-bn-in-india-build-largest-ai-hub-outside-us' target='_blank'><strong>Google to invest $15 bn in India, build largest AI hub outside US</strong></a><br><p>Google on Tuesday said it would invest $15 billion in India over the next five years as it announced a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base in the country’s south.

Andhra Pradesh state Technology Minister Nara Lokesh said the deal was a “game-changing investment” that came after “a year of intense discussions and relentless effort”.
“It is a massive leap for our state’s digital future, innovation, and global standing,” Lokesh wrote on X. “This is just the beginning.”
 






This month, US startup Anthropic said it plans to open an office in India next year, with its chief executive, Dario Amodei, meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Modi, in a post on X, told Amodei that “India’s vibrant tech ecosystem and talented youth are driving AI innovation”, adding that he wanted to “harness AI for growth”.
 






Anthropic’s move follows a flurry of announcements by other top AI firms looking to court Indian users.
OpenAI has said it will open an India office later this year, with its chief, Sam Altman, noting that ChatGPT usage in the country had grown fourfold over the past year.
AI firm Perplexity also announced a major partnership in July with Indian telecom giant Airtel, offering the company’s 360m customers a free one-year Perplexity Pro subscription.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/140927206c4db70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948718/karachi-fishermen-share-tales-of-horrific-torture-in-indian-prisons-after-may-flare-up' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi fishermen share tales of horrific torture in Indian prisons after May flare-up</strong></a><br><p>• 42 battered Pakistanis reunite with their families at Edhi Centre
• Six others still await government clearance in Lahore
• Returnees say beatings, burn injuries and forced labour became routine after Pakistan-India conflict
KARACHI: Some 42 of the 48 Pakistani fishermen released from Indian jails and handed over to Pakistani authorities through the Wagah Border reached Karachi on Monday after a long wait of over a month because of the uncertain situation in Lahore. There are still six of them awaiting government clearance in Lahore.
The expected time of arrival of the fishermen reaching the city by road from Lahore, thanks to the Edhi Foundation, was 12 noon, though they reached the Edhi Centre at Kharadar after 2:30pm. Still, the media gathered there already felt like they knew each and every one of them, as they had heard so much about them from their family members waiting for them there since morning.
What’s common is the story of the horrible torture they endured in custody after the May conflict between Pakistan and India. They were routinely subjected to physical abuse just for being Pakistani citizens.
There was Shamsa from Malir waiting for her elder brother Habibullah with his 10-year-old son Faizan. Every now and then her eyes would pool up with tears.
Hanif Katiyar was waiting for his son Sattar and brothers Ahmed, Hassan and Ghulam Hussain. “My brothers’ families cannot wait to see them, just like I cannot wait to see my son,” he said.
Noor-ul-Amin from Machhar Colony was waiting for his brother Noor Hussain with his five-year-old daughter Areeba Noor, wearing pink goggles and a shimmery blue dress. “My brother has been languishing in an Indian jail since 2013. He has several new family members to meet now, starting with my little girl who can’t wait to meet her uncle,” he said.
There was also Mohammed Hussain from Keamari Town waiting for his son-in-law Akhtar Ali, father of four. “His two older sons are already working at Karachi Fisheries. He can find work there too. He doesn’t need to go out to sea again,” the father-in-law said.
The wait was finally over. Very moving scenes were witnessed all around as the fishermen were reunited with their families.
The returning fishermen also had horrible stories to share. They said they were beaten up and burned with iron plates and rods in Indian jails.
Abdul Rehman’s entire left side was paralysed. He was on a stretcher and could not speak very well as he gestured with his right hand.
Abdul Rasheed said that he was made to do hard labour in the Indian jail. “They made me lift huge rocks. If I faltered, they beat me badly. If I asked for food, they beat me more and only gave me stale food to eat,” he said while picking up his young son Asim, whom he held close to his heart. The rose garland that others had put around his neck, he put around his son’s neck and kissed his cheeks.
Ghulam Hussain also said that he had to lift heavy construction material. “I only lifted heavy rocks and bricks and took heavy beatings and abuses,” he said.
“I was arrested three years ago, and things were not as bad as they got this year. The jail staff told me that I deserved all the beatings I got because I belonged to the enemy country, Pakistan,” he added.
Mujeebur Rehman and Akhtar Ali pointed to their burnt feet and legs. “They had hot iron rods and plates to hit us with if they thought we were being lazy,” said Rehman.
“I was arrested by the Indian coastguards four years ago. Earlier, things were normal, but this year I was told by the jail staff that I deserved a fate worse than death because I was Pakistani,” he shared.
Showing charcoal-coloured scars on his legs, Akhtar Ali said that he will carry the scars he received on his body and his heart in India all his life. “Are they not human beings? They treated us worse than animals. Hurling abuses at us, they would tell us that Pakistanis are worse than animals,” he wept at the memory.
Fishermen’s Cooperative Society chairperson Fatima Majeed Motani, who was also there to receive the fishermen and present them with some cash, said that fishermen on both sides, Pakistan and India, are innocent.
“They unknowingly cross the invisible boundaries at sea in search of livelihood,” she said.
“It is sad that India treats Pakistani fishermen harshly, while Pakistani authorities behave politely with Indian fishermen caught on this side for unknowingly crossing over to our side,” she added.
“I urge the United Nations to come up with some kind of international law for the release of these innocent people,” she said.
According to Ahmed Edhi, the maternal grandson of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, the Edhi Foundation has always taken the responsibility of facilitating Pakistani as well as Indian fishermen.
“We transport Indian fishermen released from jails in Sindh to the Wagah Border with gifts from Pakistan, and we bring Pakistani fishermen handed over to Pakistani authorities at Wagah to their cities of residence.
In the process, we take good care of their needs and requirements such as food and stay,” he said, adding that there are still some 64 Pakistani fishermen languishing in Indian jails who should also be returned soon.

The discussions focused on accelerating the IFC’s investment plans, including the Reko Diq project, expediting IsDB-funded initiatives such as the M-6 Motorway, and advancing a new framework to deepen economic collaboration with both institutions.
During his meeting with Riccardo Puliti, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the importance of strengthening IFC’s partnership with the country. “We value IFC’s role in scaling up private sector investment, particularly through multi-billion-dollar commitments under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework.”
Both sides agreed to work toward early financial closure of IFC’s flagship Reko Diq project, and the minister welcomed IFC’s new regional set-up, including a regional office in Islamabad, describing it as a “significant step to deepen collaboration and support sustainable investment in Pakistan.”
In his meeting with Dr Muhammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser, the finance minister thanked IsDB for its long-standing support to Pakistan and reviewed the current project portfolio. He emphasised the need for faster implementation of ongoing initiatives and welcomed the IsDB Board’s approval of financing for two sections of the M-6 Motorway.
Mr Aurangzeb also discussed continued cooperation in Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts and the oil financing facility, noting that both sides had agreed to develop a new Country Engagement Framework to guide future collaboration.

The decision aims to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure transparency in the post-merger landscape.
The CCP’s detailed order, posted on its website, outlines strict conditions separating the new merged entity — comprising Ufone and Telenor Pakistan (MergeCo) — from PTCL and its other businesses. PTCL has committed in writing to comply with the order.
The merged entity is expected to become the second-largest cellular mobile operator (CMO) after Jazz, surpassing Zong. Currently, Ufone is the only loss-making CMO among the four, while the rest are profitable. As part of the conditions, the MergeCo must demonstrate profitability, and a third-party evaluator will be required to submit biannual performance reports to the CCP.
To enforce operational independence, the CCP has directed PTCL and MergeCo to maintain separate financial accounts for all service segments. They must also operate with entirely separate boards and management teams. Currently, some individuals hold overlapping roles in both PTCL and Ufone, including the CEO.
“No individual may simultaneously serve on the board or hold senior management roles in both PTCL and MergeCo,” the order states. Former board members or executives are prohibited from joining the other entity for at least three years after leaving their post.
Palwasha Khan, Chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom, welcomed the CCP’s decision. “As PTCL is a state-owned entity, it is our duty to safeguard public interest. The committee will seek quarterly accounts of MergeCo to ensure it remains profitable,” she said. The order also bars the exchange of commercially sensitive information between PTCL and MergeCo. Any reduction in interconnection circuits allocated to other telecom operators, including local loop, long-distance international, and cellular licensees, must be approved in advance by the PTA. Interconnect pricing or capacity must not be used to limit other operators’ access to MergeCo customers.
A senior CCP official stated that non-compliance could result in severe measures, including the possible divestment of PTCL’s telecom infrastructure or parts of its business, as permitted under Clause 13.19 of the order. Analysts believe the separation will improve transparency, limit cross-subsidisation, and support competitive offerings in the telecom sector.

The PTI said the gover­n­­ment could not carry out a transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and hu­­man rights organisations must be included to ensu­­re a fair investigation.
In a statement, PTI Central Information Sec­r­etary Sheikh Waqqas Akram condemned the alleged killings of TLP marchers and demanded that all those responsible for the carnage be held accountable and brought to justice without delay.
Had the perpetrators of the Model Town massacre been punished, he said, the Muridke tragedy would never have occurred.
Where is the prime minister of the country, the chief minister of Punjab, and the information minister who, under normal circumstances, holds press conferences every few hours against opponents, he asked, saying that they had now gone completely silent. He lamented that the TLP leadership repeatedly sought dialogue until the very last moment.
“Had meaningful dialogue been initiated before the protests began, a peaceful solution could certainly have been found.”
Mr Akram called for immediate medical assistance for the injured, along with compensation for the families of those who lost their lives. He also called for an independent, tra­nsparent, and judicial inquiry into the incident to en­­sure that all those responsible are identified and face exemplary punishment.
He demanded that the State cannot do transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and human rights organisations must be included in the investigation process to ensure fair investigation of the incident.

The police produced Falak before the court and sought her physical remand for investigation. The investigating officer told the court that they needed to interrogate the accused, and therefore sought physical remand.
Falak Javed’s counsel opposed the remand request, saying that the police had previously informed the Lahore High Court that his client was not required in any case. He said the arrest of the activist in the case showed mala fide of the police.
The lawyer asked the court to discharge the activist from the case.
After hearing arguments from both sides, ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill allowed a 14-day physical remand of the suspect to the police. The judge also directed the police to submit an investigation report at the next hearing on Oct 27.
A judicial magistrate last week sent Falak on judicial remand in two separate cases of alleged misuse of social media platforms against state institutions and a woman provincial minister. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had arrested her from Islamabad.

Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in the Jordanian capital on Sunday.
Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine state.
In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.”

Hamas has opposed ex-UK PM’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as guardian for Palestinian state

“We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” he was quoted as saying by The Guardian.
The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords.
Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks.
Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palest­in­ian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Bri­tain, who failed in Iraq, come and — with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair — be our guardian as if we were minors?”
Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled to Israel on Monday, Trump questioned whether Blair would be popular enough with other leaders to serve on the board that the US president envisages overseeing the governance of Gaza.

Trump reignited his trade war with China on Friday, accusing Beijing of imposing “extraordinarily aggressive” new export curbs relating to rare earths. He announced extra levies — plus export controls on “critical software” — due to take effect from Nov 1, and threatened to cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump claims US wants to help China, not hurt it

On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Commerce called Trump’s tariff threat a “typical example of ‘double standards’”. The ministry said Washington had ratcheted up economic measures against Beijing since September.
“Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,” it said in an online statement.
 
 

Chinese goods currently face US tariffs of 30pc under levies that Trump brought in while accusing Beijing of aiding in the fentanyl trade, and over alleged unfair practices.
China’s retaliatory tariffs are currently at 10pc.
China dominates global production and processing of these materials, and on Thursday announced new controls on the export of technologies used for the mining and processing of critical minerals.
 
 

Rare earths have been a major sticking point in recent trade negotiations between the two superpowers. They are critical to manufacturing everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to military hardware and renewable energy technology.
Later, in his post on Truth Social, President Trump said, “The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”, adding that President Xi Jinping “… doesn’t want Depression for his country”.

• UN terms Afghan restrictions on women ‘gender apartheid’
• India’s Ministry of External Affairs denies any role in Friday’s press interaction at Afghan embassy
A PICTURE is worth a thousand words — and the image splashed across Indian newspapers on Monday, showing female journalists seated prominently in the front row at the Taliban foreign minister’s press conference in Delhi, perfectly embodies that sentiment.
The conference — Amir Khan Muttaqi’s second press event at the Afghan embassy within 48 hours — was convened following widespread outrage over the exclusion of female journalists from his initial briefing on Friday, BBC News reported.
Mr Muttaqi said at Sunday’s conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not “deliberate”.
“With regard to the [Friday’s] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific.
“It was more a technical issue… Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,” he added.
The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid,” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement.
The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world.
 
 

Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government.
New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country.
The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives.
On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy.
However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.”

• Police say inspector martyred; around 50 cops badly injured in violent clashes
• Conflicting reports emerge about fate of TLP chief; IGP says Saad Rizvi ‘not in custody’
• Second-tier leaders call on TLP supporters to converge on Lahore for protest on 17th
LAHORE: The fate of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi remained shrouded in mystery after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours.
According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road.
By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.
There was, however, a significant discrepancy in casualty reports, with local media reporting a few deaths and dozens of injuries, while social media was rife with exaggerated claims.
Nevertheless, Punjab Police confirmed the death of Inspector Shehzad Nawaz, who they said was shot during the operation. Local media reports said that at least four people, including the police officer, had been killed and 56 others injured.
Unverified social media posts, however, claimed the toll among TLP supporters was far higher, with some alleging “dozens if not hundreds” of deaths — claims dismissed by Punjab’s police chief, Dr Usman Anwar, as “baseless rumours” and “a conspiracy to evoke public sympathy”.
Adding to the uncertainty were unverified reports about the fate of Saad Rizvi, which spread rapidly across social media and WhatsApp groups on Monday. Several posts alleged that Mr Rizvi had been shot and was in critical condition, while other accounts claimed that he had been taken into custody.
Interestingly, despite its active online presence, the TLP’s official accounts and spokespersons remained conspicuously silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying rumours about their leader’s condition or whereabouts.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had not been arrested, nor injured in Monday morning’s clashes.
Ripples across the country
By mid-morning, the unrest had spread to several other parts of the country. In Lahore, hundreds of TLP supporters took to the streets, blocking key intersections and damaging vehicles in protest at what they called a “brutal crackdown”.
In Burewala, five police officers, including a deputy superintendent, were injured when TLP activists clashed with local law enforcers.
In Faisalabad, demonstrators blocked the Chenab Chowk for nearly two hours, forcing the Government College University Faisalabad to postpone its scheduled examinations.
 
 

Further south, dozens of protesters obstructed the national highway at Mian Channu for half an hour, while in Bahawalnagar, TLP members blocked the Bahawalnagar–Head Sulemanki Road near Minchinabad, prompting another round of arrests and the registration of criminal cases under multiple charges.
In Karachi, similar scenes played out as TLP activists organised protests in North Karachi and New Karachi to denounce the police action in Punjab. Fear and uncertainty gripped the city as demonstrators blocked major thoroughfares and clashed with police.
West Zone deputy inspector general Irfan Ali Baloch said protesters had set up sit-ins at 4-K Chowrangi and Sindhi Hotel, where they blocked roads and attacked police with stones, injuring two constables.
“The police responded with tear gas and arrested five of them,” he told Dawn. “The situation was brought under control and traffic resumed.”
Late on Monday night, Mufti Wazeer Ahmad Rizvi, a member of the TLP’s Majlis-e-Shura (executive committee), released a video message urging party supporters to end their agitation, clear all roads, and await further instructions. “We will announce our next strategy soon,” he said.
Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, the group’s Balochistan emir, also called on protesters to disperse and converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar shrine on Oct 17.
Stalled negotiations
Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down.
“The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.”
According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made.
When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz.
‘State brutality’
Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists.
Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force.
However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”.
“Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

• FO tells Kabul to ‘mind own business’ after Mujahid’s comment on TLP protests
• Cross-border trade, travel remain suspended
ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism.
On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend.
 
 

Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border.
Speaking on Geo News, Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.”
Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.
At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night.
Mediation offers
For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’.
“I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel.
“I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said.
China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia.
The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated.
‘Mind your own business’
On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul.
“War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital.
But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters.
Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.”
While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters.
Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal.
However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday.
Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.—Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed

• Phenomenon likely to disrupt Kharif crop harvesting, raise Glof risk
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is likely to face one of its coldest winter this year in decades due to the La Nina climate pattern.
According to the latest situation report on Pakistan’s monsoon floods, compiled by the Intersector Coordination Group in collaboration with other partners, this could lead to colder-than-usual winter conditions, further stretching coping  mechanisms of households affected by the floods, particularly in the mountainous regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan.
A La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cool abnormally, triggering extreme weather shifts worldwide.
 
 

In its forecast for October, the report published by UN-OCHA says that the continued marginally negative phases of both the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole will drive rainfall across Pakistan.
Northern Punjab, KP, AJK, and GB are likely to witness below-normal rainfall, while southern areas like Sindh, Balochistan, and southern Punjab may receive near-normal precipitation, it noted.
According to the report, the expected impacts of this phenomenon include possible disruptions to Kharif crop harvesting due to isolated storms, increased risk of dengue outbreaks in stagnant water conditions, higher chances of glacial lake outburst floods in upper areas, reduced river inflows affecting irrigation, elevated smog and air pollution in plains, and adverse effects on livestock health and fodder availability due to above-normal temperatures.
The report also takes stock of the deteriorating post-flood situation, especially in the context of “a diminishing response capacity both by government and humanitarian partners”.
“Despite robust response by local and international actors at the onset of the crisis, three months since, the presence of humanitarian partners and response capacity on the ground decreased.  Pre-positioned stocks and initial emergency funds were used, with humanitarian partners now seeking additional funding for sustained interventions to ensure provision of basic services during the transition period from a humanitarian response to that of early recovery,” the OCHA report says.
Of particular concern is the long-term damage to livelihoods, which threatens recovery and self-sustainability. Crop fields were flooded, devastating harvests, livestock and fodder were swept away, and farm machinery and agricultural tools were damaged or destroyed, wreaking havoc on livelihoods and chances of restarting income generating activities in the near future.
 
 

According to a recent geo-spatial impact assessment conducted by FAO in flood affected areas, flood waters inundated around 1.2 million hectares in Punjab, the country’s food basket, damaging major rice, cotton, and sugarcane fields. The disaster coincided with the critical window for Rabi crop planting, further threatening food security and livelihoods and the ability to bounce back.
Remaining stagnant water in some flood-affected areas is also of concern as it causes significant health risks, including outbreaks of waterborne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid, as well as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, which thrive in these conditions.
 
 

With over 229,760 damaged or destroyed homes, many families continue to sleep outside, with little protection from the elements or vector-borne diseases carried by mosquitoes.
Schools and health facilities have lost essential supplies and damaged or covered in thick mud preventing the resumption of classes or provision of health services. Food and fodder stocks were either washed away or now lay waterlogged and rotten, increasing food insecurity and reliance on humanitarian food rations.

Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony.
Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal.
“Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.”
’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“
PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”.

“You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added.
The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership.
 


“Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.”
“Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.”
Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.”
PM meets other leaders
PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt.
Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan.
Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.
 






The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East.
 






The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’.
Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people.
 






During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people.
“Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said.
“Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.”
The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts.
He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them.

Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”.
“Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X.
“It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”.
He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”.
Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations.
The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices.
The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media.
Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit.
“No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday.
Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:06</small></div><hr>
