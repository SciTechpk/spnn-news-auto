The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed by 941.79 points, or 0.82 per cent, to stand at 116,411.13 from the previous close of 115,469.34 at 10:05am.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Stronger-than-expected corporate results from heavyweight companies fuelled a surge in the index at the opening.”
“Meanwhile, the absence of further escalation in tensions between Pakistan and India helped prevent panic selling in the KSE-100,” he added.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted that the country’s monthly current account remained “in a comfortable position”, in addition to corporations “posting strong profits”.
In other positive developments, Farooq added that inflation was at a record low, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) stood at 101.
“The market opened slightly higher today, supported by relief that no major escalation occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend [following the Pahalgam attack],” he added.
“With most market participants expecting interest rate cuts ahead, there is potential for a rerating of the market’s PE [price-to-earning] multiple,” he said.
“However, a significant upward move will likely require de-escalation between India and Pakistan.”
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, also attributed the positive momentum to “dust settling down” between Pakistan and India after the Pahalgam attack, with  “no major incidents” supporting market recovery.
AKD Securities noted that the market had remained volatile last week due to escalating geopolitical tensions following the Pahalgam attack, and India’s subsequent suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan in the aftermath of the incident, undermining investor sentiment.</p><small>2025-04-28 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/680d36cf049b3.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906744/water-disputes-and-ecological-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>Water disputes and ecological challenges</strong></a><br><p>Opting for consensus rather than contention, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari agreed to go forward with the controversial Cholistan canal only if the provinces agreed. Previously, the military-backed Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) had become a political flashpoint, with protests escalating across Sindh.  
Critics have warned that the canal projects threaten ecological stability, violate interprovincial water agreements, and risk displacing communities, all without sufficient consultation or safeguards. It is not only the farmers and the people who are affected; it affects all living creatures associated. 
“This is not a people-centred initiative. It’s a for-profit scheme for cash crop irrigation,” says Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr., an environmental activist. He emphasised that when river water stops reaching the sea, it breaks the hydrological cycle. “We are the birds and trees. We depend on the land being affected.”
Environmentalists argue the Indus ecosystem has already been pushed to the brink. “We’ve destroyed natural habitats across the Indus Basin,” says Adil Mansoor, a researcher in farm economics. “The floods of 2010 and 2022 showed us that the cultivation of riverine and belt areas has severely obstructed natural water flow.”

‘The capital outlay and recurring operational costs are prohibitive — without sustained subsidies, the Cholistan canal project is unlikely to remain viable’

The GPI, a multi-billion dollar national programme, aims to cultivate desert land by irrigating state-owned wastelands through new canal infrastructure. The plan spans multiple provinces, including the Cholistan Canal in Punjab, Chashma Right Bank Canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kachhi Canal in Balochistan, and Thar and Rainee Canals in Sindh. In theory, it promises reduced food imports, increased exports, and job creation in underdeveloped regions.
Defending the project, Major-General (retd) Shahid Nazir, Director General of GPI, framed the initiative as a national necessity in the face of rapid population growth and intensifying climate stress. “Our top priority is to produce enough wheat domestically,” he says, adding that the project also aims to boost cotton-based textile exports from over $20 billion to between $25-35bn.
Mr Nazir outlined additional goals such as reducing the $5.5bn edible oil import bill by cultivating canola, sunflower, and maise; increasing livestock production for Gulf markets; and launching community-led honeybee, trout, and sheep farming projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan. “Once crops reach the market, the exportable surplus will further benefit the economy,” he said.
He also insisted the project avoids displacing small farmers. “We are cultivating state-owned wastelands, not private farms. Provinces will retain land ownership,” he said, clarifying that the Green Corporate Initiative, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, will manage operations. 
Land allocations include 811,000 acres in Punjab, 52,000 in Sindh, and 26,000 in Balochistan, with 170,000 acres already under cultivation. “Ninety-nine per cent of partner firms are locally owned,” he added, rejecting speculation about foreign takeovers. “Agreements have already been signed with Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan,” Mr Nazir said. “Others, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, are in process.”
However, concerns persist that such large-scale desert farming requires continuous subsidies to remain viable, an approach that has only succeeded in places like Saudi Arabia and Egypt under heavy state investment. “It may be technically executable on paper, but it is economically unsound,” says Mr Mansoor. “The capital outlay and recurring operational costs are prohibitive. Without sustained subsidies, the project is unlikely to remain viable.”
Mr Mansoor added that the Cholistan region receives minimal rainfall and that its historical rivers, Sutlej, Jhelum, and Beas, were already diverted under the Indus Waters Treaty. “This project involves lifting and channelling water from the Indus, most likely the Chenab, over 300-400km into Cholistan.”
Dismissing these notions, however, Mr Nazi said these canals would draw directly from the Indus. “There is no canal drawing water from the Indus River for these projects,” he says. “The Cholistan Canal will originate from the Salwan Headworks, built on a river carrying about 300,000 acre-feet of excess monsoon water from India, which otherwise often causes flooding and devastation in Sindh.”
Although Mr Mansoor acknowledged that the project’s request for one million acre-feet (MAF) is relatively modest compared to Pakistan’s annual 100 MAF allocation, he cautioned: “Once cultivation begins, deserts may demand more water than anticipated. Without structural safeguards, water might be redirected to politically or economically prioritised projects, undermining lower riparian protection.”
Mr Bhutto pointed to declining glacier formation and rainfall since the construction of the Tarbela and Kotri Dams in the 1970s. “Even Mangla Dam, so far upstream in Kashmir, has reached dead levels. If we don’t have water that far north, how can we expect to divert water to Cholistan and still have enough left for Sindh?”
A spokesperson for the Sindh government, Mustafa Baloch claims that in 2023–24 alone, Sindh experienced a 40pc water shortage, a continuation of a decades-long pattern. Historical data shows that from 1999 to 2023, Sindh suffered a 19.4pc water deficit compared to Punjab’s 13.7pc. Meanwhile, environmentalists argue that letting river water flow into the sea is essential, not wasteful. “When river water reaches the sea, it creates fertile coastal lands,” Mr Bhutto said. “Egypt’s Nile Delta is more agriculturally productive because fresh river water pushes seawater back, creating suitable conditions for multiple crops year-round.”
Yet historical mistrust continues to cloud federal-provincial relations. Activists argue that decisions are being made without consultation or transparency. “There’s no clarity on who the experts are or how decisions are being made. If experts were consulted, we don’t know who they are,” said Mr Bhutto.
Even within provinces, inequality persists. “Tail-end farmers in Sindh suffer far more than landlords at the canal heads,” says Mr Mansoor. “There may be enough water in the system — it’s the distribution that’s unequal. But it’s easier to blame ‘the other’: at the national level, that’s India; at the provincial level, it’s Punjab.”

Senior PPP leaders Nasir Shah, Saeed Ghani, Waqar Mehdi, Sohail Siyal and others arrived at the temporary headquarters of the MQM-P in Bahadurabad.
During the meeting, both sides discussed political cooperation, urban development issues in Karachi and future coordination between the two parties.
The session was marked by an atmosphere of goodwill with leaders on both sides recognising the importance of continued dialogue.

Nasir Shah-led delegation visits MQM-P headquarters

Later, speaking to the media after the meeting, PPP’s Nasir Shah confirmed that the party leadership had sought support for Mr Mehdi for the Senate seat that fell vacant after the death of senior PPP leader Taj Haider.
“We are thankful to MQM for their cooperation, especially on the canal issue,” he said. “We are hopeful that MQM will support our candidate in the upcoming by-election.”
MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar emphasised the need for continued political engagement. “Politics is all about dialogue. PPP is our ally in the federal government, and we were also partners during the PDM-led government,” he said.
“There should be flexibility in our approach, and we must move discussions forward,” he said.
Dr Sattar also highlighted the need to revisit the past agreements between the PPP and the MQM.
He stressed the importance of continued informal dialogue on key issues such as water scarcity, constitutional amendments and the local government act. “Karachi’s issues require collective focus, and we must sit together regularly to find solutions,” he said.
He told reporters that the MQM-P filed nominations of Nighat Shakeel and Mujahid Baig for the Senate by-election. “We have received a formal request from the PPP. Our central committee, under the leadership of Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, will deliberate and finalise this matter,” he said.
To a question, Nasir Shah said: “If the decision regarding the six canals project on the Indus River is not reversed at the May 2 meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), the PPP will consider parting ways with the federal government.”
“We are not in the coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz by choice, but out of necessity for the sake of Pakistan. The  canals issue is highly sensitive and that the party cannot back down on this matter,” he said.
He reiterated that PPP had always advocated for development and cooperation. He acknowledged the visible progress in development work.
He also thanked MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal for acknowledging that Karachi received federal funding during Asif Ali Zardari’s tenure. “This meeting is a gesture of goodwill and a step toward strengthening ties between our two parties,” he said.

• Tarar accuses New Delhi of sponsoring the attack
LONDON: As tensions between Pakistan and India rise in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistani diaspora protesters came face to face with their Indian counterparts outside the missions of both countries in central London, over the weekend.
The scenes outside the Pakistan High Commission in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, on Saturday and the Indian High Commission in Aldwych on Sunday showed that emotions are running high, with both sides chanting derogatory slogans and making offensive gestures against each other.
Met Police confirmed in a statement that officers were called at 5:03am on Sunday to reports of a man smashing windows at the Pakistani High Commission and that a 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of criminal damage and remains in custody. Eyewitnesses said eggs and saffron dye were also thrown at the embassy walls.
On Sunday, a handful of Pakistani protesters countered a sizeable number of Indian protesters, who were also joined by pro-Israel protesters who chanted anti-Pakistan slogans.
 
 

Outside the Pakistan mission, Pakistani protesters set up a chai stall in reference to the viral line by Indian pilot Abhinandan, who in 2019 was held captive by the Pakistan army when his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory and later repatriated. One gentleman stood on the balcony of the Pakistan mission and waved a cup of tea.
One eyewitness said that a pro-BJP group decided to initiate the anti-Pakistan protest outside the Pakistan mission, calling on scores of protesters. To counter the protest, PML-N’s UK chapter staged a counter-protest and used a sound system to drown out the anti-Pakistan slogans.
At both protests, Met Police officers stood forming a protective line between the two sides as anger and derogatory slogans were chanted. Indian protesters carried “I am Hindu” placards and waved empty water bottles, saying “do you want water”, referring to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.
Music was also blared by both sides, with the Pakistani protesters saying “Pak Fauj Zindabad” and “ISI Zindabad”. Anti-Modi and anti-Hindu slogans were also shouted, with Palestine flags and Pakistan flags waved together.
A pro-India protester was detained after making rude gestures and reportedly making racist comments. Indian protesters claimed that Met Police officers were being racist and that they pushed the protester “without listening”, adding that no one was arrested.
One Indian protester said the Met Police sides with Pakistan during the protests. Another said, “They have challenged Modi openly, now they will see the consequences.”
‘India responsible for attack’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar has accused India of being responsible for the attack on the Pakistan High Commission in London.
Speaking to reporters about the Pahalgam incident in Islamabad, Mr Tarar accused India of using its “extremist ideology” to encourage people to attack Pakistan’s foreign missions.
“A very unfortunate incident took place in London. Our high commission was attacked twice, and stones were thrown,” the minister said. “The people who are responsible are being sponsored by Indian agencies and the Indian state.”
Mr Tarar said that suspects had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police but highlighted that the incident was a product of the “kind of mindset that the Indian state has”.

At a time when external pressures threaten to compromise access to shared water resources, domestic discord, such as the infighting over the Cholistan canal project, only deepened Pakistan’s vulnerability. The nation can ill afford to be divided over water policy when the very lifeline of its people is at stake as a matter of national survival.
It’s a welcome relief that, following the meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto, the government has paused canal construction pending consensus in the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
The Cholistan canal project sparked an unnecessary political row, distracting from Pakistan’s real existential threats: a looming water crisis, crumbling irrigation systems, and escalating climate change. Ironically, experts question the logic of building canals in a desert — an impractical and unsustainable venture.

A slew of measures costing a fraction of mega‑canal budgets can be implemented immediately and unite provinces

The federal government agreed to open talks with the PPP over the contentious Cholistan canal project after tensions within the ruling coalition came to a breaking point. What began as a technical debate morphed into a political standoff, with Pakistan emerging as the ultimate casualty. 
Launched under the Green Pakistan Initiative in early 2025, the project relies on sporadic floodwaters while overlooking Sindh’s chronic water shortages, evident in Kotri Barrage’s declining average flows (14.035 million acre-feet [MAF] vs 26.807 MAF pre-1999). As of March 13, Tarbela’s reservoir was barely above dead level, and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has warned of up to a 35 per cent water shortfall in the final stretch of the Rabi season.
Sindh’s leadership accused the federal government of unilaterally undermining the 1991 Water Apportionment Accord. In response, PMLN leaders invoked Punjab’s traditional role as the federation’s “elder brother,” offering vague assurances that all “technical hurdles” will be “addressed and removed.” 
Yet by bypassing the Council of Common Interests, the federal leadership only intensified provincial distrust. When the Cholistan canal was inaugurated, few anticipated the risk that it could fracture Pakistan’s delicate federal balance. Within weeks, the Sindh Assembly passed a unanimous resolution condemning the project for violating the Water Accord and endangering Sindh’s lifeblood. 

While political actors clash, Pakistan as a nation is losing ground in the most existential battle of our times — water security

Bilawal BhuttoZardari has threatened to withdraw PPP support from the federal coalition. PTI MNAs joined Sindh’s protest with a National Assembly resolution as highways were blockaded, courts boycotted, and Sindh’s commerce halted.
Rather than convene the CCI — the constitutional forum for interprovincial disputes — the federal government opted for an Irsa certificate in January 2024, approved by a 4:1 majority that excluded Sindh’s dissenting member. The Sindh High Court has asked the federal government to appoint a federal member from Sindh in the Irsa, after a petition was filed in the court that appointments made to the Irsa were not being made in accordance with the law. 
However, Prime Minister’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah dismissed objections as mere “technical issues” to be “addressed and removed,” while Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari chided critics, insisting “Punjab has always played the role of an ‘elder brother’ and has never been unjust”. Such brinkmanship has politicised a vital watersharing question, turning what should be a policy dialogue into constitutional brinksmanship.
While political actors clash, Pakistan as a nation is losing ground in the most existential battle of our times — water security. Classified among the countries facing extremely high water stress, Pakistan withdraws more than 60pc of its available resources annually, far exceeding sustainable thresholds. A UNWater report places Central and Southern Asia, home to Pakistan, among regions with water stress above 25pc. The Global Climate Risk Index ranks Pakistan as the world’s fifth most climatevulnerable country, warning that rising temperatures and erratic monsoons threaten agriculture, livelihoods, and coastal communities.
Pakistan’s irrigation network — the world’s largest contiguous system of canals — loses an estimated 30–40pc of diverted water to seepage and evaporation due to poor maintenance and silting. The dilapidated minor canals forced farmers to rely on costly tubewells, deepening rural poverty, by increasing financial burdens on smallholders and exacerbating environmental issues like groundwater depletion. Yet the government’s focus is on grand new projects rather than rehabilitating existing infrastructure.
Pakistan has witnessed increasingly severe floods, prolonged droughts, and retreating glaciers. The 2022 floods affected 33m people, underscoring the increasing severity of climate change and the need for resilient solutions. By prioritising a contentious canal project, the federal government has not only alienated Sindh but also squandered political capital that could have tackled systemic issues as discussed below.
Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation can cut water use by up to 60pc while boosting yields, and it is ripe for rapid scaleup in both Punjab and Sindh.
Canal Lining and Desilting of the centuryold network could recover over 30pc of conveyance losses, improving downstream equity without new diversions.
Rainwater Harvesting and Groundwater Recharge through tubewells and recharge wells in Cholistan can sustain local communities and wildlife, reducing stress on river flows.
Biosaline Agriculture of salttolerant crops provides livelihoods on marginal lands without tapping fresh water, offering a sustainable alternative to desert irrigation.
These measures cost a fraction of megacanal budgets, can be implemented immediately, and unite rather than divide provinces.
The canal standoff has frayed trust across Pakistan. Some fret that a PPP withdrawal could topple the coalition, although others believe that the PPP would never rock the boat and go against the establishment. With the next general elections on their minds, both PMLN and PPP have treated the canal issue as a question of political survival rather than a critical national issue.
Ultimately, Pakistan’s real defeat lies in neglecting its water future. By turning the Cholistan canal into a political football, leaders have been distracted from systemic weaknesses — acute water stress, crumbling infrastructure, and a warming climate that imperils every citizen. If Pakistan hopes to stave off ecological and social collapse, it must abandon divisive megaprojects in favour of consensusdriven, sciencebased water management. 
Only through transparent interprovincial dialogue, strict adherence to the 1991 Water Acc­ord, and rapid deployment of lowcost, highimpact solutions prepared by experts and scientists can the Indus remain our shared lifeline — and Pakistan emerge as the true winner of its most urgent challenge.

Officials said that an improvised explosive device was used to target a car at Muskan Chowk of Pishin town of Gwadar district late night, resulting in the killing two security personnel travelling in the car while another man was injured.
“The car was blown up and badly damaged in the powerful blast, causing panic among the people of Pasni town,” a senior police officer said, adding that soon after the blast the personnel of law enforcement agencies rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and injured to the district hospital.
 
 

The deceased were identified as Nawab Salman, a resident of Pasni, and Muhammad Nawaz, a resident of Khushab district of Punjab.
Also, some armed men hurled hand grenades at the Police Lines area of Dhahar in Kacchi district and at a livestock office in Sibi. However, no loss of life was reported in the grenade attacks.

A senior official told Dawn that Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the power division — had been in contact with Punjab’s energy department for completion of formalities to file tariff reduction applications before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
He said the CPPA management to the government that the case for approval of revised tariffs with Punjab’s two plants was included in the agenda of the provincial cabinet well before Eidul Fitr. “The CPPA has reported that approval from the Punjab cabinet has not come through as of April 25, despite reminders,” the official said.
Punjab government’s two LNG-based plants at Bhikki and Trimmu are among the most efficient plants with plant efficiency beyond 61pc. The 1,180MW Bhikki plant had come into operation in 2018 and its remaining 18-year term expires in 2043 while the 1,262MW Trimmu plant that started commercial operations in May 2023 can continue to operate till 2048.

Federal govt awaiting approval to file tariff reduction pleas before Nepra

The official said the power division and PM office had conveyed their displeasure to the CPPA for the ongoing delays and had also taken up with the provincial government for early clearance.
![ .](https://www.dawn.com/news/19063510
He said the task force on power producers had concluded the revised terms with all the four LNG-based plants — two plants belonging to federal and provincial governments each — about two months ago.
The centre had not only secured federal cabinet approvals but also filed tariff reduction petitions with Nepra that had already conducted public hearing last week. The federal government had expected that regulatory process for all four similar plants to conclude simultaneously if not jointly. However, the provincial approvals are still not available.
The sources said the combined savings from Bhikki and Trimmu was estimated at about Rs596bn over their remaining useful life of 18 and 23 years, respectively. The change in terms of their contracts included a ‘hybrid take-and-pay’ model instead of existing ‘take-or-pay’ model, reduction in rate of return and a cap on dollar indexation at Rs168.
The government claims a total of Rs2.162 trillion savings from six government-owned power plants which also include two above projects of the provincial government. It claims Rs1.567tr savings from four federal projects with a cumulative capacity of about 3,700MW — two LNG-based project at Balloki and Haveli Bahadurshah of around 1,220MW each, 747MW Guddu power project and 510MW Nandipur power project.
 
 

Following revised agreements secured by the taskforce, Nepra announced that it had decided to discontinue dollar-based indexations for these plants, transitioning instead to rupee-based indexations fixed for the entire useful life of the power projects.
“This strategic revision aims to curb foreign exchange exposure and reduce tariff volatility for consumers,” it said, adding that it also capped the indexation for Operations & Maintenance (O&M) costs to 70pc of rupee devaluation, down from the previous 100pc.
Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) structure has been rationalised and the plants will now receive 35pc of the ROE as fixed, with the remaining 65pc linked directly to the actual operation of the plant.
The revised O&M shall be indexed quarterly.
Under the deal, the applicants agreed to implement a ‘hybrid take-and-pay model’, whereby tariff payment to the company shall be made by the CPPA as follows: “from the effective date, prorated for remaining period of the current agreement year, and thereafter for every agreement year, the company will be entitled to 35pc of revised RoE components of tariff as part of CPP.
From the effective date, in case the despatched and delivered Net Electrical Output (NEO) of the company exceeds 35pc of the total contract capacity in terms of kWh, the company will be entitled to receive RoE components of tariff, which shall be calculated on the actual NEO exceeding 35pc of the total contract capacity in terms of kWh and the company shall claim the differential CPP accordingly.
The government claims about Rs3.5tr savings through revised power purchase agreements with 29 IPPs and GPPs over remaining useful life.

But despite this, a number of citizens were seen crossing the border back into Pakistan while preparations for the ceremony were underway, something of an anomaly as crossings usually end well before the retreat ceremony begins.
Following the cancellation of visas on both sides, Indian and Pakistani nationals have thronged the Attari-Wagah crossing to return to their respective countries before May 1.
Given the glut, authorities on both sides have allowed people to cross over, in some cases even moments before the final ceremony begins and the gates are closed for the day.

Emotions run high during ‘beating the retreat’ ceremony; glut witnessed at border ahead of May 1 deadline for expiry of visas

In the last four days, more than 800 Indians have left Pakistan, while about 700 Pakistanis have returned from India.
 
 

On Sunday alone, 236 Pakistanis returned home and 115 Indians crossed into their homeland.
The Rangers and Ind­ian security forces were thoroughly checking their documents before allowing them to proceed with immigration.
The visitors arriving from India, however, are not allowed to interact with the media.
In the aftermath of the attack in held Kashmir, the tension among the crowds is palpable, with people seated in the viewing pavilions — located on both sides of the border — turning up to show loyalty and support for their respective countries.
Engrossed in their bid to outmatch each other amid the din of music and sloganeering, most the visitors on the Pakistani side did not seem fazed by the lack of space — due to ongoing construction work at the viewing pavilion.
For most of them, it was the experience of being present at the ceremony that took primacy.
The retreat ceremony is held at Wagah-Attari every evening, just before sunset. It is jointly performed by Pakistan’s Punjab Rangers and India’s Border Security Force.
 


The drill involves synchronised stomps, high-kicks, and theatrical standoffs between soldiers and ends with a coordinated lowering of the flags and a handshake between soldiers.
Over recent days, Pakistan and India have downgraded ties, traded fire at the Line of Control and suspended trade following the Pahalgam shooting, which claimed the lives of over two dozen tourists.
With India baying for blood following the terror attack and Pakistan paying back in the same coin, the public present at the Wagah ceremony were visibly roused.
“Today, I have come to witness the parade, especially to see the spirit of our soldiers… I am happy to see not only that the soldiers have high spirits but the public present here is backing up the armed forces in the face of any possible misadventure by India,” Sikandar Sultan, who was visiting from Lahore, said.

Ali Asad, who was accompanied by friends, said this was not his first time visiting the border for this ceremony.
“…a friend of mine who visited yesterday here told me that it is going on as usual, rather more passionately. I had been here before, but today I enjoyed it more because of the fervent involvement of the fellow visitors,” he said.
“India should learn from the past and come out of the war mentality. It should talk to Pakistan to resolve the issues between the two countries, and that is the only feasible solution,” he told Dawn.
On the other side of the border, Indians were as ardent. “It just fills you with passion and patriotic pride”, Simarjeet Singh, 17, from the nearby Indian city of Amritsar, told AFP news agency.
“There were people from all over who looked and dressed different but were cheering and screaming at the same time — for our country and the soldiers,” Mr Singh said, who came with his friends from college.

KT Ramesh, 57, from Kozhikode in the southern state of Kerala, told AFP that even the scaled-down ceremony “was worth it”. “There was no shortage of passion among our people,” he said.
He said that he’d “seen anger” about the attack in Kashmir “in whoever I spoke with, from our hotel staff to the taxi driver and other tourists here”.
“We don’t like a war but this time we must teach them a lesson,” he told AFP.
Interestingly, some foreigners were also present at the ceremony on both sides.

The incident occurred around 8pm local time as the Lapu Lapu Day Block Party, attended by 100,000, was wrapping up. Police said a 30-year-old man from Vancouver, known to police in prior contexts, was arrested at the scene after being apprehended by bystanders.
Authorities said the suspect drove a black SUV through a bustling section of the festival, striking numerous people before coming to a stop. Interim Police Chief Steve Rai said victims were transported to multiple hospitals, but refrained from speculating on the final injury count, citing respect for the families and the investigation.
Police said “at this time” they are confident this was not an act of terrorism and that the major crime section is leading the investigation.
Eyewitnesses described scenes of chaos as the vehicle barrelled through food stalls and vendor tents.
Videos circulated online showed emergency crews attempting resuscitation efforts on multiple victims, while debris and personal belongings lay scattered across the street.
Among the dead was at least one child, according to initial police reports. The driver’s motivations remain unclear.
Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim said he was “shocked and deeply saddened” by the tragedy.

The arrests were carried out across  multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian, and Kulgam, according to the Kashmir Media Service.
In the Islamabad district of held-Kashmir alone, cordon-and-search operations and house raids resulted in the arrest of over 175 people. The detainees have been transferred to police stations and army camps.
A police spokesperson said that 175 individuals had been detained during house raids and search operations across various areas of the district, adding that additional checkpoints had been set up and patrolling had been intensified, particularly in densely forested regions.

More than 2,000 people picked up, shifted to police stations, army camps

Following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian troops and paramilitary forces escalated operations across the valley, carrying out widespread house raids and arbitrary arrests.
 
 

Indian forces have also launched a campaign of demolishing the homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris. Since Saturday, the ancestral homes of seven  Kashmiris have been destroyed using explosives by Indian forces, the Kashmir Media Service reported.
On the other hand, the houses of five more Kashmiris were demolished in what critics described as ‘collective punishment’.
The demolished houses belonged to the families of Amir Nazeer Wani, Jameel Ahmad Sher Gojri, Adnan Safi Dar, Amir Ahmed and Farooq Ahmad Tedwa. High-intensity explosives caused extensive damage to surrounding homes, leaving dozens of families homeless and in distress.
Critics accuse Indian authorities of mimicking Israeli tactics of occupation and dispossession to render Kashmiris homeless and break their resistance to Indian rule.
Abdul Rashid Minhas, a spokesman for the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), condemned the demolitions and arrests in a statement issued in Srinagar.

Speaking at a news conference, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Moha­mmed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani reported “a bit of progress”, in response to questions about reports of a meeting in Doha between Israel’s Mossad spy agency chief David Barnea and the Qatari prime minister.
“We need to find an answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war.
That’s, that’s basically, I think, the key point of the entire negotiations,“ Sheikh Mohammed added.
Qatar, alongside Egypt and the United States, brokered a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza which came into effect on January 19 but which did not bring a complete end to the war.
 



Toll surpasses 52,000 after the deaths of nearly 700 ‘missing’ Palestinians confirmed

The initial phase of the truce ended in early March, with the two sides unable to agree on the next steps. Israel resumed air and ground attacks across the Gaza Strip on March 18 after earlier halting the entry of aid.
Sheikh Mohammed met Barnea in the Qatari capital to discuss a potential prisoner deal on Thursday, according to Israeli media.
“The meeting that took place on Thursday is part of these efforts where we’re trying to find a breakthrough,” the Qatari prime minister said without further elaborating on the details of the meeting.
Hamas is open to an agreement to end the war in Gaza that would see all Israeli prisoners released and secure a five-year truce, an official said on Saturday as the group’s negotiators met in Cairo.
The Qatari PM said efforts were focused on the “best comprehensive deal possible that ends the war, brings the Israeli prisoners out and not dividing (a deal) into other phases.” Hamas has insisted that the negotiations should lead to a permanent end to the war.
According to the Palestinian group, it rejected an earlier Israeli offer that included a 45-day ceasefire in exchange for the return of 10 living prisoners.
50 more killed in a day
According to Al Jazeera, the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks since Sunday dawn across Gaza rose to at least 50 Palestinians.
The Palestinian health ministry announced on Sunday that the death toll from the war had risen to more than 52,000 people, after hundreds previously listed as missing were confirmed dead.
“An additional 697 martyrs have been added to the cumulative statistics after their data was completed and verified by the committee monitoring missing persons,” the health ministry said in a statement, giving the overall death toll of 52,243.
Several United Nations agencies that operate in Gaza have said the ministry’s data is credible.
One hospital in the Palestinian territory confirmed the data and elaborated on the process.
“The families of those initially reported missing had informed authorities of their disappearance, but their bodies were subsequently recovered — either from beneath the rubble or from areas previously inaccessible to medical teams due to the presence of the Israeli army,” said Khalil al-Daqran, spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.

Escalating tensions have pushed the subcontinent into uncharted territory heightening the risk of a full-blown crisis as bilateral mechanisms are cast aside and diplomatic relations further downgraded.
Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India announced a raft of punitive measures against Pakistan. They included suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers between the two neighbours. Other steps involved closing the Attari border crossing, cancelling visas and shrinking the size of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
These so-called retaliatory steps were taken without any investigation into the terrorist incident and absent any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement. The Indian foreign secretary’s announcement only mentioned “cross-border linkages of the terrorist attack”. But an orchestrated campaign in the Indian media pointed the accusing finger at Pakistan.
 
 

More significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of “unimaginable punishment” for the attackers and their backers. This intensified speculation in India that his government was planning some kind of kinetic action to avenge the killings. It recalled memories of the 2019 Balakot crisis when Indian planes crossed the border to launch strikes inside Pakistani territory ostensibly against militant hideouts. Pakistan retaliated by air strikes in Jammu. The crisis was defused with the help of friendly countries after Pakistan repatriated an Indian pilot captured when his plane was shot down by Pakistan.
Islamabad’s response to India’s April 23 announcement was carefully calibrated to match Indian moves. A statement issued after a meeting of the National Security Committee announced a slew of retaliatory actions. It described Indian measures as “unilateral, unjust and irresponsible”. It rejected the Indian decision to suspend the IWT and warned any attempt “to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” will be “considered an act of war and responded with full force”. Pakistan, it said, reserved the right to hold “all bilateral agreements with India”, including the Simla Agreement, “in abeyance” but stopped short of suspending any. Pakistan also shut down the Wagah border crossing and its airspace to Indian overflights as well as halted all trade. These steps mostly mirrored Indian actions.

Escalating tensions have pushed the region into uncharted territory and towards a full-blown crisis.

India’s announcement about putting the IWT “in abeyance” was not made in a vacuum. For the past several years New Delhi has been raising doubts about the fate of the 1960 treaty, that has for over six decades survived wars, confrontations and tensions to provide a framework for water-sharing.
The two countries disagreed in recent years over the treaty’s dispute settlement mechanism. India, for example, boycotted a court of arbitration hearing in January 2023 at The Hague on Indian hydroelectric projects on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers disputed by water-stressed Pakistan. It wanted a neutral expert instead. In January 2023, India notified Pakistan of its intention to amend the treaty’s dispute settlement provisions. Islamabad responded at the time by expressing willingness to discuss any concerns in the relevant body, the joint Indus Waters Commission, while calling on India to comply with the treaty.
 
 

In August 2024, New Delhi formally asked Islamabad for a review and renegotiation of the IWT. In its communication to Pakistan, India called for modifying it on grounds of what it called “fundamental and unforeseen change” in circumstances as well as security concerns. It mentioned concerns over issues including “demographic changes, environmental challenges, and the need to accelerate clean energy development”. India’s letter of April 24 to Pakistan echoed the same points but significantly added “sustained cross-border terrorism by Pakistan” as justification for putting the treaty in abeyance.
India’s decision to suspend the treaty is neither consistent with treaty provisions nor international law. The treaty does not allow either party to unilaterally put it in abeyance or abrogate it. Both parties have to consent to any treaty modification or its termination according to its provisions. India’s announcement says the IWT “will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
For now, abeyance means India will cease sharing water flow data and exchanging information about project designs. But it already stopped doing that years ago. It can take other steps to mount pressure. But India cannot immediately halt the flow of water or significantly divert it as it lacks the infrastructure at present to do so. So, the near-term impact of this action will be limited. Of course, in the longer term it has serious implications.
The imminent danger is from any military action New Delhi is tempted to take, encouraged by what its officials see as ‘effective’ Indian coercive diplomacy in play, which needs reinforcement. Modi’s speech in Bihar on April 24 in which he said terrorists and their backers will be pursued to the “ends of the earth” is being widely construed as strong indication of that possibility. Speculation is running rife that conventional kinetic strikes may be combined with cyberattacks and asymmetrical actions by India.
Already deployment of heavy weaponry is reported close to the Line of Control and international border. Prime Minister Modi may think he can borrow from the Israeli playbook to ‘punish’ Pakistan but any Indian kinetic action will be met by a strong military response from Pakistan, with uncertain and unpredictable consequences for New Delhi. This will likely set off an escalatory cycle and trigger an all-out crisis, which could be on a larger scale than what happened in 2019.
 
 

In 2019, a third party helped to defuse the crisis. Will this happen again? If no such help is forthcoming in a timely way it would make the situation between two nuclear neighbours more dangerous than in the past.
The notion of limited war waged under the nuclear threshold is fraught with untold risks. Such a scenario should be avoided at all costs. Even though there is little appetite for this by the Indian side, a backchannel must be re-established without delay to avoid any miscalculation, manage the crisis and prevent it from spinning out of control. The alternative is too terrifying to contemplate.

Most headed home with more questions than answers.
Many participants in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Spring Meetings had a sense that Trump’s administration was still conflicted in its demands from trading partners hit with his sweeping tariffs.
During the whirlwind week, many finance and trade ministers sought to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other key Trump administration officials, to no avail.

Foreboding persists as financial leaders unable to meet Trump admin officials

Those that did were often told to be patient — even as the clock steadily ticks down on the 90-day pause Trump had granted on the steepest levies.
“We know that they think — that it won’t be that bad,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski.
“They think it’s a short-term pain, long-term gain. And I’m afraid that we’ll have short-term pain, long-term pain.”
 
 

The Trump administration’s most substantial trade negotiations during the week were with Japan and South Korea, but the results were inconclusive as Bessent cited “productive” talks with both countries.
The IMF took a slightly more optimistic view of the economic fallout from the US tariffs, slashing growth forecasts for most countries in its World Economic Outlook but stopping far short of predicting recessions — even for the US and export-dependent China.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged that member countries were anxious about the uncertainty shock to a global economy buffeted by pandemic, inflation and wars but held out hope that trade negotiations would ease the tariff strains.
Several finance officials told Reuters that odds of recession were higher than the IMF’s 37 per cent chance, citing private sector forecasts.
Debt risk rises
Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based nonprofit group advocating debt relief, said that the IMF’s forecasts were clearly aimed at preventing market panic, even as officials in private meetings expressed concerns about new debt crises emerging.
“It was a do-nothing kind of week,” LeCompte said, adding that debt discussions were inconclusive and overshadowed by tariff talks.
Reza Baqir, a former Pakistan central bank governor who now heads sovereign debt advisory at Alvarez & Marsal, said: “For many developing countries, especially in the Global South, there is a real sense of despair that the agenda on Financing for Development is really not center-stage. And who is going to be there to champion that debate?”
World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill also sounded an alarm on rising debt levels for emerging markets, noting that tariffs had prompted a sharp slowdown in trade and foreign direct investment that are crucial to developing country growth.
No US withdrawal
Policymakers did breathe a sigh of relief when Bessent expressed US support for the IMF and the World Bank, declaring that they have “enduring value” but criticising their “mission creep” into climate, gender and equality issues.
Participants at the meetings, along with financial markets, were encouraged by Bessent’s comments early in the week that US tariffs on Chinese goods and vice versa were unsustainable, suggesting a deal to ease them could be reached soon.
But China denied Trump’s assertions that tariff negotiations were underway with Beijing, adding to the confusion over tariffs.

• Kh Asif calls for int’l probe
• No official word on Nawaz-Shehbaz huddle
ISLAMABAD: The country’s political leadership continued to engage with foreign capitals over the weekend to highlight India’s attempts to cloak its provocative actions and false accusations in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
In separate calls with leaders from China, UK and Iran, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar drew attention to the “baseless propaganda and unilateral measures” taken by New Delhi, including the decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which is a clear violation of the country’s international obligations.
Mr Dar, who also hold the foreign affairs portfolio, spoke to his counterparts from the UK and China and stressed Islamabad’s unwavering resolve to defend its national interests, while continuing to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Mr Dar that Beijing was paying close attention to the evolving situation between Pakistan and India.
He reaffirmed China’s consistent support for Pakistan’s firm counterterrorism efforts.
 
 

“As an ironclad friend and an all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and supports Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty and security interests,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
“China advocates for a swift and fair investigation and believes that conflict does not serve the fundamental interests of either India or Pakistan, nor does it benefit regional peace and stability,” Wang noted.
The Chinese foreign minister, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China’s Central committee, hoped that both sides would remain restrained, move toward each other, and work together to de-escalate the situation.
In a separate call with the UK foreign secretary, Mr Dar briefed David Lammy on “India’s false accusations, baseless propaganda, and unilateral measures”, while reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to a Foreign Office readout of the call, the UK foreign secretary emphasised the imp­o­rtance of de-escalating the situation thro­ugh dialogue and peaceful resolution of issues.
Appreciating these efforts, Mr Dar conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to participate in any independent and transparent investigation to ascertain the facts.
Both leaders agreed to maintain active contact regarding the evolving situation.
Call for int’l commission
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khaw­aja Asif called on India to stop levelling baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, he said the UN Security Council and key regional powers should investigate the Pahalgam incident, warning that if two nuclear powers collided, world peace would also be destroyed.
Calling for the formation of an international commission to investigate the incident, he said that the UN should consider including China, Russia, Iran and Arab countries in the body. Who could better understand the issue than the UK, he said, referring to the region’s colonial past.
He accused Indian PM Narendra Modi of staging a political drama to save his skin, just as he had done after the Pulwama incident in 2019.
Call with Iranian president
Speaking to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the prime minister shared Pakistan’s position on India’s provocative actions, adding that Pakistan desired peace in the region and would welcome it if Iran also wanted to play a role in this regard.
During their call, the two leaders exchanged views on recent developments in the region, a PM Office statement said. Both also extended invitations to each other to visit their respective countries.
Referring to India’s unilateral decision on the Indus Water Treaty, PM Shehbaz said the use of water as a weapon was unacceptable and Pakistan would defend its right at all costs.
The PM said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, reaffirming that the country had no linkage, either direct or indirect, with the Pahalgam attack, adding that Islamabad was ready for a neutral investigation into the incident.
PM Shehbaz also conveyed Pakistan’s condolences on the loss of precious lives in the tragic explosion at Bandar Abbas, which claimed dozens of the lives and left more than 500 people injured.
 
 

Pakistan stood with the brotherly people of Iran at this difficult hour and would extend all possible assistance, the PM said.
Separately, media reports suggested that PM Shehbaz Sharif had met his elder brother, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, at Jati Umrah on Sunday to brief him on the Pahalgam attack and its aftermath.
However, there was no official word from the PM Office or PML-N circles in this regard.

• Condition applies to both contract, regular re-employment after age 60
• Move aims to curb rising pension costs under IMF requirements
• Govt pension bill estimated at over Rs1tr in current fiscal year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has formally notified that retired public servants rejoining government service, whether on a contract or regular basis, will now have to choose between drawing a salary or receiving their pension and may no longer claim both simultaneously.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” said a notification issued by the regulation wing of the Ministry of Finance.
Earlier, rehired government employees used to avail of the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously — and in some cases, multiple pensions. This not only had an additional financial burden on the government exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
The latest measure is part of pension reforms the government has taken in hand to contain ever-increasing pension liabilities, a key requirement of the IMF programme.
 
 

The measure was initially announced by the then finance minister Ishaq Dar in the 2022-23 budget, but it could not be implemented until reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget before the IMF signed off a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel — may be further delayed until 2026 despite a notification for its implementation with effect from June 2025, according to sources.
In September last year, the government notified the introduction of a contributory fund scheme for new entrants in the civil government and armed forces. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance said last year that federal government employees would contribute 10 per cent of their respective basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc of the basic pay of the employees.
According to the Sept 3, 2024, notification, the scheme would apply to civil servants joining after July 1, 2024, and armed forces personnel appointed after July 1, 2025. The government has allocated Rs10 billion for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget.
The scheme had been introduced on the advice of the international lending agencies, particularly the World Bank, to contain rising pension liabilities described as a “ticking bomb”. The new scheme does not apply to existing employees. The government believes the contribution pension fund would slow down the growth in pension liabilities in future budgets.
The federal government’s total expenditure for pensions has been estimated at Rs1.014 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from Rs821bn in FY24, up by almost 24pc in a single year. This included pension liabilities of the armed forces at Rs662bn for the current fiscal year, up from Rs563bn, showing an increase of about 18pc.
On the other hand, the pension expenditure of civilians has been budgeted at Rs220bn for the current year against Rs228bn last year, a reduction of 3.5pc.
Subsequently, in January this year, the government notified further pension reforms, including abolishing multiple pensions and shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of the past 24 months of salaries instead of the last pay drawn before retirement.
It had been notified that “in the event where a person becomes entitled to more than one pension, such person shall only be authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”.
This was subject to the provision that “where a federal government employee becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee shall not be eligible to receive such pension”.
However, certain quarters were still pushing for a salary for re-employment and one pension.

• Ports anticipate crisis; manufacturers face raw material shortages
• President wades in to resolve situation
KARACHI: Efforts to disperse protesters, who have paralysed cross-country traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh, remained futile on Sunday, with manufacturers saying they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The road closures in several parts of Sindh are due to continuing protests against the controversial proposal to build new canals on the River Indus.
Although the federal government and the PPP regime in Sindh have agreed to postpone the project, nationalist parties, lawyers and other civil society groups do not appear convinced by the assurance and have vowed to continue their protests until the government makes the postponement official.
According to Dawn’s correspondent in Sukkur, thousands of heavy vehicles are stuck in long queues on different roads in the Kandhkot, Kashmore, Ghotki, Sukkur and Khairpur areas.
Manufacturers and transporters are surprised by the persisting impasse, even though the provincial government has been calling on protesters to clear the roads.
 
 

On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, where the issue of the controversial projects and its fallout also came under discussion.
Sources privy to the meeting said the chief minister expressed concern over attempts by some political parties to exploit the issue for what he termed “vested interests”, referring to the ongoing protesters, staged mainly by nationalist parties in different parts of the province.
The CM also briefed the president about measures the Sindh government was taking to address public concerns and restore normalcy in affected areas, sources said.
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House at 4pm today (Monday).
Transport at a standstill
An official at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) told Dawn that export cargo was not arriving, while imported cargo was piling up and not moving out of the port due to the closure of roads in Sindh.
“We are managing this situation to avoid congestion at the port, especially with the continuous arrival of imported goods . But in case goods movement remains held up, the port will face severe congestion, the official said.
Transporters say that in addition to worrying manufacturers and exporters, their drivers and helpers are also in a dire situation. Nisar Jafry of the All Pakistan Goods Transporters Associa­tion said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded.
He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be their meant for import, export or locally produced.
Giving an estimated headcount, he said that around 90,000-100,000 drivers and their helpers have been stranded alongside their vehicles on the highways for over 10 days now. They are also facing food and water shortages.
 
 

Transporters also alleged that protesters had damaged dozens of vehicles parked on the roads, and that over 100 sacrificial animals that were part of their cargo had already died.
Mr Jafry said he had received a call from Sindh transport minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, requesting him to call off Monday’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Memon called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Due to the closures, the public, livestock, import and export sectors, farmers, and the poor are being severely affected, he said, adding that if the sit-ins must continue, the roads should be opened so that the flow of traffic is not hampered.
Representatives of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Oil Companies Advisory Council and the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council have all warned that the disruptions to the logistics supply chain are creating a severe crisis.
Although around 800-1,000 oil trucks are also stranded, the OCAC representative ruled out the possibility of a fuel shortage just yet.

Between February 1 and April 20, 2025, election tribunals decided 24 petitions related to the 2024 general elections, bringing the total number of decided petitions to 136, or 36.5 per cent of the total 372 matters being heard across four provinces. Of these, 26pc relate to Nati­onal Assembly seats and 42pc to provincial assembly seats.
Of the 24 petitions decided, 21 were from Punjab, two from Baloc­histan, and one from Sindh. In Punjab, two tribunals in Lahore decided eight cases, one in Rawa­lpindi decided seven, and one in Bahawalpur decided six.
The two tribunals in Quetta disposed of one case each, while a tribunal in Karachi disposed of only one case. No petitions from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were decided during this period.
 
 

Despite an increase in the number of petitions decided in Punjab compared to previous months, the overall pace of decisions has slowed, Fafen said.
This may be because four tribunals remained largely dysfunctional during the reporting period, including two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one in Punjab, and the sole tribunal of the Islamabad Capital Territory.
To date, Balochistan’s three election tribunals have collectively decided 43 (83pc) of the total 51 petitions filed for national and provincial constituencies in the province. Punjab’s eight tribunals have decided 66 (34pc) of 192 petitions. Sindh’s five tribunals have decided 18 (22pc) of 83 petitions. KP’s six tribunals have decided nine (21pc) of 42 petitions.
Of the 136 petitions decided so far, 133 were dismissed and three were accepted. Among the 133 dismissals, 52 were dismissed on non-maintainability grounds, including 10 related to National Assembly constituencies and 42 to provincial assembly constituencies.
Petitioners
The independent candidates supported by PTI make the largest group of petitioners, with 55pc of total petitions filed by them, followed by PML-N candidates (13pc), PPP candidates (8pc), unaffiliated independent candidates (7pc) and JUI-F candidates (6pc).
As many as 16 other party candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 11pc of the petitions.
Around 56pc petitions of independent candidates, 50pc of PPP candidates, 42pc each of PML-N and JUI-F candidates, and 58pc of those by other parties have been decided so far.
The returned candidates belonging to PML-N make the largest group of defendants with 39pc of the petitions challenging their victory, followed by PTI-backed candidates (16pc), MQM-P candidates and PPP candidates (13pc each), unaffiliated independents (6pc), and JUI-F (5pc).
As many as 11 other defendant parties’ candidates cumulatively acc­o­unt for the remaining 8pc petitions.
Around 58pc petitions filed against unaffiliated independents, 45pc against PTI-backed independents, 39pc against JUI-P candidates, 36pc each against PML-N and PPP candidates, 27pc against MQM-P candidates, and 21pc against other parties’ candidates have been decided so far.
Appeals
According to the Fafen report, 54 decisions of election tribunals have been contested before the Supreme Court. Among these, three appeals were initiated by the winning candidates against whom election petitions were accepted.
Additionally, 51 appeals have been filed against the rejection of election petitions by respective election tribunals. Among these, four have been heard and dismissed by the Supreme Court. The remaining 47 appeals are still under adjudication.
Of the 51 petitions filed against the dismissal of election petitions, 11 were lodged by losing candidates of the National Assembly elections. Similarly, 40 were submitted by losing candidates of provincial assembly elections, including 24 from Balochistan, 12 from Punjab, and four from Sindh.
Among the 51 appeals filed against the rejection of election petitions, 22 have been filed by PTI-backed independent candidates, six by PPPP candidates, five by the PML-N candidates, four by JUIP candidates, three by independent candidates, and two each by the National Party, Awami National Party, and Jamhoori Watan Party candidates.
Similarly, one petition each was filed by candidates from the Hazara Democratic Party, Balochistan National Party, Balochistan National Party Awami, Khadameen-i-Sindh, and Balochistan Awami Party candidates.
In terms of the respondents, 25 appeals were filed against the winners of PML-N, six against PPP, five against independent candidates backed by the PTI, four each against the MQM-P, JUI-F, and unaffiliated independent candidates, two against National Party, and one against the winner belonging to Balochistan Awami Party.

Muhammad Farooq Naseem, Founding 
Chairman and CEO of DWP Group

 
Muhammad Farooq Naseem started his entrepreneurial journey with the establishment of a television assembly plant that has since diversified into different businesses. With a turnover of $150 million, his DWP Group now employs around 5,500 people in its four business verticals: home appliances; MEP or mechanical, electrical, and plumbing services; cement; and information technology (IT) services.
“It was our collaboration with Samsung that threw us into a bit more prominence,” the founding chairman and chief executive officer of DWP Group told Dawn in an interview, reminiscing about how his “small company was discovered” by the Korean brand he helped establish in Pakistan back in 1999.
By the time a legal dispute forced him to exit his partnership with Samsung, he had already formed a new collaboration with one of the top, globally reputed Chinese home appliance manufacturers, Gree, to locally assemble a whole suite of consumer electronics.
“In the last five years, we have invested heavily in localisation that has created a very large value addition. We have complete manufacturing facilities because we are now component manufacturers for a lot of things,” Mr Naseem noted. “It has given us a big competitive advantage over our local competitors.”

Global evolution in the energy paradigm, the rise of digital technology and automation, and the extensive use of data could make or break countries like Pakistan in the near future

That said, the journey hasn’t been without difficulties, with the most formidable challenge being Pakistan’s recurring macroeconomic upheavals. The latest round of the ‘bust cycle’ that hit the country back in 2022 has been the worst he has ever seen.
“It was a roadblock you suddenly hit without really seeing it coming when you were driving at a speed of 100 miles an hour,” he said. “I’ve seen the currency go up and down; I’ve seen Pakistan being put through nuclear tests and things of that sort. But this was way beyond that: this was a tidal wave, a tsunami that had hit you.”
The home appliances market shrank by about 40-50 per cent (due to skyrocketing prices and rapid currency depreciation that massively reduced the purchasing power of middle-class consumers). On top of that, the liquidity crunch led the government to restrict imports as the State Bank’s international reserves depleted amid fears of a sovereign default.

‘Comparing IT with the rest of the industries, the negative list is much smaller to work with and can be easily converted into exportable income for this country very quickly’

“We also had to curtail our footprint drastically. Luckily, because the company is not leveraged much, we were able to survive the downturn. As a company, I think we did a great job because we survived the crisis without losing any real money. Now that the government has managed the downturn to a certain extent and the markets are normalising, we are back and investing again into new business opportunities.”
Are the bad times behind us? “I think that’s a bigger question than DWP Group as a commercial entity, because, as you know, the real issues stem from country risks, whether they are macroeconomic imbalances or security matters which are not currently highlighted. I don’t think it’s completely over.
“But for now, fortunately, the economy is starting to pick up; our businesses are also reflecting that sentiment. We see this segment growing because home appliances are about the emergence of the middle class and the level of urbanisation. These aren’t luxury items anymore. When you talk about refrigerators, it’s about food security. When you talk about television, it’s the first level of entertainment in somebody’s home. So, if you’re going to talk about uplift or the emergence of the middle class, which other countries have experienced, then our products are right in the middle of it.”
His company is now making strides in increasing exports, especially in the IT sector. “What we’re discovering is that the products that you make are not competitive (in the world markets) because the import costs are very high. I think we’ve missed the boat there because for that you needed to invest heavily into heavy industries like steel and plastic.
“That brings you to the virtual world: the IT services. That’s where we see the opportunity for export growth. As a Pakistani company, we are investing and aligning ourselves with the competitiveness of our people and their ability to leapfrog. If you talk purely in technological terms, the world is going through multiple fronts of technological disruption,” he explained.  
As of late, the DWP group has expanded its IT operations to the Middle East and North America. “We’ve also invested in a tech fund in which we are tapping into the new talent in frontier technologies. Yes, we are lacking certain talents, but those talents can be harnessed because at the moment we have a huge cost advantage over others, including India. But it’s not something we can say will perpetuate. It could very much evaporate. At the moment, the biggest problem is the internet. You want to have an IT future as a country, and your internet speed is not up to par.”
Emphasising the importance of IT, Mr Naseem argued that the issues facing the industry are easier to fix. “When you compare IT with the rest of the industries, the negative list is much smaller to work with. It is fixable, and it can be converted into exportable income for this country very quickly. It is a low-hanging fruit. If you were to fix Pakistan’s industrial policy, it would be a nightmare, but if you were to fix Pakistan’s IT competitiveness, that is easily fixable,” he concluded.
Mr Naseem believes that in the next 10 years the world is not going to look anything like the one that we know of. The changes, like a shift in the energy paradigm — how energy is created, distributed, and stored — the rise of digital technology and automation, and the extensive use of data could help countries, like Pakistan, bridge the gap of competitiveness. Adversely, these could also widen the competitive gap if we fail to adapt to these changes.
But do we still have time and opportunity to take advantage of technology? “There is always time. The question is: are you, as a country, ready for a transformation that requires national resolve? You are a country of 250m with one of the youngest populations in the world. But, if we look at our overall policy framework, we don’t see any focused effort to move into, say, new energy like solar, wind power, etc. Neither do we see any efforts to train our human resources to become part of the digital revolution going around,” Mr Naseem observed.
Yet, he believes there is hope: “The future frontier is something that we need to plan now. And that is what we see as an opportunity.”

A mega overseas convention will be held every April to recognise the important role of the 10 million diaspora spread across 160 countries.
In an article, ‘Rethinking the diaspora’s role’, analyst Durdana Najam wrote that the state, and its various departments, view overseas Pakistanis as critical stakeholders and are ready to reset the relationship based on terms that go beyond mere transactions.
When the country’s financial health is on the line, she said, mobilising one of the most resourceful segments of Pakistanis makes strategic sense. 
The growth in remittances has far outpaced the trade deficit during this fiscal year, which underlines the critical support these flows are providing to the current account.

With foreign investment having bottomed, analysts argue that remittances should be channelled into productive sectors to boost output and exports 

Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate, which gauges the currency’s value against a basket of foreign currencies adjusted for inflation, improved to 101.62 in March 2025 from a revised 102.25 in February, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan on April 17.
Following the significant improvements in the external sector, Fitch Ratings has upgraded the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating by one notch to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’, with a stable outlook.
The prime minister has pledged to personally oversee the investments of overseas Pakistanis in the country. “I will be your CEO. My cabinet and our business community will ensure that your investments are protected and facilitated,” he assured them. On another occasion, he added that the government will provide facilities to them for investment in the country according to their expertise.
However, media coverage of the convention did not reveal any inclination on the part of the 1,200 participants from across the world to set up manufacturing units or invest in their motherland’s farm economy, note analysts at Dawn. 
Remittances have also been a double-edged sword, the analysts argued. They help us pay our burgeoning import bills and compensate for the dwindling foreign official and private inflows as well as stagnating exports. But they are largely responsible for the rapid increase in imported consumption, unplanned urban sprawls, currency volatility, anti-export bias, etc.
Even more significant, the dependence on remittances has had a major role in crowding out manufacturing and exports, leading to deindustrialisation over more than a decade.
The share of remittances in the country’s GDP has increased from one per cent in 2000 to around 9pc; more than the share of exports.
No doubt remittances are widely recognised for their significant role in achieving the current level of macroeconomic stability. Even critics agree.
In March 2025, remittances reached a record $4.1 billion in a single month. Over the first nine months of the fiscal year, remittances have jumped by 33pc, totalling $28.1bn.
In the same month, Pakistan’s current account recorded a surplus of $1.2bn, the highest ever on record for a single month, compared with a $363m surplus recorded in the same month a year earlier and a deficit of $97m in February 2025. 
This takes the cumulative surplus for 9MFY25 to $1.86bn, a sharp reversal from the $1.65bn deficit during the same period last fiscal year.
The State Bank now expects to receive $38bn in remittances, up from the previous projection of $35bn this year, and hopes to raise foreign exchange reserves to $14bn by the end of June 2025 despite significant debt payments this year.
But, while the overall balance of payments during July-March remained positive, it turned negative for the fifth month during the outgoing year due to weakening foreign official and private inflows among heavy debt payments. The external sector stability is not durable, analysts say, founded as it is on factors such as a controlled trade deficit, unspoken import curbs, lower global oil prices, and most importantly, a massive and unexpected surge in remittances.
In the same period, it may be pointed out, that information technology exports surged by 23pc to record earnings of $2.83bn. And textile and clothing exports rose 9.38pc to $13.62bn in July-March FY25 from $12.44bn a year ago. But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has now lowered the projection of the country’s GDP growth by 0.4pc to 2.6pc for FY25 from 3pc estimated in January.
It is relevant to quote here the advice of IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva that countries must make the best of the new multipolar world.
With foreign investment having bottomed, analysts argue that remittances should be channelled into productive sectors to boost output and exports for a durable solution to the recurring balance-of-payments crisis by the creation of a business-friendly climate, tax reforms, policy consistency, etc.
Moreover, policymakers must also recognise that while remittances bolster the economy, true prosperity can only be achieved by creating conditions conducive to retaining our best and brightest brains, says a Business Recorder editorial.

Fifty years ago, the average Pakistani had a higher income than his South Asian peers. Today, he earns about half as much. What went wrong, and what must be done to turn things around?
The roots of Pakistan’s economic troubles go back decades. A booming population and poor economic management have combined to sap the country’s ability to save and invest. Compared to its neighbours — India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka — Pakistan’s living standards, healthcare, and education have all fallen behind.
One major issue is population growth. Pakistan’s population has quadrupled in the last 50 years, leaving the country with a much larger share of young, non-working dependents. That imbalance limits how much families can save, which in turn limits national investment. In countries like India and Bangladesh, the ratio of working-age people is much higher, supporting faster economic growth. Meanwhile, Pakistan struggles to keep up.
But demographics aren’t the only problem. Pakistan has also been plagued by chronic policy mistakes. Governments have repeatedly spent beyond their means, leading to mounting debt. Over time, interest payments have ballooned to the point where they now consume nearly 60 per cent of government revenue. This leaves little room for spending on health, education, or infrastructure.

The country’s saving rate could have been 10 percentage points higher if its working-age population ratio matched that of its neighbours

Foreign exchange shortages have triggered repeated economic crises, with Pakistan having to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) more than 20 times. The latest crisis erupted during the Covid-19 pandemic and worsened after the Russia-Ukraine war drove up oil prices. At one point, Pakistan had barely enough dollars in reserve to cover two weeks of imports.
In 2023, Pakistan secured another IMF bailout. That programme, and the subsequent one agreed last year, along with debt rollovers from international creditors and falling oil prices, helped stabilise the economy. Foreign reserves recovered somewhat, inflation cooled, and the rupee steadied. However, the IMF programme demands sharp tax increases and tight spending limits — an approach that critics say could choke growth and worsen social problems.
Instead, a different strategy is needed: one that prioritises more gradual but deeper tax reform and increased investment in health, family planning, and education — especially for women. Improving access to these services would boost productivity and help slow population growth, freeing up more resources for savings and investment. In turn, that would support faster economic growth over time.
There is no escaping the need to collect more taxes. Only one to two per cent of Pakistanis pay any income tax at all, and the government’s revenue receipts — at around 12pc of the GDP — are amongst the lowest worldwide. 
The agriculture, retail, and real estate sectors, which together constitute the bulk of the economy, are effectively outside the tax net. No country can function like this. So, tax reforms should aim to raise an extra 6pc of GDP over the next five years. Even if that is achieved, Pakistan would still rank in the lowest quarter of all countries in terms of tax receipts.
Only with more revenue can Pakistan afford to invest in key social sectors. Clawing back wasteful spending, such as subsidies for the well-to-do and the loss-making state enterprises, is a must. However, the savings from such efforts alone will not be enough to meet even basic social and infrastructure development needs.
With Pakistan also ranking among the lowest globally in terms of the government’s noninterest spending level (relative to the size of the economy), some of the tax revenue gains should be put back into the economy via spending to expand education and health access for those who lack it.
Key to this alternative strategy is international support. Without more low-cost loans (so-called “concessional financing”) from global institutions like the World Bank and countries that lend to Pakistan, the government will be forced to borrow from local and international markets at high interest rates. That would keep debt costs high and continue to crowd out private investment.
Addressing Pakistan’s population growth is critical. The country’s saving rate could have been 10 percentage points higher if its working-age population ratio matched that of its neighbours. More savings would mean more investment and faster growth. Better access to family planning, education for girls, and jobs for women could help Pakistan achieve this demographic shift, as seen in Bangladesh and other countries.
In short, Pakistan’s path to recovery requires more than just balancing budgets — it needs sustained investment in its people, smarter tax policy, and international cooperation. Without these changes, Pakistan risks being stuck in a cycle of crises for years to come. With them, a brighter economic future is possible.

“It needs to happen soon,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’. “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition.”
Rubio said the US would consider in the coming week whether to continue mediating talks “or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues”.
Trump and Zelensky, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met in a Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end Russia’s war with Ukraine.
 


The meeting was the first between the two leaders since an angry encounter in the Oval Office in Washington in February and comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to the conflict.
In a Truth Social post later on Saturday, Trump rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin over recent attacks on Ukraine, saying “there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.”
In a pre-taped interview that aired on CBS News programme ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would continue to target sites used by Ukraine’s military.
When asked about a Russian strike on Kyiv last week that killed civilians, Lavrov said “the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian” and that Russia only targets “sites which are used by the military”.
 


Zelensky wrote on the messaging app Telegram that his top military commander had reported that Russia had already conducted nearly 70 attacks on Sunday.
“The situation at the front and the real activity of the Russian army prove that there is currently insufficient pressure on Russia from the world to end this war, he said.
Differing proposals
Ukrainian and European officials pushed back last week against some US proposals on how to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, making counterproposals on issues from territory to sanctions, Reuters reported on Friday.
The primary areas of difference in the two proposals were over the sequencing for resolving questions over territory, the lifting of sanctions on Russia, security guarantees and the size of Ukraine’s military.
American proposals called for US recognition of Russia’s control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, as well as de facto recognition of Russia’s hold on other parts of Ukraine.
In contrast, the European and Ukrainian proposal defers detailed discussion about territory until after a ceasefire is concluded.
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that Ukraine should not agree to the US proposal, saying it went too far in ceding swathes of territory in return for a ceasefire.
Despite the divergent views, Trump’s national security adviser on Sunday said the meeting with Zelensky showed his determination to reach a deal.
“That meeting is going to go down in the history books for President Trump, to be a president of peace,” National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News’ ‘Sunday Morning Futures’.
Waltz said Trump has “expressed his frustration” at the leaders of both nations but remained determined to help negotiate an agreement. He also said the US and Ukraine would eventually reach an agreement over rare earth minerals and that talks continued over the weekend.
 


Democrats in the US Congress have criticised Trump’s approach to the conflict and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday that he was concerned Trump would “cave in to Putin”.
“To just abandon Ukraine, after all the sacrifice that they made, after so much loss of life, and with the rallying of the whole West against Putin, it would just be a moral tragedy,” Schumer said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’.
Schumer said siding with Russia in the conflict would tear apart alliances with Europe and embolden dictators around the world.</p><small>2025-04-27 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27211947ef83268.jpg?r=212015' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906915/iran-port-blast-death-toll-rises-to-40-as-fires-continue-blazing' target='_blank'><strong>Iran port blast death toll rises to 40 as fires continue blazing</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a powerful explosion at Iran’s biggest port of Bandar Abbas has risen to at least 40, with more than 1,200 people injured, state media reported on Sunday, as firefighters worked to fully extinguish the fire.
The blast occurred on Saturday at Shahid Rajaee Port in southern Iran, near the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world’s oil output passes.
The port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot. A regional emergency official said several containers had exploded.
The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.
However, Iran’s defence ministry denied media reports that the blast may be linked to the mishandling of solid fuel used for missiles. A spokesperson for the ministry told state TV the reports were “aligned with enemy psyops”, saying that the blast-hit area did not contain any military cargo.
Earlier, Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand, in a video shared on the government’s official website, gave on Sunday an updated toll of 28 people killed and more than 1,000 injured.
Live footage on Sunday showed thick black smoke still visible at the scene. “The fire is under control but still not out,” a state TV correspondent reported from the site around 20 hours after the blast.
The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard about 50 kilometres away, the Fars news agency reported.
Speaking on Sunday at the scene, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said that “the situation has stabilised in the main areas” of the port.
He told state TV that workers had resumed loading containers and customs clearance.
Images from Iranian news agency IRNA on Saturday showed rescuers and survivors walking along a wide boulevard carpeted with debris after the blast at Shahid Rajaee, more than 1,000km south of Tehran.
Flames could be seen engulfing a truck trailer and blood stained the side of a crushed car, while a helicopter dropped water on massive black smoke clouds billowing from behind stacked shipping containers.
“The shockwave was so strong that most of the port buildings were severely damaged,” Tasnim news agency reported.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered a thorough investigation to find the causes of the blast.
“Security and judicial officials are obliged to thoroughly investigate, uncover any negligence or intent, and follow up in accordance with regulations,” Khamenei said in a message carried by state television.
Mourning
Citing local emergency services, state TV reported that hundreds of casualties “have been transferred to nearby medical centres”, while the provincial blood transfusion centre issued a call for donations.
Saturday is the start of the working week in Iran, meaning the port would have been busy with employees.
Three Chinese nationals were “lightly injured”, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing its Bandar Abbas consulate.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly blast, adding he had “issued an order to investigate the situation and the causes”.
State TV reported, “The president is heading to the region to review the latest situation regarding the explosion at Shahid Rajaee Port in Bandar Abbas.”
The United Arab Emirates expressed “solidarity with Iran” over the explosion and Saudi Arabia sent condolences.
With choking smoke and air pollution spreading throughout the area, all schools and offices in Bandar Abbas, the nearby capital of Hormozgan province, have been ordered closed on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said.
The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and to use protective masks.
Authorities declared three days of public mourning across the province.
The state-owned National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company said in a statement carried by local media that the explosion “has no connection” to its facilities, reporting no interruption to its work in Bandar Abbas.
The explosion came as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress.
While Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the blast as an accident, it also comes against the backdrop of years of shadow war with regional foe Israel.
According to The Washington Post, Israel in 2020 launched a cyberattack targeting the Shahid Rajaee Port.
Putin orders Russian emergency planes to Iran
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered several planes to be sent to Iran to help deal with the aftermath of a blast at Iran’s port of Bandar Abbas, Russia’s emergency ministry said.
Putin has expressed his condolences over the loss of life and offered to provide help to Iran dealing with the aftermath of a blast, the Kremlin said. It said Putin had conveyed “words of sincere sympathy and support to the families of the victims, as well as his wishes for a recovery to all those injured.”
The emergency ministry said a Beriev Be-200 amphibious aircraft specialising in firefighting, as well as an Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane, would be sent to Iran to help out.

Needing only a point to ensure a record-equalling 20th English title with four games remaining, Liverpool were rocked in the 12th minute as Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham in front.

But the title party was only temporarily silenced as Liverpool struck back with a Luis Diaz tap-in, an Alexis Mac Allister thunderbolt and a Cody Gakpo shot before halftime.
A one-sided second half saw Mohamed Salah end a six-match scoring drought by firing a low shot past Guglielmo Vicario in the 63rd minute — celebrating his 28th league goal of an outstanding season by snapping a selfie with a fan.
Tottenham’s Destiny Udogie then bundled in an own goal to complete a miserable afternoon for the visitors, who have lost 19 Premier League games this season.
Liverpool, who have now matched Manchester United’s English titles record, have 82 points from 34 games played, with Arsenal a distant second on 67.
Dutchman Arne Slot is only the fifth manager to win the Premier League title in his debut season in English soccer and while it was a formality before kickoff on Sunday, there was still the small matter of Liverpool ensuring the cake was iced in front of their own adoring fans.
Five years ago, when Juergen Klopp’s Liverpool ended a 30-year wait for a 19th title, the Covid pandemic meant an anti-climactic finale inside an empty stadium. Sunday more than made up for that as the fans went through their choir book of club anthems.</p><small>2025-04-27 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2715362518d5198.png?r=153823' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906924/8-wounded-as-police-protesters-clash-near-karachis-gulshan-i-hadeed-over-canals-project' target='_blank'><strong>8 wounded as police, protesters clash near Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed over canals project</strong></a><br><p>Eight people, including two policemen and a lawyer, were injured and a police vehicle was torched in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed area on Sunday when police clashed with members of the legal fraternity during an attempt to end their five-day sit-in against the canals project, according to officials and witnesses.
Earlier this week, the government halted the controversial Cholistan canals project, which was inaugurated in February by Army Chief Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The decision came after months of protests, a unanimous Sindh Assembly resolution against the project, and concerns over India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. The government said work on the canals would remain on hold until a consensus is reached in the Council of Common Interests.
Despite the announcement, protests against the issue continued across several towns in Sindh on Saturday, alongside a strike called by Jamaat-i-Islami. Lawyers staged a sit-in at Babarloi in Khairpur district, and the demonstration in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed entered its fifth day today.
Karachi East-Zone DIG Usman Ghani told Dawn.com, “The police were removing tents blocking the main road in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed for the past five days when they came under attack by a lawyer, injuring a policeman, who in retaliation also injured the attacker.”
He added that the police “dislodged the tents from the road and registered an FIR (first information report) against the violent members of the crowd”.
DIG Ghani continued that the police and Rangers deployed at the site later came under stone pelting and baton charges by a mob, allegedly incited by members of the legal community, calling it “very unfortunate” behaviour from those expected to uphold the law.
He further recalled that three days ago, a sub-inspector of the investigation police was also attacked by members of the lawyers’ community while he was attending court. “The police have shown utmost restraint to avoid any untoward situation,” said the senior officer.
The DIG, however, emphasised that “given the current domestic and international cross-border terrorism and war threats, this repeated lawlessness by a community well-versed and sworn to uphold the law is unacceptable.”
He vowed, “It will be dealt with legally according to the emerging situation to uphold law and order and public safety. Law will take its own course.”
In response to a question, DIG Ghani confirmed that six protesters had been detained but were injured, so “we sent them to a hospital.” He clarified that no one was in police custody, but an FIR was being registered against them.
Meanwhile, Steel Town Police Station House Officer, Allan Khan Abbasi, told Dawn.com, “One policeman was injured in the morning while another was injured in the afternoon.”
“A police mobile was torched by the mob,” he added.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Khan told Dawn.com that when riot police attempted to disperse the protesters, they set the police mobile alight.
“It was completely destroyed by the time firefighters reached the scene,” Hassan said. “The remains of the torched vehicle were also destroyed by the mob.”
The rescue official added that no shops were set on fire, but rescue teams were informed that shops and other businesses in adjoining areas were forcibly closed.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar issued a statement today urging lawyers to protest peacefully.
“The Sindh government recognises the people’s right to peaceful protest, but the lawyers should keep an eye on miscreants around them,” he was quoted as saying.
The home minister assured that no action would be taken against people protesting peacefully and urged people to ignore “rumours”.
“I request that lawyers not cause problems for citizens,” he added. “Given the national situation and circumstances, we must promote unity.”
Meanwhile, a political worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told Dawn.com that early in the morning, when only a few protesters had gathered on a road linking the National Highway with the Superhighway near Gulshan-i-Hadeed, the police took action, resulting in injuries to one lawyer and the detention of several other protesters.
“The police removed the tents set up for the sit-in and cleared the road for traffic. However, lawyers and political workers mobilised their supporters through social media, urging them to join the protest,” he said.
The activist added that a few hundred people arrived and attacked the police with stones, damaging their vehicles.
“Over two hundred protesters later resumed the sit-in, blocking the link road again,” he said.
SHO Abbasi also confirmed that the protestors staged another sit-in on the link road in the evening.
The anonymous activist said that some lawyers visited Steel Town police station and met with Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi to “pacify” the situation.
“SSP Malir informed the lawyers that police had not taken action against the sit-in for the last five days,” the activist said. “But now, it was the government’s policy to vacate the highways and roads.”
Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) Secretary-General Dr Safdar Ali Abbasi,
in a statement, condemned the police crackdown on “peaceful protest sit-ins against the construction of canals and illegal land allotments in various cities of Sindh, which resulted in injuries and arrests of dozens, including lawyers”.
“Police action on peaceful protests by the Sindh government has revived the memories of dictatorial rule,” the statement quoted him as saying. “The protest movement ongoing in Sindh for the past eight months had remained peaceful.”
He claimed that there had neither been any damage across Sindh, nor stone pelting. “Not even a single vehicle window had been broken during the protests,” he added.
“The PPP is trying unsuccessfully to crush the peaceful movement through police brutality,” he said, urging the rulers to come to their senses and warning that such tactics would not suppress the ongoing movement.
Dr Abbasi vowed that peaceful protests in Sindh would continue.
“We demand the immediate release of all detainees. The legal fraternity is not alone and the people of Sindh stand with them.”</p><small>2025-04-27 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27193330fa04c8e.png?r=200452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906941/india-behind-attack-on-pakistani-high-commission-in-london-info-minister' target='_blank'><strong>India behind attack on Pakistani High Commission in London: info minister</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Sunday alleged that India was responsible for an attack on the Pakistan High Commission in London, amid raised tensions between both nuclear-armed nations.
According to The Express Tribune, the high commission was vandalised by a group of Indian protesters who threw saffron-coloured paint on the building’s exterior and smashed windows.  It said that hundreds of Indian protesters were gathered outside the Pakistani mission, while two individuals were arrested for their alleged involvement in the attack.
Addressing a press briefing for international media outlets about the Pahalgam incident in Islamabad today, Tarar accused India of using its “extremist ideology” to encourage people to attack Pakistan’s foreign missions.
“A very unfortunate incident took place in London, our high commission was attacked twice, and stones were thrown,” Tarar said. “The people who are responsible are being sponsored by Indian agencies and the Indian state.”
The minister said that suspects had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police, but highlighted that the incident was a product of the “kind of mindset that the Indian state has”.
He did not specify how many people had been arrested or give any further details about the attack.
“If you can kill people internationally in Canada and the US, then nothing will stop you from attacking a few foreign missions,” he said, referring to transnational assassinations of Sikh leaders.
 


During the briefing, Tarar highlighted weaknesses in India’s account of the Pahalgam attack, adding that they “jumped to conclusions” about Pakistan’s involvement.
“This Pahalgam episode to me seems like a distraction,” Tarar said, adding that Pakistan was seeing success against terrorists. “Pahalgam is more than 150 kilometres away from the Line of Control.
“Do you have credible evidence? Do you have any argument that is substantiated by proof?” he asked. “Why is it that the first information report … was registered in the Pahalgam police station within 10 minutes of the incident?”
Tarar explained that for an FIR to be lodged, officials must visit the area, collect evidence, conduct a complete scan of the scene, carry out forensic analysis, and account for the usual time lag between the occurrence and the registration of the report.
“Why is it that right after 10 minutes an FIR is registered and the blame is put on Pakistan?” he asked. “The reason that we have called for an independent, impartial and transparent inquiry is because our hands are clean. I think our eastern neighbour was quick to jump to conclusions.”
The minister echoed allegations by other Pakistani leaders that India was funding terrorist activities within Pakistan.
“Why was there hesitation on the part of our eastern neighbour to issue a simple statement of condemnation condemning the episode?” he asked, speaking about the attack on the Jaffar Express last month.
“Why is it that whenever we face terrorism and we counter terrorists and blood is spilt … why is it that the eastern neighbour always celebrates?
“There is a reason behind that … India is involved in state-sponsored terrorism.
“Had we not apprehended Kulbushan Jadhav, had we not obtained incriminating and irrefutable evidence against him, I would not have been making this argument today,” he said, referring to the Indian spy caught in Pakistan in 2016.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
 
 

Following the attack, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said Pakistan was open to any “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, criticising India for continuing with a “pattern of exploitation, levelling baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence”.
“Our valiant armed forces remain fully capable and prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity against any misadventures, as clearly demonstrated by our measured yet resolute response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019,” he added, referring to ‘Operation Swift Retort’.</p><small>2025-04-27 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27181146f025f21.jpg?r=181709' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>54 terrorists killed as infiltration attempt thwarted in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), this is the highest-ever number of khwarij killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“On night 25/26 and 26/27 April 2025, [the] movement of a large group of khwarij, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was detected by the security forces in [the] general area [of] Hassan Khel, North Waziristan District.
“[Our] own troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, all fifty-four khawarij have been sent to hell,” the statement added.
The ISPR added that a large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered from the slain khawarij, a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
“Intelligence reports indicate that this group of khawarij was specifically infiltrating on [the] behest of their ‘foreign masters’ to undertake high-profile terrorist activities inside Pakistan”, the ISPR statement read.
Referring to India’s “baseless accusations against Pakistan”, it added that such actions by Fitna al Khwarij — a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP — “clearly implies on whose cues FAK (Fitna al Khwarij) is operating”.
“Such actions amount to treason and betrayal against the state and its citizens,” said the press release.
Mentioning the National Security Council meeting that took place earlier this week to discuss a response to India downgrading diplomatic ties with Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, the ISPR highlighted how “distracting Pakistan’s security forces from their focus on the war against terror seems to be the strategic intent of India to allow a breathing space to FAK which is reeling from the onslaught of our Armed Forces resolute offensive against them”.
The ISPR commended “the exceptional professionalism, vigilance, [and] preparedness” demonstrated by security forces in preventing a “potential catastrophe”.
It asserted that the security forces of Pakistan “remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of terrorism.”
“Such bold and decisive actions further strengthen our collective resolve and underscore that Pakistan is winning the war against terrorism while achieving significant successes against terrorists”, the press release said.
On Saturday, the ISPR said that two soldiers were martyred and 15 terrorists killed in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A statement said the intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted on Friday and Saturday, and that eight terrorists were “sent to hell” after troops engaged them at their location during an IBO in Karak district.
Four more were killed by the security forces in another IBO in North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing stated. It added that troops “successfully neutralised” three more terrorists in another encounter in the South Waziristan district’s general area of Gomal Zam.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Lance Naik Usman Mohmand (age: 28 years, resident of Charsadda district) and Sepoy Imran Khan (age: 26 years, resident of Kurram district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR said.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-27 13:52</small></div><hr>
