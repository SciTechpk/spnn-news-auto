Shenkiari Station House Officer Muhammad Saqib told Dawn.com that a jeep heading towards the Jabori area fell into a ravine due to landslide debris following heavy rains on the road.
“The local people rushed to the scene after the accident and retrieved the victims from the ravine. Two of them were [found] dead,” he said, adding that four others were injured in the incident, including three children and a driver.
He also said that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Shenkiari Rural Health Centre, while two of the injured were later taken to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital for further treatment.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
Earlier this month, two people were killed and 24 others sustained critical injuries when a wagon carrying participants of a wedding procession skidded off the road and plunged into a deep ravine in Balakot.
At least two local tourists were killed in an accident after their car plunged into a ravine in the Kaghan area in June.
In April, five people were killed and eight others were injured when a passenger jeep plunged into a ravine in Mansehra’s Jabori area of Siren Valley.</p><small>2025-09-11 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11102022e453ee4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941167/security-forces-kill-19-terrorists-in-3-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 19 terrorists in 3 separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that an intelligence-based operation was conducted in KP’s Mohmand district upon the reported presence of terrorists there.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s* location, and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that another intelligence-based operation was conducted in the general Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan district, where, during the ensuing fire exchange, four more terrorists were neutralised by the security forces.
In another encounter that took place in Bannu district, one more terrorist was killed, the statement added.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the successful counter-terrorism operations.
According to Radio Pakistan, President Zardari said, in a statement, said the courage and professionalism of Pakistan’s brave soldiers continued to protect the nation from the scourge of terrorism.
“He emphasised that such operations demonstrate Pakistan’s unshakeable resolve to confront and defeat Indian-sponsored terrorism,” the report said.
Per the report, PM Shehbaz said, “The war against terrorism will continue until this scourge is completely eradicated from the country.”
“Officers and personnel of the Pakistan Army are tirelessly engaged day and night to foil the nefarious designs of the Khawarij and the Fitna of Hindustan,” he was quoted as saying.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan.  In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Last week, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
In August, security forces neutralised 50 terrorists during a four-day operation in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-11 07:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111208381f02ec9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941041/uzbekistan-airways-to-increase-flights-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Uzbekistan Airways to increase flights to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As part of efforts to deepen ties, enhance economic diplomacy and boost tourism cooperation, Uzbekistan Airways is increasing the number of regular flights between the two countries.
The Uzbek embassy in Islamabad said on Wednesday that Uzbekistan and Pakistan continued to strengthen their friendly relations and expand cooperation across multiple sectors. In this process, transport and logistics, particularly air connectivity, played a crucial role.
Starting October 28, the frequency of flights on ‘Tashkent-Islamabad-Tashkent’ route will be doubled, from once a week to two flights per week.
Currently, Uzbekistan Airways operated flights twice a week — on Wednesdays and Fridays — on the ‘Tashkent-Lahore-Tashkent’ route, and once a week (on Saturdays) on the ‘Tashkent-Islamabad-Tashkent’ route.
Due to consistently high demand, with flights running at full passenger capacity and tickets selling out several days in advance, the airline had decided to expand its flight schedule.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said increase in flight frequency would not only provide greater convenience for travelers but also foster closer trade and economic cooperation, encourage business partnerships and support more frequent exchanges between the two nations.
The embassy said these additional flights would also strengthen cultural and humanitarian ties between the brotherly peoples of Uzbekistan and Pakistan.
 
 

Furthermore, the expansion of flights offers significant advantages for international travelers. Tashkent International Airport serves as a strategic transit hub, providing convenient connections from Pakistan to destinations across Europe, North America, and Asia. This made Uzbekistan Airways an attractive option for passengers seeking smooth and efficient travel to global destinations.
According to the Uzbek embassy, the regular expansion of flight frequencies was a strategic step for both Uzbekistan and Pakistan, reflecting the growing partnership between the two nations and taking bilateral relations to a new level of cooperation and connectivity.

Vice President JD Vance was expected to attend memorial events at Ground Zero in Manhattan, where the World Trade Centre’s twin towers were destroyed in coordinated attacks that also saw a jetliner crash into the nerve centre of American military power, the Pentagon in Washington.
Another jet, Flight 93, crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside when passengers overran the hijacker and took control of the aircraft.
This year’s gathering takes place against a backdrop of sharp political division both in the city and nationally.
New York is in the grip of an unprecedented mayoral election campaign in which socialist Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing off against former governor Andrew Cuomo and sitting mayor Eric Adams.
 
 

New Yorkers go to the polls on November 4.
It was unclear which of the mayoral candidates would attend the ceremony, which is always attended by the sitting mayor as well as community leaders.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Mamdani, a Muslim and naturalised US citizen, calling him a “communist lunatic”, while one Republican lawmaker has called for the race’s frontrunner to be deported.
Mamdani holds a 22-point lead in the race, according to the latest polling from The New York Times and Siena.
“It was this horrific day that was also for many New Yorkers the moment at which they were marked an ‘other,’” Mamdani told The Times, describing the surge in Islamophobic attacks that followed 9/11.
It was unclear if Trump would attend New York’s commemorative events as he has in years past.
The United States has faced a rash of political violence in recent months, with the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk following the targeted killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and the firebombing of a Democratic governor’s residence.
 
 

New York will mark a citywide moment of silence at 8:46am (5:46pm PKT), the time that hijacked Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Centre.
Places of worship across the city will sound their bells to mark the impact as families of the victims read the names of those killed at ground zero.
The official death toll was 2,977, including the passengers and crew of the four hijacked planes, victims in the twin towers, firefighters, and personnel at the Pentagon. The death toll excludes the 19 Al-Qaeda hijackers.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11113512bfef699.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941184/china-inside-how-chinese-ev-tech-is-reshaping-global-auto-design' target='_blank'><strong>‘China Inside’: How Chinese EV tech is reshaping global auto design</strong></a><br><p>When Audi executives first saw the Zeekr 001 in 2021, a long-range electric vehicle with European aesthetics, it was a wake-up call for the premium German auto brand — if it wanted to compete with the Chinese, it needed their technology.
“The Zeekr 001 back then shocked quite everyone,” said Stefan Poetzl, president of SAIC Audi Sales and Marketing. “We needed to do something about it.”
To boost its EV lineup for Chinese consumers, Audi built the AUDI E5 Sportback in just 18 months using technology provided by Chinese partner SAIC, including batteries, electric powertrain, infotainment software and advanced driving assisted systems.
Audi expects to start delivering the $33,000 EV to customers in China this month and its global rivals are now also looking to use Chinese intellectual property to roll out new models rapidly.
Toyota and Volkswagen have joint development plans for China-dedicated models with technology from Chinese partners GAC and Xpeng, respectively.
Renault and Ford want to go one step further and develop global models on Chinese EV platforms, sources said. Renault did not respond to a request for comment. Ford declined to comment.
Such licensing deals make up relatively small but growing revenue streams for Chinese EV makers and, for now, offer a new quid-pro-quo. Global automakers need Chinese technology to leapfrog development hurdles and launch new EVs quickly.
Meanwhile, Chinese companies desperately need additional revenue amid a bruising price war at home and intensifying trade war abroad.
“It is a very smart, win-win solution,” said Will Wang, General Manager of Shanghai-based consulting firm Autodatas, which provides teardown reports of best-selling EV models.

‘China Inside’
This new strategy resembles the “Intel Inside” campaign of the 1990s — where US chipmaker Intel used state-of-the-art components to transform computers into premium products.
In this case, Chinese automakers sell EV technology in a box: the underpinnings for ready-to-build, white label battery-powered cars suitable even for low-volume manufacturers with small budgets.
Leapmotor has partnered with Stellantis to sell its EVs outside China and is talking to other brands to license its technology, CEO Zhu Jiangming told Reuters.
Using a ready-made Chinese EV chassis and software could save billions of dollars and years of development time and help traditional automakers catch up with Chinese rivals, auto industry experts say.
Renault was an early adopter, building the low-cost Dacia Spring EV on a platform from China’s Dongfeng for sale in Europe starting in 2021.
Renault has gone one step further with the new electric Twingo under development at its research centre in Shanghai, with a Chinese EV engineering firm Launch Design providing technical support in developing an EV platform, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Launch did not respond to requests for comment.
Other “China Inside” models could be coming soon. Ford is seeking a Chinese partner to provide EV platform technologies, said two people with knowledge of the matter. CEO Jim Farley has frequently tested Chinese EVs and recently praised Xiaomi’s SU7 electric sedan.
Volkswagen has expanded plans to develop China-dedicated models of all fuel types based on platforms co-developed with Xpeng, using the latter’s layout designs of electronics and software.
Analysts say legacy automakers typically struggle to develop agile EV systems that can be rapidly updated, due to complicated organisational structures.
That is why Volkswagen wants to see if Xpengs EV technologies can complement or replace Volkswagen’s own, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. If it works in China, Volkswagen could apply the strategy globally, Zhang added.
A Volkswagen China spokesperson told Reuters its collaboration with Xpeng was focused on China for now.
Xpeng’s He Xiaopeng has said the two automakers want to expand their partnership beyond China. That would boost Xpeng’s revenue without building plants overseas, said Autodatas’ Wang.
Oliver Wyman analyst Marco Santino said traditional automakers could use “firepower” of fierce Chinese EV competition to jump ahead of the development curve.
“You get a much more quality-proof product in the market in a shorter timeframe,” Santino said.

More choice?
Inspired by Tesla, China’s EV makers have developed modular platforms that cut costs and accelerate development and lower barriers of entry.
“They are quick learners from Tesla,” said Forest Tu, a former executive at Chinese battery giant CATL who founded consulting firm Mapleview Technology.
That advantage is now big enough to sustain “licensing and royalty service” as Chinese EV makers expand overseas, Tu said.
CATL adopted that approach with Ford, licensing its technology for a battery plant. Exporting Chinese technology could help less-industrialised countries build their own “national EV brands,” Tu said.
Abu Dhabi-based CYVN Holdings, a strategic investor in Nio, has developed its own premium EV model using the Chinese EV maker’s chassis and software.
CYVN bought British sports car maker McLaren in April and now plans to sell its EV using the McLaren brand, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But future models will incorporate far more McLaren “DNA” and less Chinese technology, one source said.
Nio declined to comment. CYVN did not respond to a request for comment.
CATL’s new EV chassis, meanwhile, will allow consumers to “decide what an EV looks like, rather than having giant automakers decide what to sell,” its executive president Hu Guoliang said.
CATL said it would ramp up chassis production in the next three years after signing with several domestic automakers. Its Bedrock Chassis debuted in Europe this week at the IAA Mobility show in Munich.
Whether the mutual benefits of China’s EV technology last over the longer-term, however, remains a key question.
Former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer said while there were savings in R&D, automakers should avoid over-reliance on third-party technology. “In the long-term you’re screwed because you’re just a retailer,” said Palmer.
Oliver Wyman’s Santino said the big risk for traditional automakers is that using someone else’s technology means “your capability to differentiate your brand is really limited.”
By blending in their own technology, automakers can “limit the risk,” Santino added.

The Tokyo Olympic champion, Chopra, and his successor in Paris, Nadeem, will line up at the athletics world championships for their first encounter since the nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in a four-day conflict in May, their worst since 1999.
Chopra, who took Olympic silver behind his great rival a year ago, had often spoken about his friendly relations with Nadeem despite the tensions between their countries.
After Nadeem won gold and Chopra stood alongside him on the podium in Paris, Nadeem’s mother Raziah Parveen said: “Winning and losing is part of sport, but they are like brothers.” Chopra’s mother Saroj said she took some solace in Nadeem beating her son because the Pakistani “is also our boy”.
But publicly at least that changed after the conflict.
The 27-year-old Chopra, who will defend his world title in Tokyo, said that they were “never really close friends”.
Nadeem, 28, also played down any friendship with Chopra.
“When he won, I congratulated him, and when I won the gold, he returned the same courtesy,” Nadeem told AFP by telephone en route to Tokyo.
“[Just as] in wrestling, one wrestler wins and the other loses — it’s part of the game.”
Invitation withdrawn
Nadeem, who is returning to competition after calf surgery in July, hails from a farming village.
He became an overnight sensation when he gave Pakistan their first Olympic gold in 40 years with a Games-record throw of 92.97m.
Nadeem has competed only once since Paris, winning the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea in May when Chopra did not participate.
The last time the pair clashed was at the Paris Olympics.
In April, the Indian star invited Nadeem to India for his ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ javelin event but the Pakistani declined, saying it clashed with his training schedule.
Chopra then withdrew the invitation after an attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir on April 22 killed 26 people.
India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.
In the conflict that followed more than 70 people were killed.
“I want to clarify that I don’t have a particularly strong relationship with Nadeem, we were never really close friends,” Chopra said afterwards.
“But because of the current situation, things will not be as they were. That said, if someone speaks to me with respect, I always respond in kind.”
Fine form
Chopra became a national hero in India after his Tokyo gold, earning million-dollar endorsement deals with his boyish charm, changing hairstyles and infectious smile.
He won the world title in Budapest in 2023 and has been in fine form since joining Czech javelin great Jan Zelezny’s coaching group ahead of the 2025 season. He went past 90m for the first time when he threw 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League meeting in May, but finished second to German Julian Weber.
At the Zurich Diamond League last month, Weber once again stood on top of the podium, with a throw of 91.51m. Chopra was second with 85.01m. Along with Weber, also in Tokyo will be two-time world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada.
The world championships start on Saturday, with the men’s javelin final on September 18.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1410413640eb5ce.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930653/if-the-quaid-came-home' target='_blank'><strong>If the Quaid came home</strong></a><br><p>Originally published on Aug 14, 2025.

It’s a bit of a tired theme: Muhammad Ali Jinnah, briefly returned from the pearly gates, walks around the country he’s created. He sees violence, corruption, poverty, extremism, and an unlawful regime lording over it. Perhaps, nearly 80 years on, freedom means something else.
He’s shocked, regrets what he’s founded, and calls it a day — or becomes a vehicle for some conservative columnist to tell the public what they should be doing instead. Only, the question lingers: would the Quaid have been all that surprised by what he’d seen?
Because Jinnah witnessed violence, corruption, poverty and extremism under an unlawful regime for most of his years. And that’s without touching on the constant defeats that rutted his path: his family business collapsing around the time he returned from London; Gandhi elbowing him offstage as India’s most promising politician by 1920; the civil liberties he championed crushed by the British Raj; and the Nehru Report setting fire to Hindu-Muslim unity — the work of a lifetime. His own.
In fact, the odds against anything resembling Pakistan were brutal before 1946: the Unionist Party’s obese landlords ran Punjab; Sindh was in the grips of Gandhian arch-feudal Soomros; the frontier was ruled by Congressites outright; and Balochistan wasn’t even on the provincial map.
Lesser men, almost all men, would have surrendered; yet others would have haggled for scraps from within the Raj’s cage. But Jinnah had long understood that freedom was a terrible, vital business: not so much the absence of pain, but the choice to endure it for something essential to being alive.
 
 

For freedom’s sake
After all, beyond those dry law books, Jinnah was an idealist — no freedom fighter isn’t. His friend, Sarojini Naidu, called it right as early as 1917: “Never was there a nature whose outer qualities provided so complete an antithesis of its inner worth.” If he was skinny, it concealed “exceptional … endurance”; if he was aloof, it hid a “naïve and eager humanity”. If he seemed too rational and practical, it was only to “disguise a shy and splendid idealism”.
It’s also how he changed map of the world — by keeping his eyes fixed to the eternities. As has been said of British premier Disraeli’s career (whom Liaquat Ali Khan enjoyed comparing to Jinnah): “Failure, failure, failure, partial success, renewed failure. Ultimate and complete victory.”
But such victory can never be complete: if indeed the Quaid came home, he’d have found freedom in recession. We know this not from speculation, but from decades of documentary record.
Interestingly, most of that record is nowhere to be found on August 14: beyond a few bumper stickers, Jinnah seems to have become much too radical, and thereby much too dangerous, for his own country to contend with.
Jinnah vs the state
For starters, consider liberty: is a citizen free if they can be tried by a military tribunal? Said Jinnah in 1919, “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” The Supreme Court disagreed last May, and chose to cite Ayub Khan’s laws rather than the founder’s speech.
That brings us to the judiciary itself, the crown jewel of any free republic. But are the judges in a position to safeguard the people’s rights, now that the executive has snatched away their powers via the 26th amendment?
 
 

“Powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused,” said Jinnah. He had said prior, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary … because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.’
The unity regime has thought the opposite: stripping the courts of suo motu powers, choosing its own chief justice every three years, and reducing the entire judicature to a popularity contest. The regime may think, as the British once had, that Jinnah doth protest too much. London’s Edwin S. Montagu once asked him acidly, “Have you ever known any proposal come from any government which met with your approval?”
And yet the Quaid wasn’t instinctively opposed to the state: he viewed a free country as one where the executive was in charge — just not its armed forces. He warned a future chief of general staff in 1947, “Never forget that you are the servants of the state. You do not make policy. It is we, the people’s representatives, who decide how the country is to be run. Your job is only to obey the decision of your civilian masters.”
Yet what of said people’s representatives? As blanket convictions stream in and lawmakers are flung out of the assembly, it’s hard not to remember the Quaid’s words when Satyendra Chandra Mitra, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly, was slapped with preventive detention: “Here is a man who was arrested under a most obnoxious law which gives the executive absolute power to imprison a man on suspicion without trial … How long are you going to prevent him from what he is entitled to do?”
And if the state cried law and order, he replied, “Is it to be performed in spite of the will of the people … by retaining a most reactionary and oppressive measure …? I maintain sir, that if the government were really responsive to public opinion, all the revolutionary organisations and anarchical organisations that you are now talking of and which you want to arrest and to destroy…will disappear.”
 
 

This was part of a broader, daring stance — that violence and disorder stem not from uncontrollable populations, but unresponsive rule. Jinnah may well have been addressing Balochistan when he said, “Why do these educated young men take to bombs? Have you ever thought of it? … The way to prevent bombs being thrown is to meet the people, respond to their feelings, their sentiments and their legitimate and proper aspirations.”
It most certainly isn’t to punish those who raise their voices for a better world, as we’re seeing today: journalists thrown on stop lists and anchors taken off television. Yet again, the barrister from Bombay was clear: “I say, protect the innocent, protect those journalists who are doing their duty and who are serving both the public and the government by criticising the government freely, independently, honestly, which is an education for any government.”
Back to the Raj
In sum, Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s starting point was freedom. As the late lawyer-historian A.G. Noorani wrote, no parliamentarian spoke as sharply to the British “or their Indian stooges” as Jinnah: “There was no nationalist more fervent than he; no stronger champion of freedom from British rule.”
Because freedom was the end in and of itself. That seems hard to believe these days: as we recently read in these pages, Faisalabad’s anti-terrorism court handed down scores of convictions over the 9 May riots by reasoning the law was well-drafted and wide-ranging: arch-imperialist Lord Macaulay, “the first law-giver of the subcontinent”, had authored it after “the famous mutiny of 1857”.
 
 

It’s already been questioned why the court would compare itself to its colonisers, and the PTI to yesterday’s rebels. But as a scholar of the Raj — if not of our own freedom movement — the learned judge would also know what Macaulay had written when those rebels were fired from cannons in Peshawar: that “their heads, legs, arms, flying in all directions was read with delight”. Reflected Macaulay, “I could be very cruel just now if I had the power.”
The learned judge would also know that these weren’t the emotional outbursts of a jolted regent, but sober policy directions, steeped in the racial superiority of an alien overclass. All things considered, Macaulay thought us unfit for self-rule anyway; that what we could really “have [is] the next best thing — a firm and impartial despotism”; and that the British carried with them “all the noblest virtues of a sovereign caste”. By jingo, chaps.
In fairness to Faisalabad, the anti-terrorism courts quote Macaulay instead of Jinnah in the same way the Supreme Court leans harder on Ayub’s Pakistan than the Quaid-i-Azam’s. As the song goes, it looks like freedom but it feels like death.
All of which is to say that if Jinnah indeed came home today, the story of his life points to anything but a lament, a lecture, a sad retreat in the rain. What it points to is, frankly, audacity: that no wall can’t be breached — the Congress, the provincials, empire itself; none yielded willingly, and all looked permanent until the moment they fell. But fall they did, and Pakistan was born.
So we continue. And we keep the faith.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111023440a3d024.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941161/pm-shehbaz-leaves-for-qatar-to-express-solidarity-following-israeli-attack-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz leaves for Qatar to express ‘solidarity’ following Israeli attack: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday departed for Qatar to express “solidarity and regional unity” after Israeli airstrikes targeted residential areas in Doha earlier this week, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
On Tuesday, Israel launched an airstrike against Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital of Doha, expanding military actions that have ranged across the Middle East to include the Gulf Arab state where the Palestinian group has long had its political base. According to Hamas sources, the group’s representatives were targeted while they were discussing United States President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Qatar condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
“PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and a high-level delegation, will meet Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to convey Islamabad’s sympathies and support for the Gulf state today,” The FO statement said.
 






“The visit underscores Pakistan’s unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” said the statement.
“The prime minister will meet with His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha to convey Pakistan’s deepest sympathies and support for the Qatari leadership and people,” it added.
According to state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, their meeting “will also include consultations on Israel’s unwarranted attacks on various countries in the region, its ongoing aggression, and efforts to establish peace in the region”.
Doha and Egypt have also been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.

KATHMANDU: Soldiers guarded Ne­­p­al’s parliament and patrolled deserted streets on Wednesday with the capital Kathmandu under a curfew, as the country’s former chief justice Sushila Karki claimed to have “accepted Gen Z protesters’ request to lead interim government” after two days of deadly anti-corruption protests forced Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign.
The upheaval in the poor Himalayan nation was unleashed by a social media ban that was announced last week but was rolled back after 19 people were killed on Monday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to control crowds.
The death toll from the protests had risen to 25 by Wednesday, Nepal’s health ministry said, while 633 were injured.
Nepal’s army said that relevant parties were coordinating to tackle the situation after the protests and resolve the issue. Media also said preparations were being made for authorities and protesters to hold talks, without giving details.
Most of the protesters were young people voicing frustration at the government’s perceived failure to fight corruption and boost economic opportunities, leading to the demonstrations being dubbed the “Gen Z protests”.
The young agitators want former chief justice Karki as the interim prime minister, said Raman Kumar Karna, the secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Associ­a­tion, who was consulted by the protesters.
“When they requested me, I accepted,” Karki told Indian news channel CNN-News18.
“Gen Z” representatives told reporters that they met army officials later and proposed Karki as their choice to head an interim government.
Ministers’ homes set ablaze
Burnt-out vehicles and twisted metal littered the area around parliament, where army firefighters battled to douse a blaze in the main hall, while the building’s exterior was charred after protesters set it ablaze on Tuesday.
TV footage showed youths cleaning up some damaged buildings and clearing debris from roads and the areas near parliament.
Several other government buildings, from the supreme court to ministers’ homes, including Oli’s private residence, were also set ablaze in the protests, with the unrest subsiding only after the resignation.
Armoured vehicles kept vigil in streets that were largely deserted, with shops and markets shut. Firefighters were engaged at different locations, while the process of clearing roads was also under way, army spokesman Raja Ram Basnet said.
“We are trying to normalise the situation first. We are committed to protect the life and property of people,” Basnet said, adding that prisoners had set Kathmandu’s Dilli Bazar Jail on fire before the army controlled the situation.
Nepali police said on Wednesday that more than 13,500 prisoners broke out of jails across the country during anti-government protests this week.
The main airport in Kathmandu also reopened on Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said, more than 24 hours after flights had been suspended.
Army warns of ‘strict action’ In a post on X, the army said prohibitory orders imposing a curfew would remain in force until Thursday morning.
“Any demonstrations, vandalism, looting, arson, and attacks on individuals and property in the name of protest will be considered punishable crimes and strict action will be taken by security personnel,” the post said.
For years a lack of jobs has driven millions to seek work in countries such as Malaysia, the Middle East and South Korea, mainly on construction sites, so as to send money home.

A statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China said “responsible individuals” at the Instagram-like platform would be punished after Xiaohongshu, known as RedNote in English, failed to “fulfil its main responsibility of content management”.
It gave no details of the punishments.
The statement criticised Xiaohongshu for hosting “numerous posts hyping celebrities’ personal dynamics and trivial matters and other negative content frequently populating the hot search list”.
“A clear, clean and healthy cyberspace aligns with the interests of the people,” it added.
Xiaohongshu was launched in Shanghai in 2013 and has hundreds of millions of monthly active users.
It translates literally to Little Red Book, but is not a reference to Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong’s book of quotations.
Unlike TikTok’s sister app Douyin or the micro-blogging site Weibo, Xiaohongshu leans heavily towards apolitical content such as lifestyle, travel, beauty and food topics.
Xiaohongshu’s “Explore” page is similar to TikTok’s “For You” page – both curated by an algorithm that suggests content based on users’ interests and interactions on the platforms.
It is also an online marketplace similar to TikTok Shop, where users can directly buy items including clothing, make-up and accessories.
It is seen as relatively less censored than other platforms: users can be found posting LGBTQ content and discussing the merits of women remaining single, topics often considered sensitive in China.
Xiaohongshu has also popularised “da ka”, or “check-in” tourism, where travellers plan itineraries around scenic or trending spots specifically to take photos for social media.
And similar to Instagram and TikTok, the platform has also become a hub for influencers endorsing sponsored products.</p><small>2025-09-11 05:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/110953284dbdaf4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941143/conservative-influencer-charlie-kirk-shot-dead-manhunt-on-for-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk shot dead, manhunt on for suspect</strong></a><br><p>US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination.
Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people.
The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later.
State police issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.
“There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals,” the statement said. “There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.”
In a video message taped in the Oval Office and posted to Trump’s Truth Social online platform, the president vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.
“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it,” Trump said.
Cellphone video clips of the killing posted online showed Kirk addressing a large outdoor crowd on the campus, about 40 miles (64 km) south of Salt Lake City, around 12:20 pm MT (18:20 GMT or 23:20 PKT), when a gunshot rang out. Kirk moved his hand toward his neck as he fell off his chair, sending onlookers running.
In another clip, blood could be seen gushing from Kirk’s neck immediately after the shot.
Jeff Long, chief of the university police department, said he had six officers working the event and coordinated with the head of Kirk’s private security team, which was also on site. Trump ordered US flags flown at half-staff until Sunday in Kirk’s honour.
The killing was the latest in a series of attacks on US political figures, including two assassination attempts on Trump last year, that have underscored a sharp rise in political violence.
“This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,” Utah’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox said at the press conference. “I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.”
With the suspect still at large, there was no clear evidence of a motive for the act of violence.
Trump, who routinely describes political rivals, judges and others who stand in his way as “radical left lunatics” and warns that they pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric.
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” Trump said in the video. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”
On Capitol Hill in Washington, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the US House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing.
Kirk’s appearance on Wednesday was the first in a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.

Asked about shootings, then shot
Seconds before he was shot, the married father of two young children was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, according to multiple videos of the event posted online.
“Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked.
He responded, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” He was shot moments later.
Kirk and the group he co-founded, Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.
After winning his second presidential term, Trump credited Kirk for mobilising younger voters and voters of colour in support of his campaign.
“You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,” Trump said at a rally in Phoenix in December. “It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.”
Kirk had 5.3 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio program, “The Charlie Kirk Show.” He had also recently appeared as a guest co-host on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” He was part of an ecosystem of pro-Trump conservative influencers including Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens and others, who helped to amplify the president’s agenda.
Kirk frequently attacked mainstream media and engaged in culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.
At the White House, staff members, many of them young and admirers of Kirk, were ashen-faced as news of the shooting spread.

Political violence on the rise
Republican and Democratic politicians alike expressed dismay over the shooting.
Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement: “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values. We pray for his family during this tragedy.”
The US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
In July 2024, Republican Trump was grazed by a gunman’s bullet during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. A second assassination attempt two months later was foiled by federal agents, with opening arguments in that suspect’s trial set to begin on Thursday.
In April, an arsonist broke into Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.
Earlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic Senator John Hoffman and his wife. And in Boulder, Colorado, a man used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a solidarity event for Israeli hostages, killing one woman and injuring at least six more.
In 2022, a man broke into Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer, leaving him with skull fractures and other injuries.
In 2020, a group of right-wing militia members plotted unsuccessfully to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

• HRCP highlights plight of climate refugees
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has ente­red this year’s flood season with more substantial economic buffers than it had before the 2022-23 floods, but the country’s improved macroeconomic situation comes with new constraints, according to a `targeted analysis’ carried out by the Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWS) Network.
The analysis expects that the 2025 floods will primarily drive short-term, localised, food insecurity among flood-affected households.
Produced at the request of the US government as a part of FEWS NET’s global coverage, the report notes that this time, the flood response will be constrained by limited fiscal intervention capacity, in contrast to the emergency subsidies in 2022-23.
The 37-month IMF Extended Fund Facility explicitly prohibits the use of untargeted subsidies and market interventions that were used during the previous floods.
According to the analysis, increases of eight to 10 per cent in wheat prices are expected in coming months due to flood-related market supply disruptions, but will likely return to near-normal levels once affected roads are restored.
However, production losses of Kharif season crops due to flooding are expected, particularly for rice, sugarcane, cotton, and vegetables.
The government can deploy foreign reserves in the event that emergency imports are needed, and negative food inflation provides a substantial cushion against the level of price spikes that devastated household purchasing power in 2022, according to the analysis.
 
 

The ongoing floods are expected to affect the Kharif season, which started in April. While complete information on the extent of crop damage due to flooding is not yet available, early findings indicate a significant localised impact.
They are expected, however, to affect household income from agricultural labour and crop sales, particularly in Punjab, the report warns.
HRW report
In a separate statement, global rights watchdog Human Rights Watch has called upon the government to address unchecked development amid a changing climate.
It noted that unchecked development exacerbates the effects of floods, and one representative example is the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project, which the government launched in August 2020 to address Lahore’s many problems — pollution, sewage, water, housing and employment — while aiming to revive the city’s “lost glory”.
This is just the latest in a string of failures by successive governments in Pakistan to enact needed reforms and policies to regulate development, HRW said.
It assailed the government over its history of conducting “poor quality environmental assessments for politically connected infrastructure projects”.
“In this case, it ignored warnings by independent environmental activists and experts who called the project ecologically and financially unviable and argued that building barrages and other dams on the river and replacing farmland with paved concrete could swell water levels upstream and cause flooding.”
Today, most of the area earmarked for the project is submerged, along with parts of Lahore city itself, HRW regretted.
Protecting the vulnerable
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), has called for expanding the rescue and relief operations that are currently underway, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable segments.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the rights body highlighted the plight of climate refugees, who have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods.
“Particular attention must be given to the most vulnerable — women, children, the elderly and persons living with disabilities.”

According to industry leaders, industrial output remained subdued as workers failed to report for duty due to safety concerns and transportation issues.
Faisal Moiz Khan, President of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI), stated that nearly half of the 4,500 industrial units in the area remained closed. Workers were reluctant to return after the torrential rains in the third week of August left several people stranded in factories late into the night.
 


Additionally, around 100-125 factories in sectors A to D in F.B. Area, including export-oriented units, suffered damage as the swollen Lyari River inundated production facilities, destroying raw materials and finished goods worth millions of rupees.
Moiz pointed out that the overflow from Thado Dam had submerged roads leading to the Super Highway, exacerbating the city’s already struggling infrastructure. “The city faces serious problems during the rains due to poor infrastructure,” he added. NKATI represents 70 per cent of Karachi’s export-oriented industries.

Flooding destroys raw materials, disrupts supply chain

Ahmed Azeem Alvi, President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), echoed similar concerns, reporting that 60pc of workers in 3,500 factories did not report to work despite there being no significant road blockages. “A shortage of workers has led to a 25-30pc reduction in production activities,” Alvi said, adding that workers were hesitant to leave their homes due to fears of being unable to return if the rains worsened.
In the Korangi industrial area, which houses over 4,000 factories, the output was down by 30pc due to a low turnout of workers, who accounted for less than 50pc of the usual workforce.
Junaid Naqi, President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), mentioned that entry points to the area were closed in the morning, and workers were already on edge due to the overflow of Lyari and Malir rivers. Additionally, power disruptions, caused by tripping of feeder lines, further worsened the situation, leading to the suspension of multiple shifts.
 
 

Sheikh Mohammad Tehseen, President of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), said that production activities across industrial zones had been severely affected, with factory attendance down by 50-60pc.
“The supply chain has been disrupted, slowing down the delivery of raw materials and cargo shipments to seaports,” he added. Tehseen also urged the government to collaborate with industrial associations to restore business activities and normalise the economic cycle.
The e-commerce sector also faced challenges as logistical disruptions hindered the movement of goods. Shoaib Bhatti, President of the Pakistan eCommerce Association (PEA) Karachi, reported delays in shipments both domestically and internationally, with quick commerce services suspended in various parts of the city. Long electricity and internet outages further hampered online shopping services, causing losses for e-commerce businesses.
Rauf Ibrahim, Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), noted that 80-90pc of shops in key wholesale trade areas, including Dandia Bazaar, Jodia Bazaar, and Lea Market, remained closed.
The remaining 10-20pc of shops that were open closed by 2 pm due to the adverse weather conditions. The combined impact of heavy rains, flooding, and infrastructural limitations has caused widespread disruption in Karachi’s industrial and commercial sectors, with long-term effects expected if the situation does not improve soon.

Lyari and Malir rivers serve as Karachi’s main storm drains, channelling rainwater through a network of nullahs into the Arabian Sea. Once natural seasonal streams, they are now heavily constricted by urban sprawl, encroachments, and solid waste, turning many drains into open sewers. This blockage reduces their capacity to carry stormwater, causing frequent urban flooding during monsoon downpours.
Four more people died in rain-related incidents in the metropolis today, raising the death toll since yesterday to eight, while three were missing, according to rescue services.
Edhi rescuers recovered the bodies of three men and a woman after a van carrying four people fell into the rain-filled Konkar Nadi in Gadap Town, a statement issued by the Edhi Foundation said.
The rescue operation to find the other missing people was underway, the spokesperson added.
Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the body of an 18-year-old man, identified as Ahmed Qadir, was brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital from North Nazimabad’s Block-C after he “died of an electric shock”.
A man was saved alive and the search for another was underway after the two went missing in the Malir river, a statement issued by Rescue 1122 said.
The man rescued was identified as Mustafa Ali Gul, while Farhan Akram remained missing. Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad and the Malir deputy commissioner were present on the site, Rescue 1122 added.
 






Two others were rescued alive after they were trapped in the Lyari river, Rescue 1122 said in a statement, shared by the Sindh Information Department.
 






Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah refuted rumours of the operational section of Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway (Malir Expressway) caving in or being breached to divert waters.
Asked about a video being shared on social media that showed a paved section caving in during a media talk in Karachi, CM Shah explained: “Malir Expressway is under construction at that place. A bund is being built properly on the river, so when water from the river comes and it (the bund) is incomplete, then the water will pass through some location or another.
“That is it. There is no issue,” he added, advising people to “use their energy” for a better cause.
The CM’s spokesperson, Abdul Rasheed Channa, also issued a statement refuting reports of Shahrah-i-Bhutto caving in, saying: “It is not [a] real picture.”

A further statement from the chief minister’s spokesperson said there was “no truth” to the news of an operational part of the highway being washed away.
“The unpaved part of Shahrah-i-Bhutto has sunk down in the rainwater, and work is still ongoing. This is the part of Shahrah-i-Bhutto that has collapsed and neither a retaining wall has been built nor stone pitching has been done. This is part of the Malir section, which is under construction and is not yet open to traffic,” the statement said.
It added that sections of the road that were open for traffic were still being used by the public.
 






According to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) data as of 8pm, Karachi received the highest amount of rainfall in Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 7 (32.6 millimetres).
PAF Masoor Base recorded 20mm, Keamari 19mm, Korangi 18.9mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 16.9mm, Surjani Town 13.8mm, North Karachi 12.8mm, University Road and Orangi Town 11.8mm, Airport Old Area 11.5mm, PAF Faisal Base 11mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 8mm, Saadi Town 7.7mm, Jinnah Terminal 5.2mm, Nazimabad 5mm and Bahria Town 3.4mm.
Water enters Saadi Town; 318 relocated from near Malir river
Separately, CM Shah visited various locations across Karachi — including the Lyari river, Jinnah Avenue, Saadi Town and Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway — to review water drainage following the rains.
Footage from DawnNewsTV showed that the road linking Superhighway to Thado Dam was inundated, with water gushing into a stream and people gathered near the spot.
 


The Sindh CM, accompanied by Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, visited the flooded Saadi Town through the Malir Cantonment route, the provincial Information Department said on X.
“The water entered Saadi Town due to overflow of the Lath and Thado Dams,” the chief minister was informed. He met with the local residents and directed authorities to carry out speedy water drainage.
During his visit to Jinnah Avenue, CM Shah “inspected the drainage of water from the dams via Mehran Nala and reviewed the machinery deployed for dewatering”, the Information Department said.
 






In a statement detailing his visit to the Lyari river, the chief minister was quoted as saying that the flow of water in the Lyari river was “high, but the flows are running smoothly”.
He explained that the river began from the mountains of Manghopir and Gadap, gathering rainwater from those areas. “The Lyari river passes through Orangi Town, SITE area, Nazimabad, Liaquatabad, Gulbahar, Lyari Town, Kharadar, Meethadar and West Wharf, and then reaches the port.”
 






CM Shah, Ghani and Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also visited the Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway, which is expected to be completed by the year’s end, and the Qayyumabad Chowk near Korangi Causeway.
Separately, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X earlier today, said that so far, 318 people have been “rescued [and] moved to safe [places] from around the [areas] close to Lyari Naddi and teams are still present on ground”.
“All major arteries of the city as well as underpasses are clear and open for traffic,” he asserted.
 






In Saadi Town, joint efforts by Rescue 1122 and the Pakistan Army resulted in the rescue of 10 people, Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said in a statement.
“Near Saima Society, two men, three women and six children were safely moved,” Khan told Dawn.com. “Eight people were trapped in Nashr Basti and Isa Nagri due to waterlogging,” he added.
Memon said large-scale rescue and relief operations were underway in view of the recent rains and rising water in the rivers. “The situation in Karachi after the rains is gradually improving. Due to the filling of the dam and heavy rains, the Lyari and Malir rivers overflowed,” he said.
Schools to remain closed today
Meanwhile, the Sindh government has ordered the closure of all educational institutions across the Karachi Division following heavy monsoon rains and a forecast of further showers.
“All the educational institutions (public/private) will remain closed within the territorial jurisdiction of Karachi Division,” said a notification by the Karachi commissioner, dated September 9.
 






The PMD said in its weather forecast for today that yesterday’s depression over southwest Sindh moved nearly westwards and was now lying 60 kilometres west of Karachi.
“It is likely to move further westwards and gradually weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area in next couple of hours. Under its influence: light to moderate rainfalls are expected in Karachi division, Jamshoro, Thatta and Sujawal districts today,” the PMD said, adding that hot and humid weather was expected in most parts of the province.
It said the weather forecast for Karachi division for Thursday was partly cloudy and humid with
chances of drizzle/light rain and partly cloudy and humid on Friday.
Memon said a new spell of rain was predicted in 24-48 hours, adding that the Sindh government was on full alert. “If there is no more rain, the situation will return to normal in a few hours,” he said.
Several hundred straw-mud houses in the rural areas of Tharparkar and Dadu districts were swept away as the two districts had been receiving intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells of monsoon rains for the last six and four days, respectively.
PM directs NDMA to expedite relief activities in flood-affected areas of Sindh
Taking notice of the flood situation in Karachi and other areas of Sindh, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to fully cooperate with the provincial government and Sindh Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) in relief operations.
The prime minister also appreciated the active rescue operations being carried out by Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and Rangers in Karachi.
According to a press statement issued by the PM Office, the prime minister also expressed sorrow over the drowning of citizens in the Gadap stream.
The prime minister instructed relevant authorities to locate the missing persons in the floods as soon as possible.
“The awareness campaign should be further activated to inform the public about the flood situation to protect as many citizens as possible,” he added.
The premier also directed authorities to take immediate steps to restore the flood-affected communication infrastructure.
“The federal and Sindh governments are fully mobilised to deal with the flood situation,” he said, emphasising that the relief and rehabilitation of families affected by the floods in Karachi must be prioritised.</p><small>2025-09-11 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11092628c5d908b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941099/interfaith-body-set-up-to-tackle-hate-speech-extremism' target='_blank'><strong>Interfaith body set up to tackle hate speech, extremism</strong></a><br><p>
National Paigham-i-Aman body is a subcommittee of National Committee
on Narrative Building
Senate committee alarmed by misuse of Peca by provinces

ISLAMABAD: The government has notified a special panel — comprising clerics, religious leaders of non-Muslim communities and senior officials — to counter extremism, hate speech, terrorism and sectarianism in the country.
The Ministry of Information has set up the National Paigham-i-Aman Commit­tee (NPAC), which will draft a unified national stance against extremism and terrorism.
The NPAC, a subcommittee of the National Committee on Narrative Building (NCNB), has been tasked with devising a unified national narrative that promotes peace, harmony and religious moderation.
The NCNB, which was notified earlier this month, is a 20-member body that includes the information ministers of all four provinces, GB and AJK, as well as federal minister. It also includes representatives of the military, intelligence agencies, the foreign and IT ministries, as well as the PTA chairman.
It is meant to deal with “information operation, formulation, dissemination, propagation and evaluation of [the] national narrative against the spread of terrorism [or] extremism through media, communication and cyber networks for smooth implementation of Revised National Action Plan 2021,” according to a notification.
Meanwhile, the director general of the Internal Publicity Wing of the information ministry will serve as the NPAC secretary, while Maulana Tahir Ashrafi has been appointed its coordinator.
 
 

The committee’s first meeting will focus on formulating its terms of reference, which will be submitted to the NCNB for approval.
Speaking to Dawn, Allama Arif Wahidi said the committee could be seen as an extension of the Paigham-i-Pakistan initiative, launched in 2018. “The Paigham-i-Pakistan narrative was the theoretical step to counter religious extremism. The target of this committee is to implement the idea and devise practical steps to stop the dividing forces in society,” he said, adding that these steps would also be implemented by provinces.
Allama Tahir Ashrafi told Dawn that the move reflected the government’s intent to adopt a more inclusive and strategic approach to peacebuilding through institutional coordination. He added that the initiative aims to centralise national efforts to craft and disseminate a cohesive narrative countering extremism in multiple dimensions — religious, sectarian and ideological.
Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee voiced reservations after being informed that provinces were still registering cybercrime cases under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), despite amendments barring them from doing so.
 
 

The Senate Standing Committee on Information, while reviewing the implementation of Peca, expressed concern that the law was being misused.
Director general of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the committee, chaired by Senator Syed Ali Zafar, that 10 journalists were currently facing cases under Peca, adding that 611 cases of financial fraud and 320 of harassment were also under investigation.
The committee members noted that under recent amendments, the provinces were no longer authorised to register cases under to Peca 2025, which must now be referred to the NCCIA. The officials said that any cases filed by provincial authorities after the amendment were invalid. “All these cases are illegal — now what should we do with them?” asked the committee chairman.
The lawmakers decided to form a subcommittee to review the issue of illegal case registrations. Senator Zafar ruled that 378 cases registered under Peca by provincial authorities were unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

While governments may not always recognise it, we are bound by an ecosystem that inextricably links our resilience through shared climate realities from one end of South Asia to the other.
Shared ecosystems
1) Rivers: The Indus River system serves as a central artery for India and Pakistan, comprising six major tributaries: eastern (Beas, Ravi, Sutlej) and western (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).
These sha­red waters account for over 90 per cent of Pakis­tan’s agricultural use and support seven Indian states and territories: Punjab, Haryana, Chandi­garh, Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, Rajas­than, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. Heavy monsoons and poor transboundary management are increasingly causing deadly flooding in the Punjab and Sindh floodplains.
2) Mountains: The Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan ranges have interconnected geological features. The Himalayan watershed exte­nds across northern India through occupied J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Ar­­u­nachal Pradesh, extending westward from Pak­is­­tan.
 
 

The Karakoram lies primarily in Gilgit-Bal­tistan and extends into disputed Ladakh and Aksai Chin. The Hindukush runs through Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan, merging with the Karakoram at its eastern end.
These three ranges converge near Jaglot in northern Pakistan, where the Gilgit and Indus rivers meet. This complex system houses some of the world’s largest glaciers and has become a hotspot for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), creating a geologically volatile landscape.

Only coordinated Indo-Pakistani climate governance can prevent downstream disasters.

3) Deserts: The Thar desert spans India and Pakistan, spreading desertification and drought in both countries.
This arid subtropical desert ex­­p­­eriences low irregular rainfall, soil erosion and water scarcity, driving demand for inter-basin tra­nsfers like the Beas–Bikaner and Indira Gandhi canals. Most of this desert lies in India, primarily Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana. The remainder extends into Pakistan’s drought-prone districts in Sindh and Punjab. The Pakistani Punjab portion is known as the Cholistan desert.
4) Coasts: This maritime climate zone affects monsoon patterns, cyclones and ocean currents impacting India and Pakistan’s coastal weather.
 
 

Pakistan faces transboundary threats from powerful Arabian Sea tropical cyclones along India’s 2,500-kilometre western coastline.
Recent years have seen increased storm frequency and intensity, creating growing shared risks.
5) Delta: The vast Indus delta mangroves are also divided. From Thatta, Badin, Sajawal and Karachi to India’s Gujarat coast, these mangroves depend on the Arabian Sea’s tidal waters and freshwater flows of the Indus that regulate salt levels, sediment and nutrients essential for growth.
The Rann of Kutch also straddles the border, with the larger portion in Gujarat and a smaller part in Sindh. It serves as a seasonal flooding basin during the monsoons, transforming itself from desert to marsh.
6) Interconnectedness: Climate disasters create predictable chain reactions: upstream heatwaves trigger downstream flooding, mountain glacial bursts cause delta flooding, and Arabian Sea storms affect the entire coastal ecosystem.
Almost all climate-triggered events when originating in Indian states or held territory, cascade downstream to Pakistan. This upstream-downstream dynamic creates disaster chains that demand anticipatory joint management as the following three case studies demonstrate:
a) Kashmir floods: In September 2014, unprecedented floods caused by heavy post-monsoon rains devastated the Kashmir region and downstream areas on both sides.
The disaster originated from Indian-held Kashmir’s meteorological conditions, with the Jhelum and Chenab swelling beyond danger levels, submerging Srinagar and numerous villages. The floods then followed the natural downstream flow into Pakistani Punjab, affecting over 1.1 million people and inundating more than 700 villages. Floodwaters breached riverbanks, displacing millions and causing deaths. This disaster demonstrated Pakistan’s vulnerability to upstream water management decisions and underscored the urgent need for shared early warning systems.
b) Transboundary heatwave: The spring 2022 heatwave originated in India’s northern plains before sweeping into Pakistan, breaking temperature records and reaching over 49 degrees Celsius in parts of Pakistan.
In India, the heatwave severely damaged the wheat crop, reducing yields and spiking global wheat prices. As the heatwave moved downstream to Pakistan, it triggered accelerated glacier melt leading to Glofs and intensified rains that worsened the floods, submerging a third of the country and displacing millions. This event exemplified how atmospheric extremes originating upstream create compounding climate impacts downstream.
c) Arabian Sea cyclones: Tropical cyclones for­ming in the Arabian Sea develop closer to India’s longer coastline before affecting Pakistan, following weather pattern movements. Cyclone Kyarr (2019), while not making landfall, caused coastal flooding and tidal surges in Maharashtra and Gujarat before impacting Sindh and Balochistan.
Cyclone Tauktae (2021), one of the deadliest cyc­lones in the Arabian Sea, devastated India’s west coast before bringing destructive rain and ferocious winds, forcing evacuations and causing infrastructure disruptions. These events show how climate threats move from upstream origins to downstream impacts.
Global lessons
Despite having no diplomatic relations since 1993, Armenia and Türkiye demonstrate that shared dam management is possible even amid hostile political tensions, operating the Arpaçay Dam through monthly meetings that maintain equitable water-sharing based on agreements of 1927.
Conversely, Ethiopia’s unilateral construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without downstream consent created permanent regional tensions with Egypt and Sudan, demonstrating precisely the type of conflict that cooperative management could prevent.
These shared ecological realities demand im­­mediate joint climate management between India and Pakistan. Each case study demonstrates how disasters originating in India cascade downstream to Pakistan, making collaborative early warning systems and shared water infrastructure management essential for Pakistan’s resilience. Without joint management of upstream barrages and da­­ms, Pakistan remains dangerously vulnerable to decisions made by upstream floodgate controllers.
A major lesson from the 2025 floods emerges: only coordinated Indo-Pakistani climate governance can prevent downstream disasters and eliminate suspicions of water terrorism. Joint management of upstream water infrastructure would ensure transparent, cooperative responses to extreme weather events, protecting both nations while building trust. The alternative is a continuation of cascading disasters that neither country can manage by itself.

Iran agreed a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Tuesday, af­­t­er it suspended cooperation following its war with Israel in June.
The 12-day war saw Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nucl­ear facilities, which the IAEA has not been able to access since.
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the agreed document “provides for a clear understanding of the procedures for inspections”.

UN nuclear watchdog says deal covers ‘all facilities’;  Iran’s FM says inspections require separate negotiations

It “includes all facilities and installations in Iran, and it also contemplates the required reporting on all the attacked facilities, including the nuclear material present at those”, Grossi told the Vienna-based agency’s Board of Governors meeting.
Iran’s stance
But Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi appe­ared to downplay the extent of the deal, saying the agreement itself “does not create access” for IAEA inspectors.
Araghchi said in an interview aired Wednesday that “currently no access is given to the IAEA inspectors”.
“Based on the reports that Iran will provide later, the type of access should be negotiated in due course,” he added.
The most recent inspection did not include access to other key sites, including Fordo and Natanz, which were hit in the June strikes.
“Iran and the agency will now resume cooperation in a respectful and comprehensive way,” Grossi told the board meeting, adding the “practical steps… need to be implemented now”. “There may be difficulties and issues to be resolved for sure, but we now know what we have to do,” he added.

In a telephone call with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Rubio “emphasised the importance of open and constructive communication on a range of bilateral issues”, the State Department said.
Rubio as a senator was known for his tough line on China and in his confirmation hearing warned of an all-out global struggle to prevent Beijing from outpacing the United States as the pre-eminent global power.
Rubio met Wang in July on the sidelines of the Asean Regional Forum in Malaysia, in a meeting both sides described as positive and constructive, despite tension over Washington’s tariffs. Rubio said at the time that the odds of US President Donald Trump meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping were high.
 
 

The rise of global trade barriers since Trump’s return to the presidency has exacerbated challenges for China’s export-driven economy. While US and China in August extended a truce for 90 days, President Trump urged EU officials on Tuesday to hit China with tariffs of up to 100pc as part of a strategy to pressure Russia to end Ukraine war.

The demonstrators vented their anger against Macron, who is already facing political turmoil after the parliamentary opposition united to defeat his government on Monday.
Tens of thousands of security forces who had been deployed across the country removed blockades as fast as possible, officials said, meaning that France was, for now, not blocked despite some scuffles.
The president appointed a close ally as his new prime minister, conservative Sebastien Lecornu, who took office facing the same challenge to rein in France’s ballooning debt as his predecessor.

New PM promises a ‘profound break’ with past policies

“It’s the same shit, it’s the same, it’s Macron who’s the problem, not the ministers,” Fred, a representative for the RATP public transport branch of the CGT union, said at a protest in Paris. “He has to go.”
In Paris, police fired tear gas on youths blocking the entrance to a high school and firefighters removed burnt objects from a barricade.
Police said they had stopped a large group of about 1,000 protesters from entering the Gare du Nord train station in the city.
“I was expecting either a dissolution (of parliament) or a left-wing prime minister and we have neither, it’s frustrating,” said 18-year-old student Lisa Venier, who was among the protesters near the Gare du Nord.
Protesters torched a bus in the western city of Rennes, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told reporters. He also said some protesters had attacked police with heavy cobblestones, but did not specify where.
Retailleau warned that protest rallies scheduled for later in the day could be infiltrated by hard-line, ultra-left groups and become violent.
The “Block Everything” movement — a broad expression of discontent that has no centralised leadership and is organised in ad hoc fashion on social media — sprung up online in May among right-wing groups, researchers and officials said, but has since been taken over by the left and far-left.
The movement reflects popular discontent with a dysfunctional ruling elite preaching a painful gospel of austerity. It is drawing comparisons to the 2018 “Yellow Vest” protests, which arose over fuel price hikes but morphed into a broader movement against Macron and his plans for economic reform.
Anger over budget cuts
A teacher taking part in the protests in Paris said he was against the budget cuts that Prime Minis­ter Francois Bayrou had planned and that led to his defeat in Mon­day’s parliamentary confidence vote.
“Bayrou was ousted, (now) his policies must be eliminated,” said teacher Christophe Lalande, calling for more funding for schools and hospitals.
At another protest in the city, unionist Amar Lagha said: “This day is a message to all the workers of this country: that there is no resignation, the fight continues.” In the western city of Nantes, protesters blocked a highway with burning tires and bins. Police used teargas to disperse people trying to occupy a roundabout.
New French PM
France’s new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu on Wednesday promised a “profound break” with the past as he took over from Francois Bayrou who resigned after losing a confidence vote in parliament.
Speaking at a handover ceremony, Lecornu promised to find “more creative” ways than before to work with opposition parties as he assembles his cabinet, in a bid to end the political crisis.

“Pakistan today assumed the chair of the Shanghai Coope­ra­tion Organisation’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure for 2025-26,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement after the 44th meeting of the RATS council in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyz Republic, decided to pass the chairmanship to Islamabad.
Pakistan welcomed the decision, calling it “a reflection of the confidence of SCO member states in Pakistan’s dedicated efforts and contribution towards regio­nal peace and security, particularly in combating terrorism”.
The FO said Islamabad would work to foster regional cooperation “guided by the Shanghai spirit of mutual trust, equality, and shared responsibility”.
 






The Tashkent-based RATS was created to coordinate counter-te­r­rorism, counter-separatism, and counter-extremism efforts amo­ng SCO members. Its mandate includes intelligence sharing, bu­­ilding databases of banned grou­­ps, joint drills, extradition arran­gements and coordinated operations.
 
 

But progress has often been constrained by political tensions, particularly between Pakistan and India as the Kashmir dispute and terrorism allegations have repeatedly undermined RATS initiatives.
During India’s 2022 chairmanship, efforts to expand a shared intelligence database stalled over disagreements, while participation in RATS-led drills and events has been inconsistent.
Meetings in 2023 and 2025 also saw public exchanges of accusations between the two countries, leaving China and Russia to play balancing roles.
Analysts say such disputes have eroded RATS’s neutrality and limited its ability to function as a seamless multilateral platform.
Despite these challenges, Pakistan pledged to work with SCO partners, international organisations and the United Nations to advance collective counter-terrorism efforts.
The Foreign Office said Pakistan would host events on cyber counterterrorism, information operations, border security, terrorist financing and capacity-building during its tenure.
“In order to develop cooperation, it is planned to hold expert events on the territory of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, including a practical seminar in the area of countering the use of the internet for terrorist, separatist and extremist purposes,” RATS Council said in an information note on the meeting in Kyrgyzstan.
The RATS Council, in its meeting, also approved plans for an executive cxommittee and expert groups, including measures to curb terrorist financing and prevent extremist movements across SCO states.
Members agreed to hold joint information campaigns against international terrorist organisations next year.
In a statement, the council condemned terrorist attacks committed this year on SCO territories, as well as military strikes on civilian facilities and Iran’s nuclear energy infrastructure, echoing language in the Tianjin Declaration of SCO heads of state.

The Anti-Terrorism Balochistan (Amendment) Bill 2025 was tabled by Parliamentary Secretary Mir Zareen Khan Magsi on behalf of the provincial home department, whose minister in-charge is Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.
The bill said it aimed to strengthen the counter-terrorism framework in accordance with international standards. “In light of the evolving security challenges and the sensitive nature of terrorism related cases, the bill see­ks to empower the government to implement add­i­tional protective measures for the safety and security of judges, public prosecutors, defence counsels, witnesses, and other individuals involved in such proceedings,” it said.
The bill introduces a procedure for handling “sensitive terrorism-related cases through a confidentially appointed BS-21 officer”. This officer, who will remain anonymous, would determine whether a case required extraordinary protection under this new iteration of the anti-terrorism measures.
“If so, the chief justice concerned constitutes a panel of five judges and forwards it to the designated authority, who then assigns the case to judge selected from that panel”.
A similar procedure will be adopted for prosecutors from a panel of five in consultation with the prosecutor general concerned. The new amendment also “enables the use of anonymity protocols” as well as virtual proceedings, besides advanced security technologies to safeguard all participants in the trial process.
Similarly, the identities of all those involved in the trial will remain hidden for security purposes and if a courtroom “is used for physical hearings, it shall be situated in secure premises, accessible only to judges, counsels, public prosecutors, witnesses, defence counsels and persons concerned with the trial”.
 
 

Under this bill, the “designated authority” shall be nominated by the provincial government and its identity “shall be kept confidential and shall only be communicated to the chief justice”.
The authority will consult with the chief justice for performing functions, such as deciding whether a case or a class of cases requires extraordinary protection measures, assigning cases to the judges; and consulting and coordinating with the Balochistan government.
“These measures aim to preserve judicial independence, uphold due process, and ensure the effective prosecution of terrorism related offences,” the bill read.
Opposition concerned
JI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman warned that the proposed law would undermine justice and human rights. “We will now serve justice through WhatsApp,” he quipped. According to the JI leader, if any innocent person were killed under the new law, the current government would be responsible. He said that instead of bringing this law, reforms should be introduced in the judiciary. “This law is a murder of human rights and justice,” he claimed.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti defended the bill. He said the counter-terrorism law would not be used against political workers, but solely to punish terrorists in accordance with the law. CM Bugti emphasised that the bill did not deny fair trial rights, and defence lawyers would have access to witnesses before judges.
On the issue of missing persons, the chief minister pledged that the government would permanently resolve the matter through legislation. “Any person arrested will be immediately reported to their family and the magistrate,” he assured. CM Bugti also announced strict action against poppy cultivation, revealing that 35,000 acres of poppy had already been destroyed this year. He vowed to confiscate lands given to Afghan cultivators and end illegal trawling in Makran, calling it “another form of terrorism”.
Levies-police merger
The provincial assembly also passed the Balochistan Forensic Science (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Balochistan Levies Force Bill 2025 under which the Levies would be merged into the Balochistan police.The Maulana argued that the bill required further consultations. Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani, however, noted that the government had invited the opposition for dialogue but could not force their participation.

“In view of the sensitivities attached to the highest institution like the judiciary, it is my humble request to all honourable judges that the best forums for expressing grievances are their tea rooms, the chambers of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, or the committee rooms,” he said.
This marked the minister’s first response to a recent series of letters written by several Supreme Court judges — a development he termed “unfortunate” and part of a troubling trend that has emerged in recent months.
Speaking informally to the media after attending a ceremony outside the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Islamabad, the law minister recalled that even during the New Judicial Year ceremony earlier in the week, apex legal bodies such as the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association had advised judges to resolve such issues privately rather than through public correspondence.
 
 

“This is not in the interest of the judiciary, as such tendencies erode the dignity and reputation of the top court,” he remarked.
He added that if the concerns raised in these letters were genuinely reflective of the internal situation, it was all the more reason to resolve them within institutional boundaries. “Bar councils have always been at the forefront when it comes to safeguarding the judiciary,” he noted, suggesting that lawyers’ bodies remain the appropriate avenue for internal accountability.
The minister’s comments come in the wake of a recent letter by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, along with Justices Munib Akhtar, Ayesha A. Malik, and Athar Minallah, criticizing the convening of Monday’s full court meeting to approve the new Supreme Court Rules 2025 as a mere “cosmetic exercise.”
“The convening of the full court at this stage is not only puzzling but also fallacious,” the judges wrote, alleging that the meeting was intended to give a “veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process.” In a prior letter, Justice Shah questioned whether the CJP was fostering judicial independence or seeking compliance to turn the court into a “regimented force.”
He expressed reluctance in writing the letter but felt compelled by what he described as an “unavoidable institutional duty.” “What compels me to write is your persistent and complete indifference,” he wrote, lamenting that his repe­ated letters and communications on crucial matters had gone unanswered.

• Pakistan, Algeria and Somalia request emergency Security Council session
• MBS, UAE ruler also back Qatar; Canada says will ‘evaluate’ ties with Israel
DOHA / ISLAMABAD / JERUSALEM: As the world rallied around Qatar after Israel’s reckless targeting of Hamas leaders on its soil, it’s leader declared that Benjamin Netanyahu had been wasting their time with the mediation process.
Doha and Egypt have been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
But despite their best efforts, and great flexibility demonstrated by Hamas, Isra­el has repeatedly moved the goalpost, and ‘ghosted’ neg­o­tiators after the Palesti­nian group agreed to the last draft, already vetted by the US.
Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohamed bin Abd­ulrahman Al Thani said the Israeli PM was leading the Middle East towards chaos, adding that today, the entire Gulf region was at risk.
He also revealed that in the wake of the Israeli aggression, Qatar was reassessing everything about its mediating role in the Gaza conflict — as well as Hamas’ future on its territory.
The Qatari PM’s remarks came as the world bristled over Israel’s unprovoked attack, which claimed the lives of at least five members of Hamas’ negotiating team.
Even its most staunch ally, the United States, seemed to waver, with President Donald Trump giving Netanyahu a rare slap on the wrist while denying any role in the attack.
Trump said he was not notified in advance of the Israeli attack on the Gulf state, and said he wasn’t “thrilled about the whole situation”.
Qatar, in addition to its role in the Gaza negotiations, is home to a huge US airbase, and also recently gave Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
“This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” Trump said in a post on social media, insisting that he viewed Qatar as a strong ally and friend.
Trump also focused on the possible damage to his efforts to end the war in Gaza, saying that unilaterally bombing Qatar does not advance Israel or America’s goals.
The US president added that he had assured Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in a phone call that “such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”
Israel, however, doubled down, insisting that it would strike its enemies anywhere in the world.
“There is no place where they can hide,” Defence Minister Isr­ael Katz wrote on X, while Isra­eli ambassador to the US Yech­iel Leiter told Fox News that even if they failed to kill Hamas leaders in Tuesday’s airstrike, the would “succeed next time”.
World rallies around Doha
Pakistan on Wednesday joined Algeria and Somalia in convening an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council and backed calls for a summit of Muslim countries after Israel carried out air strikes in Doha targeting a Hamas delegation of peace negotiators.
The UNSC session, initially scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, was postponed after Qatar requested rescheduling to allow its Prime Minister to attend. The meeting is now set for Thursday.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan had formally requested an urgent UN Security Council session to take up Israel’s “aggression against Qatar as a grave threat to international peace and security”.
He also called on the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, on behalf of the Org­anisation of Islamic Coo­peration (OIC) and in coordination with Gulf states, to hold a debate on the strikes.
The upcoming UNSC meeting is expected to address the serious implications of the Israeli escalation and discuss appropriate international resp­onses.
Saudi Crown Prince Moha­mmed Bin Salman also came out in support of Doha, saying that Riyadh rejected and condemned Israel’s “assaults” in the region.
 
 

“The brutal aggression against the sisterly state of Qatar requires Arab, Islamic and international action,” he said in a televised address, calling on the international community to confront Israeli aggression.
Meanwhile, the attack generated a flurry of diplomacy between Arab states. United Arab Emirates President She­ikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan led a delegation of some of his most senior ministers to Qatar on Wednesday, where he met with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and his cabinet.
Jordan’s Crown Prince Huss­ein is also expected to visit Qatar, while the Saudi crown prince is expected to arrive today Thursday, an official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The visits, which were not previously scheduled, were a show of regional solidarity with Qatar following the Israeli strikes, the official said.
Canada also said it was evaluating its relationship with Israel after the attack on Qatar, saying it considered the action unacceptable, especially given Qatari attempts to facilitate peace in the Middle East.

LAHORE/GUDDU: With South Punjab still in the throes of a devastating flood crisis, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has confirmed a high-lev­el flood situation, particularly in the Sutlej River, after India relea­sed more water on Wednesday.
All barrages in south Punjab on the Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi rivers are flowing at extremely dangerous levels, submerging vast swathes of low-lying areas and posing a severe threat to urban centres, such as Jalalpur, Alipur and Rahim Yar Khan tehsils.
Flood conditions in Jalalpur Pirwala, one of the most badly affected areas, intensified again after the Sutlej started rising and increased pressure on a major embankment.
On Wednesday, a rescue boat carrying 19 people overturned in the area, leading to the death of a child. All others were safely rescued, officials said.
Seven villages in Liaquatpur have been submerged due to the floods. In Alipur, a child died and five people went missing after a boat capsized.
The situation has worsened further due to the breach of the Azm­a­tpur embankment in the Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district.
The ancient city of Seetpur is now at severe risk from floodwaters. Dozens of settlements, inclu­ding Khairpur Sadat, Khan Garh Doma, Azmatpur, Kundarala and Sultanpur, have been inundated.
Water flow
According to Flood Forecasting Data released at 11pm on Wednesday, the water flow at Ganda Singh Wala headworks on the Sutlej River was 182,188 cusecs (steady trend) and was classified as “very high flood”.
Downstream, the flow was steady at 121,698 cusecs (high flood) at Sulemanki headworks and 121,010 (high flood) at Islam headworks.
On the Ravi River, the water flow was normal at both Jassar and Shahdara headworks and was in low flood at Balloki. However, at Sidhnai headworks, the flow was categorised as “very high” at 94,556 cusecs (falling trend).
On the Chenab River, the flow at Panjnad was “very high” at 598,731 cusecs (rising) and “medium” at Trimmu at 231,154 cusecs (steady). The flow at other headworks on the river — Marala, Khanki, Qadirabad and Chiniot — was normal.
Meanwhile, Guddu Barrage recorded a brief spell of high flood on Wednesday morning before returning to medium flood levels by the afternoon, leaving officials puzzled as the anticipated peak has yet to arrive fully.
 
 

The barrage reached high flood stage at 6am with an upstream inflow of 502,844 cusecs and downstream discharge of 492,443 cusecs. “This indicated a high flood when the barrage passed a flow of 500,000 cusecs,” an official said.
Guddu Barrage Chief Engineer Sardar Shah said that following the morning surge, about 10,000 cusecs were diverted into the Begar Sindh Feeder canal on the right bank, which irrigates rice-growing districts in the command area.
Soon after, flows at Guddu fell to 493,281 cusecs upstream and 471,549 cusecs downstream by 1pm. By 11pm on Wednesday, the inflow was 495,509 cusecs, and the outflow was 472,094.
A gauge at Chachran also showed a decline, dropping from 10.5 feet to 10.3 feet by afternoon, indicating the Indus rise had been short-lived.
Mr Shah noted that with a 48-hour time lag between Panjnad and Guddu, the peak recorded at Panjnad on the evening of Sept 7 should have reached Guddu by Tuesday night. Instead, the rise was observed on Sept 10. He said if another peak is building upstream, it could arrive late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, authorities at Sukkur Barrage said they were monitoring the situation closely. Upstream discharge at Sukkur was recorded at 405,665 cusecs and downstream at 382,355 cusecs, with officials watching for the expected peak.
Evacuations accelerated
Meanwhile, Punjab’s Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that over 4,400 villages have been affected due to severe flooding in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
He said that 2,190 villages were affected due to flooding in the Chenab River, 651 villages in the Sutlej River and 1,495 villages in the Ravi River.
More than 4.2 million people have been affected due to the flood situation in the rivers, while 2.19m  people trapped in the floods have been relocated to safe locations.
He said that 404 relief camps and 488 medical camps were established in districts severely affected by floods.
Besides, 421 veterinary camps have been established to provide treatment facilities for livestock. In the affected districts, 1.581m animals have been relocated to safe locations during rescue and relief activities.
Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, while Tarbela Dam is 100pc full, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is 90pc full, Pong Dam is 99pc full and Thein Dam is 97pc full. He said that 76 citizens lost their lives in various incidents.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said that the intensity of monsoon rains has decreased and no further increase in river flows was expected.
However, a Met office forecast indicated that isolated showers were expected in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and the Pothohar region.
Five dead in Karachi
In Karachi, five people were killed and hundreds rescued as heavy downpours and hill torrents from the Kirthar range swelled the Lyari and Malir rivers to record levels, inundating low-lying neighbourhoods and damaging infrastructure.
Floodwaters submerged homes in Gadap, Scheme 33 and along the M-9 motorway, with major relief operations carried out by Edhi Foundation, Rescue 1122, security forces and civic agencies.
A 20-metre section of the Hub Canal and a gas pipeline were damaged, while part of the under-construction Malir Expressway collapsed. Authorities suspended heavy traffic on the M-9 amid fears of further inflows from Balochistan.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said more than 400 people were rescued in the city, while 172 people stranded on the motorway were evacuated.
Separately, four bodies were recovered from a flash flood incident in Gadap Town and a teenage boy died of electrocution in North Nazimabad.
Schools were closed on Wednesday but are set to reopen today (Thursday) as the weather system has moved away from the area.

With Tuesday’s strikes, Israel is expanding military actions that have ranged across the Middle East to include the Gulf Arab state, where the Palestinian group has long had its political base. Qatar, which has acted as a mediator alongside Egypt in talks on a ceasefire in the almost two-year-old conflict in Gaza, condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
In a post on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar wrote that Pakistan requested the meeting along with Somalia and Algeria, after “unprovoked illegal Israeli aggression” in Qatar to “discuss the situation and seize itself of this grave matter”.
“Pakistan expresses its complete solidarity and firm support with the government and brotherly people of Qatar,” Dar wrote.
 






‘Our enemies are not safe anywhere’: Israel
Meanwhile, Israel warned its enemies they were not safe anywhere a day after the strikes, which drew a rare rebuke from United States President Donald Trump.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed that “Israel’s long arm will act against its enemies anywhere”, following Tuesday’s deadly attack on the Gulf state, which hosts a large US military base and has spearheaded repeated rounds of Gaza truce efforts.
“There is no place where they can hide,” Katz wrote on X, adding: “Everyone who took part in the October 7 massacre will be held fully accountable,” referring to Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the nearly two-year Gaza war.
 






Meanwhile, the Israeli ambassador to the United States said that if Israel failed to kill Hamas leaders in the Tuesday air strike, it would succeed next time.
“Right now, we may be subject to a little bit of criticism. They’ll get over it. And Israel is being changed for the better,” Yechiel Leiter told Fox News’ ‘Special Report’ programme late on Tuesday. “If we didn’t get them this time, we’ll get them the next time.”
 
 

Hamas said six people were killed in the strikes, including an aide and an adult son of its top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, as well as three bodyguards and a Qatari security officer.
But the group said its senior leaders had survived, affirming “the enemy’s failure to assassinate our brothers in the negotiating delegation”.
The White House said Trump did not agree with Israel’s decision to take military action and had warned Qatar in advance of the incoming strikes. But Doha said it had not received the warning from Washington until the attack was already underway.
Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, sought to justify the decision, telling an Israeli radio station: “We don’t always act in the interests of the United States.
“It was not an attack on Qatar; it was an attack on Hamas,” Danon told 103FM, adding: “It is too early to comment on the outcome, but the decision is the right one.”
According to sources close to Hamas, six Hamas leaders, including Hayya and former top leader Khaled Meshaal, were in the targeted building at the time. AFP has been unable to reach any of them since then.
‘Shaken conscience of world’
Along with the United States and Egypt, Qatar has led multiple attempts to end the Israel-Hamas conflict and secure the release of the remaining hostages.
In Gaza City on Wednesday, the Israeli military destroyed another high-rise building as it intensifies its assault on the territory’s largest urban centre despite mounting calls to end its campaign.
The military’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, had earlier issued an evacuation warning to those living in and around the Tiba 2 tower. The military said later it had “struck a high-rise building that was used by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the area of Gaza City”.
 






AFP images showed huge plumes of smoke billowing into the sky as the residential tower in western Gaza City crashed to the ground. Palestinians were seen searching through the rubble for any salvageable items.
The Gaza conflict has created catastrophic humanitarian conditions for the population of more than two million, with the UN last month declaring a famine in Gaza City and its surroundings.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she would push to sanction “extremist” Israeli ministers and curb trade ties over the dire situation.
“What is happening in Gaza has shaken the conscience of the world. People killed while begging for food. Mothers holding lifeless babies. These images are simply catastrophic,” she said.
Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, hit back, writing on X that Europe was sending “the wrong message that strengthens Hamas and the radical axis in the Middle East”.
 






‘Not thrilled’
Following Israel’s targeting of Hamas leaders in the Gulf, Qatar’s prime minister said it reserved the right to respond to the attack, which it said constituted a “pivotal moment” for the region.
Trump said he was not notified in advance of the Israeli strikes and “not thrilled about the whole situation”. In a post on social media, he insisted that “this was a decision made by Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me”.
“I view Qatar as a strong ally and friend of the US, and feel very badly about the location of the attack,” he said, adding Hamas’s elimination was still a “worthy goal”.
 


Russia and China joined an international chorus of condemnation, with Moscow saying the operation undermined peace efforts in the Middle East.
Germany, one of Israel’s staunchest supporters, has taken note of those proposals targeting Israel and will participate in a dialogue about future measures, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said today.
Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians. Of the 251 hostages seized during the assault, 47 remain in Gaza, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.
Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,656 Palestinians, most of them civilians.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2025-09-10 19:15</small></div><hr>
