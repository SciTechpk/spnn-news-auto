<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04161256afd5240.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971021/israeli-strikes-kill-20-more-in-gaza-violating-us-backed-ceasefire-again' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli strikes kill 20 more in Gaza, violating US-backed ceasefire again</strong></a><br><p>In the latest violence to undermine the ceasefire in Gaza, health officials said Israeli tank shelling and airstrikes killed 20 Palestinians, including four children, on Wednesday.
Among the dead was a medic who rushed to help victims of a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis and was then killed by a second attack on the same location, health officials said.
Other strikes hit Gaza City in the north, where health officials said a five-month-old boy was killed. The attacks come three days after Israel reopened Gaza’s main border crossing with Egypt, a major step in the US-backed truce.
The Israeli military claimed it had launched the strikes in response to gunmen opening fire against Israeli troops operating near its armistice line with Hamas. It said an Israeli soldier was severely injured by the fire.
Wednesday’s attacks bring the number of Palestinians killed since the border reopened to 28, according to a tally from Gazan health officials.
On Saturday, before its reopening, Israeli strikes killed more than 30 Palestinians in Gaza. The military said it launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in a Gaza area under Israeli control.
Patient crossings at Rafah halted
Palestinian patients preparing to cross through the newly opened Rafah border crossing to Egypt were told that Israel had postponed the passage of patients through the border.
A few hours later, the patients were told to prepare again to cross the border.
A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations.
“They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed,” Raja’a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances.
An Egyptian security source told Reuters that efforts were being made to reopen the crossing, and that Israel had cited security issues in the Rafah area as the reason for the closure.
The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, claimed in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, adding that it had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to facilitate the crossing.
The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.







Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters.
A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday.

 

In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire, where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave’s future governance and reconstruction.
Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from over 50 per cent of Gaza, which they currently occupy, and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence.
Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian fighters have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
The Oct 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the offensive killed around 1,200 in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</p><small>2026-02-04 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041528555e302eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971002/pakistan-kazakhstan-trade-target' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Kazakhstan aim to increase bilateral trade to $1bn</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday vowed to take bilateral trade volume with Kazakhstan to $1 billion over the next year, citing the potential of the two countries.
The premier made the announcement while addressing a joint press conference with Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who is currently on a two-day visit to Pakistan.
A signing ceremony was held at the joint press conference, where the two countries signed 27 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in several sectors, including petroleum, mining, and maritime affairs.







At the outset of his address, PM Shehbaz welcomed the delegation from Kazakhstan, noting that it was the “first time in 23 years that a Kazakh president was visiting the country”.
He stated that the two of them had “very useful and productive meetings since the morning, and just now we signed 37 MoUs”.
PM Shehbaz expressed hope that President Tokayev “will make sure that the MoUs are converted into agreements and then [move] to their implementation phase as early as possible”.
The premier also vowed to ensure “speedy” implementation of the MoUs on his part.
“If we are to make these MoUs a reality, our economic, trade, and cultural relations will go notches higher,” the premier maintained.
He commended President Tokayev for being a “very serious-minded politician, an accomplished diplomat”.
He also congratulated the Kazakh premier on receiving Nishan-i-Pakistan, stressing that the honour reflected Pakistan’s “deep appreciation of your visionary leadership and your outstanding contribution towards strengthening the close and friendly ties between our two brotherly countries”.
The premier then shifted his attention to US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, and congratulated President Tokayev for joining the board.
“Let us pray and hope to God that we will be successful in bringing long-lasting peace in Gaza, its reconstruction, and of course, make the two-state solution a reality as soon as possible,” PM Shehbaz said.
“Kazakhstan is blessed with infinite natural resources, and you are one of the leading countries in the field of mining minerals and [exporting] them along with petroleum products, oil and gas”.
“Pakistan is also blessed with infinite natural resources, great human minds and a very hardworking population,” PM Shehbaz said.
However, he noted that Pakistan and Kazakhstan’s “trade volume was just a meagre $250 million during the last year”.
“This does not just reflect the strength of our friendship but also the potential of our two countries,” he added.
He continued: “Let us make the commitment that we will take up our trade volume to $1 billion in the next year”.
He called on the Pakistani and Kazakh business communities to invest in joint ventures, stressing that the current investment portfolio was “negligible” despite great potential on both sides.
PM Shehbaz detailed that the two sides had agreed to the “Belarus-Russia-Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan transport corridor to enhance regional connectivity”.
He assured President Tokayev that Pakistan will offer to Kazakhstan “full access to Pakistan’s transit infrastructure and seaport facilities”.
Located in Central Asia, Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country. It borders Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
On the matter of energy, the premier expressed faith that the collaboration between the two countries in the sector will be a “win-win situation”.
Shehbaz further stressed that Pakistan regarded Kazakhstan as a “strategic and one of the most valued partners in Central Asia”.
“I am absolutely confident that with our collaboration and discussion today, with productive, encouraging outcomes and this signing ceremony, we will not only reinvigorate our relations but also give a huge impetus to our bilateral ties,” the premier said.
Detailing the meeting between the two, PM Shehbaz said that President Tokayev gave a “wonderful roadmap for our future cooperation”.
“This could only come from a visionary leader like you, who has great experience, great expertise and knowledge,” the prime minister added.
He further stressed that as Pakistan and Kazakhstan’s partnership strengthens, “we look forward to exploring new horizons of cooperation in trade, culture, education and many other areas”.
Pakistan ‘reliable and important partner’
President Tokayev, in his address, termed Pakistan a “reliable and important partner in South Asia and beyond”.
“Our people are united by centuries-old ties rooted in the legacy of the great Silk Road, as well as by deep cultural and spiritual affinity,” he said.
“Our nations share common values, traditions, and joint aspirations for the future,” he added.
He detailed that the two countries “signed a historical document — a joint declaration — on establishing a strategic partnership between Pakistan and Kazakhstan”.
“By elevating our relations to a new level, we open up immense opportunities to engage across the full spectrum of bilateral and multilateral agendas,” he added.
President Tokayev lauded PM Shehbaz for “his significant, decisive contribution to deepening friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries“.
He noted that Islamabad’s “regional and global standing continues to grow” under the leadership of PM Shehbaz.
Tokayev lauded Pakistan’s efforts in “strengthening peace and stability in the region,” recalling Pakistan’s election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.
“Today, Pakistan possesses strong economic potential, well-developed industrial capacity and extensive transit and transport capabilities,” he added.
He also commended the “dynamic development of Pakistan’s defence industry”, which he said was “well-recognised globally”.
Speaking about his meeting with the prime minister, he said, “We just held very substantive and productive talks with PM Shehbaz”.
“This afternoon, I will also have the privilege of meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari,” he added.
He said that during his meeting with PM Shehbaz, the pair discussed “trade, transport and logistics, industry, energy, information technology, as well as cultural and humanitarian cooperation”.
“Important intergovernmental documents were adopted, focusing on result-oriented engagement across the full bilateral spectrum,” he added.
He also took note of the two countries’ trade ties, which he said were now “gaining new momentum”.
“Last year, bilateral trade doubled compared to the previous year,” he said, adding that the “roadmap for trade and economic cooperation is being effectively implemented”.
Echoing PM Shehbaz’s earlier commitment on expanding bilateral trade ties, he said, “We agreed to take concrete measures to further increase trade volume with an ambitious yet achievable target of reaching $1bn in the near future, emphasising the importance of creating favourable conditions to intensify cooperation between our business communities”.
He added that the transport and logistics project “aimed at expanding trade” will be prioritised.
The Kazakh president stressed that Pakistan’s role in transit and logistics could “offer us alternative access to international markets”.
He said that the two leaders discussed “the capabilities of Pakistan’s ports of Karachi and Gwadar as priority issues.
The visiting head of state added that the two also addressed the “development of Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor and transit routes passing through Afghanistan”.
The two sides also agreed to “explore the possibility of resuming direct air connection between the two countries”.
Speaking about the energy sector, President Tokayev said that the two “exchanged views on the prospects of Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India TAPI gas pipeline”.
He further said that the two sides have signed agreements in the agriculture sector.
He said that the agreements will pave the way for “expanding trade and establishing joint production facilities”.
Taking note of both countries’ “substantial industrial capabilities”, he invited Pakistani companies to set up production facilities in Kazakhstan.
He added that the two also agreed to “expand mutually beneficial cooperation in the defence industry”.
“Cooperation between our security and law enforcement agencies has been developing dynamically in recent years,” President Tokayev noted.
He also said that the two leaders, during their meeting, “emphasised the strategic importance of AI and digital technologies, especially for economic growth, and we confirmed our readiness to walk jointly in this field”.
Tokayev expressed readiness to “provide favourable conditions for Pakistani investors in Kazakhstan”.
“More than 250 companies from both countries will come together and sign a number of commercial agreements,” he said, referring to the Kazakhstan-Pakistan Business Forum — to be held later today.
He expressed confidence that the event will “unlock untapped potential in trade, economic and investment relations”.
He recalled that in his meeting with the prime minister, the two also discussed the “popularity” of Kazakhstan’s higher education among Pakistani youth.
“Currently, more than 1,000 Pakistanis students are studying in Kazakhstan in various fields,” President Tokayev said.
The two sides agreed to “foster cooperation in science and education,” according to President Tokayev.
Earlier, PM Shehbaz warmly welcomed President Tokayev at his official residence.
President Tokayev was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned out contingent of the armed forces following his arrival.







The Kazakh president arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday for a two-day official visit as the two nations seek to further bolster bilateral ties.
The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
Tokayev is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials. A video shared by his office showed the streets in Islamabad adorned with Kazakhstan’s national flag.
FM Dar welcomes Tokayev
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with President Tokayev and welcomed him to Pakistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.
During the meeting, Dar “underscored Pakistan’s appreciation for the growing momentum of high-level political exchanges.”
The foreign minister “reaffirmed the shared commitment to expand bilateral cooperation across political, economic, & people-to-people domains, and to work together for durable peace, stability, and development in the region,” FO said.







Agreement to deepen trade, connectivity and investment cooperation
Separately, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan held a comprehensive bilateral meeting with Kazakhstan’s Minister of Trade and Integration Arman Shaqqaliev, at the Ministry of Commerce in Islamabad on Wednesday.
The two sides explored avenues for expanding economic cooperation, connectivity and investment, according to a press release.
“Both sides agreed that improved rail, road and multimodal connectivity is fundamental to strengthening Pakistan–Kazakhstan trade and enabling sustainable, long-term economic engagement,” the statement said.
The Kazakh minister highlighted the strategic importance of developing major infrastructure projects, particularly railway and road corridors. He emphasised Kazakhstan’s vision of becoming a regional hub connecting Central Asia with South Asia, China, Europe and the Global South, including Pakistan’s ports, the statement added.
Meanwhile, Jam Kamal Khan said that improved transit routes would not only benefit Pakistan and Kazakhstan but also open broader opportunities for regional and global trade.
“Both ministers discussed cooperation in priority sectors, including agriculture and food security, pharmaceuticals, textiles, sports goods, leather products, mining and minerals, energy, and infrastructure development,” the statement said.
The meeting also reviewed the need for structured business-to-business (B2B) engagement. It was agreed to work towards finalising a framework document outlining priority sectors, trade targets and a roadmap of activities, including trade missions, exhibitions and exchange of delegations.
“Both ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to transforming Pakistan–Kazakhstan economic relations from potential to performance,” the statement added.
They expressed confidence that sustained institutional coordination and private-sector engagement would significantly enhance bilateral trade and investment in the coming years.
‘Important and timely opportunity’
In a handout issued earlier on Tuesday, the President’s Secretariat said that President Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country sometime this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to hold meetings with President Zardari and PM Shehbaz, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.
This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><small>2026-02-04 11:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04142229cbfdaf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971023/mobile-internet-remains-suspended-in-parts-of-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan for the fifth consecutive day, with provincial authorities also halting train services in the province in the wake of last week’s coordinated terrorist attacks across the province.
“Keeping in mind the worsening law and order situation in the province, mobile internet has been shut down,” said Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat while speaking to Dawn about the situation in Quetta.
However, he added, “Now that the situation is returning to normal, it has been decided to restore mobile internet service from tomorrow at 12am midnight.”
Meanwhile, mobile data services reportedly remained suspended in Nushki, and in Mastung, where services were briefly restored.
Mobile data has been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur, Sibi and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns.
Separately, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn that train services from Quetta to other parts of the country remain suspended.
He added that “once the security situation improves and we receive clearance, services of the Jaffar Express (Quetta-Peshawar) and the Bolan Mail (Quetta-Karachi) will be restored”.
On Tuesday, security forces continued ‘mop-up actions’ in Nushki district and other parts of the province following the coordinated attacks, with the number of terrorists killed now at 197.
In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, Deputy Commissioner (DC) office and a Federal Constabulary (FC) camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire.
But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04151121bc0fbfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971014/punjab-government-notifies-public-holidays-on-feb-6-7-for-basant' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab government notifies public holidays on Feb 6, 7 for Basant</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has notified public holidays in the province on February 6 and 7 (Friday and Saturday) for Basant, said a notification.
The notification was issued on Tuesday by the provincial government’s Services and General Administration Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
“It is hereby notified for general information that 6th and 7th February, 2026 (Friday and Saturday) shall be observed as public holidays in the province of Punjab,” the notification said.







On Sunday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had announced a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a Basant holiday.
“Punjab will enjoy a long weekend with Kashmir Day on February 5, a provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday.
“We hope people across Punjab take this time to relax, recharge, and make the most of the break,” she posted on X.







The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has said dry weather with clear skies was expected for the majority of the Basant festival.
“Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said.
Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
However, it is set to make a grand return after a hiatus of 18 years, after the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying in December and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041133157cb09e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971010/police-constable-martyred-by-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Police constable martyred by terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists martyred a police recruit constable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the local police said on Wednesday.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets.
The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat.
District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School.
“On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said.
The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers.
The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty.
“The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said.
“The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Despite record militant deaths, the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan.
Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said.
The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04140135f152767.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971016/chaudhry-sugar-mills-case-lhc-directs-nab-to-approach-trial-court-for-closing-inquiry-against-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Chaudhry Sugar Mills case: LHC directs NAB to approach trial court for closing inquiry against Maryam</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to move the trial court concerned after the anti-graft body decided to close the Chaudhry Sugar Mills inquiry against Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
The case pertains to alleged money laundering and income beyond means via “dubious” business transactions of the Chaudhry Sugar Mills, of which Maryam was a major shareholder.
A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and including Justices Muhammad Jawad Zafar and Abher Gul Khan, heard CM Maryam’s civil miscellaneous application seeking the refund of Rs70 million deposited as a guarantee in the case.
During the proceedings, the NAB’s prosecutor informed the bench that following the new amendments, the bureau’s chairman had approved the closure of the probe.
Justice Neelum, however, observed that the NAB should have approached the accountability court concerned for closure of the inquiry.
Questioning the investigation process, the chief justice asked the bureau’s counsel to explain the procedure adopted in the case.
In response, the prosecutor stated that the NAB board had decided in a meeting to close the inquiry.
The prosecutor answered the bench in the affirmative when asked whether a new NAB board could reopen the case in the future.
At this, the bench remarked that such a situation would render the NAB board’s decision to close a case meaningless.
Justice Neelum observed, “If the court orders the release of the bail surety amount today and the case is reopened tomorrow, all blame would fall on the court.”
Subsequently, the bench directed the NAB to approach the relevant accountability court within one month for the formal closure of the Chaudhry Sugar Mills inquiry.
A NAB team had arrested Maryam in connection with the case on Aug 8, 2019 when she was present at the Kot Lakhpat jail on her weekly visit to her incarcerated father Nawaz.
On Nov 4, 2019, the LHC released Maryam in the sugar mills case on bail, subject to surrendering her passport to the court. She was also ordered to deposit a surety amount of Rs70m with the registrar judicial of the court.
In October 2022, the LHC directed officials to return the passport to Maryam after the NAB said it did not require the travel document anymore.</p><small>2026-02-04 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041259558396b5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971015/un-security-council-condemns-heinous-and-cowardly-acts-of-terrorism-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council condemns ‘heinous and cowardly acts’ of terrorism in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the series of terrorist attacks across multiple locations in Balochistan.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNSC said the attacks, which occurred on January 31, 2026, were carried out across the province and described them as “heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism”.







The UNSC expressed its “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governor and people of Pakistan”. The council also wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured in the attacks.
The statement reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”.
It added that it was crucial to “hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,” urging all states to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in accordance with international law and relevant UNSC resolutions.
The UNSC reiterated that “any act of terrorism is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of motivation, timing, or perpetrator”.
It further stressed that all states must combat terrorism “by all means, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law,” in order to address threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.
Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism.
“We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.
The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks staged across the province on Saturday.</p><small>2026-02-04 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041324269c40a0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970999/us-india-discuss-critical-minerals-cooperation-and-strategic-ties-during-washington-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>US, India discuss critical minerals cooperation and strategic ties during Washington meeting</strong></a><br><p>The United States and India have held high-level talks in Washington focused on critical minerals cooperation, trade and strategic ties.
The talks were held late on Tuesday against the backdrop of a recently finalised bilateral trade deal that has drawn attention across the region.
Diplomatic observers in Washington, however, maintain that the agreement is unlikely to affect recently improved bilateral ties between Pakistan and the US, as those are not linked to India.
The observers note that recent developments in the greater Middle East, as well as in South and Central Asia, have further enhanced Pakistan’s relevance as a key regional player in Washington’s strategic calculus.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during the latter’s three-day official visit to the United States, as both sides moved to deepen economic and strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific.
According to the US State Department readout, Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar discussed “formalising bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration, mining, and processing”, an area of growing importance amid global supply chain realignments and competition over energy transition resources.
The meeting came ahead of the inaugural critical minerals ministerial scheduled for Wednesday and followed the conclusion of a long-pending trade agreement between Washington and New Delhi. Under the deal, the US has agreed to reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent after nearly a year of negotiations.
“Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar welcomed the trade deal reached between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi,” the US statement said, adding that the two leaders “emphasised the importance of our democracies working together to unlock new economic opportunities and advance our shared energy security goals”.
In a post on social media, Secretary Rubio said: “Met Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar to discuss our bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration and work together to unlock new economic opportunities between our two countries. We also commended the trade deal between the United States and India.”







Jaishankar, in his own message, said he was “delighted to meet US Secretary Rubio this afternoon”, describing it as “a wide-ranging conversation that covered our bilateral cooperation agenda, regional and global issues”.
“Facets of India — US Strategic Partnership discussed included trade, energy, nuclear, defence, critical minerals and technology,” he said, adding: “Agreed on the early meetings of various mechanisms to advance our shared interests.”







The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to expanding “bilateral and multilateral cooperation” through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which brings together the United States, India, Japan and Australia.
The US readout said the meeting concluded with both leaders expressing their commitment to strengthening cooperation through the Quad, while acknowledging that “a prosperous Indo-Pacific region remains vital to advancing our shared interests”.
Pakistan, which has been seeking to stabilise its economic relations with Washington while navigating an increasingly polarised regional environment, is also attending the critical minerals meeting.
Pakistani participation in the Washington gathering is seen as part of broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation in the development and processing of critical minerals.
India will diversify energy supplies: minister
India will diversify its energy sources as a strategy amid changing global circumstances and ensure energy security for its citizens, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday, days after the US said New Delhi will halt Russian oil purchases.
Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India that slashed tariffs on Indian goods to 18pc from 50pc in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.
Trump said India would instead buy oil from the US and potentially Venezuela. The Kremlin on Tuesday, however, said it had heard no statements from India about halting purchases of Russian oil.

 

In his first statement to the parliament on the trade deal, Goyal did not refer to shifting energy purchases away from any country.

When the winter’s fog finally yields to the sun’s warm gaze, the skies above the walled city awaken. Kites (‘patangs’) burst upward from rooftops, their paper bodies trembling, their tails slicing the blue sky like calligraphy in motion.
This is Basant: a centuries-old festival marked by marigold blooms and kites, carried by colour and the steady pull of the wind.
Bo Kata! — a festival of freedom and flight
Basant traces its roots to Vasant Panchami, the ancient herald of spring observed on the fifth day of Magh, when the land stirs from winter’s slumber. In the mustard fields of Punjab, ochre blooms unfurl like carpets laid for spring’s arrival. Goddess Saraswati, (the goddess of learning and the arts), clad in saffron-gold, is invoked with music and learning, her veena (an Indian stringed instrument) resonating with the promise of renewal.
In Lahore, however, Basant long outgrew its ritual origins. It became deeply Punjabi, exuberantly urban, and radically inclusive. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh households alike climbed their roofs, dressed in amber and marigold hues, turning the city into a living mosaic where faith receded, and celebration took flight.
Historical chronicles recall Basant at its most magnificent during the Mughal era. Emperors revelled in the spectacle: kites wheeling above the ramparts of Lahore Fort, their strings guided by hands adorned with henna. Amir Khusrau, the Sufi poet whose verses still seem to linger in the city’s breath, sang of Basant as a season of love, colour, and divine intoxication.

Later, in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the festival assumed an even grander, almost theatrical form. For 10 days, Lahore became a city lost in celebration. Marigold garlands draped streets and courtyards; soldiers appeared in turmeric-hued turbans; women swayed on jhulas (swings), the steady beat of the dhol travelled through every lane. Above it all, kite battles drew cheers of “Bo kata!” from rooftop to rooftop.
Yet the true poetry of Basant lies not in its pomp, but in the humble kite itself. A fragile diamond-framed paper and bamboo, it is tethered to earth by a single string, yet it yearns for the heavens. In the hands of a Lahori child or elder, the patang becomes more than play: it is an act of transcendence. As the wind takes hold, the kite escapes the dust and clamour of crowded streets, briefly escaping the confines of class and circumstance, carrying the hopes of those who hold the string below.
For many in Lahore, Basant has always been this quiet rebellion against gravity. In narrow streets where life presses close, the rooftop becomes a stage for liberation. A young man, burdened by tomorrow’s worries, sends his kite aloft and watches it soar, higher, freer, until it seems to touch the very edge of possibility. A woman, her heart full of unspoken longings, lets the wind carry her kite as if it could bear her dreams to distant horizons.
The kite is an escape made visible: fragile yet defiant, tethered yet boundless. It reminds us that even the smallest soul can touch the infinite if given the right wind.
The ghost of Basant lingering in memory for two decades
For nearly two decades, however, the skies remained silent. The ban descended after tragic losses, lives claimed by sharp, glass-coated or metallic strings that sliced through the air, severing throats and injuring bystanders on rooftops and streets below.
The silence was born of necessary grief and reckoning, a painful but essential pause to protect what mattered most.
Families who once gathered with spools of thread in their hands now looked up at an empty blue sky, feeling the absence like a missing heartbeat. Old men sat on charpoys in the evenings, eyes distant, murmuring about days when the sky was alive with colour. Mothers recalled their children’s laughter as they ran across terraces, cheeks flushed with sun and excitement. Young people, who had known Basant only through stories and grainy videos, carried a quiet nostalgia for something they had never truly touched.

The city missed it deeply: the shared joy, the playful rivalries, the way the wind seemed to carry away every worry for a single radiant day. Basant had become a beloved ghost, lingering over rooftops and in memory.
But the longing never died. It lived in whispered conversations, in turmeric-hued kurtas worn on spring days as quiet tribute, in the careful way kite-makers kept their craft alive in the city’s hidden corners. It lived in the hope that one day the skies would fill again — not recklessly, but with wisdom earned from sorrow.
Lahore’s patangs are set to rise once more, responsibly
And now, as February has ascended, the wind is stirring once more. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, with its strict mandates for cotton strings only (no metallic or glass coatings), QR-coded registration, maximum nine threads, drone monitoring, and zero tolerance for violations, the patangs will rise again, thoughtfully and safely, over the rooftops of Lahore on February 6, 7, and 8, 2026.
The old songs are being rehearsed, the dhol awaits its beat, and the air will soon carry the sweet scent of marigold sweets and the gentle tug of ordinary thread. What was lost is being remembered with care; what was mourned is being welcomed back, wiser and more precious for the wait.
As one lifelong resident of Anarkali, Anwar Bajwa, shared with quiet emotion:
“Basant was never just a day for me; it was part of who I was, part of every spring morning when the air turned warm and full of promise. As a boy, I would wake before dawn and run to the rooftop with my siblings, thread in hand, my heart racing for the wind to lift our kites. Those patangs were my companions, my secrets, my way of whispering dreams to the sky when words fell short. Every tug on the string felt like my own heartbeat reaching higher.”

 

He added that when the rooftops went silent, “it was like losing a piece of my childhood. The empty sky in spring felt wrong, heavy, and incomplete. Now, hearing that the kites will fly again, safely and responsibly, I feel that old excitement stirring inside me, like time has turned back and I’m that boy once again, waiting for the wind to carry my dreams up where nothing can touch them.”
The skies of old Basant were tapestries of scarlet, emerald, indigo, and amber, woven by thousands of patangs locked in gentle combat. Rooftops brimmed with laughter, the air thick with the scent of marigold-hued sweets. Families gathered, strangers became friends, and for radiant days, Lahore was united in pure, unbridled joy.
The kite, too, carries its own quiet symbolism. A close look reveals intricate designs — stars, eyes, flowers — each patang a small work of art, born in the hands of artisans who know the wind’s secrets.
And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above.
The return of flight and soaring spirits
As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred.
In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more.
When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

Until last Sunday, the memorial was perched on a mound roughly 40 feet high, and land around it had been cleared and levelled to develop a commercial area for an upcoming housing society.
The Department of Archaeology and Museums (Doam) had prevented the housing authority from relocating the World War I memorial. However, on Tuesday, officials from Doam who visited the site reported that the mound had been flattened and the memorial dismantled. Pictures shared by officials showed a few blocks of the memorial lying in freshly levelled earth.
The monument was erected by the British Empire after 1914 to honour local soldiers who fought in the Great War. It stood as a symbol of recognition on Kuri Road, near Rehara village, but it is now gone.
The developers, Capital Development Authority and private housing scheme, approached Doam six months ago, requesting a no objection certificate (NOC) to relocate the memorial to a roundabout (to be built about 100 meters from its original location), ensuring visibility and accessibility.
“The roundabout may be named after the World War I memorial, thereby perpetuating its legacy and significance,” CDA stated in a letter to Doam.
However, Doam rejected the proposal, asserting that the memorial was built in honour of the men from villages like Rehara, who sacrificed their lives. Moving it would defeat its purpose.

 

Doam emphasised that the memorial must be protected first and added to Islamabad’s list of historical monuments, which requires the necessary documentation from the CDA.
Documents seen by Dawn revealed that Doam had been writing to CDA chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa, as well as the revenue department of the civic agency, since 2020, to obtain records of the war memorial. The archaeology department had also requested records of other historical sites, including the Mughal-era Rehara mosque, located 200 metres from the memorial, so it could also be protected.
“CDA has not once responded to the numerous letters Doam has sent over the last six years,” a senior official from the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture told Dawn.
“Minister for National Heritage and Culture Aurangzeb Khan Khichi faced embarrassment, especially as representatives from Unesco were visiting Pakistan when news of the memorial’s demolition reached him. A full report of the incident has been sent to the minister for further action,” he added.
Mr Khichi did not answer his phone when contacted for comments.

Spot gold gained 2.7 per cent to$5,071.79 per ounce as of 03:53 GMT, after surging 5.9pc on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain since November 2008. Bullion scaled a record high of $5,594.82 last Thursday.
US gold futures for April delivery climbed 3.2pc to $5,092.0 per ounce.
“Gold has climbed back about the key $5,000 level, … (as) geopolitical tensions have lifted the metal’s safe-haven appeal after US forces downed an Iranian drone,” said Jigar Trivedi, a senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities.
The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.
Nuclear talks between the US and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source.
Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a spending deal into law that ends a partial US government shutdown, which had delayed key labour data reports that were due for release this week.
Investors expect at least two Fed interest rate cuts in 2026 and await ADP private payroll data later in the day for more cues on the Fed’s policy path. Non-yielding bullion tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments.
“Going ahead (gold) prices may touch $5,100 in the very near-term … and we are expecting the same $5,600 levels by the end of the first half or April-end while prices will continue to rise thereafter and our year-end target is $6,000/oz,” Trivedi added.
The current wave is expected to be sharp, probably to surge into the $4,950 to $5,198 range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday.
Spot silver rose 3.2pc to $87.84 an ounce. It touched a record high of $121.64 on Thursday.

He is remembered not only by his faithful followers but also by vulnerable communities globally, as he was a champion of community-based development as well as efforts to combat natural disasters.
Late Prince Karim, the Aga Khan IV, was not only the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, but also a prominent statesman and key supporter of global development.
Prince Karim was born on Dec 13, 1936 in Geneva to late Prince Aly Khan and his first wife, the late Princess Tajuddawlah, née Joan Yarde-Buller. He spent his early childhood in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

 

The philanthropist was also an accomplished skier and represented Iran at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.
He founded what is now the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) more than 50 years ago, with the purpose of improving the quality of life of those in need — regardless of origin, race, gender or religion — through efforts in health care, education, habitat, culture and the creation of economic opportunity.
The AKDN is active in more than 30 countries, with a particular focus on some of the poorest parts of Asia and Africa.
Prince Karim held the position of Aga Khan for 67 years after succeeding his grandfather, Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan III, in 1957 at the age of 20.

 

He guided all the agencies that comprise the AKDN to work closely with national and local governments on a politically neutral basis and to identify and implement solutions in a collaborative manner.
The alleviation of poverty, enhancement of pluralism and gender equality, and protection of the environment are among its key areas of focus.
The institutional framework and holistic approach of the AKDN have led to the establishment of two universities, over 200 schools and more than 700 health facilities.
There are parks and gardens, foundations that work in social and cultural development, as well as microfinance programmes, environmental protection and climate change mitigation initiatives, habitat planning, disaster preparedness and humanitarian assistance.
There are also businesses in commercial banking, insurance, telecommunications, energy, tourism and media.
The AKDN’s impact is wide-ranging: it annually generates electricity for 10 million people, provides health care to 5m, educates 2m students, and hosts 5m visitors at its parks and gardens.
With an annual budget of approximately $1bn for its non-profit activities, AKDN agencies employ some 96,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Asians and Africans living and working in their home countries or regions.
Education
Providing access to high-quality education in the developing world and promoting gender-equal education were among the most important priorities of the late Prince Karim. He inherited and enhanced schools that his grandfather, Aga Khan III, established in Asia and Africa, and expanded the portfolio of 200 schools to serve more than 85,000 students.
Following the tradition of his ancestors, who founded Al-Azhar University in Cairo in 970, Prince Karim placed great importance on education and established the Aga Khan University in 1983 as Pakistan’s first private, internationally chartered university. It is home to leading medical, nursing and education faculties and programmes.

 

It operates in six countries, in partnership with the governments of Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan through an international treaty. Prince Karim also founded the University of Central Asia in 2000 to improve the social and economic development of Central Asia, with special attention to its high-mountain societies.
Continuing this initiative, he also supported partnerships with leading universities across the world and endowed programmes at Harvard, MIT and Brown.
Patron of the arts
The Aga Khan was deeply engaged in the arts and cultural matters, and established programmes and initiatives to support architecture, music and conservation.
The Aga Khan Award for Architecture was established in 1977 and, with a prize fund of $1m, is awarded every three years to projects that set new standards of excellence in architecture, planning practices, preservation and landscape architecture.
The Aga Khan Music Programme fosters the development of musical heritage in societies where Muslims have a significant presence.

 

The Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme supports the delivery of restoration and conservation projects and the creation of parks and gardens, such as Al-Azhar Park in Cairo.
Underlining his commitment to preserving Muslim heritage, Prince Karim in 2014 opened the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, home to over 1,000 masterpieces showcasing the arts of Muslim civilisations.
Sporting pursuits
Building on a long family tradition, the Aga Khan was a globally recognised horse owner and breeder.

 

With stud farms in France and Ireland where his racehorses were bred and raised, Prince Karim had five Derby winners — including Shergar, who won the Irish and Epsom Derbies — four winners of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and a record seven winners of the Prix de Diane.
Bridge building
Prince Karim embodied understanding and tolerance, promoted unity, and underscored the crucial importance of peace as a foundational building block for the progress of society.
Through his personal efforts over the course of six decades, he played a vital role in bringing peace to a fragmented world. He facilitated diplomatic talks at regional and global levels, including the landmark 1985 summit between Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva.

 

In partnership with the Government of Canada, he founded the Global Centre for Pluralism in 2006. The centre works with policy leaders, educators and community builders around the world to amplify and implement the transformative power of pluralism.
Titles and honours
The hereditary title “Aga Khan” (meaning “Commanding Chief”) is an honorific title given by the 19th-century Persian Qajar monarch, Fath Ali Shah (1797–1834), to the 46th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I (1817–1881).
In keeping with the recognition accorded to the previous three Aga Khans by British monarchs, Queen Elizabeth II granted the title “His Highness” to Aga Khan IV in 1957.
The Ismailis live in over 35 countries, mainly in Central, East and South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australia, and number approximately 12–15m.
In acknowledgement of his exceptional contributions to human development and improving social conditions globally, Prince Karim received distinctions of honour from France, Portugal, Kenya, Canada, the United Kingdom, Iran, India, Pakistan and Senegal.

 

He received 44 international awards, including honorary Canadian citizenship and the UN Champion for Global Change Award, and was the recipient of 24 honorary degrees from leading institutions such as Cambridge, Harvard and McGill.
His Highness the Aga Khan IV graduated from Harvard University in 1959 with a B.A. Honours degree in Islamic history.
His grandfather served twice as the president of the League of Nations, and his uncle was a long-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Prince Karim cared deeply about the continued development of communities and societies, irrespective of their faith.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04112216dc82892.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971008/human-rights-watch-warns-us-heading-to-authoritarianism' target='_blank'><strong>Human Rights Watch warns US heading to ‘authoritarianism’</strong></a><br><p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was turning the United States into an authoritarian state as democracy declines globally to its lowest ebb in four decades.
Trump’s return to the White House has intensified a “downward spiral” on human rights that was already under pressure from Russia and China, the New York‑based advocacy and research group said in its annual report.
“The rules‑based international order is being crushed,” HRW said.
In the United States, the group said, Trump has shown “blatant disregard for human rights and egregious violations.”
In descriptions that would have been unthinkable in the US section of its previous annual reports, the group pointed to the deployment of masked, armed agents — the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency — which has carried out “hundreds of unnecessarily violent and abusive raids.”
“The administration’s racial and ethnic scapegoating, domestic deployment of National Guard forces in pretextual power grabs, repeated acts of retaliation against perceived political enemies and former officials now critical of him, as well as attempts to expand the coercive powers of the executive and neuter democratic checks and balances, underpin a decided shift towards authoritarianism in the US,” the report said.
Human Rights Watch repeated its finding that the United States engaged in enforced disappearances — a crime under international law — by sending 252 Venezuelan migrants to a maximum‑security prison in El Salvador.
In a recent report, HRW documented allegations by the men, who eventually were allowed into Venezuela, of being tortured, including beatings and sexual violence.
‘Less free’ now
Human Rights Watch pointed to metrics by which democracy has declined to the level of 1985 — when the Soviet Union still existed.
“Russia and China are less free today than 20 years ago. And so is the United States,” it said.
Philippe Bolopion, the group’s executive director, called on countries to form alliances based on respect for human rights and to stand together — including against the tariff‑wielding Trump.
“Some countries may be tempted to forge ad hoc alliances on specific issues — one day with China, another with Turkey, another with South Africa,” Bolopion told AFP.
“From our perspective, for such an alliance to be strong and lasting, it must be built on principles and values — democracy, international law, human rights,” he said.
“It can carry weight and provide a degree of security to its members,” he said.
The 529‑page report stands in contrast to the latest human rights report issued by the US State Department, which toned down sections on countries friendly to Trump.
The State Department report said El Salvador in 2024 saw “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” and that President Nayib Bukele’s crackdown on gangs has brought crime to a “historic low.”
The Human Rights Watch report also said that gang violence had “markedly declined” but that in 2025 authorities carried out “widespread abuses, including mass arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and ill‑treatment of detainees and due process violations.”
HRW again renewed its charge that Israel has carried out “crimes against humanity and acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing” against Palestinians in Gaza.
It said that Israeli authorities in 2025 “escalated their atrocities” which included “killing, maiming, starving and forcibly displacing Palestinians and destroying their homes, schools and infrastructure at a scale unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine.”
Israel has angrily rejected the Human Rights Watch genocide allegation first issued in December 2024, with the United States backing Israel’s stance.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0410593969ff18d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971005/bulls-sustain-rally-with-kse-100-up-over-1000-points-during-early-trading-on-wednesday' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls sustain rally, with KSE-100 up over 1,000 points during early trading on Wednesday</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, was trading higher at 10:45am on Wednesday, up 1,105.24 points from its previous close.

Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh, who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns.
The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15.
With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A.
It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention.
Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18.Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands.
“That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said.
The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that.
“Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said.Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group.
The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate, under scrutiny.
The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents.
Confidence restored
Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand.
However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence.Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia.
“We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub.
“We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said.
The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease.
The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.
Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive.
Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component.
When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat.
Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan.
For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04082705d296181.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970927/qadhafis-son-saif-shot-dead-in-libya' target='_blank'><strong>Qadhafi’s son Saif shot dead in Libya</strong></a><br><p>TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday.
Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men.
“Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said.
While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years.
In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule.
He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.
In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock.
Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021.
Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades.
He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

Medical tests reports [available with Dawn] revealed that a 22-year-old transperson from Mian Channu tehsil (Khanewal district) was tested positive for mpox and HIV on Jan 13, 2026. He was suffering from fever and rashes on his body.
The second patient, a 20-year-old police constable belonging to Muzaffargarh district, was also tested positive for HIV and mpox on Feb 2.
According to sources, the constable was suffering from rashes and he tried to flee from the scene as his blood samples were taken for tests. The guards of Nishtar Hospital stopped him and the results of the tests confirmed that he is tested positive for mpox and HIV.

Both infected with HIV too; screening of their contacts under way

Later, he was shifted to isolation ward No: 27 in Nishtar Hospital.
The health department officials confirmed that the patients were shifted to a designated isolation area at Nishtar Hospital after testing positive through PCR-based laboratory analysis conducted at a public health reference laboratory in Punjab.
Officials said both patients are being monitored by infectious disease specialists, while standard infection prevention and control measures have been implemented to prevent further spread of the virus within the healthcare facility.
Health authorities have also initiated contact tracing to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the patients. Surveillance has been enhanced in Multan and surrounding districts, and hospitals have been advised to remain alert for patients with symptoms consistent with mpox.Nishtar Hospital Additional Medical Superintendent Dr Riwad Noor told Dawn that both patients did not have any travel history.
He said the WHO guidelines suggested that any patient, who suffers from HIV, would lose immunity and it could develop mpox.
He said Khanewal and Muzaffargarh district health authorities should take measures to check and stop spread of the infectious disease.He said the recovery of the patients is possible.
Medical Superintendent Rao Amjad also confirmed that an isolation ward was established at the hospital to deal with patients with infectious diseases.Muzaffargarh District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Fayyaz Khan Gopang told this reporter that they have started screening of the family members of the patient and samples for tests were taken.
He said he would also contact the district police officer to check about the posting of the constable and would conduct screening of the people in contact with him.
District Khanewal CEO Health Dr Asif Mahmood said the person of Tehsil Mian Channu was tested positive for mpox and HIV on Jan 13 and the rapid response team of the district screened all of his immediate contacts and did not find any one else infected with the disease.
He said the patient is a transperson and he would often organise and attend social gatherings and they were still chasing the people who might have been infected but did not find any other with symptoms.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mpox is a viral disease that usually begins with fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue, followed by a rash that can develop into fluid-filled lesions. Most cases are mild, but early medical care helps prevent complications.
WHO advises that the spread of mpox can be reduced through avoiding close physical contact with anyone who has a rash or symptoms suggestive of mpox, practising regular hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based sanitisers, not sharing bedding, towels, clothing or personal items with infected individuals, ensuring suspected or confirmed patients isolate until their lesions have healed and seeking prompt medical care if fever, body aches or unexplained rashes develop.

RIYADH: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday, Saudi media said, his first visit to the kingdom in over two years as Saudi Arabia moves closer to its rival-turned-ally.
Ties between Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have steadily recovered in recent years, with the countries cooperating on a range of diplomatic issues.
This includes support for Gaza and backing Syria’s new government in the wake of the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in 2024.
Erdogan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh, Turkiye’s Comm­unications Director Burha­nettin Duran told Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu.
Erdogan is accompanied by his wife, first lady Emine Erd­ogan, Foreign Minister Hak­an Fidan, Finance Minister Meh­met Simsek, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and other ministers.
No further detail on the clos­ed-door meeting was provided.
However, Anadolu has earlier reported that they would discuss the “deepening cooperation” between the countries, as well as regional and global developments.
It added that Erdogan would then travel to Cairo on Wednesday.
Following the meeting, Erdogan attended a closed-door dinner in his honour, hosted by the Saudi crown prince at the Yemame Palace.
This is Erdogan’s first to the kingdom since July 2023, which was part of a Gulf trip aimed at drumming up investments.
The visit comes days after two sources told AFP that Turkiye would not be joining a mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan had said earlier this month that they had entered talks aimed at joining the alliance.
‘Balance thaw’
Experts like Umar Karim of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom warn that Turkiye will have to balance any thaw with Riyadh against relations with other regional rivals.
“I think it’s in this visit that it will become clear what Turkiye can commit to Saudis in terms of this rivalry with UAE and in terms of the security threat from Israel,” Karim told AFP.
Relations between Riyadh and Turkiye were enormously strained after Saudi agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

LAW Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar (left) and Leader of Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speak during Tuesday’s session.—Dawn

• Opposition senators slam ‘denial of Imran’s rights’; Tarar tells opposition to approach court for relief concerning PTI founder’s medical care, jail meetings• Ministers detail measures to curb extremism; seek parliamentary debate on National Action Plan-II
ISLAMABAD: The opposition in the Senate was up in arms on Tuesday over what it termed the “denial of human rights” to former prime minister Imran Khan.
However, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told members that Mr Khan had been taken to Pims for a procedure on his own request, and assured the House that he had no health issues following treatment.
He said the federal government fully respected human rights and it had never issued any directive to deny medical treatment to any prisoner.
The law minister also assured the Senate that if any further medical need arose, all facilities would be provided as per law.
However, he hastened to add that any further relief concerning medical care, meetings or prison conditions must be sought through the high court, which was the competent appellate forum.
Earlier, Leader of Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas complained that Mr Khan’s imprisonment was “cruel and illegal”, and asked why was he deprived of his rights and why his family was not informed about his illness.
“A crime has been committed against him, as it is his fundamental right that he did not get,” Senator Abbas said.
He said there was concern among people all over the country over Mr Khan’s health, and described the ban on meetings with the PTI founder as the worst form of political victimisation and violation of human rights.
He expressed the fear that Mr Khan might lose his eyesight and emphasised that he should be checked by a doctor of his choice, and permitted to meet his family. The opposition leader also suggested that senators should visit him in jail.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the fact that PTI founder underwent treatment in secret, and this was later revealed by the government, was a serious issue.
“We appealed that Mr Khan should be allowed to meet his personal physicians for a complete investigation. If it was a small procedure, the nation would be satisfied,” he said, adding that this meeting was not allowed.
Following this, Mr Khan’s doctors in a video message called the issue very serious in nature, showing concerns that he could face permanent damage to his eyesight, he added.
They recommended names of two experts who should be given access to Mr Khan for complete investigation, he said.
He said the doctors were not satisfied with the Pims report, and asked that two experts should be given access to Mr Khan immediately.
He also recalled that when PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was diagnosed with low platelets, then-PM Imran Khan had said that he should get proper treatment and allowed doctors, even his personal physician, to examine him in jail.
“I am not talking about politics right now,” he said, urging the chair to direct Pims to provide them with Mr Khan’s medical report.
Unity in face of extremism
During Tuesday’s proceedings, two key ministers noted that complete national unity was imperative to effectively counter extremism.
During Question Hour, Inform­a­tion Minister Attaullah Tarar des­cribed the recent meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Sohail Afridi and PM Shehbaz Sharif as a positive development that would help strengthen coordination.
Mr Tarar said that cooperation between the federal government and the province was vital for improving the law & order situation.
He said this cooperation would convey a message of unity and help eliminate terrorism.
He informed the House that a Counter Violent Extremism Cell has been established in the information ministry and a third-party audit system has been put in place to assess the outreach and dissemination of the narrative generated by the cell.
Mr Tarar said that a fully functional digital communication department is working under the cell to counter extremist narratives through digital media.
He said the Paigham-i-Aman Committee, comprising scholars from all schools of thought, minority representatives and senior government officials, was actively working to promote peace and counter extremism in the country.
He said the committee was actively touring the country to promote a counter-narrative against extremism, violence, and terrorism. Giving the composition of the committee, he said the committee comprised several religious scholars and representatives of minority communities.
Spearately, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry also stres­sed the importance of national unity.
Speaking in the House, he noted that past success against terrorism had only been achieved when all political forces stood united behind the security forces, emphasising that similar unity was required once again to defeat extremism and terrorism.
Mr Chaudhry underlined the need for a full parliamentary debate on the 14-point National Action Plan-II (NAP-II), noting that the original NAP had been formulated after the Army Public School tragedy during the PML-N government and later revised during the PTI government with the consensus of all provinces.
He said the government was ready to present a detailed briefing on the implementation of all NAP-II points, including provincial and federal performance, if the House decided to allocate time for an in-depth discussion.
About the government’s broader strategy to counter extremism, he said that both kinetic and non-kinetic measures were being pursued simultaneously.

ISLAMABAD: The federal government has declined Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s request for Rs10.4 billion in additional expenditure linked to the settlement of displaced persons from Bajaur and the Tirah Valley following security operations, asking the provincial administration to meet these expenses from its own resources.
The Centre also expressed its inability to increase provincial transfers on account of net hydel profit beyond Rs3bn per month currently being given to the province due to fiscal limitations and legal precincts. The Centre, however, indicated to disburse about Rs26bn on an urgent basis on account of the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP) for the development of KP’s newly merged districts, previously called Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
This followed a series of meetings between the federal and provincial leadership over the last two days, beginning with a session led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday. The provincial government made a pitch for recovery of a total of Rs426bn “outstanding federal liabilities payable to KP”.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aur­angzeb and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal then sat down with KP’s team, led by KP Finance Minister Muzzammil Aslam, on Tuesday to follow up on those demands.
Informed sources said the province also demanded an early requisition of the second meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC).
Mr Aurangzeb reportedly asked Mr Muzzammil to complete the recommendations of a working group he headed on the question of requirements of merged districts and promised to call an NFC meeting soon.
The provincial government argued that Fata’s merger with KP in May 2018 increased the provincial population from around 31 million to 37m, with the area expanding from 74,521 square kilometres to 101,741. It argued that this should have automatically and proportionately increased KP’s share in NFC to 19pc from the existing 14.6pc. However, this gap of around 4.5pc created a
colossal burden. It said this year’s budget estimate for current expenditures of merged districts stood at Rs143bn, but the Centre had allocated only Rs80bn, even less than last year’s Rs105bn. For AIP 2025-26, the government had made a Rs100bn commitment but disbursed only Rs37bn in seven months.
Separately, KP reported that about 2,000 displaced families were staying at Babakhel Camp in North Waziristan, while another 15,000 families from the area were receiving Rs20,000 per month, amounting to around Rs4.2bn a year.
The province said it spent Rs19bn in FY24 and FY25 and a further Rs10.4bn so far this year due to the Bajaur and Tirah operations, without federal support.
Of the Rs426bn claim, KP said the largest chunk of Rs194.5bn pertained to federal excise duty on crude oil under the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which it said had remained unimplemented since FY11. It said another Rs75bn pertained to a windfall levy on crude oil production and Rs64bn was linked to water supply from the Galiyat Development Authority to Murree since 1947.
‘Cooperative federalism’
A statement issued by the Ministry of Finance said the meeting between the financial teams of federal and provincial government focused on a range of fiscal and development matters, including the timely release of funds under key development heads for merged districts, outstanding requirements linked to rehabilitation and support for temporarily displaced persons, and the broader framework of provincial entitlements and allocations, including those related to the NFC.
The KP team highlighted the operational and development imperatives in the merged districts and underscored the importance of predictable and timely releases to sustain ongoing schemes and meet pressing needs on the ground.
They also drew attention to pending obligations in respect of displaced families and other related commitments that require streamlined coordination and resolution.
Mr Aurangzeb “reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to cooperative federalism and constructive engagement with the provinces”, the statement said.
He assured KP of his support in pursuing and facilitating their rightful claims for allocations under the NFC and other relevant heads discussed during the meeting, in accordance with applicable rules, agreed frameworks and due process.
The minister also emphasised that “effective coordination and timely reconciliation of accounts, where required, remain essential for smooth and transparent releases, and emphasised that the federal government remains mindful of the unique development and security-related challenges faced by KP, particularly in the merged districts”.
The meeting also reviewed ongoing work and consultations on NFC-related matters, including the need to sustain momentum on technical discussions and subgroup engagements to advance consensus on key issues and agreed to continue close coordination through relevant forums and technical channels to address outstanding matters on priority and to ensure that fiscal arrangements and releases support development objectives and service delivery.

Oil prices rose and the dollar mostly dipped as investors weighed company earnings against geopolitical unrest.
The price of gold climbed more than six per cent to $4,989.20 an ounce. Last week it reached a record-high close to $5,600 before tumbling. Gold is “heading for its biggest daily gain since 2008, as prices rebounded sharply following the steepest two-day decline in decades,” said analyst Axel Rudolph at trading platform IG.
Silver surged more than 15pc to $86 on Tuesday, still well short of the record near $120 it hit last week.
“A sense of calm descended after the precious metal ructions, opening the door for investors to buy on the dip,” noted Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.
Gold and silver prices have been on a tear in recent months, benefitting from being seen as a safe haven investments during times of geopolitical tensions.
Demand for the precious metals was also being spurred by sliding value of the dollar, which was weakened by speculation that US President Donald Trump is happy to see the world’s reserve currency weaken despite the potential risk of pushing up US inflation.

ISLAMABAD / DUBAI: Tehran has asked for a change of venue ahead of planned talks between US and Iranian officials this week, after President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed ordering the initiation of dialogue with Washington.
On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington.
According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.
The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only.
This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.
Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said.
However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups.
“I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.”
Hectic diplomacy
Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal.
“I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X.







He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”.
On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”.
Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”.
“I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash.
Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities.
When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities.
Pakistan’s role
“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday.
“Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn.
The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting.
The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters, adding that some regional powers were also invited.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday.
Last-minute change?
According to Reuters, a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks.
“They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.”
A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

QUETTA: The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.
The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks, staged across the province on Saturday.
In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, DC office and an FC camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire.
But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.
District police officials told Dawn that at least four more terrorists had been killed in clearance actions conducted so far.
They also indicated that the counterterrorism department had suffered casualties during the terror attacks over the weekend, but there was no official word on their exact number, or the identities of those martyred.
There were also reports of attacks in Awaran, but no loss of life was immediately reported.
Security forces are also conducting operations in the Washuk area, following attacks there and the burning of a police station and a Nadra office over the weekend.
IGP pays tribute
Separately, Inspector General of Police Mohammad Tahir said Balochistan police had rendered unparalleled sacrifices for the restoration of peace and protection of lives in the province, with many officers and personnel attaining martyrdom while thwarting the designs of terrorists.
Paying tribute to the fallen policemen, the IGP emphasised that lasting peace in Balochistan could only be achieved through close cooperation between the public and security forces, stressing that the police and the people stand united against terrorism.
He made these remarks during visits to various police facilities, including Sariab Police Station, New Sariab Police Station, Police Training College, Smart Police Station, Manzoor Tareen Shaheed and Khaliq Shaheed Police Station, where he reviewed security arrangements and overall performance.
CTD DIG Aitzaz Goraya, Quetta SSP Mohammad Asif Khan and other senior officers accompanied him.
Later, the IGP visited the Anti-Terrorism Force (ATF) headquarters, where he met officers and personnel and was briefed on operational challenges. Praising their high morale, professionalism and dedication to duty, he said the role of Balochistan police in the fight against terrorism has been commendable.
Reaffirming his resolve, IGP Tahir said the Balochistan police remains fully prepared and vigilant to counter all challenges and is utilising all available resources to ensure law and order.
He added that the force has consistently taken timely action against anti-state elements and will continue to safeguard the lives and property of citizens, pledging that no sacrifice would be spared. He said efforts are underway to enhance police capacity and equip the force with modern facilities.
Chinese condemnation
Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism.
He made these remarks during a regular press briefing. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
“China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added.
On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”.
In a post on X, the embassy said “we… deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”.

LONDON: JPMorgan is finalising plans for a new index to track frontier market local currency bonds, investors consulted on the details told Reuters, as the bank looks to satisfy a growing appetite for riskier and more diversified high-yield debt.
The move, which comes 15 years after the Wall Street bank launched its hard-currency Next Generation Markets Index (NEXGEM) frontier index, coincides with the year-long slump in the dollar and some extraordinary recent rallies in markets like Argentina, Ecuador and Uganda.
JPMorgan declined to comment on the plans.
Six leading money managers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the bank’s engagements with them reached an advanced stage in the second half of last year.
The proposed index includes 20 to 25 countries, with Egypt, Vietnam, Kenya, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh having the largest “weightings”, three of the managers said.
Bond sizes and caps on weighting
According to one source, there would be a limit that means no country has a weighting of more than 8 per cent. A second source said an earlier consultation document had a proposed 10pc limit.
It is also set to only include bonds of at least $250 million equivalent, although that has raised issues around Zambia, which many would like to see included but has traditionally only sold smaller individual bonds.
“We expect they (JPMorgan) will give us a formal structure for the index around June with the opportunity to make some final comments,” said one senior fund manager.
“They are then likely to formally launch the index next year, we think.” Another senior fund manager said the initial announcement might be as early as the end of March, which could also bring the formal launch date forward.
Trillion dollar market FTSE
Russell has already had an equivalent index since 2021. JPMorgan’s versions, however, are more prominent among emerging market money managers, who effectively use them to compile their funds and measure their performance.
Analysis by Neuberger Berman estimates tradable local-currency debt has trebled over the last decade to around $1 trillion.
It also calculates that over the last eight years, frontier market local FX debt had outperformed JPMorgan’s mainstream emerging market local currency index by almost 2.5 percentage points, and also outstripped the EM dollar bond index.

 

“We see that as a confirmation that frontier market growth and general economic performance has been systematically underpriced,” Neuberger Berman’s Rob Drijkoningen said.
According to the World Bank, frontier economies are home to a fifth of the world’s population but account for just 3.1pc of global capital flows and less than 5pc of global GDP.
Their populations, however, are expected to increase by another 800 million over the next 25 years more than the rest of the world combined — meaning they will play an increasingly important role in global economic growth.
Analysts expect JPMorgan’s new debt index to help expand local currency bond markets — something long-championed by the World Bank and IMF as a way to reduce the number of debt crises caused when currency crashes leave governments unable to pay hard-currency debt.
Zambia and eligibility requirements
The rising interest in frontier market debt also comes as shaken confidence in once-safe debt in the developed world pushes capital flows to other parts of the globe.
Three of the investors raised questions about Zambia, which until recently had only sold sub-$250 million local-currency bonds.
It was not in some of JPMorgan’s early outlines, the investors said, but the country has since issued at least one larger bond, raising hopes it will now make the cut.
One eligibility requirement that mirrors JPMorgan’s GBI-EM index of major emerging economies is that included bonds will have more than 2.5 years of remaining maturity — the time before full repayment is due.
JPMorgan estimated in September the index will have approximately 400 basis points or more of “pick-up” in yield over the GBI-EM, with over 60pc of the index constituents yielding more than 10pc.
A potential promotion of top-weighted countries like Egypt and Nigeria to the GBI-EM index in coming years is another issue that could alter the index’s makeup, possibly putting off some investors.
“It will be important to nail that down,” one senior fund manager said.
