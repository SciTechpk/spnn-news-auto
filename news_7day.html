<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1221253734055b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/early-counts-show-close-race-in-bangladesh-election-after-strong-turnout' target='_blank'><strong>Early counts show close race in Bangladesh election after strong turnout</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-i-Islami were locked in a tight race on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election — the first since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina.
Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter.
It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led uprisings scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a vote next month.
Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said.



Contest between former allies
The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, the BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge.
BNP was leading in 10 seats and Jamaat in seven of the nearly 20 seats for which early trends were available, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority.
Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.

 

Both prime ministerial candidates — the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman said they were confident of winning.
The two men are not related.
“I am confident of winning the election. There is enthusiasm among the people about the vote,” Tarique Rahman told reporters, while the Jamaat’s Shafiqur Rahman called the election a “turning point” for Bangladesh and said the people were eager for change.

Hasina calls vote a farce
Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi fray.
Elections under Hasina were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation, critics say.
In a statement sent to journalists on WhatsApp, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process.

“We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal, and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League; and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said.

Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister.
More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.
Long lines of voters, heavy security
There were no reports of major violence.
Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.
“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”

Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling Reuters that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections.
Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.”
Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.”
President Zardari hopes for peaceful process
President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.
“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.
He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.

The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC.
“A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime,” Raja contended.
The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”.
Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court today that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig.







The PTI secretary general said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report.
Raja said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”.
“Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged.
Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.”
The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment, including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad.
“The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.”
“This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision.
He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public.
“The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted.



Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran.
“So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed; we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.”
Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing.
Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning, and we have no information about his overall health condition”.
Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing.
He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”.
“He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said.
Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart.
“We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him.
“Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted.
Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them.
He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options.
The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health.
But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.”
“God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps.







Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”.
“It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated.
“When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment.
“This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed.
“We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said.
Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board
Meanwhile, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”.
In a post on X, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP Vice Chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”.
Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”.
“If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said.
Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society.
“Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended.
“This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted.
“If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned.
“The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted.







TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention.
“This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar.
He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “Nelson Mandela Rules” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture.
Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran.







‘Not a matter to be trivialised’
Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health.
“We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X.
“The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted.
The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”.
“This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated.
It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights.
The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement.
“Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.”







“When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded.
“Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”.
While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”.
The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”.
Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.”
The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran.

 

“A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged.
It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”.
In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder.
“These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended.
It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.”
The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated.
“You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.”
‘Inhumane treatment’
PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”.
“This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X.







PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them.
“PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision detoriated because of these personnels’ callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X.
He further stated: “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.”
Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”.
“The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said.







Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”.
“Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded.
“Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted.







Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”.
“The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.

According to a press release issued by the President’s Secretariat, the meeting took place at Aiwan-i-Sadr, where the pair also reviewed the “prevailing regional and global environment”.
The meeting was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, among other officials.







The premier and president previously met in November last year, where they discussed the country’s security situation in the wake of multiple terrorist attacks.
According to state broadcaster PTV, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and federal ministers Syed Mushtaq Raza Naqvi, Chaudhry Salik Hussain, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Khalid Hussain Magsi, and Abdul Aleem Khan were present during the meeting.
“Both leaders reaffirm their resolve that actions against foreign-backed terrorists and their facilitators will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism,” the broadcaster reported at the time.</p><small>2026-02-12 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12200346e5508e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972731/trumps-border-czar-announces-end-to-immigration-crackdown-in-minnesota' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s ‘border czar’ announces end to immigration crackdown in Minnesota</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s immigration pointman on Thursday announced the end of ramped-up immigration operations in Minnesota, which triggered outrage following the killing of two American citizens.
Thousands of federal agents have in recent weeks conducted aggressive raids and arrests in what the administration claims are targeted missions against criminals.
“I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” Trump official Tom Homan told a briefing in Minneapolis.
“A significant drawdown has already been under way this week and will continue through the next week.”

 


The operations have sparked mass protests in Minneapolis, and the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti less than three weeks apart last month led to a wave of criticism.
Homan raised the prospect that the officers would deploy to another location but gave no details, as speculation is rife about which city might be targeted next.
“In the next week, we’re going deploy the officers here on detail, back to their home stations or other areas of the country where they are needed. But we’re going to continue to force immigration law,” he said.
Opposition Democrats have called for sweeping reforms to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, including ending mobile patrols, prohibiting agents from concealing their faces and requiring warrants.</p><small>2026-02-12 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12141023f9307e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972715/pakistans-2nd-indigenous-earth-observation-satellite-launched-from-chinas-space-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s 2nd indigenous earth observation satellite launched from China’s space centre</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has marked a major achievement in its national space programme with the successful launch of its second indigenous Earth Observation Satellite, EO-2, from China’s Yangjiang Seashore Launch Centre on Thursday.
Developed by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the EO-2 satellite is designed to significantly enhance the country’s earth observation and high-resolution imaging capabilities.
The officials of Suparco said the satellite will provide critical data to support national development planning, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and urban expansion.

 


It will also strengthen governance, disaster management, climate analysis, and strategic decision-making by delivering accurate and timely satellite imagery.
With the addition of EO-2, Pakistan has expanded its satellite fleet, ensuring improved continuity, coverage, and precision of earth observation data, added the space agency.
Suparco officials termed the launch a milestone in Pakistan’s space journey, noting that the successful indigenous development of EO-2 reflects the country’s growing technical expertise and self-reliance in advanced satellite technology.

 


Earlier on February 7, Pakistan marked a major step forward in its Human Spaceflight Programme as two candidates were officially shortlisted by the Astronauts Centre of China (ACC), according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The development followed a cooperation agreement signed in February 2025 between Suparco and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
Under the agreement, two Pakistanis will undergo astronaut training in China, with one ultimately selected to travel to the Tiangong space station.
Last year, Pakistan launched its first indigenous Electro-Optical (EO-1) satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China.
‘Historic milestone’
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that Pakistan had achieved “another space milestone”.
“This success reflects our growing technological footprint and is yet another manifestation of the enduring Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership that is now transcending into space,” he said.
“ Great job done by Suparco and our brilliant scientists. I look forward to more good news in the coming days with Pakistan-China cooperation in this vital area of national development,” he said.







Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar congratulated the nation on the “historic milestone”, highlighting that it was Pakistan’s fifth earth observation satellite and second indigenous electro-optical satellite.
“This achievement reflects Pakistan’s steady progress in strengthening its national space capabilities and advancing technological self-reliance,” he affirmed, noting that the satellite was launched in collaboration with China.

 

“I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of the People’s Republic of China for its continued cooperation and steadfast support,” Dar said.
The foreign minister noted that the Pakistan–China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership “continues to scale new heights, including in space technology”.
He also commended Suparco, Pakistani scientists, engineers and the entire team for their “tireless efforts in expanding Pakistan’s indigenous space infrastructure and developing reliable, domestically engineered space systems for national development”.

According to a statement issued by Bannu CTD Superintendent of Police (SP) Fazal Wahid, the suspect belonged to Bannu district and was said to be an active commander of the newly formed organisation Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), established through a collaboration between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Gul Bahadur group.
He said that the suspect confessed to his involvement in nine major terrorist activities during the initial interrogation.
He said that these included the December 2025 attack on Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali Khan, in which he was martyred along with his two security guards and a civilian.
The suspect also confessed to the abduction and killing of former Bannu station house officer Abid Wazir in November 2025. Additionally, he also admitted to his involvement in the abduction and murder of three members of the Lakki Marwat peace committee, who were actively working for public welfare and regional peace, the police official said.
According to the CTD official, the suspect had also confessed to kidnapping two Frontier Corps (FC) personnel and police officials from Pipal Daud Shah. He also admitted involvement in the June 2024 killing of a polio officer and his guard in Mamand Khel, the SP said.
He said that initial investigations showed that Osama alias Baghi was involved in the reconnaissance of sensitive institutions, and providing secret photographs and information of police personnel to terrorists.
The official said the suspect had also confessed to setting up illegal checkpoints in Pipal Bazaar and other areas along with his accomplices to harass civilians.
He said that further investigation was underway, and raids were being conducted to arrest his facilitators and other associates.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general and CTD additional inspector general appreciated the CTD team for the successful operation and termed the arrest of the most-wanted terrorist commander as a significant step toward regional peace.
Meanwhile, Domel police also carried out a separate operation, arresting two terrorists along with three facilitators.
According to District Police Officer Yasir Afridi, the arrested terrorists were involved in sniper attacks at Nala Kashu and Police Post Khonia Khel. Two police personnel were injured in the attack on Khonia Khel police checkpost.</p><small>2026-02-12 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/121802528aac1af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972727/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-in-us-confirms-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend inaugural Board of Peace meeting in US, confirms FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed on Thursday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, saying that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.
Andrabi’s confirmation follows reports that said PM Shehbaz was expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, which is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.
He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.
Asked specifically whether Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would be included in the delegation, the FO spokesperson reiterated: “We will share these details in due course.
“I do not have the details — neither on the itinerary, nor on the composition of the delegation. I can confirm that the prime minister will lead the delegation and that the deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be part of the delegation. This is the extent of information right now. We will, of course, update you in due course.”
Pakistan is among the 14 countries that signed the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.
The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November 2025 authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.
However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations by Israel.

 

Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.
Rights experts and scholars have, however, criticised the concept, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.
A journalist also pointed out during the FO briefing on Thursday that there was no representation from Gaza on the board. Highlighting US support for Israel as well, the journalist asked: “How reliable would this Board of Peace prove to be for the people of Gaza?”
In his response, Andrabi said, “We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith, as I highlighted in my previous briefing.”
He also pointed that Pakistan had not joined the board in isolation and not as “one voice, but as collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries”, which had worked with Trump on his Gaza plan.
“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
“So, our engagement is both for short-term, medium-term and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he explained.
Asked about Israel joining the board, the FO spokesperson said: “It is their decision. We are not obliged to offer any comment. We will engage with the Board of Peace with positivity of intent, and as I said, our prime minister will attend the Board of Peace meeting.”
‘Shot down a number of Indian Rafale jets’
Andrabi was also asked for a clarification following Trump’s recent remarks that 10 aircraft were shot down during the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May 2025.
Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose.
Initially stating that five jets were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October, and then eight in November.
Responding to the question on Trump’s statement, the FO spokesperson said: “We have stated it previously, and I wish to reiterate it here that Pakistan is appreciative of the role of the United States during our 90-hour war with India.
“The role of the United States was for peace, for prevention of war and prevention of violence. So, in that context, President Trump’s statements, previous statements, and these statements are all obviously welcomed and endorsed.
“As regards the fighter planes: this is a matter of history,” he said.
He said Pakistan shot down “a number of Indian Rafale jets, and the evidence is all over — available internationally, corroborated by international reports, including by the manufacturers of these planes”.
“This demonstrated that Pakistan was able to deter Indian aggression through conventional means. This is also an indicator for the future — any future Indian aggression would be dealt forthrightly and forcefully with all our resources,” he added.
‘Weaponisation of cricket is regrettable’
During the session, the FO spokesperson was asked whether Pakistan’s decision to play the T20 World Cup match against India after announcing an initial boycott was the consequence of back-channel cricket diplomacy between the two sides.
In response, Andrabi said: “Cricket is a game that we all love and we all cherish. We grew up playing this game. Weaponisation of cricket, politicisation of cricket is regrettable.”







He explained that the government’s decision to not play against India “reflected the resolve of the government of Pakistan to not let cricket be weaponised and politicised”.
“Our subsequent decision to play reflected our magnanimity, after the relevant cricket authorities realised that they had weaponised and politicised cricket, particularly weaponised against Bangladesh.

 

“As you are aware, the Bangladesh side and Sri Lankan side (host of this game) were in touch with our government and cricket board,” he highlighted.
“So the decision to play the game, is reflective of the magnanimity shown by our prime minister as a result of contacts made by the brotherly countries of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as by a realisation within the relevant authorities managing cricket internationally and in India, that weaponisation and politicisation of cricket is wrong, is unwarranted, and it defies the spirit of the beloved game of cricket that we all cherish,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-12 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1219054316c07eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972729/pakistan-us-agree-to-boost-partnership-in-mining-minerals-and-energy-sectors' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US agree to boost partnership in mining, minerals and energy sectors</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and the United States on Thursday agreed to promote partnership in the mining, minerals and energy sectors.
According to a handout from the interior ministry, the agreement was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs John Mark Pomeroy.
During the meeting, the US official said that the country attached great importance to its relationship with Pakistan. He condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Quetta and expressed condolences to the victims.
The interior minister welcomed US investment in the mining, minerals, and energy sectors and assured that American investors would be provided with the safest possible environment in Pakistan.
‎During the meeting, Pakistan–US bilateral relations and the regional situation were discussed, along with ways to enhance cooperation in counterterrorism, particularly in the field of internal security.
Speaking on the occasion, Naqvi said that global cooperation was essential in the fight against terrorism, and relations with the US were of key importance in this regard.
He emphasised that Pakistan believed in global partnerships to eliminate terrorism and promote investment.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, US charge d’affaires Natalie Baker, Interior Ministry Secretary Khurram Agha and senior officials were also present on the occasion.
Earlier this month, Pakistan participated in the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial at the US Department of State, as Islamabad sought to expand foreign investment and forge strategic partnerships in the minerals and energy sectors.</p><small>2026-02-12 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1216514852d5c5d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972723/risk-of-nipah-spread-low-after-cases-in-india-bangladesh-who' target='_blank'><strong>Risk of Nipah spread low after cases in India, Bangladesh: WHO</strong></a><br><p>The World Health Organisation has said the risk of the deadly Nipah virus spreading was low after three cases of infection were recently confirmed in India and Bangladesh.
Nipah, which spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the UN health body.
“In the past few weeks, three cases of Nipah — two in India and one in Bangladesh — made headlines and caused concern about a wider outbreak,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.

 

WHO assessed the risk of spread of the Nipah virus regionally and globally and found it low, he added.
Two cases of Nipah were confirmed last month in India’s West Bengal state, while one patient died in Bangladesh last week after contracting the virus.
“The two outbreaks were not related, although both occurred along the India-Bangladesh border, and share some of the same ecological and cultural conditions, as well as populations of the species of fruit bat that are known to be the natural reservoir of Nipah virus,” Tedros said.
Indian nurse infected with Nipah virus dies
Meanwhile, an Indian health worker who contracted the Nipah virus in December has died, a senior health official from the eastern state of West Bengal said on Thursday.
The woman — a nurse — was one of two people in the state who were infected and was being treated at a local hospital.
“The woman … who was critical, died due to cardiac arrest,” Health Secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam told Reuters.
Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia. In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.
In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus in the same southern Indian state.
Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.</p><small>2026-02-12 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/121033478880642.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972699/imran-claims-only-15pc-vision-left-in-right-eye-sc-forms-medical-team-to-examine-pti-founder' target='_blank'><strong>Imran claims only 15pc vision left in right eye; SC forms medical team to examine PTI founder</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the formation of a medical team to examine former premier Imran Khan’s eye, after a report submitted in court quoted the PTI founder as claiming that “only 15 per cent” vision was left in his right eye.
The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
The instructions came as a two-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the case regarding the PTI founder’s living conditions in Adiala jail.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
“The issue of Imran’s health is most important,” CJP Afridi observed, adding that “intervention was necessary”.
“We want to know the government’s stance on the matter of his (Imran’s) health,” the top judge said, at which Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan affirmed that it was the state’s responsibility to provide medical facilities.
“If the prisoner is not satisfied, then the state will take measures,” AGP Awan added.
CJP Afridi then noted that the issue of Imran’s “telephone calls with his children is also important”.

 

“We are trusting the government. The government is in a good mood today,” he remarked.
PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Tuesday, had submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living condition in the prison.
In his report, seen by Dawn, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6 x 6 vision in both eyes”. He then began experiencing persistent blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then-jail superintendent but “no action was taken by the jail authorities”.

 

The report read: “[Imran] stated that he subsequently suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye, following which an ophthalmologist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was called to examine him.
“According to [Imran], he was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused severe damage, and despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye.”
Adding to Imran’s claims, Safdar said he “personally observed that the petitioner appeared visibly perturbed and deeply distressed by the loss of vision and the absence of timely and specialised medical intervention”.
“Throughout the meeting, the petitioner’s eyes were watery, and he repeatedly used a tissue to wipe them, reflecting physical discomfort,” the lawyer recalled.
However, during the hearing, the SC dismissed the request to have the condition of Imran’s eye examined in the presence of his family members.
On the request to provide some books to the PTI founder, AGP Awan said it would be done after consultation with eye doctors.
Recalling that the SC had received reports from Safdar and the Adiala jail superintendent, CJP Afridi said: “Most of the things in both reports are similar — the place is good, the facilities are fine.”
Noting that the issue of Imran’s meetings with his family members was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the top judge said it would be appropriate for the relevant forum to decide on that.
‘No access to personal physicians amid deteriorating eye condition’
The report detailed Safdar’s meeting with Imran, the cell conditions, the facilities and amenities provided to the ex-premier, his living compound’s description, as well as the lawyer’s process of reaching the jail.
Safdar further quoted Imran as claiming that “regular and periodic blood tests” were not conducted.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.

 

“[Imran] stated that for nearly three months, the only treatment administered consisted of eye drops, which resulted in no improvement and was followed by a major impairment of vision in his right eye,” Safdar said.
Imran also claimed that “despite being 73 years old and requiring dental consultation, no dentist had examined or treated him over the past two years, notwithstanding repeated requests”.
According to Safdar, Imran told him about “rapid and substantial loss of vision over the preceding three months while he was living and detained under the ‘care and custody’ of Abdul Ghafoor Anjum”, the jail superintendent.
“This concern of his was neither taken seriously nor addressed by the relevant jail authorities,” Safdar was told. Upon inquiry, the jail staff informed the lawyer that Anjum had been transferred on Jan 16, 2026, and replaced by Sajid Baig.
Safdar stated that upon inquiry, the jail superintendent informed him that Imran was currently under the care of Pims’ Dr Arif and that the on-duty jail doctor recorded the PTI founder’s vital signs three times daily.
A day ago, Safdar denied making any statement on Imran’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard, it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
On Tuesday, the day he met Imran, Safdar had reportedly told the media that the incarcerated PTI founder was fine and looking healthy.
The SC’s order allowing Safdar to meet Imran came after the bench rejected senior PTI leader Latif Khosa’s request for an immediate meeting, but issued notices to the parties.
Direct consequence of ‘medical neglect, solitary confinement’, says Imran’s son
Imran’s son Kasim Khan, in a post on X, termed the development “a direct consequence of “solitary confinement, medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” Kasim said.
“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neglect (denied blood tests) and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” Kasim stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”.
He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added.
Kasim claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.
“History will record this injustice,” he said, and called on “human rights bodies, legal institutions and democratic nations to confront this persecution and ensure those responsible face consequences”.







Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the narrative being “propagated” by the incarcerated ex-premier’s family had “fallen flat on its face” in light of the report.
In a post on X, he said: “The narrative which was being propagated to international media by Aleema Khan and other members of Imran Khan’s family regarding mistreatment and shabby conditions in prison has fallen flat on its face.
“The report regarding daily routine and diet plan has cleared all ambiguity. All facilities are available to him and he has privileges more than any other prisoner,” he added.







Diagnosis and treatment
Meanwhile, a medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.
It noted that Dr Sikander had been directed by the prime minister’s office to communicate to the jail staff about Imran’s medical condition.
Imran “reported reduced vision in the right eye”, Dr Sikander said, without specifying when.

 

He added: “A qualified ophthalmologist from Pims, Islamabad, conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiyala Jail [sic], including slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure measurements, essential laboratory tests and OCT (optical coherence tomography) of the retina.
“Based on his assessment, a diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made and hospital-based follow-up treatment was recommended.”
Recalling Imran’s treatment on the night of January 24, the doctor said the ex-premier was “brought to Pims on the night of Saturday/Sunday for advised procedure”.
“At the hospital, the treatment plan i.e. need for administering anti-VGEF intravitreal injection was explained in full to the patient. Accordingly, an informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure,” Dr Sikander stated.
He reiterated that the procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocols and monitoring, adding that it was “completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes”.
In his report, Safdar said Dr Sikander’s note was provided to him by Imran’s family and it did not “contain full details of the episodes”.
“Nor does it identify the qualified ophthalmologist who conducted the tests and administered the treatment,” he highlighted.</p><small>2026-02-12 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12175452c5c5465.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972726/in-letter-to-pm-kundi-recommends-posthumous-civil-award-for-youth-who-resisted-islamabad-suicide-attacker' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to PM, Kundi recommends posthumous civil award for youth who resisted Islamabad suicide attacker</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to confer a posthumous national civil award on 22-year-old Oun Abbas, who lost his life while resisting the suicide attacker who targeted an imambargah in Islamabad, it emerged on Thursday.
On February 6, a suicide bomber ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident, and more than 150 were injured.
According to eye witness accounts, Abbas, who was praying inside the hall, had abandoned his rituals and tried to tackle the attacker. However, he lost his life when the suicide bomber detonated.
In a letter addressed to the prime minister and dated Feb 11, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Kundi lauded the “exceptional gallantry and supreme sacrifice” displayed by Abbas.
“In those moments of terror and chaos, while many sought safety, this brave young man chose to confront the terrorist face to face,” Kundi said, stressing that the young man’s courage prevented “a far greater tragedy” and led to the “saving of countless innocent lives”.
“Tragically, he embraced martyrdom in this valiant effort,” he said.
The KP governor called on the prime minister to confer “a posthumous national civil award, such as the Sitara-i-Shujaat or Tamgha-i-Shujaat”.
He said that the award would “not only honour his memory with the dignity it deserves but would also serve as an enduring inspiration for the youth of Pakistan, affirming that courage, faith and sacrifice in service of one’s community are the truest expressions of Pakistani nationhood”.
The KP governor expressed faith that the prime minister would consider the recommendation with the “utmost priority and urgency it so clearly warrants and approve the award at the earliest possible instance as a fitting national tribute to his unparalleled courage and sacrifice”.
Kundi had made a similar request earlier this week during a visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), where the injured remained under treatment.
It is worth mentioning that a day earlier, PM Shehbaz had announced a sum of Rs 10 million for the heirs of Abbas. The premier had also announced Rs5m for each person martyred in the attack; Rs3m for those critically injured and under treatment at the hospital; and Rs1m for those with minor injuries who had been discharged.</p><small>2026-02-12 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12173229d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972719/2-cops-among-6-injured-during-armed-confrontation-over-shop-ownership-in-kps-lower-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>2 cops among 6 injured during armed confrontation over shop ownership in KP’s Lower South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>LOWER SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Six people, including a police constable and station house officer (SHO), were injured when an argument over shop ownership and financial dealings led to an exchange of fire between the rival groups at the Toi Khullah market in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower South Waziristan on Thursday.
Wana Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn that the incident took place at around 9am when “a disagreement between two groups over monetary transactions and shop ownership turned into a heated argument”.
“The situation quickly escalated into a physical altercation and subsequently into an armed confrontation,” he said.
The DSP said that upon receiving the information about the incident, SHO Qutab Khan Dottani of the Toi Khullah police station,along with a police party, reached the site of the incident.
“While trying to mediate between the rival groups, the SHO and a police constable came under fire and sustained injuries,” the DSP said, adding that SHO Dottani had sustained a bullet wound in the leg but was out of danger.
Meanwhile, injured constable Bahra Khan sustained a minor head injury.
Both were shifted to the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital in Wana for treatment.
The DSP said that among the four other injured, Juma Gai and Alauddin — who are brothers — sustained bullet wounds in their legs. Another injured person, Hazrat Ali, sustained a bullet wound in the abdomen and was reported to be in serious condition, he said, adding that a man identified as Khudai Noor also suffered an injury in the leg in the incident.
All the injured were shifted to the DHQ hospital Wana.
DSP Shah said police had registered a case of the incident and initiated an investigation to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the incident, while efforts were under way to identify and arrest those involved in the clash.</p><small>2026-02-12 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12173223f0fa98b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972724/india-clears-proposal-to-buy-french-rafale-jets-defence-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>India clears proposal to buy French Rafale jets: defence ministry</strong></a><br><p>Indian defence officials on Thursday cleared the purchase of $39 billion worth of defence equipment, including more French Rafale jets, days ahead of a visit to the country by France’s President Emmanuel Macron.
A defence ministry source told AFP that the clearance covered the purchase of 114 Rafale fighter jets, adding to the dozens already used by the Indian Air Force (IAF).
“The procurement … will enhance the capability of undertaking air dominance roles across the spectrum of conflict and significantly boost the deterrence capabilities of IAF with long-range offensive strikes,” India’s defence ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of jets being purchased.
The approval by the defence acquisition council — comprising top military officers and the defence minister — is an important first step for any military hardware purchase in the country.
“The majority of MRFA (Multi Role Fighter Aircraft) to be procured will be manufactured in India,” the statement added.
New Delhi has pushed hard in the last decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment.
India has boosted military hardware imports from the United States, France, and Israel.
Macron is set to visit India on February 17.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has also liberalised laws to ease private investments in domestic defence manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ policy initiative.
Since 2015, India has bought 26 Rafale jets worth around $8.7bn and in April announced a fresh multi-billion dollar deal to buy 26 more of the fighter jets.

Is that a good thing?</strong></a><br><p>It took me about an hour to produce a 50-page-long children’s book. All it required was a handful of prompts to ChatGPT.
The task was simple: Write a children’s story about a journalist living in the age of artificial intelligence, set at The Korea Herald, with a main character named Jane.
Here’s what I got.



Both the book cover image and the title were created by ChatGPT.
And here are a few pages from the book:



Readers can decide for themselves if the result is convincing enough to pass as something written by a human.
But this experiment shows just how quickly a book can be made with AI, something South Korea’s publishing industry is trying to cope with, for better or worse.
Publishing in the AI era
Some say AI’s rise in publishing represents a change far greater than e-publishing, even akin to the advent of movable type.
Already, the industry is seeing a surge in published titles, as AI dramatically speeds up the production process.
Last year, the National Library of Korea issued 419,534 International Standard Book Numbers, or ISBNs, a 13.5 per cent increase from 369,628 the year before.
It was the first time since records began that annual ISBN issuance posted double-digit growth, far exceeding the roughly two per cent average increase seen over the previous five years.
ISBNs are unique codes for all books published worldwide, in both print and digital formats. A big jump in ISBNs indicates more books are coming to market.
Some early local news stories have called this increase an opportunity. The idea is that if you have a good idea but lack the writing skills, AI could help level the playing field.
In early January, the Korean news outlet Edaily reported that homemakers and even high school students have published books using AI tools.
Seo Jin, CEO of Snowfox Publishing, also said that AI is giving writers new opportunities. Snowfox Publishing released Korea’s first book made with ChatGPT, called “45 ways to find the purpose of life (unofficial title).”
“For aspiring authors, this is an exceptionally strong opportunity for publishing,” she said.
Seo also said that AI use has caused a big increase in manuscript submissions. She explained that this is especially important for small publishers, who have often struggled to get enough good material.
But this boom has also revealed some problems.
A wave of low-quality books, many made with little editing, is now entering the market.
This trend is mostly driven by the search for government subsidies and quick sales.
In Korea, all books issued an ISBN must be submitted to both the National Library of Korea and the National Assembly Library. The system is designed to preserve published works as part of the nation’s documentary heritage. Publishers are required to submit two copies of each title, with libraries compensating them for the price of one.
Recently, there have been growing worries that some publishers are taking advantage of this system by putting out books that don’t even meet basic standards, like proper grammar and spelling, just to get compensation.
On February 9,  the National Library of Korea said it had rejected 395 e-books from Luminary Books, submitted between July and September last year, because they were too short, reused public materials, or had repetitive content. The publisher is known for mass-producing e-books and openly using artificial intelligence in its writing and publishing.
However, publishers say this problem goes far beyond just one company, and more people are starting to worry.
“There is a group chat of roughly 2,000 publishers. Editors regularly share cases of authors submitting manuscripts that are largely completed with the help of AI,” Choi Ah-young, CEO of Calm Down Library, an independent publishing house, said.
She also gave more details about how this is hurting the local publishing industry.
“Editors sign (a contract) with authors because they value their ideas,” she said. “But when unverified information created through AI is turned into a manuscript, it creates serious trouble with fact-checking. Some manuscripts are sent back and revised, but others cannot even do that because the author never had the ability to write the book in the first place.”
She said the issue has even affected international rights deals.
“Some foreign publishers now include clauses explicitly prohibiting the use of AI for translation,” she said.
However, some people see this change as temporary and also as an opportunity.
Seo, CEO of Snowfox Publishing, is among those who view it as a chance for publishers and editors.
She believes that as more low-quality books appear, readers will become more selective. In the end, this will benefit publishers who focus on good editing and strong author voices.
“(Readers) will ask for something more than what they can get by asking ChatGPT. And that creates space for publishers who know what they are doing.”
At her company, editors are encouraged to use AI for tasks like proofreading and finding repetition or structural issues.
“This supports the editing process but doesn’t replace it,” she added.

The power regulator on Monday changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network. The notification effectively terminated the existing net-metering regime and replaced it with net-billing for all.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the Power Division to file a review appeal against it after the action drew much criticism.
In response to a call to attention notice — regarding prosumer regulations — raised by PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui during today’s session, Leghari spoke in defence of the move. He began his address by presenting “some key facts”.
He recalled that the issue had been under discussion for the “past 9-10 months”, adding that when the matter was forwarded to the federal cabinet, PM Shehbaz “told us to engage in further deliberations”.
The minister said that the total distributed solar generation in the country was estimated to be between 20,000 MW and 22,000 MW, out of which, “only 6,000-7,000MW of solar systems were on net-metering”.







He continued: “Out of these, only 2,200MW are used by industrial units, while the number for commercial and domestic consumers stood at 4,800MW.”
“Out of these, only 456,000 consumers use net-metering,” the minister said, stressing that given the limited number of consumers, it was “false to say that the general public will suffer due to the move”.
He maintained that only 8-10 per cent of the total solar consumers used the net-metering system. The minister stressed that the issue was not about “being anti-solar, but about fair pricing”.
The minister added that the proposed regulation had maintained the purchase rate for existing users at Rs27 due to “contractual obligations”; however, he noted that “this sparked another debate”.
He said that the net-metering users complained, “if you buy it from us at Rs27, and then give it to us at the rates of Rs45-65. How is this fair?”
“I will tell you how it is fair, this is fair [..] because with all the hydel, solar, wind, nuclear, gas, and coal sources combined, the average price is Rs8.31, then how can you justify the rate of Rs27,” the minister said.
He said that despite the “concessions”, PM Shehbaz has directed the Power Division to “file a review petition to the regulator and limit the move”.
The minister said that if the government were to continue with the policy, “these 456,000 investors, their profit will go down from 50pc to 37pc per year. Is that so bad?”
He stressed that “no one was going to incur any losses”.
“If the electricity cost goes down by Rs1-1.5 for the general consumers and you still get a 37pc profit, then, how can you say that the policy does not serve public interest?” he said.
“Yet, the prime minister has directed us to wait until the NEPRA hearing,” he added.
The minister said that the prime minister further directed the Power Division to develop a strategy to “lessen the burden on others caused by net-metering solar consumers”.
MNA Sharmila Faruqui terms action ‘daylight robbery’
Faruqui, in response to the minister’s remarks, objected to the minister for “shifting the blame to net-metering users for burdening the national grid”.
“These consumers are the ones who followed the government’s clean energy policy,” she said, stressing that the government had taken a “U-turn on their policies”.
“Now they are justifying it by blaming people who were at the forefront of your policy,” she said.
She maintained that the Power Division was “compensating for the cost incurred from line losses and transmission losses, their own inefficiency, inconsistency, corruption, line losses, capacity payments from the people”.
She termed the action “broad daylight robbery”.
In his response to Faruqui, the minister noted that the call to attention on the matter was no longer appropriate “since the prime minister has already said that the net-billing should be halted and the consumers will stay on net-metering for now”.
Addressing the list of issues pointed out by Faruqui, the minister held that “while other issues existed, this is still an important issue that is raising the price of power for all consumers on the grid.
“With this in rationalisation in mind, the regulations were introduced,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-12 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11235047d788238.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972556/ex-army-chief-qamar-javed-bajwa-hospitalised-after-fall' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa hospitalised after fall</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former chief of army staff Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa has been admitted to a military hospital after sustaining injuries in a fall at his home.
Inter-Services Public Relations confirmed this on Thursday, a day after the incident was initially reported.
The military’s media affairs wings said in a statement that the former army chief was under treatment at the Combined Military Hospital after the fall.
An informed source, which also confirmed the reports of Bajwa’s fall, earlier told Dawn that he suffered injuries after slipping at his residence.
He was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit. While the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear, he was reported to be in stable condition.
‘100pc out of danger’
In a video message released on social media, the former army chief’s brother-in-law, Naeem Ghumman, said Bajwa was “barefoot when he slipped and suffered a head injury”.
He added that nothing “suspicious came up” following his medical examination, and all necessary tests were conducted.
Ghumman stated that the former army chief is “100 per cent out of danger”.
Bajwa, 65, served as the 10th chief of army staff from Nov 29, 2016, to Nov 29, 2022, with an extension in his tenure granted in 2019.
Since retiring in late 2022, Bajwa has largely stayed out of the public eye.</p><small>2026-02-12 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1212300016c11e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972708/what-facilities-does-pti-founder-imran-khan-have-access-to-in-prison' target='_blank'><strong>What facilities does PTI founder Imran Khan have access to in prison?</strong></a><br><p>Advocate Salman Safdar formally submitted to the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday a seven-page report regarding incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s living conditions at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, amid concern from his party over his treatment.
The PTI lawyer, who was appointed amicus curaie to visit Adiala jail, told the media after submitting the report that he met the PTI founder and visited his cell. At the time, he refused to divulge details of the report to the media.
A copy of the report, available with Dawn, detailed the conditions of Imran’s confinement, including the facilities provided during his incarceration.
Daily routine and diet
According to the report, Imran’s daily routine varies between summer and winter.
“He takes breakfast at around 9:45am, followed by recitation of the Holy Qur’an from approximately 11:30am for about an hour,” the report said, adding that breakfast consisted of coffee, porridge and a few dates.
“He then undertakes physical exercise using the limited equipment available to him, including an exercise bike, two nine-kilogramme weights, and a bar,” the report said.
“At around 1:15pm, after showering, he is permitted to access the strolling shed within the secured compound, where he may sit or walk.”
According to the report, the PTI leader takes lunch between 3:30pm and 4pm — according to a meal plan selected by himself and financed by his family — and at 5pm he is again allowed a brief walk. The lunch plan consists “two days of chicken, two days of meat, two days of lentils (daal), and/or two days of ‘chaat’/snacks”.
“From approximately 5:30pm until 10am the following morning, he remains confined to his cell,” it said.
It added that Imran did not take a full meal at dinner, instead consuming “fruit, milk and dates”. He further said that bottled Nestle drinking water was available to him.
Confinement cell, hygiene
According to the report, Imran’s designated cell contains a chair, table, bed, and a hanger.
The report stated that “lighting and ventilation are sufficient during both daytime and nighttime”. Imran also informed Safdar that no utensils, crockery or cutlery were kept inside the cell.
Regarding cleanliness, the report shared that a mushaqati (convicted labourer) had been deputed to assist with washing and cleaning, including changing the bedding and maintaining the cleanliness of the cell as well as the washroom.
“He (Imran) expressed no complaint in this regard and stated that he is satisfied with the cleanliness arrangements,” the report said, adding that toiletries were provided to him “whenever demanded”.
Safdar reported that upon inspection of the cell, the bedding provided consisted of “one single-bed mattress, four pillows, and two blankets”.
A toilet was observed within the cell, measuring approximately four and a half feet by four and a half feet and partitioned by a five-foot wall. Outside the toilet area, it added, a wash basin with access to “both hot and cold water” and a mirror were present.
“With regard to cleanliness, some room for improvement in sanitary conditions of the toilet was observed,” the report said.
It also added that the cell had two openings of roughly two by two feet on opposite ends of the ceiling to allow for cross-ventilation. However, it called attention to the lack of an exhaust system installed in the cell despite the presence of the toilet.
The report further noted a carpet mat on the floor of the cell and several belongings of the ex-premier, including a prayer mat and counter (tasbeeh), personal care items such as a shaving kit and mouthwash, and “approximately 100 books”.
Safety and amenities
The report stated that Imran was given a “small-sized heater/blower” in his living cell during the winter months and that hot water was available at all times.
However, he said that during the summer months, his living conditions were “particularly difficult due to extreme heat and humidity” as well as insects and mosquitoes.
Despite an installed room cooler and mosquito repellent, the measures “do not sufficiently mitigate the prevailing conditions”, the report said. This, according to the ex-premier, affected his quality of rest during the summer period.
Notably, Imran also reported that there was no refrigerator provided in the confinement cell, and the cool box provided to him was “not always effective” during extreme weather. Imran expressed discontent in this regard and said that he had experienced food poisoning two to three times during the summer months.
Regarding his safety and security, however, Safdar reported “no concerns” from the incarcerated PTI leader, saying that there were approximately 10 surveillance cameras installed in the compound for monitoring purposes.
“He further stated that while one camera has coverage up to the shower area, there is no camera installed inside the room/cell itself,” the report said.
Overall, it said that the premier expressed no concern over his safety.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12122726b613d31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972709/canadian-police-identify-18-year-old-woman-as-suspect-in-mass-school-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Canadian police identify 18-year-old woman as suspect in mass school shooting</strong></a><br><p>The suspect in a deadly school shooting in western Canada was an 18-year-old woman with mental health issues who killed her mother and stepbrother before attacking her former school, police said on Wednesday, but investigators did not offer a motive for one of the worst mass slaughters in Canadian history.
The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia.
Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten.
On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago.



“Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said.
Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure.
“We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters.
Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days.
Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning.
“It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said.
McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home.
She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun.
Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital.
Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound.
“We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted.
Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths.
Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history
Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday.
In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote.
He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims.
“Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community.
“Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.”
McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision.
Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence.
Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests.
The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history.
In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station.
In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide.
“There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator.
“It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12122324870f92b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972707/pakistan-sends-another-humanitarian-aid-consignment-to-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sends another humanitarian aid consignment to Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan dispatched another consignment of humanitarian supplies to Gaza on Thursday as part of measures to provide Palestinians with life-saving aid following Israel’s invasion of the enclave.
The latest aid consignment was dispatched by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), with the support of Al-Khidmat Foundation.
This is the second aid consignment sent by Islamabad within the last week. Earlier, on Monday, the 28th consignment was dispatched.
Pakistan had sent the first aid consignment, including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023, days after the Israeli bombardment began.







The relief goods were dispatched through a chartered flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s Al-Arish airport for onward delivery to Gaza.
Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents.
Tel Aviv’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1211150095db52f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972703/gold-dips-lower-due-to-firmer-dollar-after-strong-us-jobs-data' target='_blank'><strong>Gold dips lower due to firmer dollar after strong US jobs data</strong></a><br><p>Gold prices dipped on Thursday as the US dollar firmed after stronger-than-expected January jobs data dented expectations for near-term interest rate cuts, while investors awaited inflation data due on Friday for more monetary policy cues.
Spot gold edged 0.3 per cent lower to $5,063.11 per ounce by 04:53 GMT. It closed Wednesday with a more than 1pc gain.
US gold futures for April delivery lost 0.3pc to $5,083.90 per ounce.
“The stronger jobs report leading to a slight pare back in Fed rate-cut expectations may have played a role in gold’s lacklustre move,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at OCBC.
The US dollar index rose following the surprisingly strong employment report that suggested underlying US economic health.
A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced metals more expensive for other currency holders.
“Sensitivity to the dollar, yield repricing, and uncertainty around Fed policy should continue to pose two-way risks for gold in the interim,” Wong said.
US job growth unexpectedly accelerated in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3pc, though the largest increase in payrolls in 13 months likely exaggerates the labour market’s health, as revisions showed the economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025 instead of the previously estimated 584,000.
The US budget deficit will grow slightly in fiscal 2026 to $1.853 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office forecast on Wednesday, showing that on balance, President Donald Trump’s economic policies are worsening the country’s fiscal picture amid low economic growth.
The Federal Reserve will keep rates unchanged through Chair Jerome Powell’s term ending in May but cut immediately afterward in June, a Reuters poll showed, with economists warning that policy under his likely successor, Kevin Warsh, could become too loose.
Investors now await the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday and inflation data on Friday for more cues on the Fed’s monetary policy path.

Visuals released earlier on Wednesday after the Netanyahu-Rubio meeting showed them holding a document with Netanyahu’s signature on Israel joining the board.
Netanyahu said on X that he “signed Israel’s accession as a member of the ‘Board of Peace’”. He later discussed Iran with Trump.







A UN Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorised the board and countries working with it to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Hamas signed off.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board, with him as chair, would be expanded to tackle global conflicts.
The board will hold its first meeting on February 19 in Washington to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction.
Many rights experts say that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory’s affairs resembled a colonial structure. Israel’s presence on the board is expected to bring further criticism as the board does not include a Palestinian.
Countries have reacted cautiously to Trump’s invitation to join the board launched in late January. Many experts are concerned that the board could undermine the United Nations.
While some of Washington’s Middle Eastern allies have joined, many of its traditional Western allies have stayed away.
The ceasefire in Gaza has been repeatedly violated, with at least 580 Palestinians killed since it began in October, according to Palestinian and Israeli tallies, respectively.
The next phase of Trump’s Gaza plan calls for resolving complex issues like Hamas’s disarmament, which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
Israel’s invasion of Gaza has killed over 72,000, according to Gaza’s health ministry, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population.
Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.</p><small>2026-02-12 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12085905a6ca4cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972690/pakistan-key-us-partner-in-region-official-tells-congress' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan key US partner in region, official tells Congress</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country.
Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation.
“Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources, combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee.
Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.”
He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.”
During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics.
Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States.
Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups.
When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere.
The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect.
The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests.
He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific.
Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence.
At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said.
Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people.
She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute.
Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable.
Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces.
“We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.</p><small>2026-02-12 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12092214088983b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972677/all-punjab-police-personnel-to-get-bodycams-within-two-months' target='_blank'><strong>All Punjab Police personnel to get bodycams within two months</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Police and traffic personnel will be provided body cameras in phases within the next two months, said Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Abdul Kareem on Wednesday.
He was chairing a meeting at the Central Police Office to review the implementation of reform measures in the Punjab Police under the ‘Fast, Fearless, Transparent Justice’ initiative.
He said that panic buttons were being installed outside police stations so that citizens could immediately lodge complaints in case of any misconduct or lack of hearing.
He directed that at all police stations, offices, checkpoints, and Khidmat Marakaz, citizens should be addressed respectfully as “sir or madam” and “sahib or sahiba”. He said that counseling and training of officers and personnel would be arranged to improve the overall perception of Punjab Police’s conduct.

IGP also speaks to citizens through 1787 Complaint Centre

It was made clear that officials involved in corruption, abuse of authority, and misconduct would face immediate and strict accountability.
The IGP directed that CCTV cameras installed in all police stations be kept fully operational and backup systems be ensured.
A modern control and monitoring room was being activated at the Central Police Office for effective monitoring of police stations, while through the Safe Cities mechanism, direct monitoring of police stations, SHOs, moharrirs, and investigation rooms would be carried out.
He emphasised on making core policing, supervision, and the command system more effective for crime control and said that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was herself overseeing all police reform measures.
The meeting also issued instructions to strictly enforce traffic laws and to continue the crackdown against violations.
He said that the investigation process and the activities of citizens visiting police stations would be fully recorded and that key performance indicators (KPIs) scorecards would be implemented in practical terms. He said that he was himself calling applicant citizens from the Central Police Office to obtain feedback.
He directed RPOs and DPOs to initiate direct contacts and meetings for redressal of citizens’ grievances, while in cases of abuse, harassment, and violence, investigations involving affected women and children should be conducted within the bounds of complete civility and respect. Instructions were also given to resolve cases of women and children on a priority basis with the help of data from Virtual Women Police Stations and the Center for Child Safety.
Meanwhile, the IGP initiated direct contact with citizens through the 1787 Complaint Center and spoke with several citizens via phone calls. He obtained information about the duration of redressal of received applications and complaints, police response, and overall conduct.
Citizens also shared their feedback regarding the actions taken and responses by the police.
Mr Kareem directed RPOs, DPOs, and other supervisory officers to take immediate action on citizens’ applications and provide relief without delay.
He further directed that all complaints received via phone calls, SMS, email, and other channels be resolved immediately in accordance with the prescribed timelines and SOPs.
He urged citizens to register complaints on 1787 in case of any irregularity or misconduct by the police force.
The IGP received a detailed briefing on the 1787 dashboard and complaints from across the regions.
During the briefing, Punjab Additional IG Imran Arshad, Additional IG (Internal Accountability) Imran Mehmood, Additional IG (Logistics) Fawad-ud-Din Qureshi, AIG Inspection, AIG Operations, and other officers were also present.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stepped in on Wednesday to seek a review of Nepra’s revised rules for rooftop solar users, while the power regulator simultaneously rubber-stamped a government plan to impose hefty fixed charges on residential consumers.
The premier also directed the Power Division to file a review petition against the regulator’s move regarding new solar regulations.
On Monday, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) revised the terms for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — on the pretext of rising solar penetration and the need to protect an expensive and inefficient state-run power network. The notification effectively ended the net-metering regime and shifted prosumers to net billing.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier had taken “immediate notice” of the matter, following criticism in the Senate from lawmakers across party lines, including ruling ally PPP and opposition PTI.







The PMO quoted the prime minister as directing the Power Division to file a review petition before Nepra “to ensure every possible safeguard of the existing consumer contracts”.
He was of the view that the “burden of 466,000 users benefitting from solar should not be put on 37.6 million domestic consumers” receiving electricity directly from the national grid. “Power Division should chalk out a comprehensive strategy in this regard,” he said.
The directives were issued during a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on the new Nepra regulations. The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Cheema, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and the prime minister’s adviser Muhammad Ali.
Speaking in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr Leghari defended Nepra’s move, saying it was aimed at easing the burden on consumers. “Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he would not step back. “This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained.
Stakeholders and policy experts have warned that the proposed Prosumer Regulations 2025 could undermine a decade of citizen-led expansion in clean energy.
Under the new regulations, registered prosumers will be immediately shifted to net billing in place of net metering, and their exported units will be credited for one month instead of the current three months. Other terms will remain unchanged until their seven-year contracts expire.
Under net billing, electricity generated by a prosumer is purchased by the relevant distribution company (Disco), and the consumer is billed for electricity imported from the grid at about Rs37-55 per unit (depending on the slab) after receiving credit for exports at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
The new rules bar prosumers from installing solar power systems for net metering beyond their originally sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Nepra approves fixed charges
Meanwhile, Nepra on Wednesday approved a government decision to impose about Rs132bn in fixed charges on more than 28.5m residential electricity consumers, at rates ranging from Rs200 to Rs675 per kilowatt per month of sanctioned load.
The regulator’s fast-tracked approval of the federal government’s Feb 4 decision will come into retrospective effect from February, increasing the effective unit price by up to 75pc for the lowest strata with a declining scale for higher consumption groups. The Rs132bn fixed charges do not include about Rs24bn general sales tax and other taxes, surcharges and duties.
This will adequately address cross-subsidy on industrial consumers, reducing their average tariff by Rs4.04 per unit as announced by the prime minister to make export products competitive in the global market. For the first time, the burden of cross-subsidy on the industrial sector has come to zero.
Given “the fact that the revised tariff proposed by the federal government is within the determined consolidated revenue requirement of all the XWDISCOs (ex-Wapda distribution companies) and already budgeted tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249bn for the calendar year 2026, the authority has no objection in approving the motion”, Nepra wrote in its decision to the government for formal publication in the Gazette of Pakistan.
The revised schedule of tariff shows that new fixed charges have been imposed on monthly consumption of up to 300 units, raised for the 400-600 unit slabs and slightly scaled down for higher users to discourage defection from the grid.
As a result, the average power tariff (including energy and capacity components) for both protected and non-protected consumers in the first 100-unit slab has risen by 76pc, or Rs8 per unit, and 73.5pc, or Rs16.5 per unit, respectively, following the imposition of fixed char­ges at Rs200 and Rs275 per kilowatt of sanctioned load.
More than 22m consumers fall into these two categories. “This is the highest-ever price hike for this consumer category since the creation of separate distribution, generation and transmission companies in the early 1990s,” a senior official told Dawn.
For protected consumers using 101-200 units, the average cost has increased by Rs4 per unit, or 31pc, due to a Rs300-per-kW fixed monthly charge, while the non-protected category in the same slab has seen a rise of Rs6 per unit, or 21pc.
Consumers in the 200-300 unit slab will face a Rs350-per-kW fixed charge per month, lifting their average price by 12.7pc, or Rs4.20 per unit. About 5.6 million consumers fall into this group.
The fixed rate for the 301-400 unit category has been doubled to Rs400 per kW from Rs200, raising average unit rates by 6.5pc, or Rs2.5 per unit, despite a slight downward adjustment in base tariffs. More than two million consumers are in this bracket.
Higher-consumption households will also face increases. The fixed rate for the 401-500 unit slab has been raised to Rs500 per kW from Rs400, and to Rs675 per kW for the 501-600 slab, resulting in a 5.8pc, or Rs2.30-per-unit, rise in average tariffs, even after a Rs1.25-per-unit cut in base rates.
For consumers using 601-700 units a month, the fixed charge has been reduced to Rs675 per kW from Rs800, while those exceeding 700 units will also pay Rs675 per kW instead of Rs1,000. Nevertheless, both groups will still see average-rate increases of Rs2 and Rs1.80 per unit, or about 5pc and 4pc, respectively.
Only time-of-use consumers with sanctioned loads above 5kW will benefit from an average reduction of about 7pc, or Rs3.30 per unit, after the abolition of their Rs1,000-per-kW fixed charge in view of peak rates of Rs47 per unit, excluding taxes and duties. Even they, however, will face a 6pc, or Rs2.5-per-unit, rise during off-peak hours.
An official said the Power Division had estimated that the fixed charges would generate an additional Rs132bn for distribution companies, although another calculation suggested the inflow could exceed Rs250bn because most residential subsidies had been eliminated.

The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation.
To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC).
A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes.
Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog.

Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn.
According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn.
The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn.
The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years.
The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives.
The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”.
Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records.
Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction.
A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025.
Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority.
The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million.
The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

Red and yellow varieties of Swiss chard planted eight to 10 inches apart

 
Often referred to as ghaas phoos [grass and straw] in jest, leafy green vegetables are known as a healthy eating option, particularly for those facing weight issues or metabolic disorders such as hypertension and diabetes. 
Swiss chard, with its rich nutritious profile, is no exception. Its leaves are rich in vitamins A, C, E and K. Minerals such as magnesium, manganese, potassium, copper and iron contribute to its nutrient density. The consumption of Swiss chard provides considerable quantities of proteins, fibres and carbohydrates along with minimal calories, making it one of the best solutions to manage weight. 
Quercetin, an antioxidant present in Swiss chard, may have anti-cancer properties. The vegetable is also beneficial in diabetes management and keeps bones, heart and eyes in good shape. 
However, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions need to exercise caution while consuming it. Individuals on blood-thinning medications should consume Swiss chard judiciously due to its vitamin K content. The high oxalate content of Swiss chard can also cause kidney stones in prone individuals. Even with the widespread belief that boiling Swiss chard and removing the water reduces its oxalate content, prone individuals should still eat it in moderation and consult with their physician regularly. 

Swiss chard’s vibrant stems — in red, yellow and white — make it one of the most visually striking vegetables you can grow

Given these nutritional benefits, Swiss chard is worth growing at home. Here’s how to cultivate it successfully.
Swiss chard seeds, ranging from brown to dark brown, are available in “rainbow” mixes, containing red, yellow and white-stemmed varieties, often called Bright Lights. These colours refer to the stem and mid rib of the leaves. Some growers mix different-coloured varieties when planting.

In favourable conditions, the irregular, spinach-like seeds of Swiss chard are likely to sprout within one week to 10 days of sowing. Usually, one seed ball of Swiss chard has three to four seedlings growing out of it. With care, a seasoned gardener can separate the seedlings. An easier way, called thinning, is to remove relatively weaker seedlings and retain the strongest of the three to four seedlings. 
Initially, the seedling sprouts cotyledon leaves, which are distinct from Swiss chard leaves. The two cotyledon leaves are very thin, as shown in the photograph, without any mid ribs. They have a smooth texture and are oval-shaped. These leaves usually emerge at the beginning of the seed-sprouting phase, to provide the initial energy boost to the nascent seedling. 
At this stage, the seedling tray or the potting vessel should be exposed to three to five hours of early morning sunlight. The watering schedule should be adjusted to ensure that the sunlight-exposed soil surface remains moist, and not wet, throughout the day. 
The seedlings are extremely lanky at this stage and should be covered to protect them from birds. This can be done using a green net or installing mirrors to reflect sunlight.
The first true leaf of Swiss chard is likely to appear in about 10 days after planting. Once it has sprouted three to four leaves, the seedling should be transplanted at its permanent location. This may take anywhere between three weeks to one month. During this process, the sturdiness of the sapling’s stem also increases and the sapling reaches three to four inches in height. 



 
It is critical to transplant the sapling exactly at this stage as deviation — either too early or too late — can result in transplantation shock to the plant. Usually, the pot should be at least 11 to 13 inches in width and height. When planting in open ground, space saplings at least eight to 10 inches apart. 
One of the drawbacks of growing Swiss chard in pots is that the leaf is smaller than those from plants grown in the ground. Plant growth in pots is also slower.
