• Audit had flagged over Rs375tr in financial irregularities, loss of public money, ineffective public investments
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) on Monday rejected media reports alleging errors and miscalculations in its audit reports released last month, which had highlighted more than Rs375 trillion in financial irregularities, loss of public money and lack of intended impact of public investments.
“AGP rejects allegations of errors in audit reports,” said a statement issued by the Department of the Auditor General of Pakistan (DAGP). It added that the office “strongly rejected recent media reports alleging miscalculations in the federal audit reports, terming them entirely unfounded and misleading.”
The DAGP also denied that the reports had been released bypassing the constitutional process, which requires their submission to the president and then laying before parliament.
According to the statement, the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements for the fiscal year 2023-24 were duly submitted to the president and routed through the prime minister, strictly in line with constitutional provisions and the Rules of Business 1973. “The president approved the submission, and the reports were subsequently transmitted to both houses of parliament,” it said.
The DAGP explained that as the supreme audit institution of the country, it functions under a constitutional mandate laid down in Articles 168 to 171 of the Constitution.
Article 171 states: “The reports of the Auditor General relating to the accounts of the Federation shall be submitted to the President, who shall cause them to be laid before both Houses of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament). The reports relating to the accounts of a Province shall be submitted to the Governor of the Province, who shall cause them to be laid before the Provincial Assembly.”
The statement further said that the app­r­oval of the reports from the president was duly communicated through the President’s Secretariat on April 12, 2025. Following this, the required number of federal audit reports were printed for laying before both houses of parliament.
On the AGP’s request, the motions were included in the National Assembly’s Orders of the Day issued on August 13, 2025. However, the National Assembly Secretariat, through its deputy secretary (legislation), informed the same day that the assembly session had been prorogued. As a result, the motion for laying the reports could not be included in the Orders of the Day.
The secretariat further asked that the reports be collected from the legislation branch, with due observance of confidentiality until they are formally laid before the house. “It is further clarified that the audit reports transmitted to the Senate remain in the custody of the Senate Secretariat,” it added.
Based on this record, the DAGP said: “The news currently circulating in different sections of print media alleging miscalculations in the audit reports and claiming that these reports were returned to the Department of the Auditor-General of Pakistan by the National Assembly Secretariat are entirely unfounded and misleading.”
It stressed that the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements were sent to the NA Secretariat after the president’s approval on the prime minister’s advice to lay them before both houses of parliament.
Defending the integrity of its audit findings, the AGP asserted that the reports were prepared after proper quality assurance and “did not contain any errors”. It explained that the figures cited in the media came only from the executive summary of the consolidated federal audit report for 2024-25, which is prepared as a reference document to help stakeholders access and review sector-wise findings.

WHILE one cannot say for sure what was in the minds of those who approved the new National Tariff Policy 2025-2030, they were definitely not looking at the prevalent global trade scene. The new policy seems to draw its inspiration from the ‘neoliberal orthodoxy’ fast becoming redundant in these challenging times, which columnist Gillian Tett describes as “a new era of ‘geo-economics’ where state-driven industrial policies — tariffs, export controls — are reshaping global trade.”
In the 1980s, leaders such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan supported the free-market ideas espoused by politicians such as Jack Kemp and economists such as Eugene Fama and Milton Friedman. They assumed that “markets and money were shaped by laws of supply and demand so consistent and universal that they could be modelled using tools from physics and math”. The myth did not survive even in the best of the times when global free trade policy in the World Trade Organisation was led initially by the US or later by China.
 
 

Even before the world saw the US-China trade war heat up, using tariffs and subsidies to influence flow of trade, globalisation and market access had been restricted through customs unions/ trade blocs such as Asean, the EU, EAEU, GCC and many others. The countries have been engaging with each other and these trade blocs, to gain market access through free or preferential trade agreements (FTAs/ PTAs). One of the main reasons for Pakistan facing difficulty in expanding its exports is that it has only few FTAs/ PTAs as compared to its competitors. That is to say, it has limited market access.
This is not the first time that we went down the path of old-fashioned romanticism with the ideas of free trade and tariff liberalisation. The rationale was always the same: global integration, competitiveness and efficiency. The outcomes, however, tell a different story.

The new tariff policy poses a risk to external sector stability and the current account surplus.

We should have kept in mind the lessons from the liberalisation era of the 1990s under the IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programmes. It was said that tariff rationalisation would modernise trade and integrate the economy into the global market. Between 1996 and 2005, Pakistan’s average tariff was steeply brought down from 46.6 per cent to just 14.3pc. Instead of expanding exports, Pakistan entered into an unending spiral of high trade deficits eating away workers’ remittances and leaving behind large current account deficits. The trade deficit which was just $3.1 billion in 1995-96 grew four times to $12.1bn in 2005-06 and 16 times to $48.3bn in 2021-22.
 
 

In three decades (1995-2025), Pakistan’s exports increased only 3.7 times from $8.7bn to $32bn. In these 30 years, the export of regional peers, ie, Bangladesh and India, grew by 12.6 and 14.3 times, respectively. In contrast, our imports jumped almost eight times, from $11.8bn in 1995-96 to $80.3bn, its highest in 2021-22.
The unilateral opening of our markets to foreign goods, without an accompanying industrial policy which would have allowed our industry to grow from producers of low-value goods to high-value ones, left our industries facing their worst downward spiral into an era of premature de-industrialisation. In these three decades, Pakistan’s industrial sector recorded only a six-fold increase, compared with 30-fold in Vietnam, 17-fold in Bangladesh, and nine-fold in India.
The National Tariff Policy 2025-30 seeks to reduce the average tariff from 10.4pc to below 6pc by 2030, far below the average tariff of around 16pc in India and 14pc in Bangladesh. The new structure reduces five slabs to four (0pc, 5pc, 10pc, 15pc), reducing from the current highest slab of 20pc. Bangladesh and India continue to retain their maximum slabs of 25pc and 70pc respectively, despite enjoying a much larger market access. Both our competitors continue to impose additional duties and surcharges, whereas Pakistan has committed to phase these out in four to five years under the new policy.
The previous National Tariff Policy 2019-24 distinguished between inputs essential for industrial development and luxury consumption goods, lowering duties on raw material, intermediate inputs and machinery while retaining higher tariffs on finished and non-essential imports. It helped reduce production costs without exposing domestic firms to undue competition. If accompanied by the right policy mix, it could have provided the foundation for sustainable industrial growth.
 
 

Any attempt to trade liberalisation must be accompanied by a reasonably sound industrial base and enabling global environment. The new tariff policy puts the hard-earned stability in the external sector and the current account surplus achieved only last year, at immense risk. The knee-jerk tariff policy shift has shown the future trend in the first two months of its partial implementation. The trade deficit in the months of July and August jumped 29pc at $6bn, up from $4.6bn last year for the corresponding period against a 12.5pc decline in exports in the month of August.
As a market of 250 million consumers, Pakistan can attract many investors and traders if it can offer a profitable proposition through preferential tariff concessions to economies which make reciprocal concessions to our exporters and investors. If we open our market unilaterally for the entire world, giving away tariffs as a bargaining chip, why would anyone bother to discuss FTAs/ PTAs with us and open their markets for our exports?
“The world has changed, globalisation is over and we are now in a new era,” said Keir Starmer, the British prime minister. We no longer live in the Reagan-Thatcher era of neoliberalism or globalisation. Let us put aside outdated editions of a redundant policy mix. Let us wake up to the new real world of smart trade deals, using tariff policy as a tool for negotiations and for exchanging market access, instead of allowing unilateral access. It must be accompanied by a reliable security environment, enabling policies and their continuity; and efficient protection for those industrial sectors that are critical for our economic security.

Speaking at a news conference, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to China, the two sides had agreed to constitute a consortium of financiers, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), China and Pakistan, for the 1,700-km Karachi-Peshawar railway line.
He said China had assured financing not only for ML-1 but also for the Karakoram Highway. Negotiations with multiple financiers would be concluded within a month. He added that ML-1 and the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway would already have been completed, had it not been for the 2018 political change, alleging that the subsequent PTI government “destroyed the process”.
The minister said Pakistan and China had agreed to develop and implement a four-year action plan to build, between 2025 and 2029, a “China-Pakistan community with a shared future” with stronger political trust, closer trade ties, deeper security cooperation and stronger people-to-people links. Agriculture modernisation and industrial development would be prioritised under CPEC’s second phase, with space for third-party participation.

Minister says Beijing also assured funding for Karakoram Highway

The next meeting of the Joint Cooperation Council (JCC) of CPEC will be held on Sept 26 in Beijing. Both sides also agreed to advance industrial park development in line with local needs, support enterprise investment in special economic zones (SEZs) — particularly in Karachi and Islamabad — and offer preferential policies and a supportive business environment.
Mr Iqbal said the action plan was a “solid development” of leadership-level meetings aimed at deepening strategic cooperation and advancing the shared vision of an even closer partnership in the new era between two “time-tested, friendly countries.”
The two sides agreed to make full use of the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation to accelerate industrialisation, support exports and encourage Chinese firms to invest in Pakistan, including in the mining sector and building mining industrial parks.
They also agreed to promote cooperation in crop cultivation, animal husbandry, epidemic control for plants and animals, aquaculture, agro-processing, agricultural mechanisation and capacity building in seed technology and drip irrigation.
The plan includes aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Pakistan’s 5Es Framework, implementing both large-scale landmark projects and “small and beautiful” livelihood projects, while ensuring both high-quality development and robust security.

Al Jazeera quoted paramedics as saying that at least 12 people were inju­red and six were in “serious condition” after the shooting on Monday morning at Ramot Junction.
Israeli police described the shooting as a suspec­ted “terror attack”, Al Jaz­e­era reported, adding that a security officer and an armed civilian shot and killed the perpetrators soon after the shooting began.
The police said the perpetrators arrived in a vehicle and opened fire at a bus station.
Four of the dead were ultra-Orthodox Israeli men, according to local me­d­ia, while another was a recent immigrant from Spain.
Israeli forces closed all checkpoints between East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank after the attack, sources told Al Jazeera.
After police said the perpetrators had come from the occupied West Bank, Israeli Army Radio reported Israeli forces imposed a military cordon on four villages in the Jerusalem governorate in the territory — Qatana, Biddu, Beit Inan and Beit Duqu — and conducted raids there.
The Israeli military said it had reinforced its forces in the wider Jerusalem area and was conducting a wide-ranging search for what it described as “accomplices” in the shooting.
Palestinians in the West Bank are preparing themselves to face collective punishment from Israel in retaliation for the attack, a Palestinian journalist said.
According to an Al Jazeera journalist, Israeli authorities said the two perpetrators came from an area in the occupied West Bank that is just west of East Jerusalem.
They claimed the two worked in tandem; both gunmen boarded a bus —  witnesses say one of them was dressed as a ticket inspector —  and opened fire.
Israeli officials are now trying to wrap their heads around how exactly this happened, saying that they haven’t seen something like this happen in years, saying that the last shooting like this in greater Jerusalem was back in November 2023, Al Jazeera reported.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich blamed the attack on the Palestinian Authority, which he claimed “raises and educates its children to murder Jews”.
But the Palestinian presidency in Ramallah said it “firmly rejected and condemned any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians,” the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
The PA is a civilian ruling authority in areas of the West Bank, where about three million Palestinians live — as well as around half a million Israelis occupying settlements considered illegal under international law.

• Police fire tear gas to disperse protesters in various localities; dozens rounded up across the province
• Markets stay shut; trade with Iran, Afghanistan suspended due to roadblocks; only airport, railway station operational
QUETTA: Opposition leaders vowed to continue holding protests across Baloc­histan after police arrested 260 people on Monday for alleged violent demo­n­s­trations and violation of Section 144.
The arrests came as Quetta and other parts of the province were brought to a virtual standstill as a result of a strike — announced by opposition parties to protest a recent suicide bombing, which claimed over a dozen lives.
Life across the province was also disrupted and due to road blocks, Balochistan remained cut off from the rest of the country, barring rail and aerial routes.
Clashes were also reported between protesters and the police. A senior police official was also taken to hospital with bullet injuries, officials said.
Workers and supporters of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan alliance blocked all national highways at different entry points, putting up barricades and big boulders in the morning to block all types of traffic. Transporters’ associations had already announced support for their protest.
Likewise, trade activities between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were suspended due to the strike. Not a single truck or other vehicle crossed into the border towns of Chaman and Taftan due to the blockade on highways linking Balochistan with Afghanistan and Iran.
The airport and rail services, however, remained operational under the watchful eye of security personnel.
Besides roads and trade, businesses also remained shut and the supporters of the opposition parties patrolled the business hubs of the provincial capital, seemingly to enforce the strike.
Clashes erupted in the areas of Sariab, Airport Road, Pashtunabad, Nawa Killi, and Jinnah Road when police attempted to remove blockades from main roads.
Police removed the hurdles and did not allow the alliance workers to block intra-city roads.
The protesters, however, managed to block the Western and Eastern bypasses for a brief period, but police dispersed them by firing tear gas.
On Airport Road too, police fired in the air to disperse protesters who were blocking the road, while clashes were also reported from Sariab Road.
SSP Mohammad Baloch told Dawn that those detained had been sent to the district jail.
PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, ex-MNA Abdul Qahar Wadan, BNP-Mengal leader Mir Naseer Ahmed Shahwani and others were also arrested by the police.
Private educational institutions, including schools and colleges, remained closed due to the protest.
However, government-run educational institutions and offices remained open, but very few employees could reach the secretariat and other offices due to low traffic.
60 arrested across province
In other parts of the province, over 60 people were arrested for violating Section 144, blocking the highways, and clashing with the security forces. The wheel-jam and shutter-down strike was also observed in Loralai, Zhob, Sibi. Nasirabad, Khuzdar, Kalat, Harnai, Mastung, Hub Bela, Kharan, Noshki, Qila Saifullah, Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, Dera Murad Jamali and other towns and cities. “Around 60 people were arrested in these towns,” said officials.
In KP, the opposition parties, as well as the ruling PTI, also organised demonstrations across the province.
The strike call was given by PkMAP, BNP, the PTI, the ANP, the National Party, and the MWM at a joint presser last week to protest the Sept 2 suicide bombing.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the attack as they had left just a few minutes before.
Press conference
Addressing the media at the Quetta Press Club on Monday evening, PkMAP’s Lala Abdul Rauf, BNP’s Sajid Tareen Advocate, ANP’s Asghar Achakzai, National Party’s Aslam Baloch, Jamaat-e-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar, and PTI’s Dawood Shah Achakzai condemned what they called the government’s attempts to sabotage their strike. They decried baton charge, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests of peaceful protesters and announced a plan to hold more protest rallies.
The leaders announced that protests will be held on Sept 11 in front of press clubs across Balochistan, while a meeting of senior leaders has been scheduled for Sept 13 to finalise the alliance’s future course of action. They warned that if political workers and leaders detained across the province were not released, a tougher line of action would be announced at the Sept 13 meeting.
Former governor Malik Abdul Wali Kakar, Akhtar Hussain Langove, Shafqaat Langove, Jameel Mashwani, Abdul Hameed Mansoori, Mir Ghulam Nabi Marri, Kabir Afghan, and Ismatullah were also present at the press conference.
Behram Baloch, Ali Jan Mangi, and Abdul Wahid Shahwani also contributed

MULTAN: Flood-affected villagers are rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil after the Chenab overflowed following heavy monsoon rains.—AFP

 
• Gilani urges residents to evacuate after decision to breach Shershah dyke ahead of another surge; four drown after boats capsize in Rahim Yar Khan
• Floodwaters not receding as ‘backwater effect’ prevents Chenab from flowing into Indus; high-level alert for Sutlej after advisory from India
• PM Shehbaz forms committee to assess flood damage; official says over 4m people affected by floods
LAHORE: The southern districts of Punjab, particularly Multan, are at risk of severe flooding due to the swollen Chenab River, with the authorities preparing for a breach at the Sher Shah dyke to save the urban centres from inundation.
Although no decision had been taken to breach the Shershah bund at the time of going to press, officials were clear that the dyke would have to be breached if the water level crossed the critical threshold of 393.5 feet. As of Monday night, the water level was steady at 393 feet.
Officials said the flood would approach Multan in the next 48 hours, which would make the situation very critical for the city, which is already at risk of flooding.
Against this backdrop, it seemed that the decision to breach the embankment had already been made anticipating a massive surge heading towards Multan from Trimmu Headworks.
Multan MNA and ex-PM Yousaf Raza Gilani, in a Facebook post, asked people living in settlements along the embankment to relocate immediately. The PPP leader said water would be diverted towards Sher Shah, Gagra Kachhor, Mouza Hamar and other adjacent areas to break the flood force and avoid further damage.
Meanwhile, floodwaters that had entered Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday submerged more localities in the district, including Alipur tehsil. Due to a backwater effect that was preventing the Chenab from falling into the Indus, the water had started flowing upstream of Panjnad.
The water first entered Panjnad Headworks’ downstream settlements Makhan Bela, Azmatpur, Bait Mullanwali, Bait Nabi Shah, Paka Naich, Bazwala, Lati Marri, Bait Burraha, Kundrala, and Bait Channa, and later flooded upstream areas of Ghalwan-I and Dammar Wala Janobi. The authorities relocated thousands of people to save them from flooding.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif constituted a committee led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal for the completion of the damage and need assessment report of the ongoing floods within two weeks.
Flood threat
Addressing a press conference in Multan, Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Jalalpur Pirwala was still facing the flood threat. He said that the first flood was moving out slowly and the water was not receding, while another surge from Head Trimmu was on its way towards Multan. 
He said that the pressure would increase on Head Muhammadwala and the Sher Shah dyke in the next 24 hours. He said 63 people lost their lives and rescue boats had made 27,000 trips in Multan, adding that 4300 villages in 26 districts were affected due to the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab floods.



 
Multan Commissioner Aamir Kareem Khan said 4,000 people were evacuated and shifted to safer places in Jalalpur Pirwala.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said 4.199 million people from 4,300 villages were affected due to the flooding in the eastern rivers. He said that 2.147 million people, who were trapped in the floods, had been relocated to safer locations and 412 relief and 492 medical camps were established in the flood-affected districts.
The commissioner further shared the water situation of different dams, including Mangla Dam was 88 per cent full while Tarbela Dam was 100pc full. According to the commissioner, India’s Bhakra Dam on the River Sutlej was 90pc full, Pong Dam was 99pc full, while Thein Dam was 97pc full.
Earlier, the PDMA released a high-level flood alert for the Sutlej River, following an official advisory from the Indian High Commission regarding the rising water flow. 
According to the alert, the river was experiencing a high flood level at the Harike and Ferozepur downstream points in India, indicating that water levels were expected to rise further within Pakistan. 
Ganda Singh Wala Headworks on the Sutlej would continue to be in an “exceptionally high” flood. Besides riverine floods, Punjab’s urban centres also faced urban flooding. 
Lahore recorded a heavy rainfall in several of its areas, with some localities, including Jail Road, receiving more than 100mm of rain on Monday. Meanwhile, torrential downpour in Faisalabad broke a 30-year record for the city.
Flowing backwards
As of Monday night, the floodwaters were not receding as the Indus River was pushing back the water from the Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi rivers. Due to this backwater effect, the operational capacity of the Panjnad Headworks had also reduced, according to a PDMA official.
Despite a steady flow of over 524,000 cusecs at Panjnad, the water was flowing upstream. Panjnad had recorded a flow of 609,664 cusecs till 12:30am and the water receded to 524,762 cusecs by 3:30 pm.
Just like the Indus, the Chenab is pushing back Ravi waters, a phenomenon that has previously led to a perilous rise in pressure at the Sidhnai Barrage on the Ravi River. 
For the past few days, flows had remained dangerously steady at over 135,000 cusecs despite falling inflows from the upstream Balloki. To avert a catastrophic breach at Sidhnai, the government had to make a breach at the Mai Sufara embankment to save the barrage.
In a second major emergency operation, a controlled breach was made on the Sutlej River near Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday night to divert water towards the Vehari district.
RYK capsize
Three people were killed while at least 8-10 people, mostly children, were missing after a boat capsized in the Chenab floodwater in the Noorwala area of tehsil Liaqatpur.
Reports said that a boat carrying almost 28 people capsized in Mouza Noorwala located in the riverbed area of the Chenab.

Bayrou, who has been in the job for just nine months, had blindsided even his allies by calling a confidence vote to end a lengthy standoff over his austerity budget, which foresees almost 44 billion euros ($52 billion) of cost savings to reduce France’s debt pile.
Bayrou, the first premier in the history of modern France to be ousted in a confidence vote rather than a no-confidence vote, will submit his resignation on Tuesday morning, according to a person close to him who asked not to be named.

President Macron left scrambling to find a successor; country plunged into another political crisis

In the vote in the National Assembly, 364 deputies voted that they had no confidence in the government while just 194 gave it their confidence. “In line with article 50 of the constitution, the prime minister must submit the resignation of his government,” said speaker Yael Braun-Pivet.
Bayrou is the sixth prime minister under Macron since his 2017 election but the fifth since 2022. Bayrou’s ousting leaves the French head of state with a new domestic headache at a time when he is leading diplomatic efforts on the Ukraine war.
But defending his decision to call the high-risk confidence vote, Bayrou told the National Assembly: “The biggest risk was not to take one, to let things continue without anything changing… and have business as usual.”

Invasive surveillance and data-gathering on citizens creates a massive liability because the state must assume all responsibility for the information it collects. There can be extreme consequences in case of failure, and this is precisely what has happened in the latest leak of citizens’ personal data, which not only compromises thousands of ordinary citizens, but government officials and federal ministers as well.
Peel back the headlines, and the questions left are why were such extensive details — including what mobile SIMs they own, what their CNICs look like, their call logs, identity documents, and even their international travel histories — being collected, and who was doing the collecting? More gravely, how did all this data leak into the open? Were those doing the spying also compromised?
The National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency has now formed a special team to investigate the matter on the special directives of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, whose own data is said to be among the caches being sold freely on the web, sometimes for as little as Rs500. The relevant press release issued by his ministry promises that those involved in the data leak will be identified and brought to justice. If, indeed, anyone is caught — and that is a big if — the damage may already be done by the time they are brought to justice, mainly because the government is not in any position to secure the leaked data and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. All of the compiled information is now reportedly just a Google search away from cybercriminals. Therefore, instead of finding scapegoats, the authority would be better served with a bit of self-reflection.
 
 

Investigating how the data leaked will be important, but it would seem much more necessary for the state to ask itself why it needs such expansive surveillance of its own citizens.
Clearly, the premise it works on is that nobody can be trusted; however, as the repeated leaks of sensitive data continue to show, even security agencies cannot be trusted to be fully ‘secure’ themselves.
Secondly, why are our national cybersecurity capabilities so weak that massive breaches of sensitive data continue to occur with such alarming frequency? It may be recalled that, just a few months ago, the National Cyber Emergency Response Team warned that the login credentials and passwords of 180m Pakistanis were exposed online. Last year, it emerged that data on 2.7m citizens had been compromised due to weak cybersecurity controls at Nadra. When even citizens’ fingerprints can be put up for sale, what is safe? And what can the state be trusted with safekeeping?

• Israel’s defence minister asks Hamas to ‘lay down arms’ or ‘face annihilation’
• Netanyahu tells residents of Gaza City to evacuate;  four Israeli soldiers killed
WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was issuing a “last warning” to Hamas, saying the Palestinian group must accept a deal to release Israeli prisoners.
“The Israelis have accepted my terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning,” Donald Trump said on social media.
“We had some very good discussions. Good things could happen,” he told reporters. “I think we’re going to have a deal on Gaza very soon.”
 


Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told residents of Gaza City on Monday to evacuate, and the military said four soldiers were killed in the Gaza Strip when an unidentified person “lobbed an explosive device into their tank”.
In response to Trump’s comments, Hamas said it was ready to “immediately sit at the negotiating table” following “some ideas received from the American side aimed at reaching a ceasefire agreement”.
In exchange for a truce, Hamas said it wanted “a clear declaration of the end of the war, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the formation of a committee of independent Palestinians to manage the Gaza Strip, which would begin its duties immediately”.
Hamas agreed last month to a ceasefire proposal that involved a 60-day truce and staggered prisoner releases.
Israel, however, has demanded that Hamas release all the prisoners at once, disarm itself and relinquish control of Gaza, among other conditions.
In Geneva, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said he was “horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric by senior Israeli officials”.
‘Face annihilation’
Israel’s defence minister warned Hamas on Monday to “lay down your arms” or “face annihilation”.
“This is a final warning to Hamas: release the hostages (prisoners) and put down your weapons or Gaza will be destroyed and you will be annihilated,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said on X
The Israeli minister threatened that “today, a massive hurricane will hit the skies of Gaza City”, where he said the military was “preparing to expand” operations.
 


Israel has stepped up operations, levelling high-rise buildings in Gaza City which it has vowed to capture, despite mounting international pressure to stop the bombardment.
‘Genocidal rhetoric’
The UN rights chief accused Israeli officials of using overt “genocidal rhetoric” about Gaza and called for decisive international action to “end the carnage”.
In a speech to the UN Human Rights Council that was criticised by Israel, Volker Turk said the occupied Palestinian territory was already “a graveyard”.
He stressed that “the region is crying out for peace”.
Turk accused Israel of inflicting indescribable suffering and wholesale destruction.
“I am horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric and the disgraceful dehumanisation of Palestinians by senior Israeli officials.”
“Further militarisation, occupation, annexation and oppression will only feed more violence, retribution and terror,” Volker Turk warned.
He insisted Israel had “a legal obligation to take the steps ordered by the International Court of Justice to prevent acts of genocide, punish incitement to genocide and ensure enough aid reaches Palestinians in Gaza”.
The UN rights chief said the international community was “failing the people of Gaza”.
“Where are the decisive steps to prevent genocide,” he wondered.
Ravina Shamdasani, the spokeswoman for Volker Turk, said “shocking and dehumanising language” has been used by a number of high-level officials, stressing that “this is not a case of one senior official mouthing off”.
Two teens killed in Jenin
The Palestinian health ministry said that the Israeli military killed two teenagers at a refugee camp in Jenin on Monday.
The two victims were named by the ministry as Islam Abdel Aziz Nouh Majarmeh and Muhammad Sari Omar Masqala, both aged 14.
Palestinian official news agency Wafa reported that the two boys were killed after Israeli soldiers “opened fire at a group of civilians who attempted to inspect their houses in the camp and retrieve some of their belongings”.

He was addressing a judicial conference at the apex court, marking the commencement of the new judicial year.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
 
 

“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he said.
The chief justice emphasised, “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised. But no, not now. We are not ready for it. We have to prepare ourselves for that.”
Justices Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Shahid Waheed, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Malik Shahzad Ahmad were among the fellow SC judges seen attending the event. Judges of the high courts were also present.

Judges’ leave
During his speech, CJP Afridi also detailed a number of new policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) introduced to address the structure of discussions on important issues.
Justice Afridi remarked that the chief justice could previously take up any case out of order for an early hearing, but SOPs were now in place to prevent that.
Stating that the court was taking up cases on a “first-come, first-served” basis, the top judge clarified that the court would not hear cases out of their order.
Then, apparently responding to one of the questions raised in Justice Shah’s recent letter on the CJP having powers to grant or refuse judges’ leaves, Justice Afridi said leaves outside of judicial holidays required permission.
“Let’s look at the grant of leave. I made it very clear, during holidays anyone who wants to go anywhere, no issue. But when there is court work, then I said here is the discretion, discretion is the exercise, it is the criteria, you have got everything in writing.”
 
 

Just last month, the SC issued a number of policy decisions taken between Oct 26, 2024 and Aug 12, 2025. One such decision, reflected in a General Standing Order dated July 29, 2025, amended the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997, empowering the CJP to grant or refuse leave, whether within or outside Pakistan, or to revoke or curtail leave already granted to judges of the court.
In his letter, Justice Shah wrote: “In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it.
“Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums.”
Enforced disappearances’ issue given ‘serious attention’
CJP Afridi further observed that the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee, which he heads and includes all the chief justices, had given “serious attention” to the issue of enforced disappearances.
“We sat down and decided on 17 items on which we are to proceed […]
First and foremost was that serious attention was given to enforced disappearances,” the top judge said.
He thanked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan for assuring the judiciary that the government was “seriously considering a mechanism to ensure the production of detained persons”.
 
 

“I thank you for that and I expect that soon, we will have a good news regarding that,” Justice Afridi remarked.
“Number two, to safeguard the dignity of judges, SOPs have also been framed by the high courts to protect the judicial officers from external influence. This is the district judiciary. We have done it; all the district judiciary, all the high courts have framed their rules,” the CJP stated.
SC reforms based on 5 principles
Justice Afridi observed that after assuming the CJP’s office in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
The CJP listed those principles: “To improve service delivery through technology, to improve access and transparency, to strengthen legal and regulatory framework, leverage international and external resources, and to revitalise the attached departments.”
 


Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice. He said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised during six interactive meetings held to discuss the SC’s reforms.
“There are two groups in the lawyers’ community,” the CJP remarked, adding that members from both were included in the consultation process for judicial reforms.
He detailed that a high-powered committee led by Justice Shahid Waheed, which also included Justices Irfan Saadat Khan, Afghan and Abbasi, reviewed suggestions made by the SC “sections”, some judges and lawyers. Those were then placed before an administrative full court meeting on April 17.
Justice Afridi also spoke of the “Public Facilitation Centre” inaugurated today, which will begin its operations on October 1 and will provide “all details” related to cases.
Reiterating the need for speedy disposal of cases, he asserted: “We have always worked for the supremacy of the law.”
Emphasising that rules cannot be made within a single day, the judge urged those having objections to file their recommendations, which would then be taken up by a committee and eventually the full court. “I assure you that whatever your proposals are will be […] taken into consideration,” he affirmed.
‘Reduced security protocols for judges’
During his address, CJP Afridi highlighted that the security provided to him and other judges has been reduced, as well as the protocols when in Islamabad’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings.
“I had nine security contingents as the chief justice. I sat down with the security people and I said ‘I am in the Red Zone, my residence is in the Red Zone, please have a heart’. So we have come down to this that there will only be two security vehicles with me, and same is the case with the worthy judges.”
 
 

He remarked that judges could need security when going outside of Islamabad, but not as much when in the Red Zone.
Continuing his speech, Justice Afridi noted that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had decided on 64 complaints against judges, 72 had been referred to the council’s members, and 65 were pending, which would be considered in the SJC meeting later this month.
AGP Awan, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Mian Rauf Atta also addressed the event.
Separately, CJP Afridi also inaugurated a “Media Station” at the SC, telling mediapersons on the occasion: “You people are necessary for the system because you keep everyone in check. […] Please keep us on check but it should be healthy.”</p><small>2025-09-09 02:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0907434988a4a6f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940647/flood-devastation-prompts-food-inflation-fears' target='_blank'><strong>Flood devastation prompts food inflation fears</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Floods in Punjab, which have submerged more than 1.3 million acres of farmland along the eastern rivers, have caused significant damage to the Kharif crops, particularly cotton, prompting fears of food inflation.
Floods have displaced two million people, submerged 2,000 villages, and led to the relocation of 760,000 residents and 516,000 heads of cattle from the affected areas.
The satellite imagery of 24 Punjab districts in the command areas of the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers shows that arou­nd 3,661 square kilometres, or 4.7 per cent of the total area, remained under floodwaters.
The floods have devastated key crops, including rice, sugarcane, corn, vegetables, and cotton. According to the Pakistan Business Forum, approximately 35pc of the cotton crop in central and southern Punjab has been destroyed, with losses reaching as high as 40-50pc in Bahawalnagar, the province’s largest cotton-producing district.

Kissan Board leader claims losses to tune of Rs500bn; over 1.3m acres of farmland submerged

Akhtar Farooq Meo of the Kissan Board Pakistan claimed that farmers sustained losses to the tune of Rs536 billion due to damage to the cotton, rice, sesame, maize, and fodder crops. Mr Meo claimed that many towns were facing shortages of perishable items and the situation could transform into a food crisis.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports about damage to the rice crop. The Pakistan Business Forum claimed that 60pc of the rice crop in central and southern Punjab had been destroyed — a claim contested by the exporters.
They said the Basmati crop region, with the exception of Pasrur in Sialkot, remained largely undamaged, adding that the non-Basmati crop, particularly along the Sutlej River, had already been harvested in late July and early August, with only hybrid varieties in some areas sustaining damage.
 
 

However, floods created a severe shortage of fodder, threatening the livestock industry, which was a major contributor to the national GDP.
Meanwhile, experts feared a sharp rise in domestic grain prices that could make Pakistani rice uncompetitive on the global market. Similarly, the loss of the cotton crop was also alarming for the textile industry, accounting for over half of Pakistan’s export revenues.
Ihsanul Haq, the chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said the crop was under severe stress.
Major cotton-producing regions in Punjab and Sindh, including Bahawalnagar, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan, were either currently submerged or were bracing for more heavy rainfall. The reduced supply of raw cotton reportedly forced several ginning factories and mills to cease operations. Furthermore, there were early reports of a virus affecting various cotton varieties, which could further reduce per-acre yields.

This is despite the fact that Pakistan officially suffers a severe natural gas and LNG supply glut, compelling the government to seek postponement of more than 170 LNG import cargos and SNGPL forcing local gas producers to shut down their fields or scale down production.
This causes substantial losses, not only to local producers like state-owned OGDCL, listed at the London Stock Exchange, but also erodes the country’s foreign exchange and forces consumers to pay high fixed charges for gas they receive for only a few hours a day.
And yet, while the political leadership remains engaged in firefighting, officials in the Centre and SNGPL —  along with its board of directors, businessmen and other stakeholders concerned with investment facilitation — try to navigate their interests and arguments .

Move aimed at providing ‘level playing field’ for public and private sector gas suppliers

None of the parties involved Dawn contacted — the petroleum division, the SNGPL management and the private entities — chose to speak on the record, rather passed the buck onto other parties.
At the same time, SNGPL has instructed local gas fields which produce cheaper gas, to shut down or reduce output to absorb expensive LNG purchased under binding international contracts. More than 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of local gas production has been curtailed.
Unannounced rationing
While producers are forced to limit supply, SNGPL has begun unannounced rationing for residential and commercial customers, providing gas for only two to three hours during breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This follows a government decision to double fixed monthly charges effective July 1, 2025. Consequently, gas consumption of around Rs450 now results in a total bill near Rs 2,500, after fixed charges and taxes are added.
The production cuts have created cash flow problems for local producers like OGDCL, GHPL and others including a few in the private sector, hampering their domestic and international exploration activities.
The country’s largest producer, OGDCL, has publicly deplored the situation.
“The less gas intake by SNGPL from Qadirpur, Nashpa, Chanda, Dhok Hussain, Mela, Bettani, Pirkoh, Togh and Loti fields and TAL owing to SNGPL system constraints and by UPL from Uch fields due to less demand from power purchaser adversely impacted daily net production by 1,148 barrels of crude oil, 76 MMcf of gas and 55 tons of LPG,” the company stated in a report to its board of directors a few months ago.
“During the nine months ending March 31, 2025, OGDCL registered Sales Revenue of Rs 310.907 billion (against Rs348.164 billion of same period of previous year),” the report added. “The Company’s Sales declined primarily due to forced production curtailment accompanied with reduction in average basket price of crude oil.”
With the energy sector’s circular debt exceeding Rs4.6 trillion, the government had allowed local producers to sell some of their gas to third parties to improve their cash flow.
Under such arrangement, some producers like MOL-Pakistan and Petroleum Exploration Limited were allowed by petroleum division to sell their output from Razgir and Zahra North field and some others to third parties.
However, SNGPL resisted an arrangement for the Razgir field, arguing it created “a market distortion”.
The company noted that a Rs791 per unit captive levy, imposed on its industrial customers under IMF instru­ctions, did not apply to third-party suppliers, prompting its customers to switch to cheaper private gas.
Despite this resistance, SNGPL’s board of directors approved the pipeline capacity allocation for the Razgir gas to a third party. While SNGPL management later denied any such approval, records seen by Dawn indicate that at least nine of the 11 board members signed the decision.
In response to the infighting, the Ministry of Law has now ruled the captive power levy applies to all consumers of LNG or local gas, whether supplied by public or private entities.
To resolve the issue, the ministry ruled that while the sale of gas from producers to suppliers is deregulated, the subsequent sale from suppliers to CPPs is not.
The ministry determined that the price has to be determined by Ogra under section 8(6), read with sections 43A and 43B of the Ogra Ordinance for the purpose of collection of levy under the Levy Act of 2025.

According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), remittance inflows in the first two months of FY26 rose by 7pc, dispelling fears that a reduction in incentives would lead to a decline in remittances.
In August, remittances totalled $3.137 billion, showing a 6.6pc year-on-year increase. However, the monthly inflows saw a slight decline of 2.4pc compared to July, when they were $3.214bn.
While the growth in the first two months of FY26 is positive, it pales in comparison to the remarkable growth witnessed during the same period last fiscal year. Remittances surged by 44pc in 2MFY25 compared to FY24. This extraordinary growth contributed to a record annual total of $38.3bn, which helped maintain exchange rate stability and allowed the SBP to increase its foreign reserves by $7.8bn, reaching $14.5bn.
The government does not expect remittance growth to match the record levels of FY25 but remains hopeful that total inflows will reach around $40bn in FY26.

Inflows rose 6.6pc to $3.13bn in Aug

Despite these expectations, remittances from regions outside the Middle East have shown a decline. Inflows from major destinations like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and GCC countries accounted for about 55pc of total remittance inflows during July-August FY26.
The inflows from Saudi Arabia amounted to $1.56bn, reflecting a modest growth of just 6pc, compared to a 50.7pc increase during the same period last year. Remittances from the UAE grew by 13.8pc, down significantly from the 84.3pc growth recorded in the first two months of FY25, totalling $1.308bn.
 
 

In contrast, inflows from other GCC countries reached $600 million, showing a growth of 5.3pc.
Meanwhile, remittances from the UK and USA showed a decline, with the former down by 0.5pc to $913.7 million, and the latter down by 13.7pc to $537 million. On a positive note, remittances from the European Union (EU) continued to grow, increasing by 18pc to reach $857 million in the first two months of FY26.Financial experts emphasise the need for remittances to remain strong throughout FY26 to maintain a current account surplus and preserve the stability of the exchange rate.

Speaking at an open kachehry in the Bhekar area of Dera Bugti district, he urged political stakeholders to move beyond “non-issues” and focus on the real challenges hindering development.
The event drew a large turnout of citizens and members of the provincial assembly, offering a rare platform for direct public engagement.
CM Bugti listened attentively to public grievances and issued immediate directives to officials, reaffirming his administration’s commitment to swift and practical solutions.

Urges political stakeholders to move beyond ‘non-issues’ and focus on real development challenges

The chief minister described terrorism as a “cancer” that has deeply affected all segments of society. He commended the sacrifices made by the people of Dera Bugti in their pursuit of peace and national unity, emphasising that the integrity of the state must be upheld at all costs.
He warned against the practice of linking everyday societal issues with state responsibilities, stressing that such narratives undermine national cohesion.
“The government’s doors are open to all,” he assured, highlighting his commitment to inclusive and responsive governance.
While affirming the public’s right to peaceful protest, the chief minister condemned disruptive actions such as road blockades, warning that coercion and violence will not be tolerated. He called for responsible civic engagement that respects public convenience and national dignity.
To enhance service delivery at the grassroots level, CM Bugti directed local government representatives to adopt a more proactive approach. He reiterated the provincial government’s commitment to providing development funds to local bodies, contingent upon transparency and alignment with national values.

CJP Afridi shared council’s performa­n­­ce during the last judicial year while add­r­e­­ssing a conference marking the new judicial year here at the  Supreme Court auditorium on Monday. All the 24 judges of the Su­­preme Court were present at the ceremony.
Comparing the previous years’ SJC performance, the chief justice said the council did not dispose of a single complaint in 2021-22. It decided 21 cases in 2022–23, 53 in 2023–24 and nearly 70 cases in 2024-25, he said, claiming that the institutional strengthening was also prioritised during the past one year.
He said the Supreme Court had plans to use artificial intelligence to categorise cases for fixation, but the judiciary would have to prepare itself for technology use. Under a project, which would be completed within six months, 61,000 files would be digitally screened, he explained.
“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he added, according to a Dawn.com report.

Justice Afridi says judiciary needs to get ready as SC plans to use AI to categorise cases for listing

Referring to the contentious issue of leave on part of judges, the CJP said he had made it very clear that during vacation, any judge could opt for holidays, but during the court work, the discretion to approve a request for leave of absence or reject it vests with CJP.
During the past year, he said, the SJC secretariat was relocated to a newly established office within the SC building, equipped with modern facilities and designed for future expansion. As the finance division approved its budget, its financial independence was secured, he said, adding that its secretary was designated as principal accounting officer.
In a year, the overall pendency of cases was brought down from 60,635 to 56,943 cases, he said. The backlog could have been reduced further, if several judges had not been engaged in larger constitutional benches, which demanded extended hearings, he added. This decline is not only statistically significant but also a meaningful step towards improving efficiency of the system, he said.
 
 

However, at the same time, data revealed that the number of adjournments sought by advocates rose sharply in 2024–25 to 56,449 compared to 22,425 in the previous year.
“I must remind you all that the Bar play an important role in advancing justice, and I urge them to help curb the growing tendency of adjournments, so that the hard-won reduction in pendency may not only be sustained but further strengthened,” the CJP said.
The conference also featured three symbolic inaugurations reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to accessibility, inclusivity, and shared responsibility, with public facilitation centre being inaugurated by litigant Basharat Javed, SC media platform by SC press association president Zulqarnain Iqbal, and Supreme Court bar cafeteria by SCBA president Mian Muhammad Rauf Atta.
The conference was also addressed by Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, who emphasised that the SC should refrain from political cases since it makes the top court controversial, whereas Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) vice chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nas­rullah Warriach cautioned the judges to stay away from what he called a mob mentality and never yield to popular opinions.
SCBA President Rauf Atta had earlier ex­­pressed concern that despite increase in the strength of judges after the 26th Amen­d­ment, the pendency of cases did not reduce.

The disaster could now trigger one of the country’s largest internal migrations since the devastating 2010 floods, aid agencies and local experts warn.
“Migration has already started in several areas as unprecedented rains and floods have left nothing behind for millions of people,” Shaukat Ali Chadhar, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Agriculture, told Anadolu.
Chadhar said the ongoing deluges have already affected around 10m people dependent on agriculture across the country, mainly in Punjab.
“A multi-pronged combination of rains and floods has affected the farmers in many ways, destroying stored and standing crops, agricultural lands and livestock,” he explained, saying it could take up to 18 months for the land to become cultivable again.
“This gloomy scenario has left no choice for them but to migrate to the big cities to make a living,” Chadhar said, warning that as many as one million migrants could make the move.
Climate disaster compounded by human factors
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned last Friday that Pakistan was facing one of its worst monsoon seasons in recent memory.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 922 people have been killed and 1,047 injured since late June, while more than 10,000 homes have been partially or completely destroyed, mainly in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In late August, India — also battered by heavy rains — opened the gates of major dams on rivers shared under the Indus Waters Treaty, cautioning Pakistan that the releases could swell downstream floods. The added discharges pushed Punjab’s water levels even higher.
For the first time in the country’s 78-year history, three eastern rivers — the Sutlej, Jhelum and Chenab — are simultaneously at “exceptionally” high flood levels, according to local authorities.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, sudden glacial lake outburst floods added another layer of devastation, tearing through remote valleys and destroying homes, water systems and power lines. These floods occur when rains or rising temperatures cause mountain lakes to burst, releasing torrents of water and debris with little warning.
The UN says climate change is accelerating glacial melt across the Himalaya and Hindu Kush ranges, creating more unstable lakes and heightening the risk of such disasters.
“Unpredictable and intense weather patterns, shrinking agriculture, sea erosion, unemployment, and lingering dry spells have caused widespread migration within Pakistan in the past decade,” Hafiz Wasi Mohammad Khan, a member of the Punjab Agriculture Research Board, told Anadolu.
“We fear that this process would be further accelerated by the latest floods.”
He estimated that although temporary migration will be higher, around 25 per cent of the displaced people may never be able to return to their homes.
Earlier this year, the Climate Risk Index ranked Pakistan as the country most affected by climate change in 2022.
Experts also point to human-driven vulnerabilities such as unchecked land grabs and illegal constructions along natural drainage paths, which the government has vowed to address.
“Pakistan stands where it was in 2010 in terms of handling floods,” Khan said. “I suspect we will be discussing the same situation next year.”
Government planning ‘massive rehabilitation package’
In 2010, more than 2m people were displaced by floods that inundated one-fifth of the country. Of those, 70pc permanently settled in big cities because of the destruction of their homes and farmlands, according to the climate change ministry.
Khan warned that another wave of mass migration to already-overcrowded cities would not only add to their strained infrastructure but also fuel crime and deepen poverty.
“An enormous challenge is ahead in terms of rehabilitation and food security. The affected families have lost everything — their homes, lands, livestock and piled up stocks,” he said, adding that farmers urgently need cash inputs to procure seeds and other agricultural supplies.
He noted that many communities, especially downstream, have learned from recurring floods over the past two decades. In some cases, they even view them as opportunities, as floods can regenerate land and replenish underground water levels.
Chadhar called for the establishment of a “special agriculture fund” to help farmers, in addition to writing off their loans and utility bills, saying the government cannot handle the challenge of rehabilitation alone.
Meanwhile, Farid Abdulkadir Aiywar, IFRC head of delegation for Pakistan, urged the international community not to overlook the unfolding tragedy that is “quietly but relentlessly” devastating communities across the country.
“The crisis is far from over,” he told reporters on Friday. “Entire communities remain underwater, families have lost everything, and access to safe water and health care is becoming more urgent by the day.”
Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, however, downplayed the chances of a large migration toward urban centres.
“This time, there will be no mass migration by [flood-affected people] as the government is set to announce a massive rehabilitation package for them, which will cover everything — from their crops and land losses to home destruction,” Kathia told Anadolu.</p><small>2025-09-08 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08230118eabd783.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940536/pindi-police-book-aleema-khan-naeem-panjutha-others-for-violence-against-journalist-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi police book Aleema Khan, Naeem Panjutha, others for violence against journalist outside Adiala Jail</strong></a><br><p>The Rawalpindi Police on Monday booked PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and others for violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail.
A first information report (FIR) was filed at the Saddar Bairooni Police Station today on the complaint of Supreme Court Press Association President Tayyab Baloch under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 382 (theft after preparation made causing death, hurt or restraint in order to committing of the theft), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Baloch said that he was present outside Adiala Jail at around 3:55pm for reporting with other journalists when Aleema and other people began a media talk after a hearing for the Toshakhana case.
“During this time, a person named Naeem Panjutha called out: ‘Teach him a lesson for questioning Aleema about properties,’” Baloch said, adding that 35-40 people there grabbed him at that, laid him down and began beating him.
“During this time, some unknown person snatched my mobile phone from me and also broke my microphone,” he said, adding that other reporters there who tried to rescue him were also beaten up.
“We barely escaped them after much pleading. The reason is that I had previously asked Aleema Khan about purchasing properties in America as a journalist, which made her uncomfortable. On which, Aleema Khan, through his workers, first posted pictures of me … [and others] on social media and spread rumours against us. Today, as per the pre-arranged plan, they attacked me, beat me up, forcibly snatched my mobile and threatened to kill me, along with breaking my microphone.”
He requested legal proceedings against Aleema, Panjutha and the other suspects.
In reponse, Panjutha termed the FIR a “fake case” against him and Aleema.
 






Slamming the incident, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Baloch was targeted with violence “solely and only because of a difference of opinion, which is unacceptable”.
He said strict action would be taken and vowed to give his full support.
 






PPP leaders such as Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also condemned the incident.
Karachi Press Club President Fazil Jamili said the incident was both “unfortunate and condemnable”. He added that “this new trend will not end unless political parties actively discourage it. We must remember that politics and journalism rise & fall together.”

Jean Carroll, whom he was found to have sexually assaulted.
The January 2024 order consisted of $65m in punitive damages after the jury found Trump acted maliciously in his many public comments about Carroll, $7.3m in compensatory damages and $11m to pay for an online campaign to repair Carroll’s reputation.
The civil order, which prompted an audible gasp in the federal court, far exceeded the more than $10m in damages for defamation that Carroll had sought.
Trump — whom a jury found liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a separate federal civil case in New York — used his Truth Social platform at the time to fire off a spate of insulting messages attacking Carroll, the trial and the judge, whom he called “an extremely abusive individual”.
‘Substantial financial penalty’
“We hold that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury’s duly rendered damages awards were reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts of this case,” the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote.
Carroll, 81, alleged that Trump defamed her in 2019, when she first made her assault allegations public, by saying she “is not my type”.
Jurors were shown Trump’s October 2022 deposition during which he confused a picture of Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples, which threatened to cast doubt on his claim Carroll was not his “type”.
In 2023, another federal jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and subsequently defaming her in 2022, when he called her a “complete con job”.
“We agree with the district court that the jury was entitled to find that Trump would not stop defaming Carroll unless he was subjected to a substantial financial penalty,” the appeals court ruled today.
Trump was not required to attend the trial or to testify. However, he used the case to generate heated media coverage and to fuel his claims of being victimised as he campaigned for a return to the White House.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0816522395aa5b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940498/in-letter-to-cjp-4-judges-term-sc-full-court-meeting-stamp-of-approval-for-already-decided-rules' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to CJP, 4 judges term SC full court meeting ‘stamp of approval’ for ‘already decided’ rules</strong></a><br><p>In yet another letter highlighting the rift within the judiciary, four Supreme Court (SC) judges expressed their reservations on Monday regarding the process being adopted for the review and approval of Supreme Court Rules 2025.
They dubbed the full court meeting, which was called for this purpose today, a mere “stamp of approval” for the rules, which they said were already decided and unilaterally approved.
The letter addressed to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was sent by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Athar Minallah. The four judges also skipped the full court meeting held later today.
They pointed out that “if the full court was not deemed necessary for the adoption of the rules themselves, how can it now be summoned to deliberate upon their amendment?”
The judges said the working paper for the meeting’s agenda stated that under Rule 1(4) of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, the CJP may “remove any difficulty in giving effect to the said rules” on the recommendations of a committee that was constituted by him and had already been formed.
Moreover, “the chief justice, through a letter dated August 12, 2025, informed the judges that the rules had already been approved through circulation and duly notified in the Gazette on August 9, 2025,” the judges highlighted.
Yet, they further stated, the CJP had sought suggestions “for further amendments” to the rules.
Calling into question the legality of the rules themselves, the judges noted that the “present Supreme Court rules were never placed before, nor approved by, the full court.”
Citing Article 191 of the Constitution, they said the SC had the “power to make rules regulating its practice and procedure, but this power is exercised collectively by the court as an institution”.
The judges concluded that any rules established “without deliberation and approval of the full court” lacked its approval and could not acquire “binding legal status”.
They were of the opinion that the rules, in their present form, “suffer from both substantive and procedural illegality”. In this connection, they expressed reservations that rules were processed through circulation.
“Circulation is an administrative convenience to deal with routine or minor procedural matters; it is not, and cannot be, the vehicle for laying down the constitutional architecture of this court’s governance.
“Unless the full court had itself had expressly resolved to adopt circulation for this purpose, the chief justice alone could not unilaterally resort to it.”
Further highlighting confusion around the matter, the judges said that the working paper for the meeting invoked “Rule 1(R) regarding removal of difficulties” during the process, despite there being no need to invoke the provision.
The judges deliberated that the provision was invoked only “to defend or justify the unilateral process already undertaken”.
“Instead of clarifying the legitimacy of the rules, this only exposes their infirmity: if no difficulty exists, why place such a point before the full court?” they asked.
The four SC judges termed the purpose behind the move “puzzling and fallacious”. The judges, in their letter, questioned why a full court was convened if the rules had already been notified as “approved” on August 9.
Within three days, on August 12, CJP “sought suggestions for amendment [to] the same rules”, the judges said.
They went on to add that “this sequence tacitly acknowledges that the full court is the correct forum for such deliberation,” but noted that it was only undertaken after the “fait accompli of unilateral approval”.
“This amounts to putting the cart before the horse-first declaring the Rules valid, and then calling the full court merely to consider patchwork amendments,” they added.
On that note, the judges regretted that the “meeting is being used to give a veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process,” and aimed to reduce the role of a full court to only “cosmetic”.
The forum was being used to ratify “what has already been done rather than discharging its true constitutional function under Article 191,” the judges claimed.
The judges recommended that the constitutional course of action would have been to “place the rules in their entirety, before the full court, permit genuine discussion and deliberation, and only thereafter seek formal approval.”
Calling for the abandonment of the meeting, the judges said that it was “designed to merely serve as a stamp of approval” and to proceed with it would be equal to reducing the “full court to an afterthought — convened not for decision-making but for damage control.”
The judges noted that such a move “undermines the collective authority of this court”.
Citing the above reservations, the four judges refused to attend the full court, unless a constitutional course of action is adopted, stating that, “we see no point in attending a meeting that is premised on amending rules which, in our respectful view, already suffer from illegality both in substance and in process.”
The letter further called for the objection to be presented in the minutes of the full court meeting and for the meeting to be made public.
“People are entitled to know how rules governing the internal life of the court came to be notified without discussion or deliberation amongst its judges,” the letter added, calling the meeting a ploy to “cloak” the whole process in a “semblance of legitimacy”.
“By opening our deliberations to the gaze of the people we serve, we reinforce the trust without which no constitutional court can function,” the letter concluded.
Last week, Justice Shah, in a separate letter to the CJP, had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was “approved by circulation”, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
In March, a committee constituted by CJP Afridi was tasked to conduct a thorough review of the Supreme Court Rules of 1980, and formulated a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The aim was to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings.
However, when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while the legal fraternity also expressed reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Afridi convened a full court meeting on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
Full court meeting
Later in the day, the full court meeting was held without the participation of the four judges.
A press release from the Supreme Court said CJP Afridi welcomed the participants and commended the efforts of the committee constituted to review the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. He appreciated the committee’s “exhaustive work”, undertaken with input from fellow judges and the legal fraternity, resulting in a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The chief justice briefed the full court on the rules, the press release said, adding that after detailed deliberations on various provisions, the meeting’s participants unanimously agreed that the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, were a “living document” and should be subject to ongoing review and amendment as required from time to time.
“The full court, after considering various aspects and deliberating upon some of the critical provisions, unanimously decided to postpone the implementation of amendments to the extent of enhancement of court fees and securities for the time being. The committee shall consider the suggestions from honourable judges, the bar representatives or other stakeholders in this regard for placement before the full court for decision in light of the committee’s recommendations.
“The honourable chief justice termed this development a significant milestone, reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to strengthening institutional frameworks and ensuring that the Supreme Court Rules remain dynamic, responsive and in line with contemporary needs,” the press release said.

The city is bracing for heavy rainfall over the coming days as strong monsoon currents penetrate Sindh as the PMD had said a day ago that a deep depression was expected to enter the southeastern parts of the province from India today.
While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD had highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
According to rainfall figures from the PMD as of 5pm today, University Road received the most rain with 8.8 millimetres, followed by Gulshan-i-Maymar (8mm), Gulshan-i-Hadeed (7mm), Airport Old Area (6.6mm), Saadi Town (4.3mm), Korangi (4mm), PAF Faisal Base 3mm), Jinnah Terminal (2.8mm), Nazimabad (1.5mm), North Karachi (1.2mm) and Keamari (1mm).
In a message on X at 4:12pm, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said it had begun to rain again and urged people to avoid unnecessary movement.
 






He also held a meeting with senior Karachi officials regarding rain preparations, saying they agreed on alternate routes and traffic diversions in case of any eventuality.
 






The Provincial Disaster Management Authority was directed to remain in the field with dewatering machines, pumps, and other necessary equipment to ensure the timely drainage of rainwater.
The PDMA director general informed the meeting’s members that 16 dewatering pumps were already installed at various choke points across the city.
He also said that rescue kits would be provided to field officers to enable immediate assistance to citizens and Rescue 1122 teams were put on high alert to respond promptly in case of emergencies and to carry out rescue operations with machinery to be deployed at key points, while the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation would establish special camps to provide guidance and support to citizens.
Wahab was told that the cleaning of storm drains and choke points was expedited and union council chairmen were directed to ensure drainage of rainwater from inner streets during the rain spell.
The members also decided that control rooms would be established at the Commissioner’s Office and Police Office to ensure close coordination among all institutions.
K-Electric officials assured the meeting’s members that special control points were already set up to ensure an uninterrupted power supply during the rains.
Sindh Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah stressed that all institutions must work in close coordination with a joint strategy to ensure smooth traffic management, effective drainage, and maximum facilitation for the people of Karachi during the upcoming rains.
On the order of the Sindh CM, the chief secretary conducted a review of the city’s preparedness for ongoing and expected rainfall.
According to a spokesperson, all deputy commissioners are on high alert along with their teams to manage any emergency situation.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi has issued instructions to ensure smooth traffic flow throughout the city, while the DIG Traffic made a tour of various areas to oversee and implement traffic control measures.
“The district administration and municipal bodies are actively working to provide maximum public convenience,” the commissioner said.
A control room has been established at the Commissioner’s Office to continuously monitor the situation in the city and coordinate a timely response where needed.
The Karachi Traffic Police have issued an advisory urging residents to avoid low-lying areas and use designated alternate routes to stay safe.
In District Central, key roads like Powerhouse Chowrangi to Nagan Chowrangi are prone to waterlogging, the advisory read.
Commuters were advised to use diversions via Shafiq Mor, Godhra, and New Karachi. Those heading to North Nazimabad Blocks N, H, I can take routes through Imtiaz Store, Mujahid Colony, and Peoples Chowrangi.
“On Sharea Faisal and in District East, areas such as Nursery, Baloch Colony, Karsaz, and Drigh Road Underpass are expected to be heavily affected,” the advisory read.
Travellers going to and from Jinnah International Airport were asked to use alternative routes via Tariq Road, Stadium Road, Johar Chowrangi, and Shahrah-e-Bhutto.
 






Last month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08180943e1337ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940515/us-metals-company-signs-500m-mou-with-pakistan-on-critical-minerals' target='_blank'><strong>US metals company signs $500m MoU with Pakistan on critical minerals</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth $500 million with an American metals company, the US Strategic Metals (USSM), it emerged on Monday.
The USSM, based in the state of Missouri, is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the United States Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
The USSM is a company that specialises in extracting critical metals from old lithium-ion batteries and mining cobalt, nickel and copper, according to its website. According to the American embassy, the US Department of Energy has defined critical minerals as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
A press release from the US Embassy, published on Sunday, stated that Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Zach Harkenrider accompanied a USSM-led delegation to sign an MoU with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) at the Prime Minister’s House.
Speaking about the MoU signing, US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said, “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”
 






Speaking about the importance of such bilateral agreements, Baker said that US President Donald Trump’s administration has made forging such deals a key priority, based on the importance of critical mineral resources to American security and prosperity.
“We look forward to seeing future agreements between US companies and their counterparts in the critical minerals and mining sector in Pakistan.”
A statement from the PM House said that the USSM delegation is visiting  Pakistan to explore opportunities for expanding the country’s mining operations and assessing the potential for value addition in mineral resources and the development of supporting infrastructure.
“[The] delegation held high-level meetings with [the] prime minister of Pakistan, chief of army staff, minister of petroleum and minister of commerce and were briefed on Pakistan’s vast mineral reserves, including copper, gold, and rare earth elements,” the statement read.
“In this context, two Memoranda of Understanding, focusing on [the] development and processing of critical minerals, including rare earth elements (REEs), and logistics services, were signed.”
The second MoU was signed between the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a global leader in engineering and construction.
“The current survey of opportunities in Pakistan aims to identify priority markets where Mota-Engil can align with government visions and private sector initiatives. The group seeks to build long-term partnerships that leverage its global know-how while creating value locally through job creation, technology transfer, and sustainable development.”
According to the statement, the partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten and REEs.
“The first phase of this deal is envisaged at approximately $500m of investments into Pakistans critical minerals sector,” the statement read.
 






Pakistan’s relations with the US have been improving, with both nations recently signing trade deals. Islamabad successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29 per cent to 19pc — after the two nations concluded a trade deal in July.
This was after Trump announced that the US had concluded a deal with Islamabad that would allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
In April this year, a senior US official had underscored Washington’s strategic interest in Pakistan’s mineral sector, signalling a push for long-term cooperation in the development of critical mineral resources key to American advanced technologies.
“Critical minerals are the raw materials necessary for our most advanced technologies,” Eric Meyer, senior bureau official for the Department of State’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, was quoted in a statement issued by the US embassy in Islamabad on his visit.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08193725df04fed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940524/19-killed-in-nepal-in-gen-z-protest-over-social-media-ban' target='_blank'><strong>19 killed in Nepal in ‘Gen Z’ protest over social media ban</strong></a><br><p>Unrest killed at least 19 people in Nepal on Monday, authorities said, as police in the capital fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to storm parliament in anger at a social media shutdown and corruption.
Some of the mainly youth protesters forced their way into the parliament complex in Kathmandu by breaking through a barricade, a local official said, setting fire to an ambulance and hurling objects at lines of riot police guarding the legislature.
“The police have been firing indiscriminately,” one protester told the ANI news agency.
“[They] fired bullets which missed me but hit a friend who was standing behind me. He was hit in the hand.”
More than 100 people, including 28 police personnel, were receiving medical treatment for their injuries, police officer Shekhar Khanal told Reuters. Protesters were ferrying the injured to the hospital on motorcycles.
Another two people were killed when protests in the eastern city of Itahari turned violent, police said.
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the unrest, which erupted after thousands of young people, including many wearing their school or college uniforms, took to the streets earlier today.
Many carried flags and placards with slogans such as “Shut down corruption and not social media”, “Unban social media” and “Youths against corruption”, as they marched through Kathmandu.
Organisers of the protests, which spread to other cities in the Himalayan country, have called them “demonstrations by Gen Z”. They say the protests reflect young people’s widespread frustration with government action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.
“This is the protest by the new generation in Nepal,” another protester told ANI.
A government decision to block access to several social media platforms, including Facebook, last week has fuelled anger among the young. About 90 per cent of Nepal’s 30 million people use the internet.
Officials said they imposed the ban because platforms had failed to register with authorities in a crackdown on misuse, including false social media accounts used to spread hate speech and fake news, and commit fraud.
Batons and rubber bullets
Police had orders to use water cannons, batons and rubber bullets to control the crowd and the army was deployed in the parliament area to bolster law enforcement officers, Muktiram Rijal, a spokesperson for the Kathmandu district office, told Reuters.
He said the curfew, which will remain in force until 10pm local time (1615 GMT), had been extended to Kathmandu’s Singha Durbar area, which includes the prime minister’s office and other government buildings.
Violence abated later in the evening, although protesters remained in the area outside parliament.
Police said similar protests were also held in Biratnagar and Bharatpur in the southern plains and in Pokhara in western Nepal.
Many people in Nepal think corruption is rampant, and the Oli government has been criticised by opponents for failing to deliver on its promises to tackle graft or make progress to address longstanding economic issues.
Thousands of young Nepalis go abroad every year for work and education.
Rameshwore Khanal, a former finance secretary, said that although job creation is not up to expectations, popular anger appears to stem more from unhappiness with government appointments and its inability to stamp out corruption.
Nepal’s social media shutdown comes as governments worldwide take steps to tighten oversight of social media and big tech due to growing concern about issues such as misinformation, data privacy, online harm and national security.
Critics say many of these measures risk stifling free expression, but regulators say stricter controls are needed to protect users and preserve social order.</p><small>2025-09-08 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/081915251d306c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940520/sri-lanka-to-play-bilateral-odi-series-in-pakistan-after-six-years-pcb' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka to play bilateral ODI series in Pakistan after six years: PCB</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to host Sri Lanka for a series of one day international (ODI) matches in Rawalpindi from Novermber 11-15, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday.
A day earlier, the PCB announced that it was set to host Sri Lanka and Afghanistan for a T20 International (T20I) tri-series for the first time from November 17 to 29 in Lahore and Rawalpindi.
In a press release, the PCB noted that this would be Sri Lanka’s first bilateral ODI series in Pakistan since 2019, when they last visited for a three-match series that the Green Shirts won 2-0, with the first ODI in Karachi abandoned due to rain.
“Sri Lanka’s most recent visit to Pakistan came in 2023, when they participated in the ACC Asia Cup and played against Afghanistan in Lahore,” the press release read.
 






The PCB reiterated that the nation’s maiden tri-series will be held after the ODI matches, while the Green Shirts will host two ICC World Test Championship matches and six white-ball games against South Africa from October 12 to November 8.
International cricket had dried up in Pakistan following a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore. Consequently, the Green Shirts were forced to play international matches at neutral venues such as the United Arab Emirates.
In 2017, international cricket began gradually returning to Pakistan with the Green Shirts playing against the ICC World XI in a series of three T20 internationals.
Earlier this year, the country hosted the ICC Champions Trophy in February and March, though India played their matches in Dubai. It was the first time that Pakistan hosted an ICC event after 1996.</p><small>2025-09-08 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0817002478f38bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940501/quetta-police-arrest-over-100-protesters-for-violating-section-144-shutting-shops-and-highways' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta police arrest ‘over 100’ protesters for violating Section 144, shutting shops and highways</strong></a><br><p>The Quetta police arrested more than 100 protesters for violating a ban on gatherings, allegedly forcefully shutting down markets and blocking highways, an officer said on Monday.
“More than 100 people were arrested under charges of violating Section 144, forcefully shutting down markets and blocking highways,” Quetta Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Muhammad Baloch told Dawn.com.
The arrests come as six opposition political parties announced a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across Balochistan today to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) on Sept 2 and claimed 15 lives.
Police in Quetta fired tear gas to disperse protesters and arrested them, AFP reported. AFP pictures showed people blocking roads by placing stones, which they were also pelting, and burning objects.
At 12pm, the National Highways and Motorways Police said the N-25 highway near Baleli Custom in Quetta was closed due to a “public protest”.
 






Parts of the N-25 highway, which extends from Karachi to Quetta, were also blocked near Hub and Mastung’s Sona Khan area, the motorway police said in the morning.
 






 






The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance — which the PTI, PkMAP and BNP-M are a part of — shared purported pictures on its X account of closed shops in Awaran.
 






In another post, it claimed that the Western Bypass in Quetta was “completely shut”. “Violence and shelling by the police on PTI workers. The workers are continuing to resist the police shelling,” it added.
 






The opposition parties had declared that highways, intercity roads and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked during the strike. Other airports in the province would also be shut, they added, urging the business community and transporters to support the strike.
The Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, had announced the closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing. The Private Schools Association also declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.
 
 

Last night, the Balochistan government warned protesters of “strict and immediate action” if they tried to disrupt law and order, or block roads and highways.
Fifteen people lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and BNP founder.
Subsequently, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Mah­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of the PTI, Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), had announced the strike at a joint press conference.
Mengal, calling the stadium bombing a “painful and tragic act”, had criticised the state for not fulfilling its “duty” to protect the gathering. Mengal, Achakzai, former NP senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai had remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.</p><small>2025-09-08 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08171109a789210.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940510/emirati-naval-chief-awarded-nishan-e-imtiaz-by-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Emirati naval chief awarded Nishan-e-Imtiaz by President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>Commander of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Naval Forces, Major General Humaid Abdulla Alremeithi, was on Monday awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military) by President Asif Ali Zardari at a special investiture ceremony at the Presidency.
A press release from the President’s Secretariat quoted Zardari as saying that the award was “in recognition of his outstanding services and contributions”.
“He (President Zardari) added that the commander’s visit reflected the enduring fraternal ties between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, which stand as a testament to the two countries’ shared commitment to deepening cooperation in all fields,” the press release read.
According to the press release, the president appreciated the confidence the UAE’s Navy placed in the professional expertise of the Pakistan Navy and expressed interest in further collaboration, stating that they remain ready to support their Emirati counterpart’s manpower requirements in the future.
President Zardari also highlighted the extraordinary and exemplary relations that Pakistan and the UAE enjoy, which are “rooted in history and strengthened by enduring people-to-people bonds”. The press release said that he reaffirmed Islamabad’s resolve to continue working closely with the UAE and bolster brotherly ties.
“Commander Alremeithi informed the president that he had close ties with Pakistan, having spent four years in the country while graduating from the Pakistan Naval Academy [in] Karachi,” the press release stated.
During his visit, Maj Gen Alremeithi also called on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where he was welcomed with a guard of honour, according to a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
 


“The two dignitaries held in-depth discussions on professional matters, reviewing the evolving global and regional geo-strategic environment,” the ISPR said. “Both sides emphasised the vital role of bilateral defence and security cooperation, including in the maritime domain, for regional peace and stability.”
The ISPR stated that Maj Gen Alremeithi expressed appreciation for the professional standards and achievements of the Pakistan Armed Forces, as well as their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and continued efforts towards achieving regional peace and stability.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-09-08 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/081643460572130.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940508/gb-police-chief-bans-use-of-tiktok-by-personnel-to-ensure-discipline' target='_blank'><strong>GB police chief bans use of TikTok by personnel to ensure ‘discipline’</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan police chief on Monday banned the use of social media platform TikTok by personnel of the force for the purpose of maintaining “discipline”.
A notification issued today from the office of the GB inspector general of police said: “In order to maintain discipline, uniformity and dignity of the force, it is hereby directed that no GB police officer/official shall use social media platform (TikTok).”
It ordered all district police officers and unit heads to bring the direction to the notice of all personnel under their command, warning that any non-compliance would be “viewed seriously and cause disciplinary action”.
In July, two constables from the Security Division Islamabad were suspended and facing an inquiry for allegedly violating the capital police’s social media policy by making and uploading TikTok videos in uniform.
Sources had said that dozens of other lower-ranking officials had been warned and directed to remove their TikTok accounts to avoid further action.
In March, the Punjab Police warned its officials against expressing “offensive views” about the state using their personal social media accounts.
In September 2024, the Islamabad and Punjab Police had devised policies regarding the use of social media platforms by officials and officers. The policies had restrained police officers and officials from giving any opinions or statements across all social media platforms.
Heads were also made responsible for personally supervising and monitoring the activities of officers and officials posted in their respective divisions, zones and units.
In the same month, the government had once again asked its employees to refrain from using social media to express political or religious opinions as well as from sharing information with any unauthorised government official or the media.</p><small>2025-09-08 11:48</small></div><hr>
