Meanwhile, all the other five franchises renewed their agreements with the league for the next 10 years over the last two days — Islamabad United and Karachi Kings being the latest ones.
Tareen announced his decision with a heartfelt note on social media platform ‘X’.
“Despite the financial losses year after year, I never once thought about walking away,” he said.  “The Sultans have always meant more to me than just numbers. And I have always been willing to go as far as needed to protect it.“I know I’m not everyone’s cup of tea, and I’m okay with that. But I have always been honest and I have always spoken my mind,” Tareen added, pointing out at his longstanding criticism over the league’s management issues that landed him in the bad books of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which eventually decided to snub him.
“I never learned how to play it safe or just play along. That simply isn’t who I am. And if staying means compromising those principles there is only one choice I can make.
“I would rather lose this team while standing on my feet than run it from my knees. So, this is goodbye.”</p><small>2025-11-25 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25184442c03fe57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957299/aleema-again-denied-meeting-with-imran-pti-supporters-stage-sit-in-near-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema again denied meeting with Imran; PTI supporters stage sit-in near Adiala Jail</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, was again denied a meeting with her incarcerated brother on Tuesday, while party leaders and supporters staged a sit-in near Adiala jail.
Last week, the party said that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala Jail, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder.
A livestream by the PTI showed a massive crowd sloganeering, with riot police present in the area.
 






Aleema and her sisters — Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan — were stopped at Factory Naka by police, upon which PTI supporters started sloganeering and staged a sit-in. Majlis Wahdaat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also joined the demonstration.
At Factory Naka, Aleema told reporters that she would stay at the sit-in site until she was allowed to meet Imran and questioned the presence of a large number of police personnel.
“At this time, it is the law of the jungle; they (authorities) should be concerned that if they do not proceed according to the constitution and law, Pakistan will face the law of the jungle.”
Aleema also condemned the treatment of her and her sisters last week, calling female police personnel “shameless”.
“These policewomen think that they will make the [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz happy and get promotions by doing this,” she said. “If they want to arrest us, we are not afraid.
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh uploaded a video on X showing the party’s Karachi General Secretary Arslan Khalid at the protest.
“The police are doing the same thing again,” he said, referring to the use of force to disperse the protesters.
“Our brothers and sisters are safe and the PTI’s workers are here to protect them,” he added. “Our demand is the release of Imran Khan.”
 






Earlier today, Aleema told a reporter that she had a legal right to visit her brother in prison.
“We come here legally, as is our legal and constitutional right,” she said. “If we are attacked, it is unconstitutional. As Imran Khan said, the rule of law is being buried.”

During the meeting, the army chief commended General Mirza for his “exemplary leadership, strategic foresight, and dedicated service to the Pakistan Armed Forces”, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“He (COAS) lauded the CJCSC’s pivotal role in enhancing tri-services synergy, strengthening joint operational preparedness, and advancing Pakistan’s national security objectives at the strategic level,” ISPR said.
Furthermore, Field Marshal Munir also highlighted General Mirza’s contributions towards regional stability, military diplomacy, and the strengthening of Pakistan’s partnerships with friendly countries, as per ISPR’s statement.
“General [Mirza] expressed gratitude to the COAS and the armed forces for the support extended during his career,” the statement said. “Upon arrival at GHQ, the CJCSC laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.”

CJCSC meets air chief
Separately, General Mirza also visited Air Headquarters in Islamabad where he was received by Pakistan Air Force Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, ISPR said.
“[The air chief] commended the CJCSC’s exemplary services and his pivotal role in strengthening tri-services synergy,” according to ISPR’s statement. “He appreciated [General Mirza’s] significant contributions towards national defence and reaffirmed PAF’s unwavering resolve to continue working closely with sister services to eradicate the menace of terrorism.”
Furthermore, the statement added that the CJCSC expressed his satisfaction over the combat readiness of air force and the progress achieved through its modernisation and upgradation initiatives.
“He lauded the professionalism and dedication of PAF personnel in safeguarding Pakistan’s aerial frontiers and acknowledged the vital role of the Service in the national fight against terrorism. He also appreciated the seamless coordination among the tri-services and expressed confidence that this cooperation would continue to flourish in the years ahead,” it said.

Abolishment of CJCSC office
Earlier this month, the national security establishment was restructured through Amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislations governing Army, Air Force and Navy.
The legislation also abolished the office of CJCSC, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces.
The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making at least during war time.</p><small>2025-11-25 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251647470436aea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957296/fazl-objects-to-legislations-enacted-to-combat-child-marriages-and-domestic-violence-protect-transgender-people' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl objects to legislations enacted to combat child marriages and domestic violence, protect transgender people</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday strongly objected to recent legislations aimed at reducing domestic violence, protecting children from child marriages, and safeguarding transgender community’s rights.
On November 13, the National Assembly also passed a bill — awaiting the Senate’s approval — to protect people against domestic violence in Islamabad. A day later, the Balochistan Assembly adopted a bill to ban child marriages with a majority, amidst a protest by opposition lawmakers, including JUI-F’s Younis Zehri.
In September, the Balochistan cabinet approved the province’s first-ever transgender policy to ensure the community’s social and economic inclusion.
Addressing the media in Islamabad today, the JUI-F chief said, “Some legislation has been enacted regarding the marriage of children below the age of 18 years, regarding transgenders, and regarding domestic violence.”

The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 aims to establish an effective system of protection, relief and rehabilitation of women, men, transgender persons, children and any vulnerable person against domestic violence. It provides jail terms ranging from six months to three years, and a fine of up to Rs100,000, if the offence does not fall under the Pakistan Penal Code.
Speaking about child marriages, Fazl took exception to terming those under 18 as “na-baaligh” (minors), asking which sect’s Islamic laws stated as such.
“Strengthening the law to the point that if a marriage or nikkah is done before 18, it will be called sexual abuse and will be interpreted as rape, and a punishment will be given accordingly,” he said.
Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides, with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18, according to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef).
 
 

While Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory already enforce 18 as the minimum marriage age for girls, the Punjab government is also set to introduce the Child Marriage Restraint Act to set the same threshold.
During his media talk, the JUI-F chief also criticised the Protection of Women Bill 2006, which had been introduced amid opposition from religious parties during Gen Pervez Musharraf’s dictatorship, to amend widely criticised Hudood laws.
He pointedly said the PPP had voted in favour of that bill, and “today as well, hindrances were being created in the way of permitted nikkah”. The PPP is in power in Balochistan, where the recent anti-child marriage bill and the transgender policy were introduced.
Fazl went on to term it a “weird point” and a “joke” that, although child marriages would be considered as rape, a child born out of it would be legitimate. “And the father will be bound to pay for its expenses,” he added.
It is unclear whether any of the recent legislation specified this. However, in March, the Lahore High Court ruled that a biological father was under an obligation to maintain his child even if born as a consequence of rape.
On the legislation pertaining to the transgender community, Fazl sought the “justification” for individuals born as a “complete male or a complete female” being allowed to change their gender.
“Perhaps, they do not even have as much freedom there in the West as we have given them here in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he claimed.
The JUI-F chief said he did not “expect” such decisions from the government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his PML-N.
He alleged that the new laws were being passed on an “agenda” of the United Nations. He described laws and conventions enacted by international rights bodies as “slavery”.
Fazl objects to ‘lifetime perks’ under 27th Amendment
During his media briefing, Fazl also “completely rejected” the recently enacted 27th Amendment, which had been assailed by other opposition parties as well.
While praising the armed forces’ performance and courage during the May conflict with India, Fazl objected to the “lifetime perks” given to top military officers.
“These are perhaps such unique perks that Pakistan’s democratic society does not require them at all,” the senior politician said.
 
 

He urged President Asif Ali Zardari and the three services chiefs to reject the lifetime immunity offered under the 27th Amendment themselves.
Fazl expressed his reservations about the PPP “playing a role in the backslide of democracy instead of raising the slogan of democracy”, as it could not block the changes that were earlier opposed during the 26th Amendment.
The JUI-F chief said the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and the Supreme Court Shariat Appellate Bench’s jurisdictions were not kept in mind when drafting the 27th Amendment. He contended that appeals against FSC decisions would be marred by confusion about whether the SC would hear them or the Federal Constitutional Court.

The move comes as several US tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI make a beeline for the world’s most populous nation, seen as a critical growth market where nearly a billion users access the internet.
Under the partnership, Google’s AI Futures Fund and Accel will co-invest up to $2 million in each startup, Prayank Swaroop, partner at Accel, told Reuters in an interview, with the investments focused on the wide areas of entertainment, creativity, work and coding.
 






The announcement comes after Google in October said it would invest $15 billion over five years to set up an AI data centre in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, its biggest-ever investment in the country.
Its AI Futures Fund, launched six months ago, has funded over 30 companies, including Indian webtoon startup Toonsutra and United States-based legal-tech firm Harvey.
Google has also teamed up with India’s largest telecom operator, Reliance Jio, to provide free access to Gemini AI for 505m users.
“We firmly believe that the founders in India, they are going to be playing a leading role in defining that next era of global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of Google’s AI Futures Fund, said.
“… we think that it’s critical to invest in the early stage. Particularly in key markets like India, so that we can be at the forefront of investing in the next generation of AI leaders.”
India’s AI market is projected to reach $17bn by 2027, according to IT industry body Nasscom and consulting firm BCG.
Global AI spend is seen at nearly $1.5 trillion in 2025, and will exceed $2tr in 2026, as per market research firm Gartner.</p><small>2025-11-25 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25183626146ba71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957297/struggling-with-your-40s-for-many-women-its-perimenopause' target='_blank'><strong>Struggling with your 40s? For many women, it’s perimenopause</strong></a><br><p>The forties may have gained a reputation for being the age when bad things happen to a woman’s body, but there is no magic to this number.
Every woman goes through these physiological changes in their own time. The 40s is, however, the age when perimenopause is most likely to hit women, and it is good to know what changes to expect and how to combat them.
Perimenopause can be loosely defined as the prep time that a female body takes to transition into menopause, and it is here that hormones such as oestrogen and progesterone start to destabilise.
The most notable changes a woman faces physically at this time are weight gain, a deteriorating skin texture, and exhaustion. Doctors have noted that this particular weight gain is not just visible on the scale — it settles distinctly on the hips, giving the body a more rotund look.
The loss of oestrogen and progesterone is directly responsible for saggy and more dehydrated skin, fine lines and the loss of skin suppleness due to decreasing collagen.
Dr Kazi Azmiri Hoque, RMO at the Obs Gyn Department of Meditech General Hospital, mentions, “Women can sometimes lose the softness of their face, and even the litheness of their build during this process, and gain some facial hair.”
Women hitting this age also often complain of losing hair volume, but this is not common to everyone.
One of the most important jobs of oestrogen is to keep young joints greased — women losing this hormone in their 40s, therefore, often complain of joint stiffness, bone and back pain over time, especially if they have a BMI on the higher side.
Women also lose muscle mass and strength by up to 15 per cent during this time, increasing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis.
Other effects of hitting pre-menopause include vision changes and dry eyes, a weak pelvic floor, especially for women who have given birth, sleep challenges, fatigue and consequent brain fog.
These, however, are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg of perimenopause.
Oestrogen provides a buffer against cardiovascular ageing and even insulin sensitivity. A decrease in the hormone could therefore render women more vulnerable to cardiovascular risks and strokes, and increase the risks of Type 2 diabetes. 
Wild fluctuations of hormones before the last period may cause irregular periods, hot flashes and night sweats, vaginal dryness, and wild mood swings in women.
“One of the reasons women dread menopause is because they feel that this would mean the end of sexual desire and physical love, but this is far from the truth,” shares Azmiri. “In fact, libido remains unchanged and sexual relations can continue well into menopause.”
Vaginal dryness may be an issue during this time, but lubricants can help make things better. While these are all intimidating factors to consider, not every woman goes through all these factors, and definitely not all at once.
“Oftentimes, women find themselves dealing with teenage children in their 40s, or ailing parents,” confides Azmiri. “These are stressors which may manifest themselves in the form of aches and pains. Most doctors group these ailments under menopause, making it a villainous stage in women’s lives.”
However, there are several ways in which a woman can combat the negative effects of perimenopause in her 40s. She can choose to switch to a healthy lifestyle, incorporating a balanced diet, for instance.
A dietician will be especially beneficial here, as they can chalk out a phytoestrogen-rich diet including foods like flaxseeds, soy, and lentils, balance blood sugar levels, and order a reduction in nicotine, caffeine, and alcoholic beverages.
Women can also take up regular exercise, leaving behind a sedentary way of life, and practice stress management techniques such as yoga or meditation. A good sleep hygiene, such as a solid eight-hour shut-eye and a no-screens rule an hour before bedtime, can help counter fatigue and brain fog.
More than anything else, having a good sense of awareness of what is going on in your body means that half the battle is already won. Knowing and expecting, and to some extent perhaps even combating the signs of perimenopause, can make your 40s much less daunting, allowing you to embrace this milestone age as a special number, not a dreaded one.

Investi­gators and intelligence agencies are hunting for facilitators and support networks behind the attack, which saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
Questioned about the progress of the investigation and whether any evidence had come to the fore about the assailants being Afghan citizens, IG Hameed said: “We are saying this because, based on the evidence so far, when someone does not have a citizenship record, they are assumed to be Afghan or something similar.”
He confirmed that authorities had identified the location where the terrorists spent the night before attacking the FC Headquarters. However, he added that no facilitators had been arrested so far.
IG Hameed added that the CCTV footage showing their arrival was obtained and the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) was working to verify their identities.
The KP police chief elaborated that the authorities were also determining the route the terrorists used to enter Peshawar.
 


He further said that the terrorists’ motorcycle was seized and fingerprints taken from the vehicle were now part of the ongoing forensic investigation.
IG Hameed highlighted that recent measures taken by the KP Police had significantly reduced terrorist incidents, and the provincial police force was being equipped with weapons, modern technology, including anti-drone systems, and bulletproof jackets and vehicles for officials and police stations.
He praised the bravery of the KP Police, noting that despite operating in a stressful environment, the force continued to make sacrifices for peace in the region.</p><small>2025-11-25 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25164857880f9c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957285/dg-ispr-refutes-allegations-by-afghan-taliban-of-pakistani-airstrikes-in-afghanistan-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR refutes allegations by Afghan Taliban of Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan: state media</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban on Tuesday that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan, state media reported.
The statement by the head of the military’s media wing came hours after the Afghan Taliban spokesperson accused Pakistan of attacks in Khost, Kunar and Paktika provinces.
According to state broadcaster Pakistan TV, the military spokesperson refuted the claims of conducting strikes inside Afghanistan. “Pakistan Army has not attacked civilians inside Afghanistan,” it quoted him as saying.
 






“Whenever Pakistan attacks someone, it announces it,” he said, according to local media.
“In our view, there are no good and bad Taliban,” he said, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists.
“The Taliban government should make decisions as a state, not as non-state actors,” said Gen Chaudhry. He also wondered how long the current set-up in Afghanistan would remain an interim one.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
Gen Faiz court martial proceedings
The military spokesperson also addressed the court martial proceedings against former intelligence chief Gen (r) Faiz Hameed. “The trial is a legal matter; there should be no speculation about it. There will be an immediate announcement when the matter reaches its final conclusion.”
Gen Hameed has been in custody since August 2024 and the military annou­nced the initiation of court martial proceedings on Aug 12, 2024, on the charges of violating the Army Act and misconduct filed by the owner of a private housing society.
The army said in December 2024 that he was indicted by a military court on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority.
The case against Gen Hameed was made following a Supreme Court ruling in November 2023, which directed petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan, owner of Islamabad’s Top City housing society, to pursue grievances thro­ugh appropriate channels, including the Ministry of Defence.
Khan had alleged that a May 12, 2017, raid on his property by Pakistan Rangers and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) officials resulted in the seizure of valuables, including gold, diamonds, and cash, under the pretext of a counter-terrorism operation. This is one of the most high-profile court martial cases in Pakistan Army’s history, as Gen Hameed is the second three-star general and the first former ISI chief to face such proceedings.
Under military laws, an indictment follows a court of inquiry and a summary of evidence, which form the basis for framing cha­rges. Following his indictment, Gen Hameed will be allowed to hire legal representation.

Jeena Wada Khilafi HaiBy Ghazi SalahuddinAaj PublicationsISBN: 978-969-648-128-7194pp.
Stories are ubiquitous and take on many forms. Even the stories themselves have their own accounts — detailing how they came to be, sometimes shared in an instant and, in other instances, forgotten only to be revived later. Occasionally, the story of stories proves to be more captivating than the stories themselves.
Ghazi Salahaddin, a distinguished journalist and social activist, has recently released his first collection of Urdu short stories, titled Jeena Wada Khilafi Hai [Living is Against the Pledge]. The story behind this book is just as intriguing as the 10 stories it contains.
These stories were penned in the 1950s, nearly 70 years ago, and were featured in esteemed literary magazines such as Adab-i-Lateef [Light Literature] and Naya Daur [New Era]. However, the stories faded into obscurity, even forgotten by the author himself. He ceased writing stories. Why? Ghazi sahib addresses this question in the book’s preface.
He reminisces that these stories received praise from editors and peers, but he needed to learn English for his journalism career. He is entirely self-taught when it comes to his command of English. He acquired the language not through formal education, but by utilising the resources of the British Council library in Karachi. He proudly claims that, for him, this library is his equivalent of Harvard and Oxford.

A collection of long-forgotten short stories by journalist Ghazi Salahuddin resurfaces in the form of a book, leading to the question of whether these tales of young angst about love and belonging still resonate

Did he forsake Urdu, his mother tongue and national language, in favour of English, the colonial global language? The reality is that he did not forsake Urdu; he continued to write Urdu columns and, particularly, essays about his travels in Jang, which were later compiled into Meray Sahil, Meray Darya [My Shores, My Rivers]. However, he never returned to fiction writing. His departure from fiction was complete. Nevertheless, he has remained an enthusiastic reader of both English and Urdu fiction all along.
His departure from writing fiction seems more related to writer’s block than merely his pursuit of a journalism career. Writer’s block can manifest in various forms and durations; some instances are fleeting, while others can be enduring. In every case, writer’s block stems from a deep shift in the writer’s mindscape. Simply put, the causes lie within, not outside.
 

Ghazi Salahuddin | Altamash Kamal

We can infer that Ghazi sahib explored what he needed to through his Urdu short stories. If he had left fiction unfinished, he must have eventually returned to it. Only unfinished endeavours and unfulfilled commitments continue to haunt us, prompting us to resume them. The pressing question is why Ghazi sahib chose to publish stories that are 70 years old.
Over the past seven decades, Urdu fiction has experienced numerous thematic and aesthetic transformations. Does he — or his younger associates who insisted on him to publish these stories — believe that these stories possess literary significance that transcends both history and time? Do these stories resonate with readers in this postmodern, post-truth, AI-driven era? Moderately, yes.
All 10 stories in the collection delve into the theme of love through a young male narrator. This Karachi-based protagonist is a solitary adult, searching for his Sosan, an archetypal figure of womanhood. Although he encounters women, he quickly loses them. In these tales, moments of joy are rare, while hours of suffering are plentiful. In our contemporary society, the concepts of love and sexuality have undergone major shifts. So, at places the protagonist of these stories appears like an individual of an old generation.
What renders these stories valuable today is their stylistic approach. Ghazi sahib’s fictional prose is remarkably creative, engaging and captivating, allowing it to still resonate with readers. It is astonishing that he possessed such a flawless yet imaginative style even in his teenage years.
Additionally, there are several other factors that contribute to the relevance of these stories.
In the 1950s, when these stories were crafted, the Urdu literary landscape was overwhelmed by three significant movements: Progressive, Modernist and Cultural Nationalist. Each of these movements grappled with the critical issues surrounding Partition, including the resulting violent communal riots, migration, displacement, and questions of cultural and national identity.
At that time, Ghazi sahib was a teenager living in Karachi. On the surface, his stories may appear to be disconnected from these grand national issues. Yet, on a deeper level, the characters endure the pain of displacement and crises of identity as well.
These narratives are characterised by a modernist approach, as they delve into the inner turmoil of young individuals marked by romantic struggles, while largely ignoring the anxieties stemming from the class system. It is important to emphasise that the romantic struggles faced by the young protagonists bear significant psychological similarities to those induced by displacement. All 10 stories can be classified as ‘love stories’ told from the perspective of a young protagonist. Yet, in each tale, we encounter desires and dreams that remain unfulfilled, leading to feelings of angst and sorrow.
The most striking and memorable tale is the opening story of the collection, ‘Veeranay Mein Do Awazain’ [Two Voices from the Wilderness]. In this narrative, human existence is depicted as a wilderness, with the two voices representing passion and revulsion, loyalty and betrayal, acceptance and rejection.
The conflict inherent in the perception of love is central to the story. The main characters, Faruq and Abida, embody this conflict, resulting in their inevitable separation. Their longing for love only exacerbates the horror of their wilderness and sense of homelessness. Intriguingly, Faruq equates love with the concept of home, suggesting that we seek a home not only for safety but also for order, tranquility in our lives and for a space of mediation on our fundamental existential issues. Love serves as a sanctuary for our wandering spirits.
Kashif Raza, in his essay included in the book has skillfully peeled back the layers of this story. It is noteworthy that in Ghazi sahib’s stories, the young lovers based in Karachi grapple with a profound sense of internal displacement.
‘Jeena Wada Khilafi Hai’ is a story that highlights the idea, as expressed in the second line of Mahbub Khizan’s famous couplet (‘Ek mohabbat kaafi hai/ Baaqi umr izaafi hai’ [One love is enough/ The rest of life is surplus]), that we only need one love; living without it feels like a betrayal. It emphasises the harsh truth that love often leads to tragedy — a tragedy that we lose our loved ones, even betray them, but keep living in the wilderness of our beings.
Is it merely a coincidence that one of the stories is titled ‘Mera Ghar Kahaan Hai’ [Where is My Home?]. The narrator-protagonist reminisces about his beloved Nafeesa, who has married someone else, while he searches for his home, a small paradise on earth. He states, “I hate big houses; I just need a small home.” Ghazi sahib’s fictional characters struggle to find their home. The quest for home is a recurring theme throughout these stories. They often feel ‘out of place’, whether they are in cafes, at the airport, in Murree or in Lahore.
‘Ban Basi’ [Jungle Dweller] is another short story where the protagonist feels disconnected. He comes to the realisation that neither his father nor his mother truly belongs to him. He feels estranged from his parents’ home as well. Even in his own home, he experiences a sense of being ‘out of place’. He grapples with an identity crisis and feelings of estrangement, which continue to resonate with us.

The court found Hasina guilty of incitement, orders to kill and inaction to prevent atrocities during the deadly state crackdown on a student-led uprising in 2024.
Hasina denies all the charges against her, calling the court’s decision “biased and politically motivated.” In a statement released after the verdict, she said: “I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal, where the evidence can be weighed and tested fairly.”
Hasina has challenged Bangladesh’s caretaker government to bring the charges before the International Criminal Court.
The Bangladeshi court’s judgment is anchored in extensive evidence from the United Nations (UN) and international human rights organisations. In a report published in February 2025, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed during the three weeks of unrest. A further 11,700 people were detained, it said.
The report found that “the vast majority of those killed and injured were shot by Bangladesh’s security forces”, and determined that security agencies “systematically engaged in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.” UN data suggests that up to 180 children were killed in the security crackdown.

Ousted Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina, living in exile in India, is sentenced to death. But does the judgment signal that no leader is above the law or political vengeance? And what does it mean for stability in the country?

During the unrest, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that the Bangladeshi government had “deployed the army against student protesters, imposed shoot-on-sight curfew orders, and shut down mobile data and internet services.”
The UN report concluded that the violence against protesters in Bangladesh “was carried out in a coordinated manner by security and intelligence services.” It documented instances where “security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point-blank range.”
HRW documented similar patterns. In a January 2025 briefing, HRW stated that “over 1,000 people were killed and many thousands injured due to excessive and indiscriminate use of ammunition.” These findings were repeated by Amnesty International, which recorded the use of live ammunition on protesters and mistreatment of detainees.
The court’s verdict accepts evidence that multiple branches of the security apparatus acted in concert, and that senior officials did not intervene even as human rights violations escalated. Judges stated that those in positions of authority were expected to prevent such abuses, yet the violence continued despite their ability to stop it.

For many families, the court’s ruling marks the first official acknowledgement of their loss. Testimonies collected by UN investigators describe parents spending days searching hospitals and police stations for their children, often being told that records were missing. The UN reported that hospital staff were pressured by security forces to alter or remove death records.
Meenakshi Ganguly, the deputy Asia director at HRW, said at the time of the unrest: “Bangladesh has been troubled for a long time due to unfettered security force abuses against anyone who opposes the Sheikh Hasina government.”
Hasina won a fourth straight term as prime minister in 2024, following an election that the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist party alleged was a sham. The party boycotted the poll after many of its key leaders were forced into exile or jailed prior to the vote.
Under Hasina, Bangladesh’s security forces operated with broad discretion. This included the Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force, which was sanctioned by the US Treasury in December 2021 over “serious human rights abuses.” Civil society groups documented pressure on activists prior to the 2024 unrest, while journalists faced harassment.
Next steps
The verdict arrives at a pivotal moment for the interim government which, led by Muhammad Yunus, has pledged to restore the rule of law in Bangladesh and rebuild public trust. One difficult question for his administration moving forward will be whether it can secure Hasina’s extradition.
The Hindustan Times is reporting that the Bangladeshi government has already written to India, where Hasina has been living in exile since being ousted from power, asking for her to be handed over.
Hasina’s extradition is no foregone conclusion. India can deny the Bangladeshi government’s request if it is deemed that the charges against Hasina are of a political nature. And Delhi has responded cautiously to the extradition request, saying it is “committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh.”
Yet pressure on India to extradite Hasina is likely to grow. The gravity of the charges — grounded in UN findings that suggest the violence, and Hasina’s role in it, may amount to crimes against humanity — adds an international dimension that could influence future decisions.
Another challenge facing Bangladesh’s interim government is the prospect of renewed unrest. Reuters reported clashes between Hasina supporters and security forces in parts of the capital, Dhaka, and the port city of Chattogram in the days before the court’s ruling. And Bangladeshi police dispersed protesters marching towards party offices in Dhaka after the judgment.
Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, has also publicly warned that supporters of his mother’s Awami League would block national elections scheduled for February 2026, if the government’s ban on the party remained in place. The country’s political environment remains fragile, as legal proceedings against the former Hasina government continue.
The court’s verdict establishes an official record that lethal force was used in ways inconsistent with international law, the violations were widespread and the state bears responsibility.
What follows — whether it’s further prosecutions, security-sector reform or a movement towards extradition — remains uncertain. But next steps must ensure that justice continues.

The attack killed 12 people and injured 35 others, with the government saying days later that it had arrested four terrorists belonging to the TTP.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Tarar detailed the correspondence between these four facilitators and TTP commanders in Afghanistan. Displaying their pictures, Tarar identified them as the suicide bomber’s handler Sajidullah alias Sheena, Kamran Khan, Muhammad Zali and Shah Munir.
The minister said Mehsud “planned this attack through his commander Daadullah”, whom Sajidullah met in 2023, 2024 and in August 2025 as well. He added that Daadullah and Sajidullah “remained in touch through an app”.
 


Tarar identified Daadullah as a resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur, adding that he was currently in Afghanistan.
He also played a video statement of the man he identified as Sajidullah, who the minister said arranged the suicide jacket and brought the bomber, Usman Shinwari, to the site of the attack.
“He was planning this incident in collaboration with Noor Wali Mehsud’s commander Daadullah. Their target was to carry out such an act in either Rawalpindi or Islamabad,” Tarar said, highlighting that the country evaded a “major loss”.
The minister said Sajidullah joined the TTP in 2015 and received training in various TTP camps across Afghanistan. He also visited the neighbouring country’s Jalalabad city in 2024.
During his 2024 visit, Sajidullah met Daadullah to “plan this suicide bombing and hired two more people upon his return”, who were Zali and Khan.
Then, in August 2025, Sajidullah and Zali visited Afghanistan together, Tarar said. According to the minister, they first met TTP militant Abdullah Jan alias Abu Hamza in Shigal district, where they stayed overnight, then met Daadullah in Kabul’s Arzan Qimat neighbourhood.
“Daadullah conveyed the orders of Noor Wali Mehsud to them, that they have to carry out a suicide bombing in the areas of Rawalpindi, Islamabad,” Tarar said.
“Once back in Pakistan, Sajidullah met with Shinwari, the suicide bomber,” who Tarar said was a resident of Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province.
 
 

Detailing the correspondence between Sajidullah and Shinwari, the information minister said they scouted multiple locations but “failed to reach their target” due to security.
“There is no doubt in the fact that all of this was orchestrated from Afghanistan. Daadullah is present in Afghanistan, [and] the main perpetrator, named Sajidullah, was also trained in Afghanistan.”
Tarar further said that the bomber was also a resident of Afghanistan.
After playing Sajidullah’s video statement, Tarar asserted, “This is very clear-cut evidence that the TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan) and the TTP jointly did this.”
The minister said the four men arrested had “some role in some capacity in the suicide bombing”. He noted that the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Intelligence Bureau (ID) had arrested them within 48 hours of the incident during a joint operation.
He said a “huge racket” had been uncovered through the arrests of these four terrorists, terming it a huge success for the CTD and the IB.
The PML-N leader affirmed that security and law enforcement agencies, along with the armed forces, were fully active to eliminate terrorism.
Alleged terrorist details facilitating attack
In the video statement played during the press conference, the man identified as Sajidullah said he went to Afghanistan in 2016, met Abu Hamza and returned to Pakistan after receiving training for a month.
Sajidullah said he met with Abu Hamza during his 2023 visit to Kunar, and then days later, went to Daadullah’s hideout, who “brainwashed and forced me to take an oath of allegiance”.
“Six months ago, Daadullah contacted us and told us to come to Afghanistan and told me to bring my friend along as well,“he said, adding that subsequently, he and Zali headed to Jalalabad.
They met with Daadullah at his residence, where the TTP commander tasked them with transporting the suicide jacket provided by him to the bomber, according to Sajidullah’s account.
“We came to Peshawar and went to Akhun Baba Graveyard,” Sajidullah said, adding that he picked the jacket from there and entrusted it to Munir to “keep it safe”.
 
 

A few days later, Sajidullah continued, he was informed that a man from Afghanistan named Usman would contact him. “He stayed with me for one to two days. I said he was a guest when my family members asked about him,” Sajidullah said, adding that he later had Munir provide shelter to Usman.
However, Munir also said he could not leave Usman alone with his children, and therefore, Munir’s “cousin” Zali rented a room from a man named Muhammad Ali, Sajidullah added.
He further said he told the suicide bomber to arrange his accommodation on his own after 15 to 25 days had passed. Then, on November 11, the day of the blast, Sajidullah said he picked up the jacket from Munir, and both of them, along with Zali, “made [Usman] wear the jacket”.</p><small>2025-11-25 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251401483c3d584.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957270/pakistans-atmosphere-almost-clear-of-ash-plume-from-volcanic-eruption-in-ethiopia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s atmosphere ‘almost clear’ of ash plume from volcanic eruption in Ethiopia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s atmosphere is “almost clear” of the ash plume from a volcanic eruption in Ethiopia, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) spokesperson Anjum Nazeer Zaighum said on Tuesday, adding that the ash cloud was now present over parts of India.
The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted for several hours two days ago. The eruption sent a column of ash and smoke rising nearly 45,000 feet into the atmosphere.
The dangerous ash plume from the eruption had drifted across the Red Sea and disrupted operations on one of the world’s busiest air routes. By Monday, the plume had spread east over Yemen and Oman and was tracking toward the airspace of Pakistan and India, forcing airlines to cancel flights or fly costly detours.
The Met Office spokesperson said the ash plume was first detected in Pakistan about 60 nautical miles south of Gwadar around 10am on Monday. Zaigham said the ash plume remained over areas in Pakistan for around 18 to 20 hours.
He added that the Met Office had issued a volcanic ash advisory for the aviation industry for the first time in Pakistan’s history following the development. “In total, three advisories were issued,” he said.
“At present, it [ash plume] is present over parts of India and Pakistan’s atmosphere is almost cleared,” the spokesperson said.
He also clarified that the ash plume had no environmental impact in Pakistan as it moved at altitudes above 45,000 feet and with a speed of 15 to 20 kilometres per hour.
“It was too high,“ he said, adding that Pakistan would have faced environmental effects if the eruption had occurred in a country more closely located.
Ash cloud over India
Local Ethiopian media rep­orted that the explosion from the eruption caused tremors felt as far away as Djibouti and plunged surrounding settlements into darkness.
Officials and experts described the event as one of the most extraordinary volcanic awakenings in the region’s history. There is no evidence the volcano had erupted in more than 10,000 years, scientists said.
Meanwhile, airlines began cancelling flights post-noon on Monday as the ash moved across the Red Sea.
Air India said it had cancelled 11 flights on Monday and Tuesday to make precautionary checks on aircraft that had flown over some locations after the eruption.
Smaller peer Akasa said it had scrapped scheduled flights to Middle East destinations such as Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled during the two days.
India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation said that only a few flights had been rerouted as a precautionary measure, and that the airports authority had issued a notice to all affected planes.
The ash cloud is moving towards China and is expected to clear Indian skies by 7:30pm today (7pm Pakistan time), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement.
The Hindustan Times reported yesterday that Indian carrier IndiGo cancelled six flights, including routes originating from Mumbai and southern India. Another IndiGo flight, bound for Abu Dhabi from Kannur, was diverted to Ahmedabad.
“The Pakistan airspace is shut for Indian airlines, hence the Indian airlines are expected to be impacted,” a Mumbai airport official said on Monday regarding the re-routing challenges. “We have started keeping a record of this and are monitoring the situation.”

The two also agreed to “deepening bilateral ties in diverse areas” between Islamabad and Tehran, the FO posted on social media platform X.
 






Lari­ja­­ni reached Pakistan on Monday and is expected to meet Pakistan’s political and military leadership during the visit.
His trip follows Speaker of Iranian Parliament Bagher Ghalibaf’s visit to Islamabad last month, marking the second high-level Iranian delegation to Pakistan in weeks.
In a post on X before landing in Pakistan, Larijani said: “Iran and Pakistan are two important and influential countries in ensuring lasting security in the region, and we always pay close attention to the brotherly relations between the countries of the region.”
He also said that “Iranians will never forget” the support extended to them by the people of Pakistan during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam termed the visit “unprecedented” in a post on X.
“This historic milestone marks a pivotal moment at which the already solidified and time-tested relations between our two brotherly nations are set to enter another strategic phase.
“In light of the rapidly evolving global landscape and the emerging dynamics within our regional ecosystem, the need to further strategise and elevate our bilateral relations has become more imperative than ever — an objective that will be meaningfully advanced through this significant visit,” he added.
 






In August, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had also visited Pakistan. Pezeshkian and his delegation had met the top civilian and military leaders of the country, and among the matters discussed during the visit was Israel’s onslaught in Gaza.
 
 

Pezeshkian had expressed his desire to raise bilateral trade to $10bn, while the need to jointly combat terrorism, especially along the border in Balochistan, was also discussed.
The Iranians had further sought to join Pakistan and China in expanding regional trade as part of the Silk Road initiative. At least 12 memoranda of understanding and deals were signed covering various sectors.
In October, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had visited Iran. He had also met Pezeshkian during the visit.</p><small>2025-11-25 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/250841314285aa2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957247/pakistan-carried-out-strikes-in-afghanistan-claims-taliban-spokesman' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan carried out strikes in Afghanistan, claims Taliban spokesman</strong></a><br><p>Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, claimed on Tuesday that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country.
In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
No official statement has been issued by Pakistan thus far.
The strike was reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office (FO) said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-25 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25134409b1c233f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957275/cannot-ask-dictated-questions-court-appointed-lawyer-for-imaan-spouse-refuses-to-cross-examine-witnesses' target='_blank'><strong>‘Cannot ask dictated questions’: Court-appointed lawyer for Imaan, spouse refuses to cross-examine witnesses</strong></a><br><p>The counsel appointed by the court for lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses on Tuesday, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
He also alleged that he was not given enough time to prepare for the case, which was registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
Mazari and Chattha have been accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country in the case.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammed Afzal Majoka resumed proceedings in the case in Islamabad today, where court-appointed defence counsel Advocate Shakeel Jatt alleged he was approached at around 4pm yesterday to represent Imaan and Chattha.
He said that he had not been provided the case file to prepare in time.
Moreover, he said that he had “received 15 questions with the instructions that he should ask them during today’s cross-examination”, without giving any specific details.
Addressing Judge Majoka, he said he was told, “You have to do this tomorrow.”
The lawyer said he could not argue the case under such circumstances.
“I am in favour of a fair trial. I cannot ask questions that are dictated [to me]. My conscience does not allow this,” he said, stressing that every accused person had the right to a fair and impartial trial under the Constitution.
Advocate Jatt sought adequate time from the court to prepare before cross-examining witnesses. He said that without properly studying the case file, he would not be able to fulfil his professional responsibilities.
The judge accepted his request for more time and adjourned the hearing till November 27 (Thursday).
Mazari had previously alleged that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel” for her and Chattha.
Mazari and Chattha were indicted in the case on October 30, a day after the latter was arrested outside the courtroom over non-appearance. Mazari said that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Speaking to reporters after his release, Chattha had maintained that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings on October 29, but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25123520b13bade.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957265/india-issues-demarche-to-china-after-woman-from-arunachal-detained-mocked-by-shanghai-airport-officials-reports' target='_blank'><strong>India issues demarche to China after woman from Arunachal ‘detained, mocked’ by Shanghai airport officials: reports</strong></a><br><p>India has issued a demarche to China after a woman from Arunachal Pradesh alleged that she was detained at the Shanghai airport by immigration officials for 18 hours, who “mocked” her and said that the territory was not part of India, according to Indian media.
China says Arunachal Pradesh is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.
The woman, named Pema Wangjom Thongdok, said in yesterday’s interview to ANI that she was an Indian citizen residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years. Thongdok said she was travelling from London to Japan’s Osaka via Shanghai on November 21, when Chinese authorities held her back for 18 hours.
 






Detailing her “very long ordeal”, Thongdok alleged that Chinese immigration officials at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport declared her visa as “not acceptable” and her Indian passport as invalid.
She further said the officials “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India.
“You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying.
“The airline staff of China Eastern and about two other immigration officers were speaking in their language and saying […] ‘Arunachal’ and laughing and calling it ‘China, not India’,” Thongdok told ANI, describing the immigration and airline staff’s behaviour as “very humiliating [and] questionable”.
Frustrated by their conduct, she reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country.
“We are part of India … We speak ‘shuddh Hindi’, we don’t understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian,” Thongdok told ANI.
 


“They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” Thongdok had said on social media platform X on November 23 (Sunday), referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff.
 






On Monday, The Print quoted a source as saying that a “strong démarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place”.
“Our consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended the fullest assistance to the stranded passenger,” the source added, terming Thongdok’s detention based on “ludicrous grounds”.
“Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory, and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,“ they added, according to the publication.
Other Indian publications, including Press Trust of India, Hindustan Times, The Wire and ANI, also reported the same, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Following the incident, Thongdok wrote to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the foreign secretary, asking them to ensure that any Indian citizen does not face such a situation in the future, The Statesman reported.
The incident comes as both China and India, for the past year, have been seeking to put aside differences lingering since their 2020 border standoff.
Sources in India’s MEA, as per The Hindu, said that at a time when both sides were working to improve ties, such actions by the Chinese side introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2512211351fd6b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957267/pakistan-tennis-icon-aisam-qureshi-calls-time-on-illustrious-career' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan tennis icon Aisam Qureshi calls time on illustrious career</strong></a><br><p>The next chapter in Pakistani tennis began with the close of another as top-ranked player Aisamul Haq Qureshi announced his retirement from professional tennis at the opening ceremony of the ATP Challenger Pakistan in Islamabad on Monday night.
Bringing the international event to home soil was a dream come true, Aisam, who is president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF), said at a press conference for the event earlier this month.
“I don’t know if my tears are for my career or hosting the challenger cup as president,” the visibly emotional 45-year-old joked as he addressed the audience on a chilly evening.
PTF described his retirement as the “conclusion of an era”.
“His legacy will continue to inspire upcoming players and contribute to the growth and recognition of tennis across the nation,” the federation said in a post on social media.

The right-hander turned pro in 1998 and was the only Pakistani tennis player to have played in a Grand Slam final at the 2010 US Open in both the men’s and mixed doubles.
Aisam achieved a career-high singles ranking of 125 in December 2007, and a doubles ranking of 8 in June 2011 with recently-retired partner Rohan Bopanna of India, according to the ATP Tour, who honoured Aisam and seven other retired stars at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin earlier this month.
“Obviously it’s an amazing feeling [to be here],” said the former Top 10 star, who is one of only four men to win the ATP’s Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award twice.
“Growing up as a Pakistani, a young kid, I never thought I would have such a long career to start with. Playing with the top guys, at the top tournaments, and qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals also four times. It’s been amazing, and this is like a full circle,“ Aisam had said.
“The ATP was like a second family to me. I’ve had some ups, I’ve had some downs, but overall, I think it was a mutual friendship and trust that I gathered the most.”
 






The tennis star made his final tour-level appearance in a Davis Cup tie in Paraguay in September. He won 18 tour-level doubles crowns, including two ATP Masters 1000 titles.
He is also the most successful Davis Cup player in Pakistan’s history, with the team most notably reaching the World Group play-offs in 2005.

The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. More recently, Jordan banned it in April of this year.
Signed at the White House on November 24, the order specifically mentioned its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt.
It stated that it “sets in motion a process by which certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation” as both foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs) under US counterterrorism laws.
 






The directive described the Brotherhood as having developed into a “transnational network” since its founding in Egypt in 1928, with chapters across the Middle East that, according to the order, “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens, and American interests.
The order highlighted activities attributed to Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt.
It cited the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which led to Tel Aviv’s relentless military campaign in the Palestinian enclave, stating that the Lebanese chapter’s military wing “joined Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian factions to launch multiple rocket attacks against both civilian and military targets within Israel”.
The White House document further noted that “a senior leader of the Egyptian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood … called for violent attacks against US partners and interests”.
It added that the Jordanian chapter’s leaders “have long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas”.
“It is the policy of the US to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the capabilities and operations” of chapters that may be designated under this process, the order said.
It also instructed agencies to act to “deprive those chapters of resources, and thereby end any threat” they posed to US nationals and national security.
Implementation timeline
The executive order also established a clear timeline. Within 30 days, the secretaries of State and Treasury must submit a joint report evaluating which chapters should be designated.
After that, the order directed that the relevant department must, within 45 days, take “all appropriate action” to complete the designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood has been the subject of long-running debate within US policymaking circles.
 
 

Some chapters have functioned as political parties participating in elections, while others have been accused by regional governments of supporting militant groups.
Past US administrations resisted designating the organisation outright, citing its diverse branches and concerns over destabilising political consequences.
Trump’s order marks the most detailed administrative mechanism yet to evaluate specific national chapters individually rather than treating the Brotherhood as a monolithic entity.
Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is also a Republican like Trump, had designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation at the state level.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25102921c42777b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957260/pindi-police-say-3-arrested-after-video-of-girls-hair-being-forcibly-cut-goes-viral-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi police say 3 arrested after video of girl’s hair being forcibly cut goes viral on social media</strong></a><br><p>Rawalpindi police have stated that three suspects have been arrested after a harrowing video of a girl’s hair being forcibly cut went viral on social media.
The video, which has been making the rounds on social media since Tuesday, shows a man standing over what appears to be a young girl and cutting her hair with a pair of scissors while others in the background watch.
Subsequently, another video also surfaced on social media, purportedly of the victim, in which she alleged that the incident occurred one-and-a-half months ago in Rawalpindi’s Christian Colony. She also alleged that she was beaten and threatened, adding that four men were involved in the incident.
In a statement early on Tuesday, Rawalpindi police commented on the incident. The statement referred to the victim as a “girl”.
“A video of a girl being beaten and her hair being cut has come forward, after which a video statement also came forward,” the statement said.
The incident took place in Rawalpindi and Islamabad a month and a half ago, the statement said, adding that it was not reported to the police earlier.
It went on to say that the Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani had taken notice of the incident, adding that police had gotten in touch with the girl in the video.
“Legal action is being taken at her request at the Naseerabad Police Station,” it said.
“Three accused have been taken into custody in light of the victim’s statement,” the statement added.
It said that crimes pertaining to violence, coercion and exploitation of women would not be tolerated.
“All the accused involved in the incident will be arrested and punished to the fullest extent of the law,” the statement quoted the Rawalpindi CPO as saying.
 






A first information report (FIR) of the incident has been registered under Sections 337V (intentional uprooting of hair) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on behalf of Duty Foot Constable (DFC) Asad Hussain at the Naseerabad police station in the early hours of Tuesday against four named and “a few other” unidentified suspects.
It said that “a video went viral on social media, including on Facebook, in which some people can be seen forcibly cutting the hair of a girl”.
Upon further investigation, it was found that the incident had occurred in Christian Colony, the FIR said, adding that the suspects had committed a serious crime by forcibly cutting the girl’s hair and then widely sharing the video on social media.
Last night, Islamabad police also commented on the incident, saying that it had taken place in Rawalpindi and not in the capital’s Lohi Bher area as was being reported.
“Islamabad police have traced the girl and have recorded her statement,” it said. Police further said that they had “conducted raids” and taken those involved into custody.
“However, since the incident took place in Rawalpindi, the suspects are being handed over to the police concerned,” it added.

Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated, along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police.
Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a post on X on Monday, the PTI said Noreen had filed a formal complaint with the Punjab IG over the “brutal assault and unlawful detention of peaceful citizens”.
 






The party also shared the two-page letter, in which Noreen called the incident “deeply disturbing”. She said the violence was “brutal and orchestrated” and was carried out without provocation.
According to her, her and her sisters had for weeks been denied access to see Imran without justification, leading them to “peacefully and democratically protest” over concerns for his condition. She said that they were also accompanied by members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet, lawyers and party workers.
“We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct,” she said.
“Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” she said.
“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she said.
Noreen also recounted that other women were slapped and dragged, and peaceful citizens were rounded up in vans, only to be later abandoned in remote areas in the middle of the night.
“The fact that ministers and elected officials from another federating unit were subjected to this violence further underscores a dangerous erosion of political comity and the misuse of provincial police power to suppress legitimate political expression,” she said.
She said that the police’s conduct was part of a “broader and troubling pattern” of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years, reflecting a “troubling impunity”.
Noreen called the Punjab police’s conduct “not only indefensible (but) wholly criminal, illegal, morally reprehensible, and in direct contradiction to the foundational duties of any law enforcement agency in a democratic society”.
She said their actions amounted to actionable criminal offences as they were in breach of the provisions of the Police Order 2002.
She called on the Punjab IG to immediately initiate proceedings against all police personnel who participated in and authorised the incident, or failed to prevent it.
She also requested the preservation and impartial review of “all visual evidence” from the incident and the constitution of an impartial inquiry that treated peaceful citizens “as criminals”.
On November 20, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern and called for an inquiry into the alleged mistreatment of the PTI protesters.
In a post on X, the HRCP had expressed concerns over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly are protected under national and international human rights law.
“The HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it added.
Subsequently, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, had also raised concerns over the incident and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights.</p><small>2025-11-25 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2510511186d2b2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957263/china-launches-shenzhou-22-early-for-stranded-space-station-crew' target='_blank'><strong>China launches Shenzhou-22 early for stranded space station crew</strong></a><br><p>China conducted an urgent unmanned spacecraft launch on Tuesday, after damage to a previous mission’s return capsule left the crew on its space station without a means of getting back to Earth.
The Long March-2F rocket carrying Shenzhou-22 lifted off shortly after midday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China, footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed.
Shenzhou-22 was originally slated for a crewed launch in 2026. But it was launched early after a suspected space debris strike to the Shenzhou-20 return capsule made it unsafe for re-entry to Earth, leaving its crew briefly stranded.
 






The Shenzhou-20 team returned aboard Shenzhou-21 on November 14 — nine days later than planned — leaving their relief crew without a reliable return vehicle.
Recent Shenzhou missions have been used to crew China’s Tiangong space station, exchanging teams of three astronauts every six months.
The accelerated launch ensures Shenzhou-21 astronauts Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang have a safe return option.
The three were “working normally and in good condition”, the China Manned Space Agency said on Monday before the Shenzhou-22 launch.
China is the third nation to put humans in orbit after the United States and the former Soviet Union. It has been excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the US banned Nasa from collaborating with Beijing.
It has since sought to bring other countries into its efforts and signed a deal with Pakistan in February to recruit the first foreign “taikonauts” — a term used for astronauts in China’s space programme.</p><small>2025-11-25 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251038266378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957261/22-terrorists-killed-in-intelligence-based-operation-in-kps-bannu-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>22 terrorists killed in intelligence-based operation in KP’s Bannu: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Twenty-two India-sponsored terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
A statement by the ISPR said that security forces conducted the IBO on Monday, based on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists in the area.
The ISPR also said that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue with full pace to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.”
 






Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered.
According to the state-run APP, initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.</p><small>2025-11-25 05:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2507524583fb370.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957204/pm-shehbaz-eliminates-025pc-export-surcharge' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz eliminates 0.25pc export surcharge</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday eliminated the 0.25 per cent Export Development Surcharge (EDS) to relieve exporters and boost Pakistan’s competitiveness on international markets.
The decision was made during a meeting, chaired by the prime minister, during which proposals from a dedicated working group were reviewed. Among the key recommendations was the removal of the EDS to ease pressure on the export sector and strengthen its global competitiveness.
An official announcement from the Prime Minister’s Secretariat said that the premier has directed the immediate abolition of the EDS imposed on domestic exports. He also directed the review of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan for reforms and its revamp.
Earlier, the premier had constituted a dedicated Working Group on the Export Development Surcharge (EDS), led by convener Musadaq Zulqarnain. The group included private sector members Shahzad Saleem, Misbah Naqvi, Khurram Mukhtar, Arif Saeed, Ahmad Umair, and Sualeh Faruqi. State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul were also part of the group.

Directs EDF money must be spent on boosting competitiveness of Pakistani goods on world markets

The terms of reference (TORs) of the group were to evaluate the efficacy of existing projects under the Export Development Fund (EDF) and propose measures to enhance the competitiveness of Pakistan’s exporters. After extensive deliberations and consensus-building, the Working Group submitted its recommendations to the Prime Minister last week.
PM Shehbaz issued special directives for a third-party audit of the EDF for the past five years, in accordance with international standards. He emphasised that the fund must be utilised to enhance domestic exports, support related research and development, provide skill training to the sector’s workforce, and provide world-class facilities. He added that any irrelevant or unjustified use of the fund would not be tolerated.
It was also decided that an interim steering committee, led by the private sector, will be constituted to ensure that the Rs52 billion currently available in the EDF is allocated strictly to projects that directly contribute to export enhancement. The projects should be carried out solely for R&D and skill development, and no money should be spent on infrastructure.
The matter of excessive taxation on exports was also raised during the meeting. It was highlighted that the effective tax burden on exporters is currently much higher than on domestic businesses.
Another Working Group, under the convenorship of Shahzad Saleem, has already submitted its recommendations on the tax burden on the export sector.The premier also instructed that a competent private sector chairman be appointed to ensure the optimal use of the fund’s available resources.
He resolved to promote and market Pakistan’s export products worldwide. He emphasised that providing maximum support to industrialists to enhance domestic exports is one of the government’s top priorities.

It was the sixth attack on the Jaffar Express bet­ween Quetta and Sibi during the past one and a half months.
Railway officials said the Jaffar Express depar­ted Quetta for its destination, Peshawar, on schedule, and after crossing Mach station, when it rea­ched near Aab-i-Gum, ar­­med men opened fire on the train from the nearby mountains.
Security personnel, in­­cluding Railways Police tr­­­avelling on the train, im­mediately retaliated and returned fire. How­ever, after a brief exch­an­­ge, the assailants escaped from the area.
Railway officials said all bogies of the Jaffar Express remained safe in the armed attack. “No cas­ualty was reported in the shooting and all passengers travelling on the train remained safe,” a senior railway official said.
He said the train was stopped after the firing in­­cident and later procee­ded to its next destination after security clearance. Security on the railway track was tightened following the armed attack on the train.
The Jaffar Express has been facing continuous attacks, including a bomb blast on the railway track between Quetta and Jacobabad.

“If the FCC hears and decides ICAs that were moved against decisions of the Supreme Court, it will create the impression that the court is sitting as an appellate forum over Supreme Court judgements, whereas the 27th Constitutional Amend­ment contains no such provision,” argued senior counsel Ibad-ur-Rehman Lodhi.
Consequently, Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was heading a six-member FCC bench, adjourned the proceedings to allow the counsel to file an appropriate petition on the matter. The counsel later told Dawn that he would file a miscellaneous application within the present ICA instead of submitting a separate petition.
 
 

The issue arose when the FCC bench, also comprising Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah, took up a set of ICAs concerning the All Public Universities BPS Teachers Association (APUBTA), an organisation that had earlier highlighted vacant positions across public-sector universities, including vice-chancellors, presidents, vice presidents, registrars, faculty heads, department heads, controllers of examination, and directors of finance.

Question of jurisdiction surfaces when court takes up varsity teachers’ appeals

When the case was taken up, Advocate Lodhi representing one of the petitioners, vice chancellor Dr Akhtar Ali Kalhoro of the NFC Institute of Engineering, Multan, argued that the FCC could not hear the matter because the appeal had been filed under Section 5 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
He contended that the matter should instead be referred back to the SC, which had issued adverse remarks against the petitioner. However, the CJ reminded him that the SC could no longer hear petitions filed under Article 184(3), which relates to the enforcement of fundamental rights, now omitted under the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “Where is Article 184(3) in the Constitution as it stands today?” Justice K.K. Agha asked.
The counsel responded that at the time the appeal was filed before the SC, Article 184(3) was still in effect, even though Article 175(E) now vests original jurisdiction in the FCC to hear such matters. He noted that no appeal or petition under Article 175(E) was pending before the SC that would require transferring cases to the FCC; rather, the appeals had been filed under Article 185 of the Constitution. Justice Najafi observed that the amendment had broadened the scope and concept of the Article, bringing such matters within the FCC’s domain.
 
 

“Confusion inevitably arises when matters are left to assumption,” the counsel argued, adding that lawmakers did not address this anomaly. He reiterated that the SC was not seized of any petition under Article 175(E) that would warrant transferring cases to the FCC after its creation.
“Why don’t you file a separate petition on this point?” Justice Najafi suggested.
The counsel replied that if the FCC proceeded with the appeal, it would give the impression that the court was acting as an appellate body over SC decisions. He added that Article 175(F) of the 27th Ame­ndment clearly states that the FCC may hear and determine appeals arising from judgements of a high court made under Article 199 — and not those of the SC.
During the hearing, the FCC also appeared constrained by the lack of readily available copies of the Pakistan Legal Decisions or the Supreme Court Monthly Review for quick reference to prior decisions. The bench had to rely on books provided by the counsel, with two judges sharing a single copy at a time.

According to Chainalysis’s 2025 Global Adoption Index, Pakistan ranks third globally in crypto adoption, with most activity driven by small investors. Likewise, a 2020-21 report by the FPCCI estimated that Pakistanis collectively held around $20bn in cryptocurrencies. Research indicates that outside of Binance, a popular crypto exchange platform, much of the trading in cryptocurrencies occurs on local peer-to-peer platforms. These platforms enable direct transactions without Know-Your-Customer checks, allowing significant sums to move across borders with no oversight. The situation should trigger concern. The chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan recently warned that people are buying dollars from foreign exchange companies and using them to purchase crypto. This, he believes, has resulted in roughly $600m ‘disappearing’ from the formal system. If true, it could get Pakistan into trouble with the FATF yet again. Crypto can create openings for money laundering and terror financing, drawing unwanted attention from the FATF, whose requirements for regulating crypto include collecting and sharing originator and beneficiary information and ensuring that service providers are properly licensed and supervised. On the regulatory side, Pakistan is still in the early stages of building this framework. The Pakistan Crypto Council, formed earlier this year, has yet to issue comprehensive guidelines.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has begun the process of licensing service providers but is still only inviting expressions of interest from global exchanges. Given the scale of grassroots crypto activity and the ease with which unlicensed platforms operate, the potential for illicit financial flows is substantial, underscoring the need for a robust regulatory framework. The Ecap chairman’s warning should prompt the authorities to complete their homework before global watchdogs start prying into the country’s financial system again.
