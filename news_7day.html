The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.
“Minister of Interior Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani emphasised the importance of strengthening regional ties, stating that, from the Islamic Emirate’s perspective, the advancement of economic and political relations, as well as regional understanding, can be achieved through mutual respect and constructive engagement,” the Afghan interior ministry said.
It added that the special envoys of China and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening good neighbourly relations and fostering cooperation with Afghanistan based on mutual engagement. They also agreed that the sixth round of the trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers would be held in Kabul, continuing the established mechanism.
Separately, in a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said: “The meeting aimed to follow up on the fifth trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers of the three countries, held in Islamabad; prepare for the upcoming sixth ministerial round; and strengthen three-way political and economic cooperation.”
“The delegations emphasised their commitment to good neighbourly relations, regional stability, mutual respect, and constructive engagement as foundations for stronger ties,” he added.
 






Meeting with Afghan FM
Separately, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi held a meeting in Kabul with the Pakistani and Chinese special envoys and their accompanying delegations.
In a statement, the ministry said the meeting “focused on following up on the agenda of the fifthth round of the Afghanistan-China-Pakistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue”.
The fifthth round, which was held in Islamabad in May 2023, had “stressed on the need of not allowing any individual, group or party, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) etc., to use their territories to harm and threaten regional security and interests, or conduct terrorist actions and activities”.
Kabul’s trilateral meeting on May 10 decided that the sixth round of the Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue would be convened in Kabul, with preparatory measures also to be undertaken for the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries.
However, no date was announced for the trilateral meeting. “Underscoring the importance of political and economic relations with both countries, FM Muttaqi expressed hope for continued progress in these areas,” the statement added.
In a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said the meeting provided the occasion for convergence of views on economic and security cooperation as well as regional stability.
 






Meeting with Afghan commerce minister
Earlier, the Chinese and Pakistani envoys also met Afghan Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi. According to the ministry, the meeting aimed at strengthening and developing trade relations, attracting investment, and launching joint projects between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.
The meeting discussed key issues including the establishment of joint industrial parks in Afghanistan, the establishment of special economic zones, the launch of joint export processing centres, the holding of trilateral trade fairs, the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprise support centers in Afghanistan, and the facilitation of banking relations between the three countries were discussed and exchanged.
Azizi expressed gratitude for the presence of high-ranking representatives of Pakistan and China and emphasised the importance of joint and mutual cooperation, the statement said.
“The policy of the Islamic Emirate is economy-oriented, and we organise and implement programs to attract foreign investment based on this policy, taking into account common interests,” it quoted Azizi as telling the special envoys.
The Afghan minister officially invited his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts to visit Afghanistan to deepen discussions and expand cooperation.</p><small>2025-05-11 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/111409104725895.png?r=142751' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910296/sajid-sadpara-summits-worlds-seventh-highest-mountain-without-supplemental-oxygen' target='_blank'><strong>Sajid Sadpara summits world’s seventh highest mountain without supplemental oxygen</strong></a><br><p>Renowned Pakistani climber Sajid Ali Sadpara on Saturday summited the world’s seventh highest peak — Dhaulagiri at 8,167 metres — without oxygen or porter support.
On May 4, four Pakistani climbers began their expedition to climb Dhaulagiri, located in Nepal. Sadpara had reached the base camp of the peak on April 6 and had begun his rotation and climbed up to the Camp 3 and descended to the base camp.
The feat, confirmed by the Alpine Club of Pakistan, marks Sadpara’s ninth 8,000m peak, all of which were climbed without bottled oxygen and were completely unsupported.

In a statement, Seven Summit Treks said the team successfully reached the summit starting at 9:35am on Saturday, marking the first confirmed ascent of Dhaulagiri in the Spring 2025 season.
The expedition team had previously fixed ropes up to 8,050m and launched their final summit push during a favourable weather window.
The team began their summit push from Camp IV at 6:15pm on Friday, making relentless efforts to reach the top while simultaneously securing the final section of the route by fixing over 350m of rope.
This year, Kangchenjunga has seen an impressive turnout, with nearly 70 international climbers and an equal number of Sherpas taking on the challenge.
“At just 29 years old, Sajid has displayed remarkable endurance, resilience, and dedication to high-altitude mountaineering,” the Alpine Club of Pakistan said in a statement.
His Dhaulagiri expedition was organised by Seven Summit Treks Nepal and Sabroso Pakistan, with technical gear sponsored by Kailas.
“[Sadpara] is the proud son of the legendary Muhammad Ali Sadpara, who tragically lost his life during a winter ascent of K2 in 2021. Carrying his father’s legacy with honour, Sajid has emerged as a powerful symbol of Pakistani mountaineering strength and global excellence.
Karrar Haidri, secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, congratulated Sadpara, calling it “a historic milestone that reflects the strength and courage of Pakistani climbers on the world stage”.
“This is another proud moment for Pakistan and the mountaineering world!”
While speaking to Dawn.com before beginning his summit push, Sadpara had said he would attempt to climb the peak without supplement oxygen and porter support.
Sadpara has already summited eight of the world’s peaks above 8,000m, including Everest, K2 , Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, and Gasherbrum-II.
He has also taken part in rescue operations at several peaks including K2, and plans to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000m.
Sadpara has made a name for himself in the alpine community with his summits of the most daunting peaks at a young age.
He has climbed K2 twice; once without supplemental oxygen. He also set records when he summited both Gasherbrum-I and Gasherbrum-II peaks in three days and 18 hours without supplementary oxygen.
In February 2021, his father Muhammad Ali Sadpara, Iceland’s John Snorri and Chile’s Juan Pablo Mohr went missing while attempting to summit the K2 during the winter season.
Their bodies were found in July, nearly five months after they went missing.
Sadpara described the search for the bodies of his father and other missing climbers as “the most challenging and extraordinary mission” of his life.
“First, the summit of K2 itself was a dangerous adventure and the burial of my father above eight thousand metres was heartbreaking,” he said.
“It was impossible to take the bodies back to base camp so we decided to bury them on the mountain.”
Now, Sajid Sadpara said his mission to summit all 14 peaks above eight-thousand metres altitude without supplementary oxygen would be the fulfilment of his father’s dream.
For him, climbing was something he was born to take up.
“When you get an environment where you listen and practice only to become a mountaineer, you definitely become one,” he explained while talking about his father’s training.</p><small>2025-05-11 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/11155012a0854cc.jpg?r=155053' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910312/bus-carrying-pilgrims-crashes-killing-21-in-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Bus carrying pilgrims crashes killing 21 in Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>An overcrowded bus carrying dozens of Buddhist pilgrims plummeted into a precipice in Sri Lanka on Sunday, killing at least 21 and injuring 24, a senior transport official said.
The island nation’s winding roads are among the most dangerous in the world, and the crash off a cliffside road on Sunday was among the deadliest recorded in Sri Lanka in decades.
The roof and side panels of the bus were sheared off, and more than half the seats were ripped from the floor of the vehicle, which landed wheels up into a tea plantation, photos of the wreckage showed.
The state-owned bus was carrying around 70 passengers — about 20 more than its capacity — through the central hilly region of Kotmale when the driver lost control and it veered off the road before dawn, police said.
“We are trying to establish whether it was a mechanical failure or if the driver fell asleep at the wheel,” a local police official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to media.
Deputy Transport Minister Prasanna Gunasena told reporters at the scene that the injured were rushed to two area hospitals.
“Twenty-one have died and we are trying to identify the victims,” Gunasena said.
The toll could have been higher, the minister added, if not for local residents helping pull people from the mangled wreckage and rushing them to hospital.
Police said 24 people were being treated in the two hospitals.
One survivor told a local journalist that he had been in the front section of the bus and was lucky to have escaped with only minor injuries.
“The bus was leaning to the left side and as the driver was negotiating a bend, he lost control and it fell down the precipice,” said the man, who did not give his name, in a video seen by AFP.
The bus was travelling from the pilgrim town of Kataragama in the island’s deep south to the central city of Kurunegala, a distance of about 250 kilometres.
Sri Lanka records an average of 3,000 road fatalities annually, making the island’s roads among the most deadly in the world.
Sunday’s bus accident was one of the worst in the country since April 2005, when a driver attempted to beat a train at a level crossing in the town of Polgahawela. The bus driver was lightly injured, but 37 passengers were killed.
In March 2021, 13 passengers and the driver of a privately owned bus died when the vehicle crashed into a precipice in Passara, about 100 kilometres east of the scene of the crash on Sunday.</p><small>2025-05-11 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681fceaeb9cec.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910153/the-hope-and-despair-of-fertility-treatments' target='_blank'><strong>THE HOPE AND DESPAIR OF FERTILITY TREATMENTS</strong></a><br><p>Cradling her two-month-old twin girls in a quiet apartment in Dubai, Zenub is the perfect picture of the radiant mother she struggled so hard to become. Yet, the path to attaining this joy was not an easy one.
Married in 2016, she and her husband waited until five years later to attempt to become parents, only to be met with heartache and physical trauma. Two ectopic pregnancies — a life-threatening condition when a fertilised egg grows outside the main cavity of the uterus — left the young woman shattered in both body and spirit.
“The treatment was harsh,” she remembers during our Zoom interview, explaining how the effects of the chemotherapy medication to treat the condition kept her alive but ravaged her body.
Nonetheless, Zenub’s desire to become a mother never wavered.
But a further ectopic, the doctors cautioned, could prove deadly. IVF (in vitro fertilisation), sometimes called the ‘test tube baby’ procedure, was now the only option for her. A friend, who had also conceived via IVF guided Zenub to award-winning specialist gynaecologist DrZeryab Setna in Karachi.

While IVF treatment offers hope to couples struggling with infertility in Pakistan, that hope comes at a high cost and with no guarantees. Expensive procedures, societal stigma and unethical practices can often add to the emotional and financial burden borne by couples opting for assisted reproduction

With her medical reports from the Middle East and an uncertain sense of hope, she flew to Karachi to initiate the gruelling procedure, spending more than Rs1 million on tests, scans, drugs, egg retrieval, transfer and an anaesthesia procedure.
“You are taking your body to hell, and your beliefs to the test,” says Zenub, who chose to be identified by her first name only. And yet, with one baby snuggled into each of her arms, she acknowledges that the journey was worth every tear, every rupee.
Not all stories, though, end in such triumph.
In Lahore, Saima*, 36, has a darker tale to tell. She sold her wedding jewellery while her husband, a low-ranked government employee, borrowed hefty amounts to pay for an Rs800,000 IVF attempt, only to discover that there were no healthy embryos and therefore no pregnancy. “I feel incomplete because of the taunts I receive from my in-laws,” she says, her pain also fuelled by rising debt.
Beyond financial loss, some couples face deception, as Saif* and his wife learned in Karachi. Lured by a Facebook advert promising 100 percent success through IVF — a scientifically ludicrous claim — they found themselves confused and dismissed. Saif says, “The doctor at this DHA clinic didn’t want to listen to us. We were clueless about what was happening during our consultation. I think it was a scam.”
Their stories are not isolated, each one portraying a larger, more complicated picture of assisted reproduction in the country. From hope to heartbreak, IVF in Pakistan is a journey of extremes.
Across the country, the coveted procedure — which combines male and female reproductive cells in a laboratory to create a baby — promises miracles and sometimes makes them happen. But for many, it delivers confusion, heartbreak and debt. Costs range from Rs600,000 at private clinics to Rs200,000–350,000 in public centres. But beyond money, couples face cultural stigma, misinformation and, sometimes, unethical practices, where poor communication and questionable staff qualifications leave patients vulnerable.
THE STIGMA SURROUNDING FERTILITY TREATMENT
Infertility is not just a medical condition — it’s a deeply emotional experience, made even harder by the societal pressures that come with it. “Society sees children as the ultimate purpose of matrimony,” says Dr Nighat Ali Shah, Professor and Head of the Department at the Sindh Reproductive & Genetic Health Centre (SRGHC), part of the Jinnah Sindh Medical University, where the Sindh government has set up the first IVF centre in the province. She points out that couples struggling with infertility can feel isolated and judged.
The emotional toll of infertility is something many couples face in silence, but Dr Gul Rana Ahmed, Infertility and IVF Expert at the OVA IVF Clinic, Pakistan, believes that it’s vital to offer support, not just medically, but emotionally, too. “We offer counselling and help, especially after failed cycles,” she shares.
The road to parenthood can be long and full of heartache, but compassionate care can make a world of difference, easing the heavy burden that stigma places on couples. Transparency, open conversations, and accessible mental health support are essential to help couples go through this challenging journey, she says.
This stigma also fuels misconceptions, particularly about who bears the burden of infertility, explains Dr Tabaan Khan, a gynaecologist and Senior Medical Officer at Sindh Integrated Emergency and Health Services. Shedding light on the situation in Pakistan, she says that normally, people who go for fertility treatments fall in the age group of 32 to 38.
“This is typically the age when couples in Pakistan seek fertility treatment. What I’ve observed is that men often hesitate to undergo testing due to stigma. There’s a widespread belief, not just among men but within entire families, that infertility is solely a woman’s issue. But that’s not true,” she explains.
Dr Tabaan adds that male factor infertility accounts for nearly 45 to 50 percent of cases in the country. “The problem is that many men go undiagnosed due to hesitation, denial, or disbelief that they could be the cause. That’s why, at fertility centres now, we make it a point to test both partners when they come in.”
For Humaira*, this reluctance delayed her journey to parenthood. After 10 years of marriage, she travelled from Birmingham to Lahore for fertility treatment. The cause of their infertility was male-related, but her husband’s hesitation delayed their decision to start treatment. “He resisted for years and would have emotional outbursts before agreeing to treatment,” she says.
Initially, the couple tried IUI (intrauterine insemination) in the UK but, after three failed cycles, they turned to IVF in Lahore to save on costs. “The UK treatment was too expensive, and our insurance wouldn’t cover more.”
At a well-known Lahore clinic, Humaira and her husband were advised to combine IVF with ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection), where a single sperm is injected into an egg. The first cycle showed promise with a healthy embryo, but it didn’t implant. “The treatment was costly by Pakistani standards, but, in the end, it is God’s will,” she reflects.
Though the couple has paused treatment, Humaira says she still dreams of having a child. “My husband is open to adoption, but it’s hard to let go. I regret the time lost because of his initial hesitation to treatment.”

THE HIGH COST OF IVF
Stories such as Humaira’s show the emotional toll, but the financial burden of IVF weighs just as heavily, as seen by the experiences of Zenub and Saima. While Zenub’s Rs1 million IVF treatment resulted in her twin daughters, Saima had to endure a financial crisis that left her dreams unfulfilled.
Married for eight years now, Saima was 28 when she tied the knot, while her husband was 33. They soon started trying for a baby after their wedding but failed. Several doctor appointments and tests later, no underlying cause could be established: they were diagnosed as having unexplained infertility. With the years going by with no pregnancy, family pressure intensified and gossip gave way to advice for her husband to remarry for the sake of having an heir.
Saima recalls, “One of my cousins was also having a similar problem with conceiving. Her husband worked in Saudi Arabia, so they could afford the IVF treatment. They had a child after 10 years of marriage, which gave me hope.”
“So, I began insisting we also go for IVF, and my husband was on board. I sold all my wedding jewellery, and my husband, who barely earns enough to feed the whole household, including his siblings, parents, and me, took loans from people. We paid a total of Rs800,000 to a very well-known clinic in Lahore and they were quite transparent with us, telling us that success wasn’t guaranteed but they’d try their best.”
As she underwent the procedure at the age of 34 , the doctors could only retrieve 12 eggs from her first cycle, but none of them could give a euploid (an embryo with the normal number of chromosomes).
“We are shattered,” she says. “We can’t afford another round immediately but I’m saving up money again to try a second time. My husband has yet to pay off the loans we initially took, so I have joined a rotating credit fund.”
Infertility treatments, in particular IVF, can be very costly, which is of great concern for couples. The costs can pile up fast, from consultation fees to medication and treatment costs, and additional cycles. For couples from relatively low- or medium-income families, the financial burden can render treatment almost inaccessible.
Nonetheless, couples go to great lengths to make the treatment possible, even if they have to exhaust all their savings, as in the case of Saima.
According to Dr Setna, who runs the renowned The Fertility Clinic By Setna in Karachi, while costs do cause some constraints, most couples — irrespective of their socio-economic status — seek help and consider IVF.
“Unfortunately,” Dr Setna explains, “IVF is an expensive treatment with almost all inputs, including medication, being imported. We are unable to offer discounts generally, but we have partnered with Oraan, a financial services provider to facilitate instalment plans for our patients.
“Our patients are welcome to contact the Oraan platform, which will help develop an instalment plan that works for them.”
Dr Gul Rana also says that due to the high costs, many low-income couples find it difficult to opt for a second attempt. “However, those who are highly motivated to have a child often save up or seek financial help to try again,” she says. “Many clinics, including ours, offer discounts, or low-cost cycles for financially constrained couples, to make treatment more accessible.”
PUBLIC AND NON-PROFIT IVF CENTRES — A RAY OF HOPE?
To ease these financial burdens, public and non-profit IVF centres offer a lifeline for low-income couples. While there is an acute dearth of public-funded IVF centres in the country, the SRGHC, a project of the Sindh government, provides hope despite its challenges. Limited resources, the high prices of imported medication, and the need to outsource certain tests mean the treatment isn’t entirely free, though costs are significantly subsidised.
The IVF centre at SRGHC, developed under the guidance of Dr Shah, functions in collaboration with various laboratories. “While we don’t have a full embryology lab yet, we do offer andrology services such as semen analysis, hormonal work-ups, and IUI procedures,” she explains. “The unit operates seven days a week, regardless of emergencies. It doesn’t stop.”
Dr Shah adds that in discussions with the government — which has shown strong interest in supporting fertility services — she proposed a three-pronged financing model: one-third of the cost covered by the patient, one-third subsidised by the government, and one-third provided as a loan.
“At our clinic, we once had a woman whose husband sold his rickshaw, their only source of income, to pay for the IVF treatment,” recalls Dr Shah. “Despite their sacrifice, the cycle failed. We managed to raise internal funds to cover some costs and refunded what we could for another cycle. But that kind of support is rare and not something private clinics can typically offer, as they must cover all expenses themselves. We, on the other hand, were able to manage it only because of government funding and other support.”
Dr Shah notes that, while SRGHC covers doctor and lab fees, patients must still bear the cost of medicines, which typically falls between Rs100,000 and Rs150,000, depending on their age and hormonal response.
“Younger women often need fewer injections, keeping costs down, but older or less responsive patients may require up to six shots a day, which quickly adds up,” she explains, adding that price gouging by pharmaceutical companies makes matters worse.
“On day six of a patient’s cycle, for example, a supplier refused to release medicines unless we paid double,” she recalls. SRGHC covered the difference, leaning on cooperative pharmacies and clinics such as The Fertility Clinic by Setna to help source supplies.
 

A visual representation of the stages of the IVF process: IVF success rates vary globally and are influenced by factors such as patient age, health and clinic protocols

THE DECLINE IN FERTILITY
Efforts to improve access come as infertility rates rise, creating a growing need for such services. World Health Organisation (WHO) data from 2024 shows that globally, one in six people face infertility, defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of trying. Pakistan, the world’s fifth-most populous country, presents a complicated demographic profile, with both high rates of fertility and infertility.
According to the non-profit organisation Population Council’s ‘Pakistan@2050’ report, the country’s fertility rate is higher than both South Asian and global averages, second only to Afghanistan. The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (2020) shows a total fertility rate of 3.7, with 3.0 being wanted fertility, meaning many women have more children than desired. The country also faces high infertility rates, with a prevalence of 21.9 percent, including 3.5 percent primary and 18.4 percent secondary infertility, according to the Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences. Primary infertility is the condition where a woman has never conceived, while secondary infertility is when a woman has conceived before but is unable to do so again.
As explained by the Mayo Clinic, infertility, affecting both men and women, can result from hormonal imbalances, genetic disorders, lifestyle choices, and reproductive system issues. For women, causes include irregular ovulation, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), blocked or damaged fallopian tubes, or endometriosis. In men, low sperm count, hormonal imbalances, and reproductive system issues can contribute to infertility. Sometimes, the cause remains unexplained.
Presenting her observations over the last 10 years, Dr Shah says that rising pollution, consumption of processed foods, as well as climate change, have been key drivers in contributing towards poor quality eggs as well as sperm.
According to Dr Shah, “I have noticed an extremely prominent decrease in the quality of mature follicles over the past 10 years. When earlier, we used to take and put them under the microscope, we used to have a good feeling that these were healthy follicles. Now, even with young females, what we find is that they degenerate very rapidly.”
She notes that one of the most common conditions seen in women visiting fertility clinics is PCOS, which is highly prevalent in the population. “Among men, contributing factors include the use of substances such as paan [betel], gutka, chhalia, cigarette, and naswar, all of which affect sperm quality.” Over time, she observes, these factors appear to be contributing to a steady decline in reproductive health.
With infertility on the rise, waiting to start a family can stack the odds against couples. Career dreams, money troubles, or life’s twists often lead couples to delay having kids, only to hit the wall of age-related fertility decline. For women past 35, becoming pregnant gets harder, and IVF, though a lifeline, grows tougher with time, dimming the spark of hope.
Asma*, now a 40-year-old banker, underwent three unsuccessful intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles, beginning at the age of 36, in Lahore before turning to IVF in Karachi. Her age, along with diabetes and hypertension, complicated the process. “I do regret waiting so long and not trying in my early 30s,” she says.
After exhausting her savings and taking on loans, she developed ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS), a painful side effect of IVF. Even so, she was able to freeze three viable embryos. In an unexpected turn, she conceived naturally at 38 and gave birth at 39. “Our daughter is nothing short of a miracle,” she says. She has opted to still keep the embryos for the future.
According to Asma, IVF can offer hope, but it also brings risk, uncertainty, and financial strain. Her advice to others is simple: “If you’re over 35 and trying, don’t put it off. Look into your options early if you can.”
Doctors agree that while IVF can still work later in life, age has a clear impact on fertility. “IVF is generally most effective before 35,” says Dr Setna. “But we do see promising outcomes with customised protocols, even in women in their early 40s.”
Dr Gul Rana shares a similar view, saying many women in their late 30s and 40s have conceived at her clinic with the help of individualised treatments.
Still, biology has its limits. “Women are born with a fixed number of eggs,” explains Dr Shah. “And men’s sperm quality starts to drop after 44, especially with stress, poor diet, or smoking.” She advises couples not to delay seeking help and to keep options such as adoption in mind if treatment doesn’t succeed.
As for IVF success rates, they vary globally and are influenced by factors such as patient age, health and clinic protocols. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) reports IVF success rates of 30-35 percent for women under 35, dropping to 25-30 percent for ages 35-37, and lower still for women over 40. In Europe, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) cites a 20-40 percent success range, with similar age-related declines.
In Pakistan, IVF success rates align with global trends but vary by clinic, technology and patient demographics. The Fertility Clinic by Setna reports 35-40 percent success across age groups. OVA IVF & Reproductive Health Clinic notes 25-35 percent success per cycle, though cumulative cycles can lead to higher take-home baby rates. The SRGHC reports lower success rates of 17-18 percent, likely due to limited resources and broader patient access.
NEED FOR STRICTER REGULATION
While age and access shape IVF outcomes, unethical practices in Pakistan can add another layer of pain for couples, as discovered by Saif and others. Following three unsuccessful attempts at conception, Saif, 31, and his wife, 27, decided to go for IVF on the advice of friends and family.
“I found one such clinic located in Karachi’s DHA through an ad on Facebook that promised 100 percent success with a foreign-qualified doctor,” says Saif.  “The beginning of the consultation was promising, as the doctor assured us that a 27-year-old woman couldn’t develop complications. He even told us that we would be able to choose a boy through the procedure, and quoted us the price of Rs800,000 for the first round of egg retrieval.”
But as the conversation went on, Saif said he began to feel increasingly uncomfortable. “When I asked questions about his lab, he said he outsourced everything but never provided any clear responses. My questions were making him upset.
“We consulted with everyone and decided not to proceed with it. The clinic seemed dubious. I did try to Google whether it had branches in the countries it listed but couldn’t find anything. I’m grateful I didn’t pay, as my instincts worked. But when couples are desperate and they are assured of the results, I can understand how difficult it is to resist. My wife was very upset with me. She still is. We are saving a bit more and are going to go to a clinic that is the most reliable one in Karachi.”
Sidra*, 35, who has been married for eight years but never actively tried conceiving a baby, had a similarly unpleasant experience at the same DHA clinic Saif and his wife had gone to. “My friend and I went to check out IVF because of its upscale DHA location,” she remembers. “The consultation was unprofessional. The doctor, seated at a laptop, dismissed our questions regarding age and number of eggs, said the AMH [Anti-Müllerian Hormone] test was unnecessary, made derogatory remarks about other doctors, and said my friend’s eggs were ‘unused’ because she wasn’t having intercourse. His business card had misspellings, and his lack of knowledge felt like deceit.”
Sidra is worried about unsuspecting patients getting duped in such an upmarket area. “I am a layperson but know the AMH test is necessary before IVF. I wonder how such a clinic is running. Where are the authorities? Is there an error-check mechanism to verify the credentials of the doctor or can anyone set up a clinic and play with people’s lives?”
Like Sidra, Ayesha*, a 38-year-old educator, says she felt she was deceived at an upscale Lahore clinic that promised her an 80 percent IVF success rate for Rs600,000. Her hopes crumbled when four embryos failed.
In 2023, she underwent IVF with ICSI at a well-known IVF clinic in Lahore due to her husband’s low sperm motility, costing Rs550,000 plus Rs70,000 in tests. The process, with frequent visits and costly injections, was gruelling. “The clinic’s rush, with too few doctors, felt like a scam,” she says, cursing long waits and broken promises.
Ayesha endured steroid side effects, which were initially dismissed as “normal” but were later blamed on her body. Only two weak embryos survived from six eggs, contradicting the 80 percent claim. “They pinned it on us,” she says, heartbroken and in debt.
Dr Tabaan warns of the dangers of unregulated clinics. “They falsely claim 100 percent IVF success, ignoring factors like age, and some offer illegal gender selection, risking patient health. Seven or eight out of 10 patients at these clinics seek gender selection, which is unethical and unsafe. With no effective reporting channels, these practices persist, as patients rarely disclose their experiences due to stigma.”
She notes that many small clinics popping up in different cities lack the expertise for complex IVF, leading to high failure rates and potential health risks from improper medications or procedures.
A DREAM WORTH FIGHTING FOR
IVF in Pakistan tests hearts and wallets, with couples facing stigma, debt and deceit for a shot at parenthood. The journey is fraught with financial and emotional stress, accompanied by public judgment and unethical activities in a poorly regulated sector. Unfortunately, there is often also a cultural stigma attached to and not enough awareness regarding alternatives to expensive medical intervention, such as adoption.
However, amid demands for more transparency and reform are tales of hope and victory. Zenub’s journey is one such story, a testament to the strength and hope many cling to despite all odds.
“After my miscarriages, I thought I’d never even have one baby, but God has blessed me with two,” she says with a smile, her eyes brimming with tears of joy. “When someone says, ‘You spent one million on IVF?’, I tell them: ‘I’d spend all the money in my life to hold my daughters in my arms.’ There is nothing in life like the feeling of being a mother. I couldn’t ask for more.”

In a Truth Social post following the first day of talks in Geneva on Saturday, Trump praised the “very good” discussions and deemed them “a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner”.
Earlier, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua also described the talks in Switzerland as “an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue”.
The second day of closed-door meetings between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng resumed shortly after 10am (1pm PKT) on Sunday.
As of Saturday, the talks were taking place at the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, a discrete villa with sky-blue shutters near a large park on the left bank of Lake Geneva.
“These talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,” Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told AFP, calling the tariffs a “lose-lose proposition”.
‘Good news’
The discussions are the first time senior officials from the world’s two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the thorny topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking a robust retaliation from Beijing.
The tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 per cent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245pc.
In retaliation, China put 125pc tariffs on US goods.
Ahead of the meeting, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80pc Tariff on China seems right!”
However, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and that China would also need to make concessions.
Going into the meeting, both sides played down expectations of a major change in trade relations, with Bessent underlining a focus on “de-escalation” and not a “big trade deal,” and Beijing insisting the United States must ease tariffs first.
The fact that the talks are even happening “is good news for business, and for the financial markets,” said Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
But Hufbauer cautioned he was “very skeptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations,” with even a tariff rate of 70pc to 80pc still potentially halving bilateral trade.</p><small>2025-05-11 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/111221184eb3c02.jpg?r=122656' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910172/imf-wants-cut-in-auto-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>IMF wants cut in auto tariffs</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The local auto industry and its suppliers are facing uncertainty ahead of the FY26 budget as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is reportedly pressuring the government to rationalise auto tariffs and permit the commercial import of used cars.
The IMF believes the auto sector is highly protective, and there is a need to rationalise tariffs to improve competitiveness and efficiency to benefit consumers. There are over 40 per cent taxes and duties on locally produced vehicles.
On May 6, auto assemblers and part vendors met Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAMP) Haroon Akhtar Khan in Islamabad and conveyed their concerns that the local industry would collapse if commercial imports of used cars are allowed and tariffs on CBU are lowered below a certain threshold.
The SAPM assured them that the government did not intend to jeopardise the industry and the investments. On the contrary, the ministry will protect the local industry and try to achieve balanced tariffs with industry consultation.
The old guards within the local assemblers and parts vendors are alarmed as the government moves to rationalise the excessively high tariff protection under the IMF’s direction.

Assemblers fear collapse of industry if used cars’ commercial import allowed

The part makers have been operating under the highest tariff protection, enjoying effective rates as high as 98pc. The landed price of any part is valued at $100, with 46pc duty, 18pc GST, and minimum 15pc margins, totalling $198.
 
 

They stressed this entire burden must be borne by consumers, who are already grappling with inflation and stagnant wages. The IMF, recognising the extraordinarily high effective tariff protection rate, has recently directed the government to rationalise the tariffs under the latest standby arrangements.
This will provide a lot of relief to consumers, as prices may be adjusted with a reduced duty structure. The old guards within Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam) wish to maintain the highly inefficient tariff structure and are seeking meetings with government officials to resist IMF demands.
Their usual arguments are that any reduction in tariffs will cause irreparable damage to the industry without addressing the core issue of overprotection and excessive pricing of parts in the market.
However, auto parts vendors, under the umbrella Paapam, believe that their competitiveness can be judged through the supply of Rs325 billion worth of auto parts to the local industry, estimating a foreign exchange saving of minimum $480 million annually, along with collateral advantage of direct jobs of over 150,000 and over 500,000 indirect jobs through Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers, besides providing taxes separately to the state coffers.
During the first stage, the government has proposed to rationalise tariffs by five per cent to 10-15pc, along with gradual reduction in additional customs duty (ACD) and regulatory duty (RD). The tariff reduction on higher engine size CBU is proposed to be much higher.
Part makers contest that their pricing are generally on a landed cost (minus) model, thus saving foreign exchange and assuring price stability, though their competitiveness can be judged if they can compete on FOB cost instead of landed cost.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Industries has been questioning part makers and local assemblers that if they are indeed competitive and produce global quality parts and vehicles, then why have they not been able to export from Pakistan?
Many Paapam members have invested in modern technologies, followed by joint ventures and technical collaborations with various foreign companies. Over 40 Paapam members are also exporting parts to Europe, Africa, the US and China, though the exports are negligible.
Paapam disagrees with the IMF impression that the Pakistani automotive sector rests upon a highly supportive tariff-protective sector.
An auto assembler said rationalisation of auto tariffs, along with added competition by new entrants, will help the government reduce vehicle prices and may also help in improving sluggish demand in the auto sector.

According to Gwadar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zia Mandokhail, a residential quarter of people belonging to Punjab was targeted with a hand grenade near Bilal Mosque located on Syed Hashmi Avenue. The attackers fired in the air and fled the scene.
As the attackers attempted to flee, the police constable present at the scene took immediate action and chased one of the attackers.
The timely police action led to one attacker, Shah Jahan, being killed, while the other, Shahzad, was seriously injured.
In the exchange of fire, however, policeman Muhammad Khamari was martyred.
Three others were also injured in the attack, according to SSP Mandokhail.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March 2025, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

ISLAMABAD: Norma­lity returns to the Sub­continent after Pakistan and India agreed on Saturday to a full and immediate ceasefire after days of deadly jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — news surprisingly announced by US President Donald Trump, who congratulated them on using “common sense”.
Officials from Islam­abad and New Delhi confirmed the development mi­­n­utes after Mr Trump posted the ann­ouncement on his Truth Social net­work, as the conflict bet­ween the nuclear-armed neighbours appeared to be spiralling towards a full-blown war.
“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congra­tulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” Mr Trump posted.
In a statement on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect. Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added.
 






Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the two countries’ military operations chiefs had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT), without using the word “ceasefire”. He said the two DGMOs would speak to each other again on May 12.
Mr Dar told Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had actively helped to facilitate the agreement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US Presi­dent Donald Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region. “Pakistan appreciates the US for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” he said in a post on X.
 






The ceasefire comes after four days of attacks and counter-attacks by both sides that killed at least 60 people and saw thousands of civilians flee their homes along their border as well as in Azad and occupied Kashmir.
The fighting was touched off by an attack last month in the India-held Kashmir town of Pahalgam that killed 26 tourists, which Delhi blamed on Islamabad.
Pakistani military sources said armed forces had shot down at least 77 Israeli-made high-tech drones, while Indian officials claimed they had destroyed hundreds of Pakistani drones, many Turkish-made.
Pakistan also says it downed five Indian warplanes — including three French Rafale fighter jets — although New Delhi has not confirmed any losses.
This was the first time the two nations used drone attacks on a large scale against each other. Both countries have been developing their own drones, and they also import them.
Punitive measures in place
Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now.
The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Pahalgam attack, would continue to remain in abeyance.
Meanwhile, in contradiction to Mr Misri’s statement that the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of Pakistan and India would “talk again on May 12 at 12pm (11:30am Pakistan time)”, the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting reported that “there is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place”.
Quoting its Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian information ministry tweeted that the “stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries”.
“The Pak DGMO initiated the call this afternoon after which discussions took place and understanding reached,” it added.
Positive step
“The ceasefire is a positive step,” said Bilal Shabbir, an IT consultant in Muzaffarabad. “In war, it’s not just soldiers who die, it’s mostly civilians — and in this case, it would have been the people of Kashmir.”
Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, said both Pakistan and India “need to lift their large populations on virtually every measure of socio-economic development. We are happy that a ceasefire will help both governments to focus on this priority”.
Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, said the Indus treaty would figure prominently in the impending talks “after a decent interval, which allows both governments to claim credit for what they’ve achieved until now”.
However, within hours after the ceasefire, violations were reported from both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).
Blasts were heard in Srinagar and Jammu and projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky over Jammu, similar to the events of the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.
Residents in the city of Barnala, in Azad Kashmir, reported hearing exchan­ges of fire along the line dividing the region, according to the New York Times.
Military spokespeople in both countries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Separately, occupied Kashmir’s chief minister Omar Abdullah posted on X: “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!”
 






There were also reports from different border regions of skirmishes. Some reports also said that drones were spotted hovering over Bahawalpur.
Dawn learnt that the drones were spotted after Isha prayers, prompting citizens to come out of their homes. However, sources said the presence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is not a matter of concern as it may happen for a few days after a truce is brokered.
When contacted the district emergency officer, Police Emergency 15, Rescue 1122 Emergency Office and other security institutions, it was told that the situation was being cleared.
Deputy Commissioner Bahawalpur Dr Farhan Farooq told this scribe, via WhatsApp message, that “all intercepted” and no damage so far, Alhamdolillah“.
Rubio lauds PMs
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later revea­led that he and Vice President JD Vance had been in direct contact with senior Pakistani and Indian officials, including Prime Ministers Shehbaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, over the past two days.
In a statement released by his office, Mr Rubio said: “Over the past 48 hours, Vice President Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, and National Security Advisors Ajit Doval and Asim Malik.”
 






He added, “I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.”
He also commended PMs Sharif and Modi on “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.”
Mr Vance, who had earlier said the conflict was “fundamentally none of our business”, also endorsed the deal by reposting Mr Trump’s statement on X.
“Great work from the president’s team, especially Secretary Rubio,” Mr Vance wrote. “And my gratitude to the leaders of India and Pakistan for their hard work and willingness to engage in this ceasefire.”
 






In a separate statement, State Department Spokes­person Tammy Bruce said that Mr Rubio spoke with Mr Dar. “Secretary Rubio reiterated that both parties must find ways to de-escalate the current situation and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation. He also offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts,” she added.
Ms Bruce said that Mr Rubio also spoke with the Indian foreign minister and “emphasised that both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation”.
Secretary Rubio “further proposed US support in facilitating productive discussions to avert future disputes”, Ms Bruce added.
PM calls for dialogue
Hours after the ceasefire was announced, PM Shehbaz on Saturday expressed hope that a process of peace dialogue would take place to resolve all contentious issues between the two nuclear states, including fair distribution of water resources and the Kashmir issue.
In his address to the nation, the prime minister said Pakistan responded positively to the option of ceasefire for international and regional peace and for the sake of millions of people in the subcontinent.
He thanked opposition parties, political forces and friendly nations, including the United States, for their constructive and effective role in de-escalating tensions.
 


“We responded positively to the option of ceasefire for the sake of international and regional peace and millions of people,” PM Shehbaz said.
The premier extended special thanks to China and President Xi Jinping, saying, “China stood by Pakistan without concern for any personal gain or loss.”
He also expressed gratitude to other world leaders, including the US President Donald Trump, Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, and UN Secretary General António Guterres.
The prime minister congratulated the whole nation and armed forces for the victory in the standoff with India and said: “Today we got a historic victory. It is the victory of our principles.”
The premier said India played a shameful role in these days and Pakistani nation and armed forces gave a befitting response to the enemy what it deserved.
“In the pretext of Pahalgam incident, India imposed war on us and attacked our civilian population through drones and missiles. Then we decided that the issues which should have been resolved through dialogue, will be settled in battlefield,” he added.
Dar engages counterparts
Foreign Minister Dar also talked to his counterparts in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye and apprised them of the current situation in the region following last night’s Indian aggression and Pakis­tan’s subsequent response.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged Pakistan’s restraint and reaffirmed that China would continue to stand firmly by Pakistan.
Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan expressed condolences over the loss of innocent lives and appreciated Pakistan’s measured response.
Turkish Foreign Minister  Hakan Fidan also lauded Pak­istan’s restrained response.

The decision, announced late Saturday, follows days of street protests led by the student-driven National Citizen Party, which emerged from last year’s uprising that toppled Hasina.
Several Islamist and right-wing parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami and other opposition groups, joined the demonstrations, demanding that the Awami League be designated a terrorist organisation.
The ban would remain in place until the trial of the party and its leadership over the deaths of hundreds of protesters at the International Crimes Tribunal is completed, the government said in a statement.
The government also announced an amendment to the ICT Act, allowing the tribunal to prosecute not only individuals but also political parties and organisations. The change clears the way for the Awami League to be tried as a collective entity for alleged crimes committed during its time in power.
The Awami League, which was founded in 1949, dismissed the decision as illegitimate, posting on its official Facebook page: “All decisions of the illegal government are illegal.”
The country has seen rising tensions and protests in recent months, after deadly protests forced Hasina to flee to India in August and an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge.
Yunus pledged reforms and said the poll could be delayed until 2026.
The unrest began in July with student protests against public sector job quotas, but quickly morphed into one of the deadliest periods of political violence since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971.
In October, the government banned the Awami League’s student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, labelling it a “terrorist organisation” for its role in violent attacks on protesters.</p><small>2025-05-11 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1111450658a6b14.jpg?r=114527' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910253/people-in-lahore-celebrate-pakistan-armys-victory-over-india' target='_blank'><strong>People in Lahore celebrate Pakistan Army’s victory over India</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: People burst into celebrations after the armed forces early on Saturday responded to Indian war hysteria in a befitting manner and brought India to its knees. They celebrated the victory of the army after the ceasefire was announced in the wake of the US intervention.
Earlier in the day, Lahore also faced the first missile attack on Saturday that struck the Sundar Industrial Estate and, according to law enforcement agencies, sank into the ground. No loss of life or injury was reported. People, however, were skeptical over Pakistan’s delayed response to India’s ‘Operation Sindoor’ and aggressively asked for a befitting response. All the skepticism, however, evaporated when the army announced the launch of Bunyan-um-Marsoos and launched a powerful and well-coordinated military operation, targeting Indian military infrastructure.
As the Pakistan Army came out, saying it had avenged the blood of the innocent kids martyred in missile and drone attacks, the people shared the pictures of army artillery trucks and chanted slogans “Pakistan Zindabad. Pakistan Army Paindabad”. They took to the roads, organised rallies showing a national unity across the party lines and lauded the army for its calculated and meaningful response that even brought the mighty US to intervene and agree on a ceasefire between the neighbouring nuclear nations.
The ruling PML-N held a rally on The Mall to celebrate the success of the operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos against India. Paying tributes to the army’s befitting reply to the Indian airstrikes, the Lahorites burnt Indian and Israeli flags as well as an effigy of Indian premier Narendra Modi.

Rallies held in support of army and operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos; home dept asks law enforcement, civil defence to stay alert

Since India has been cut to size and licking its wounds, the rally participants asserted that Pakistan should not get relaxed but to win another war at the diplomatic front and ensure restoration of the Indus Waters Treaty as well as the legal status of India-held Kashmir.
As the nation showed unity in celebrating the victory and congratulating the Pakistan Army, a rally participant said, “The nation was divided and Indian Premier Modi’s false pride and arrogance helped it to unite across party lines”.
After the ceasefire, tributes and congratulation messages for the Pakistan Army’s bravery and war-ready spirit also poured in from all segments of the society and political leaders as well as PML-N president Mian Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and other political leaders across party lines. People were seen presenting flowers and garlanded army men wherever they came across them in the province.
The social media sites X, Instagram and Facebook were flooded with memes and shattered India’s propaganda, sensationalism and even serious statements and communications aimed at pressurizing Pakistanis.
As the airports opened for resuming flight operations and the expected resumption of academic and examination activities at all academic levels, students have also urged the ICAP to withdraw its notification of postponing next week’s examinations and proceed with the already notified schedule.
Earlier, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved the release of Rs2bn for emergency security arrangements in all districts and training of volunteers to enable them to deal with any emergency.
After the home department released the funds and the finance department made them available online, the respective district administrations were specifically instructed to ensure the availability of essential goods, including rations, medicines and fuel.
Though the ceasefire has been declared after the US intervention, the home department has asked all law enforcement agencies, civil defence and rescue services to stay on high alert. A home department spokesman urged the citizens not to post any videos or pictures on social media about the location of defence installations and the movement of law enforcement agencies. The citizens have also been instructed to avoid unnecessary travel, stay at home and follow the safety measures issued by the civil defence.

ISLAMABAD: After demonstrating restraint in the face of blatant Indian aggression since Wednesday, Pak­istan launched strikes early Satur­day morning targeting military installations in India and India-held Kashmir.
The strikes were launched under operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos at 5:16am.
“Bunyan-um-Marsoos” translates as a concrete structure or firm foundation.
 






The missiles, launched by aircraft and ground-based systems, targeted multiple strategic and military sites of India, security sources and state media reported.
According to the military’s media wing and Radio Pakistan, the targeted locations included S-400 missile system in Adampur; military intelligence’s training ce­n­tre in Rajouri and brigade hea­d­quarters in Uri; Adampur, Udha­mpur, Pathan­kot, Suratgarh, Sirsa, Bathinda and Halwara airfields; Akhnoor aviation base; artillery gun positions in Dehrangyari; Brahmos missile battery site in Nagrota; Brahmos storage site in Beas; and India’s Rabtanwali Post, Jazeera Post Complex, Kafir Mehri, Shahpar 3, and Ghadar Top across the Line of Control (LoC).
ISPR said PAF’s JF-17 Thunder hypersonic missiles destroyed the S-400 missile system in Adampur.
The strikes came hours after India fired missiles at three air bases in Rawlpindi, Chakwal and Shorkot, as well as the Rahim Yar Khan
airport.
All assets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) remained safe in the attack, the military spokesman said.

Pakistan has targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation, the federal government said in a statement.
“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes at three PAF airbases.
The retaliatory attacks targeted “more than 26” locations and damaged “equipment and personnel” at at least five airbases, according to Colonel Sophia Qureshi of India’s Army Signal Corps.
The damage was sustained at air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur, Bhuj and Bathinda, Col Qureshi said, according to Times of India.
India’s attack India launched missiles and drones in its late-night attack, which were shot down by ground defence systems in Punjab and Sindh.
The strikes targeted Nur Khan air base, Rawalpindi; Murid air base, Chakwal; and Shorkot air base, Inter Service Public Relations (ISPR) DG Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at a press conference.
 


Two missiles fired by India at the Shorkot airbase were shot down by the air defence system, officials said.
The debris of destroyed missiles fell near a government primary school in Pirmahal village.
No casualties were reported, while Zahoor Ahmad, 70, received minor injuries after being hit by falling debris.
A drone fired by India fell in open fields in the Ahmad Nigar village on on Chiniot-Sargodha Road.
A large number of locals gathered at the site to view the wreckage of the fallen drone.
Debris of three downed Indian drones also fell in fields in Islam Nagar village, Chak Noor Muh­ammad 11/SP and Bheela near village 13/SP during the past 36 hours.
It was collected by the police officers who took it away for further analysis.
Drones were also intercepted in Sargodha.
One of the drones fell in the area of Kirana Hills and another in open fields in Chak 48 SB village.
No casualties were reported in any of these localities.
At least four drones were also shot down in different areas of Jacobabad, Sindh, on Saturday, according to Deputy Commissioner Sameer Hussain Laghari.
The debris of scattered drones fell near the Jacobabad Institute of Medical Science and the Shah Abdul Latif Numaish (Exhibition) Ground.
Locals reported sounds of explosions as smoke filled the sky, as drones were intercepted by the ground defence systems.
According to DC Leghari, at least eight people were injured after being hit by fragments of destroyed drones. One man, who was critically injured, had been transferred to Larkana for treatment.
He added the debris had been taken into custody by the authorities.
Shelling at border
At least six people were martyred and five injured as India fired shells in Tanda and Karianwala areas of Gujrat.
The deceased included three members of a family, including a man and his two sons.
They were killed after mortar shells hit their house in Jalalpur Sobtian village of Karianwala early on Saturday morning.
The victims were identified as Nisar Ahmed, 45; Habeebur Rehman, 18; and Naeem, 12.
Mr Ahmed’s third son, Muneeb, 17, was injured and undergoing treatment at the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital.

Speaking at a press conference along with Lahore Press Club (LPC) President Arshad Ansari and prominent Sikh personalities including Sardar Bishan Singh, Satwant Kaur, Sardar Jaskaran Singh, and Kalyan Singh Kalyan, here at LPC on Saturday, the minister decried recent missile attacks on mosques and drone strikes on minority worship places, declaring these actions as part of a wider Indian conspiracy to malign Pakistan’s image and ignite religious tensions in the region.
Sardar Arora said that Pakistan could never even imagine of targeting Sikh religious sites, and emphasised that the country’s bond with the Sikh community is founded on sincerity, reverence, and mutual respect.
He categorically rejected India’s claims regarding fabricated attacks in Pahalgam, Amritsar, or near the Golden Temple, terming them baseless and pre-planned narratives aimed at misleading the global community and stirring interfaith discord.
 
 

He warned that India is attempting to instigate hatred between Muslim and Sikh communities and it is waging psychological warfare against Pakistan. Pakistan’s Sikh community is an integral part of the national fabric, he said.
“We will not allow any foreign element to jeopardise the spirit of brotherhood and interfaith harmony we have nurtured over the decades,” he said.
He urged the United Nations and international human rights organisations to take immediate notice of India’s aggressive behaviour and repeated violations against religious minorities.

RAHIM YAR KHAN: The Sheikh Zayed International Airport (SZIA) in Rahim Yar Khan district of Punjab — a landmark viewed as a symbol of friendship between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates — was struck by an air-to-surface missile fired by India in the early hours of Saturday, causing significant damage to its infrastructure, including the Royal Lounge used by the UAE president and his family.
Deputy Commissioner Khuram Javed confirmed that India targeted the airport with both a missile and a drone.
He said the airport is occasionally used by the Abu Dhabi royal family, as commercial flight operations have been suspended since 2023.
The attack destroyed the Royal Lounge, and a 10-foot-wide crater was left at the apron area of the airport.
The deputy commissioner also confirmed that the UAE embassy has been informed about the damage caused to the airport.
 


Locals living near the airport reported hearing loud blasts around 4:15am on Saturday, which caused many to wake up in alarm.
Named after the late UAE president Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the airport serves as a vital part of Pakistan’s aviation network and carries diplomatic importance because of its ties to the Gulf nation.
According to Civil Aviation Authority’s website, the airport played a vital role during 1973 and 2010 floods for logistics support, including food and other supplies, as well as transportation of flood victims.

QUETTA/ GWADAR: Unknown armed men snatched official weapons from the police and Levies force personnel on various highways of Noski and Mastung districts and also set on fire their two vehicles.
Earlier, the armed men had blocked the highways at different points in the districts.
Officials said armed men blocked the main road in Washbo area late on Friday night and intercepted two police vehicles patrolling in the area.
They took the police personnel into custody and after snatching their weapons, burnt both vehicles.
 
 

Reports suggested that the miscreants also blocked the Quetta-Taftan highway in Ahmedwal area of Noshki district. They intercepted four vehicles carrying gas from Taftan and took away four persons with them at gunpoint who belonged to Punjab. They also entered police and Levies stations and snatched their weapons.
The armed men also blocked roads in the Dasht area of Mastung district and some other areas. They checked the passing vehicles and the people travelling in these vehicles.
Two hurt in barber shop firing
Two people working at a barber shop in Turbat town were injured when armed men opened fire at the shop. It was the second incident of firing at a hairdresser during the past 24 hours. Last night, three people were killed in firing at a haircutting shop in Uthal town of Lasbela district.
Grenade attacks
In Quetta, five hand grenade attacks were carried out by unknown armed men in different areas of the provincial capital late on Friday night, while a grenade attack also took place near Railway Station Sibi, police said on Saturday.

• Ex-NSA says Pakistan has re-established deterrence, stability and balance in region
In the latest round of hostilities between India and Pakistan, a US-brokered ceasefire has sought to pause what risked spiralling into a catastrophic conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
But make no mistake: this was no negotiated compromise between equals in the conflict. Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire after securing a calculated victory by firmly denying a much stronger India the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate.
The crisis began in the wake of the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, which India swiftly blamed on Pakistan-based militants without providing evidence. Islamabad’s call for a neutral investigation was brushed aside. Instead, New Delhi escalated — launching missile and drone strikes into Pakistani territory beginning May 7. The most intense exchanges came on the night of May 9-10, one of the tensest nights in decades, when Indian forces targeted Pakistani military installations, only to face swift and strategic retaliation from Pakistan.
Pakistan’s military response during the entire crisis was measured and decisive. Retaliating to India’s Operation Sindoor, Pakistan’s forces on May 7 took down five Indian jets, including advanced Rafales, using Chinese-supplied J-10Cs and PL-15E missiles — an undeniable blow to India’s air superiority pretensions. And then on May 10, in a rare and calculated action, Pakistan neutralised Indian S-400 missile systems using hypersonic missiles fired from JF-17 aircraft. These kills — Rafales and S-400 system — sent a message not only across the border but across the globe.
 
 

“This week’s India-Pakistan conflict has marked a turning point, with modern conventional weaponry reshaping the battlefield and expanding the scope for the conventional use of force,” Muhammad Faisal, South Asia research analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said.
India’s ambitions to dominate the escalation ladder — long a cornerstone of its regional strategy — collapsed under the weight of these setbacks. The Rafale and S-400, icons of India’s defence modernisation, became symbols of its miscalculation. For the first time in years, Pakistan demonstrated not just parity but deterrent credibility that undermined India’s claims of military primacy.
Former national security adviser Gen Nasser Janjua said, “Pakistan has successfully re-established the deterrence, stability and balance in the region. Pakistan has also successfully buried the concept of limited war under a nuclear environment.”
Diplomatically, too, the tide turned. As the spectre of escalation loomed, the United States intervened — not out of favour to one side, but out of alarm. With India’s air force facing serious attrition and risk of deeper military degradation, Washington acted to cap the conflict.
Secretary of State Mark Rubio’s diplomacy made the leadership of both warring countries, including Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, negotiate. Crucially, the resulting agreement was not just about ceasing hostilities; it included Pakistan’s long-standing demand: that future talks take place at a neutral venue. This was not a face-saving gesture, it was rather a strategic vindication.
Simultaneously, the G7’s restrained statement of May 10, notably avoiding any blame on Pakistan and instead urging dialogue and de-escalation, marked a diplomatic win for Islamabad. India’s narrative — that it was the aggrieved party reacting to terrorism—failed to gain traction. Instead, New Delhi found itself incr­easingly portrayed as the aggressor, its unilateral actions and refusal of an independent probe into Pahalgam casting doubt on its intentions.
 
 

“India overassessed and miscalculated its newfound relevance while eyeing to become a counterweight to China and being part of the Indo-Pacific strategy. The whole conflict till May 10 exposed India’s exaggerated and inflamed strategic relevance,” Gen Janjua maintained.
Pakistan, for its part, played the moment with clarity and restraint. By upholding Article 51 of the UN Charter, it positioned its response as legitimate self-defence. It neither overreached nor sought escalation for escalation’s sake. This is what separates a state seeking resolution from one seeking hegemony.
And yet, challenges remain. The ceasefire, while welcome, is tenuous. Hours after it took effect at 16:30 hrs on Saturday, there were reports of breaches from various locations.
Trust is scarce and for good reason. India’s post-ceasefire messaging has been muddled and, at times, deliberately dismissive. Indian officials privately propagated the impression that the agreement was merely an “understanding” devoid of commitments or international mediation.
Even more concerning, Indian officials suggested to their domestic audiences that hostile measures — such as the April 23 decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty remain in force. This selective reinterpretation of the deal aims to pro­ject strength at home, but it raises serious doubts about New Delhi’s sincerity.
“India must cease its threats, stop externalising its internal security issues, and engage in meaningful dialogue with Pakistan. A backchannel between the two NSAs should be established to lay the groundwork for talks. As a first step, India must reverse its suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty to address a key Pakistani concern,” former foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani said.
Pakistan cannot be expected to buy into an illusion of peace while India reserves the right to provoke again. Any enduring resolution demands good faith and that means addressing root causes, above all the Kashmir dispute. India’s consistent refusal to engage meaningfully on Kashmir and its habit of painting all Kashmiri dissent as terrorism perpetuate the cycle of violence and instability.
 
 

“Pakistan hopes that India will stop its march to the follies and learn from the outcome of conflict and will come to terms for a peaceful coexistence by resolving all its disputes with Pakistan including Kashmir and Indus Waters Treaty, which was unilaterally and illegally suspended despite the World Bank being a guarantor,” Gen Janjua said and added that Delhi should stop misperceiving that it is above international law.
“Despite ceasefire and commitment to talks, Pakistan needs to remain ready for another round of military confrontation,” Mr Faisal warned.
The international community, particularly those who helped defuse the crisis, must now hold India to account. Ceasefires cannot function if they merely reset the clock until the next provocation.
Dialogue must be real, not rhetorical. And India must show that it values peace more than posturing.In the final accounting, Pakistan has walked away from this round not as a state that bent to pressure, but one that stood firm, exposed its adversary’s miscalculations, and steered the crisis toward de-escalation on its own terms. It restored deterrence, secured diplomatic recognition, and reframed the regional narrative.

The plea was filed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur through senior advocate Latif Khosa. The petition, which sought Mr  Khan’s release under parole, was dismissed for not fulfilling basic legal requirements.
The Registrar Office objected that the plea was not filed by the aggrieved individual himself and failed to name Mr Khan as a party in it. Additionally, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) — the prosecuting authority in the case in which Mr Khan is serving the sentence — was not listed as a respondent.
The registrar also noted that the full addresses of involved parties were missing, and raised concerns over the legal standing of a third party seeking such relief on behalf of a convicted individual.

Returns petition for not fulfilling basic legal requirements

Following these objections, the Registrar Office removed the filing and directed that the plea be re-submitted with corrections.
 
 

The petition, filed amid rising regional tensions, warned of a possible drone attack targeting Adiala Jail, where Mr Khan is currently detained. It claims that Khan’s life is at imminent risk due to heightened hostilities with India, and argued that releasing him on parole was essential for national security and unity.
Citing recent drone incursions and the ongoing “national emergency,” the petition alleged the former premier has become a prime target for Indian aggression. It claims that Mr Khan’s historical confrontations with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made him a “top enemy” of New Delhi.
“Mr. Modi views Mr. Imran Khan as India’s biggest enemy… Central Jail Adiala is a potential target to take out Imran Khan and leave the Pakistani nation in further disarray,” the petition warned.
It further argued that Mr Khan’s release would help foster unity within Pakistan and bolster its position internationally amid cross-border threats.
Mr Khan, detained since August 2023, is serving a sentence in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023 protests.
 
 

The petition termed these cases “politically motivated” and lacking in credible evidence.
The plea also cited Mr Khan’s deteriorating health and references the Good Conduct Prisoners’ Probational Release Act, 1926, as well as international precedents — including Nelson Mandela’s release — as grounds for parole.
It drew parallels to the 2020 Supreme Court order that allowed parole for prisoners during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying.
Ukraine and European leaders agreed on Saturday to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire on May 12 with the backing of US President Donald Trump, threatening Presi­dent Vladimir Putin with new “massive” sanctions if he failed to comply.
The announcement was made by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine after a meeting in Kyiv, after which they held a phone call with Trump. The US leader, who wants a rapid peace, has not commented publicly on the course of action.
“So all of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters at a news conference.
“No more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays.”
 
 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters at the news conference after their talks that he and the visiting leaders “agreed that on Monday (May 12) there must start an unconditional ceasefire”.
He added that it should cover air, sea and land, and said that if Moscow refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Friday that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of  “nuances”.
In remarks to ABC News that were aired on Saturday, Peskov suggested that Western military assistance for Ukraine would have to stop in order for a temporary ceasefire to happen. “Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,” he said.
In Kyiv, the European leaders said they held a phone call with President Trump after their talks. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a photograph on X of the five men huddled around a table with a phone on the desk.

MUZAFFARABAD: In yet another night of devastation along the Line of Control (LoC), Indian troops resorted to intense artillery shelling past midnight on Saturday and continued firing in intervals until noon, leaving 13 more civilians martyred— including a three-year-old girl — and over 55 others wounded across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
According to the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the latest casualties raised the death toll to 30 since Indian missile strikes targeted two cities in AJK, followed by heavy and indiscriminate shelling in several border areas.
Officials said the shelling intensified after Fajr prayers, targeting civilian population with heavy guns, causing massive damage.
In Poonch district, three people were killed in Chaffar village of Abbaspur tehsil. The victims were identified as Areesha, 26, her three-year-old daughter Hadia, and Rehman Jan, 60.

In Kotli, Robila Javed, 35, was martyred in Bandli village of Khuiratta tehsil. Also, Kaneez Begum, 50, was martyred in Thalla Laat neighbourhood, while Muhammad Fazil, 70, was martyred in Seri Tangar village of Nakyal tehsil.
 
 

Four men and two women suffered injuries in the district.
In Neelum valley, Ali Ahmed Butt, 20, lost his life in Bugna village. Three men and two women were injured in the valley.
Although no fatalities were reported in Jhelum valley, three men and a child were injured in different areas. In Haveli district, four people, including a child, suffered injuries.
The heaviest toll, however, was reported from Barnala tehsil in Bhimber, where six people identified as Muhammad Junaid, 18; Allah Log, 65; Ms Shahmeen, 50; Nabeel, 15; Moon Shah, 18; and his 13-year-old sibling Aitraz Shah were martyred and 16 others, including five women and a child, were injured.
Indian troops were still fiercely firing artillery in Barnala, Moyel, Kot Jaimal, Watala, Nandpur, and Thub after the ceasefire, confirmed a police official.
An administration official independently confirmed the ongoing shelling, also requesting anonymity.
In Neelum valley, scepticism ran high over the ceasefire announcement, with many residents citing “the Indian side’s treacherous track record”.

“They (our government) must take up this issue with the US authorities immediately to ensure withdrawal of the illegal unilateral decision of holding the treaty in abeyance by India on April 24,” advised Jawaid Latif, a former member (water) of the Water and Power Development Authority.
“I think it is the right time to raise this issue with immediate effect,” he told Dawn.
According to him, India may withdraw its decision covertly in confidential meetings with Pakistan during mediation by the US, as it would avoid announcing this publicly for face-saving.
The 1960 treaty regulates the sharing of water from the rivers. Under the treaty, India has the right to use water from the eastern rivers Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, with some discharges to Pakistan downstream. Pakistan, under the treaty, has the right to use the western rivers: Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.
 
 

When contacted, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, former Pakistan’s commissioner on Indus Waters, termed the intervention by the countries, including the US, not limited to just the ceasefire. “I think the ceasefire is the first step. And I am sure when they (Pakistan and India), under US mediation, sit together, the former will have to raise this issue,” he maintained.
Mr Shah said the government should ask the US to play its role in resolving other issues between Pakistan and India, including Kashmir.
Answering a question, the former commissioner said that if the aforementioned issues move towards resolution, Pakistan must seek a guarantee from the US so that India does not flout this in future.
Meanwhile, Reuters news agency quoted Indian government sources, saying that despite the countries reaching a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after days of deadly fighting, the water-sharing treaty remains suspended.
‘No flow disruption’
All rivers are flowing in their normal course, as there is no flow disruption, according to a senior official in the Punjab government. “There is no problem; all rivers, including the western ones Chenab, Jhelum and Indus, are flowing normally,” the official said while talking to Dawn on Saturday.
Talking about Chenab River, where inflows reduced to 3,100 cusecs on May 5 after India halted the river flow to fill up its dams and later released the water the next day, he said the inflows at Marala headworks were also normal.
 
 

About water data-sharing, he said such data is generally shared with Pakistan by India in the monsoon or flooding season. “They (India) are not sharing data with us these days, as they generally do this in the flood season or any other unusual situation under the Indus Waters Treaty. But since the Chenab river flows are normal these days, we are not worried at all,” he explained. He hoped India would share the data in the upcoming monsoon season.
Separately, a daily water report sha­red by the Water and Power Deve­lop­ment Authority said that Chenab River inflows and outflows at Marala were recorded on Saturday as 29,700 cusecs and 10,300 cusecs, respectively.
The inflows and outflows at Indus at Tarbela were recorded as 136,300 cusecs and 70,000 cusecs, respectively. In Jhelum, 52,400 cusecs of inflows and 32,000 cusecs of outflows were gauged at Mangla.
The River Kabul at Nowshera had inflows of 46,000 cusecs and outflows of 46,000 cusecs.
“The inflows and outflows of River Indus at Tarbela, Jinnah and Chashma, River Kabul at Nowshera and River Jhelum at Mangla have been reflected as mean flows of 24 hours, whereas the other flows have been gauged at 6am,” the report said.
While discussing the country’s reservoirs, the report said the current level in Tarbela Dam was 1456.40 feet with a live storage of 1.289 MAF.
The minimum operating level of the dam is 1402 feet, whereas the maximum conservation level is 1,550 feet.
The water level in Mangla Dam was recorded at 1141.20 feet with live storage of 1.377 MAF. The minimum operating level of the dam is 1050 feet, whereas the maximum conservation capacity of the dam is 1242 feet. Chashma Lake had a water level of 646.40 feet and a live storage of 0.189 MAF.
The minimum operating level of the lake is 638.15 feet, whereas the maximum conservation capacity is 649 feet.

The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times since Wednesday, when India launched missiles into Pakistan, triggering a series of hostilities.
On Saturday evening, the Pakistan Airport Aut­hority (PAA) announced that the airspace has been fully restored for all types of flights and issued a fresh notice to airmen (NOTAM).
“All airports in the country are available for normal flight operations,” a spokesman for PAA said. He requested passengers to contact the airline for the latest flight schedule.
However, the normalisation of flight operations is expected to take time as passenger aircraft and other equipment were shifted to safe locations as a precaution during escalating tensions between Pakistan and India.
Officials have said the aircraft are being brought back to the operational area for routine operations.
The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also resumed flight operations following the reopening of the airspace.
The national carrier’s flight PK750, coming from Paris to Islamabad, which was diverted and landed in Quetta early on Saturday, will return to its original destination at 9pm, said PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan.
Other operations of PIA would also resume from 10pm and all grounded or delayed flights would become operational, he said.
Passengers who had returned to their homes or hotels are being contacted to return to the airport. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers due to the air closures and affected flight operations, but caution was necessary given the circumstances,” the statement added.
The disruption of flight operations for days stranded hundreds of travellers in Pakistan and abroad.
Earlier, Pakistan had closed the airspace to all flights from 3:15am to 12pm and extended the closure till Sunday noon.
 
 

The action was taken after India targeted PAF bases in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Shorkot. The military said all Air Force assets remained safe in the attack before Pakistan launched it operation in retaliation.
On Friday, India had closed 32 airports across northern and western regions, including Srinagar and Amritsar, for civilian flight operations till May 15.
As tensions escalated, several global carriers, including Air France and Germany’s Lufthansa, cancelled or rerouted flights crossing Pakistan’s airspace.
Last month, Pakistan closed its airspace for Indian airlines, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country in the wake of a deadly attack in Pahalgam.

He knows the art of virality. The zappy Rizwan has a punchy remark for all situations, but that night he was compelled to repeat the very words he had uttered after it became all but certain that Pakistan would not go beyond the group-stage of a home Champions Trophy under his captaincy. 
“I do not like to be dependent on the results of the other teams,” the Multan Sultans captain said after Quetta Gladiators condemned his team to the largest defeat in terms of balls remaining in the history of the Pakistan Super League (PSL). They needed to win all the remaining matches and had to hope for other results to go in their favour after Sultans had lost six out of seven matches and had a negative net run rate of 2.355. 
Two days later, Karachi Kings thrashed Multan Sultans by 87 runs. The result effectively eliminated Rizwan’s side — that still had two more matches to play — from the playoffs race with still as many as 10 group matches remaining.  
Sultans lifted the PSL trophy in 2021 and since have played every final, establishing themselves as a dominant force in the six-team competition. But, the 10th edition of the PSL — in which they have also faced the biggest defeat in terms of runs remaining and have been skittled under 100 for the first time — has tarnished that legacy. 

Multan Sultans had played in the finals of the last four seasons of the Pakistan Super League, building a reputation as one of the most consistent sides in league. This season, they became the first team to get knocked out. What went wrong?

Eos looks at how it all came crashing down for the Multan Sultans. 
An ‘unfavourable’ schedule
Competitive advantage plays a significant role in top-flight cricket and, while the PSL is yet to experience the authentic flavour of home and away matches, Multan Sultans have been the lucky side to be afforded proper home advantage. 
The Multan Cricket Stadium — or the ‘Sultans Fort’, as the team refers to it — staged 13 PSL matches before this season. Those games, spread across three seasons (three in 2020 and five each in 2023 and 2024) and played in tandem, provided Sultans a home base, shielding them from travel fatigue and the need to acclimatise to the ever-changing conditions which, frankly, are the most challenging factors that the teams have to brave in such tournaments. 
Before this season, Sultans had a near-perfect record in Multan, as they had won 11 of those 13 games — hence, the ‘Sultans Fort’. This year, however, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) divided the five Multan games into two legs, of two and three matches, with the away games before and after the first leg. 
It irked Multan Sultans and their owner Ali Khan Tareen lamented the schedule in various podcasts before and during the PSL season, as playing all home games on a bounce had contributed significantly to their success in the previous seasons.
After starting their last two PSL campaigns with five consecutive matches at home, Sultans played three away games before their first home fixture and arrived at the Multan Cricket Stadium with three losses. 
The respite in the shape of the victory over Lahore Qalandars in the first home game was short-lived as Islamabad United thrashed them in their second home game. Multan Sultans never recovered from that defeat. 
Getting the draft wrong 
There are certain cheat codes to developing a squad in franchise cricket and one of them is to have the team’s core based on the local players. This not only guarantees availability of the players throughout the tournament but also brings in the much-desired players who have the experience of the local grounds and conditions. 
Sultans, however, released Khushdil Shah and Abbas Afridi ahead of the player draft. 
With his middle-order batting firepower and handy contributions with the ball, Khushdil had been one of the core players for the Sultans since 2020. Despite batting for a limited number of balls, the left-handed later order power-hitter’s 658 runs at a strike rate of 142.42 were the sixth most for the franchise since its inception in 2018 and his 23 scalps at 20.83 are the seventh most.
Abbas’ ability to deliver crucial middle and death overs in Sultans colours earned him a spot in the national side. His 37 wickets at 19.46 are the most wickets for a bowler to have played for Multan Sultans after Imran Tahir and Usama Mir. 
The two were placed in the Diamond category after the category renewals in December 2024. The Sultans could have offered the players brand ambassadorship or mentorship to lower their categories, a move that the franchises practise widely to retain their best talent and make sure that the players’ cheques reflect their actual worth. 
Sultans, instead, gave brand ambassadorship and mentorship to Iftikhar Ahmed, who has fallen out of national selectors’ favour in the twilight of his career, and David Willey, who retired from international cricket after the 2023 World Cup, to slot them in the Diamond Category along with Usman Khan. 
Curiously, young left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram, one of Sultans’ seven retentions, did not play a single match during the entire time they were mathematically in the playoffs race. 
And, it does not stop here. They used the ever-crucial ‘right to match’ card on Tayyab Tahir, to snatch him from Lahore Qalandars, only to keep him on the bench. By the completion of the Sultans’ eighth game, Tayyab had warmed the bench in seven matches and did not face a ball in the one match he played. 
Trailing in every aspect
Multan Sultans’ squad boasted an assistant coach, dedicated fast and spin bowling coaches, a power-hitting coach, a fielding coach and his assistant, a performance coach (whatever that is), and as many as three analysts under Abdul Rehman, the head coach. 
The team, however, failed in every possible metric. Statistician Kamran Muzaffer provided some brilliant insights for this piece. By the completion of match 22, Sultans had the worst economy of any side in the history of the tournament, as no team had ever leaked runs at 10.61 in an edition. On average, their pacers leaked 10.97 runs an over and their spinners 9.93 in the PSL 10. 
They had the worst net team run rate (calculated by subtracting the batting and bowling run rate) of negative 1.92. Peshawar Zalmi (-0.09) was the only other team with a negative net run rate. 
They also faced way more dot balls than they bowled, as the net dot ball percentage was just a shade under negative four. And they conceded way more boundaries than they hit, reflected by a negative boundary percentage of 6.89. Sultans’ were the worst net dot ball and boundary percentages.
Bowling Michael Bracewell in the powerplay backfired heavily as the off-spinner gave away 12.56 runs an over and his two wickets cost Sultans 56.50 runs in the first six overs. The decision was a curious one anyway, as the New Zealander has given almost 10 runs an over and taken just two wickets at a woeful 60.50 in the 12.4 powerplay overs since the start of 2024.
Following their eighth game, Rizwan admitted to the host broadcaster that his side had just not been good enough to go beyond the group stage. The ‘Sultan Supremacy’ — built over four years of consistent performances — had been shattered. Rizwan knew it.

Huxley wrote these words just 11 years after the end of World War II. The memory of the horrors of that war would have still been fresh in his mind — such as the memory of an idealistic programme in Nazi Germany to create a ‘1,000-year Reich’ founded on the supposed intellectual, spiritual and physical ‘superiority’ of the white ‘Aryan race’, which was ‘destined’ to rule supreme after vanquishing ‘inferior’ races.
Such beliefs were concocted by the Nazis to motivate a polity that was struggling to come to terms with the ‘humiliation’ that their country had suffered in the First World War. Then, in the late 1920s, Germans became victims of a rapidly crumbling economy. So, a lot of them quite liked the idea of being told that they were a superior race, led by a ‘strongman’ (Hitler), who shaped himself not only as a ‘fearless leader’, but also as a messianic figure whose impulse, will and wisdom would put in place the building blocks of the coming 1,000-year Reich. 
Therefore, the core theme in most of Huxley’s post-war writings was the manipulation of whole societies through ideologies that harden to become dogmas. These dogmas are then given a sacred status. Huxley was most concerned by the fact that this process diminishes the ability of critical thinking in societies because the education that is imparted in schools is more about indoctrinating ideologies and dogmas rather than about sharpening and expanding the intellect. 

In an age of rising populism and fragile states, Pakistan’s ‘hybrid system’ may be less about democratic ideals and more about national survival and political pragmatism

But doesn’t it take the indoctrination of one ideology to dislodge another? 
Soon after World War II, democracy was pitched and romanticised (by the West) as an ideology against those ideologies that stifle thinking and ‘natural rights’. But what the world has been witnessing from the 2010s is an adverse reaction to democracy. This reaction is manifesting a renewed interest in many people in stiffer ideologies, even to the extent of them desiring to be ruled by messianic figures and ‘strongmen’. 
This is mostly emerging in the shape of populism. Populism is often described by political scientists as a ‘thin-centred ideology’, or an albeit clumsy, theatrical style of politics that borrows from other ideologies. Nevertheless, today it is gleefully devouring democracy. 
Interestingly, there is a school of thought that suggests that by borrowing heavily from the right, clumsy modern-day populism has even begun to erode mainstream conservatism and conventional right-wing politics. However, the other (more alarming) view is that, clumsy or not, populism will lead to the return of systematic fascism and totalitarianism. 
Keeping in mind the way populism is causing some serious social, economic and political disruptions in established democracies (in Europe, the US and India) — imagine what it may end up doing in developing democracies such as Pakistan. Actually, one has already seen what it did before it was uprooted — not by another ideology — but by an ‘-ism’ that is often not considered to be an ideology as such: (political) pragmatism. 



 
Ideologies are systems of beliefs and values that shape understanding of the world and guide actions. Political pragmatism is an approach focused on the practical consequences and usefulness of ideas and actions. Idealists and romantics detest it. They call it ‘centrism’. They do so because they can’t help but view things through an ideological lens alone. Centrism is an ideology, but it is different from political pragmatism, which isn’t one. 
I will try to demonstrate this by making a case for political pragmatism as an effective deterrent against populism in Pakistan. This political pragmatism is manifested by what we now call the ‘hybrid system’ that produces ‘hybrid regimes.’ Hybrid regimes — at least in the context of Pakistan — are governments that are ‘democratic’ but in which state institutions such as the armed forces are ‘allowed’ to become important stakeholders in the decision-making process. 
Ever since the 1990s, Pakistan has had hybrid regimes. But the hybrid system that the military establishment (ME) began weaving from the early 2010s was almost officially declared as a recognised system in 2018. It had serious teething problems, though, mainly because the ME chose to pick populism as a ‘useful idea.’ Ideologies, including thin-centred ones such as populism, do not gel well with pragmatism.
Therefore, by 2019, the populism-centred hybrid system began to trigger deep structural conflicts, until the ME decided to pull out the system’s populist drive and replace it with the experience of established mainstream parties that are inherently pragmatic. 
The hybrid system was not discarded. It remained in place but, this time, instead of pretending to be based on an ‘ideology’, it is justifying itself as a necessity to maintain economic and political stability, something It has somewhat succeeded in achieving. It does not have any idealistic pretensions, other than that of the textbook nationalism kind. It is largely pragmatic and antithetical to any kind of populist politics. 
Of course, as expected, those who were ousted by it, and the usual cast of idealists and romantics, are constantly castigating it. A lot of their criticism does carry weight. But, I also believe, there is nothing so terribly flawed in the argument that the hybrid system as it is today is indeed a necessity — at least until threats posed by populist politics, economic fragility, insurgencies in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and by India, are largely warded off.
This needs to be done (and is being done) in a realistic and pragmatic manner. We can all return to play with ideology later, when actual threats are actually mitigated.

The intense military exchange began in the early hours of Saturday after India attacked Pakistani airbases. Soon afterwards, Pakistan launched its retaliatory operation, Bunyan-um-Marsoos, which came to an end on Saturday afternoon when both nations agreed to a full ceasefire, effective 4:30 PKT.
The ceasefire was announced by US President Trump in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.
“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire,” Trump wrote, congratulating both nations and praising them for “using common sense and great intelligence”.
 


Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to X to announce the ceasefire “with immediate effect” at 5:08pm, writing “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
 






His counterpart, Indian Foreign Minister Subhramanyam Jaishankar wrote on X that both countries “worked out an understanding on [the] stoppage of firing and military action”.
“India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,” he added.
 






India’s Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri said a ceasefire was established between the two neighbours at 5pm IST (4:30pm PKT), adding during a press briefing that the military operations chiefs of both nations agreed “that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect”.
“Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding,” Misri said, adding that the Directors General of Military Operations would “talk again on 12th of May at 1200 hours (11:30am PKT)”.
PM Shehbaz thanked Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region.
“Pakistan appreciates the US for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” PM Shehbaz said in a post on X.
“We also thank Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their valuable contributions to peace in South Asia,” the premier said, adding that the country believed the step marked a new beginning in resolving issues that have plagued the region and hindered its journey toward peace, prosperity and stability.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistan has consistently pursued dialogue and diplomacy as the “only viable path to peace”.
“War, violence and aggression are never the answer,” the Bhutto scion wrote on X. “Now that both India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire and dialogue, we welcome this as a victory for diplomacy.”
Bilawal appreciated the role of the US, Saudi Arabia and all countries “involved in achieving this historic milestone”.
“As a Pakistani, I could not be more proud of our people, our army and especially our Air Force. Pakistan Zindabad.”
 






Operations commence
At around 3:30am on Saturday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that India targeted the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi), Murid (Chakwal) and Rafiqui (Shorkot in Jhang district) air bases, adding that all PAF assets remained safe.
Addressing a press conference, he said that India was “pushing the whole region towards a dangerous war with its madness, aggression and deceit”. The DG ISPR also said that India had fired missiles at Afghanistan and used drones to conduct attacks as well.
The military spokesperson said that “the majority” of Indian missiles fired at PAF airbases were intercepted by the armed forces’ air defence systems. He noted that the few Indian missiles that were not intercepted and “sneaked in” had “not been able to cause any damage” to PAF’s flying assets, as per the initial damage assessment reports.
The DG ISPR said that the air defence systems of the armed forces were able to “successfully prevent the desired objectives of India”.
He added the missiles and drone attacks by India on Afghanistan shortly after attacks on the territory of Indian Punjab were “part of a larger sinister plan to push the region and beyond into havoc”.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the PAF had the electronic signatures of all Indian missiles, including “from where they were initiated and what was targeted”.
The military’s spokesperson assured the nation that the armed forces were “vigilant and thwarting all these cowardly acts of aggression by Indians”.
“These blatant acts of aggression by India actually reflect the paranoia within Indian mindset which continues to grow after failure of each of these acts and the paranoia continues to also grow once it realises that they cannot break the resolve and will of the people of Pakistan which actually strengthens and further grows with each such cowardly act.”
He further said that the “growing frustration and paranoia” of the Indians would be “further compounded”.
At 4:38am, state-run PTV News said that the Pakistani military had launched its counter-attack against Indian aggression.
 






At 5:52am, PTV News and Radio Pakistan announced that the Pakistani military had destroyed a site storing Brahmos missiles in India’s Beas region as part of the retaliatory operation called ‘Bunyan-um-Marsoos’.
In a statement, the broadcasters reported that attacks were ongoing at more places in India and that airbases in Udhampur and Pathankot were also destroyed.
 






Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan also confirmed that Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos was launched against the “enemy”.
“Long live Pakistan — May Allah protect our falcons,” the minister said in a post on X.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that Pakistan responded with precision and strategic integrity by targeting only Indian military targets.
“In tonight’s unprovoked attack by India once again, civilian populations have been indiscriminately attacked in Pakistan,” Rehman said. “This is the clear difference.”
At 6:13am, PTV News said in a video update that a storage site of Brahmos missiles was destroyed.
 






At 6:50am IST (6:20am PKT), The Times of India reported that explosion-like sounds were heard in Punjab’s Pathankot district early on Saturday morning,
“The blasts, reported around 5am, however, have not yet been officially acknowledged by authorities. A blackout was enforced in Pathankot on Friday night, with officials urging residents to remain indoors as a precautionary measure,” it said.
PTV News said at 6:29am that Pakistani drones were active in the skies above India’s capital New Delhi. Soon after, the government said on X that Pakistan had targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of ‘Bunyan-um-Marsoos’.
“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes against the three PAF bases.
PTV News further reported at 7:13am that hypersonic missiles launched by a PAF JF-17 Thunder destroyed an Indian S-400 system in Adampur. It added that the S-400 air defence system is worth approximately $1.5 billion.
PTV News also said that most Indian websites, including the BJP’s official website and the Border Security Forces (BSF), were hacked as Pakistan’s counterattack continued.
Other hacked websites included the Crime Research Investigation Agency, the Mahanagar Telecommunication Company Limited, the Bharat Earth Movers Limited, All India Naval Technical Supervisory Staff Association, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Unique Identification Authority of India.
“Data leaked sites include Indian Air Force, Maharashtra Election Commission and others,” the statement added. “In addition, more than 2,500 surveillance cameras have also been hacked.”
 






Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to Geo News around 7am and said that Pakistan was operating on the defensive and had no choice but to retaliate to India’s military actions.
“The tamasha (circus) that India has done in the past three days, we will not let India claim hegemony. The Pakistan Armed Forces and government are determined that this will not happen.
“This operation that we started today, it will all end in some way. It all depends on what India wants,” he said.
“Pakistan had no choice, so our civil military leadership made the decision following the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. No more patience. We are just giving them a response.
“We’ve exhibited a lot of patience so far. There is a threshold which we cannot go beyond, especially when it comes to hypocrisy and double standards,” he said.

Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were due to meet He in Geneva after weeks of growing tensions that have seen duties on goods imports between the world’s two largest economies soar well beyond 100 per cent.
The trade dispute, combined with US President Donald Trump’s decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn.
 
 

US President Donald Trump said on Friday an 80pc tariff on Chinese goods “seems right,” suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145pc levies imposed on Chinese imports.
The location of the talks has been kept secret, although a witness saw over a dozen police cars outside a private residence in a leafy Geneva suburb.
Mercedes vans with tinted windows were seen leaving a Geneva hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying on the banks of Lake Geneva.
Earlier, a delegation of over a dozen US officials, including Bessent and Greer, were seen smiling and wearing red ties and American flags on their lapels as they left their hotel. Bessent declined to speak to reporters.</p><small>2025-05-10 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1011291221965a4.jpg?r=112930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910016/no-casualties-reported-as-53-magnitude-quake-hits-kp' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties reported as 5.3-magnitude quake hits KP</strong></a><br><p>A 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck various cities across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday, according to a statement by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The PMD said the quake struck at a depth of 230 kilometres, with its epicentre located in the Hindukush region.
“No casualties or damages have been reported,” KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson Anwar Shahzad told Dawn.com.
Parts of KP — Mardan, Swat, Swabi and Abbottabad, and their surrounding areas — felt the tremors of that quake, he added.
Last month, a 4.4-magnitude earthquake jolted Swat and adjoining areas with a depth of 185 kilometres and epicentre in Hindukush.
On April 12, a 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck near Islamabad and Rawalpindi, while tremors were also felt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from another earlier quake.
Pakistan witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
However, experts had pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p><small>2025-05-10 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1008140268f663b.jpg?r=081517' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909891/indias-irresponsible-jingoism-threatens-one-fifth-of-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>‘India’s irresponsible jingoism threatens one-fifth of the world’</strong></a><br><p>• FO slams New Delhi’s war hysteria, says Pakistan still considers Indus treaty in force
• Saudi minister arrives in Islamabad with message of concern, calls for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: South Asia — home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population — can ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being carried out by India, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said on Friday.
At the weekly press briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.”
His remarks came ahead of a meeting between Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir and PM Shehbaz Sharif and other top state functionaries. The Saudi official had travelled to Pakistan on Friday after completing an official visit to India.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Riyadh’s emissary “expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of precious civilian lives”.
 
 

He said the kingdom was deeply concerned about the current situation in South Asia, and reiterated his country’s call for de-escalation, as well as peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes between Pakistan and India, in accordance with international law and the UN Security Council’s relevant resolutions, the PMO said.
While discussing the prevailing situation in South Asia, the PM strongly condemned India’s missile and drone strikes against Pakistan that had resulted in the martyrdom of scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, as well as damage to civilian infrastructures.
He stressed that India’s unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability.
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar received Adel Al-Jubeir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged views on the evolving regional situation.
FO briefing
Earlier, at the weekly briefing, the FO spokesperson said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”
“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.
The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.
He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.
“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.
“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.
“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”
He said that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”
The FO spokesperson also said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”
Mr Khan said “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.
“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.
