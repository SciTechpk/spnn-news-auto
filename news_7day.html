The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production.
Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow.
Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled.
“Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said.
He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”.
“The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha.
As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow.
The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow.
Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”.
The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided.
Judge Majoka expresses displeasure
During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested.
He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am.
When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court.
The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest.
Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”.
On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings.
In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA.
During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest.
At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court.
The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused.
Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-19 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191355413574412.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967821/gul-plaza-inferno-death-toll-rises-to-15-flames-continue-to-emerge-from-smouldering-debris' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza inferno death toll rises to 15; flames continue to emerge from smouldering debris</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno rose to 15 on Monday as nine more bodies were recovered and firefighting efforts resumed after flames re-emerged from the smouldering debris.
The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road, was finally doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday. A search operation was initiated amid fears of further casualties. Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit, but said the cause has yet to be confirmed.

 


Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said they had managed to control the flames by upto 95 per cent, and the cooling phase has been initiated.
“The cause of the fire is still unknown,” he noted. Officials have said it was believed that a short-circuit sparked the blaze.
South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khosa had also said the cooling process was ongoing.
Earlier in the day, Fire Officer Zafar Khan stated that 90pc of the blaze had been brought under control, although “flames are still present in the inner market”.
“The building’s front and back façades have collapsed, and there are many cracks on the inside as well. So it is extremely dangerous,” Zafar said, adding that rescue teams were conducting “short-term operations” at some spots where they suspected bodies were present.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalal said that firefighting efforts restarted from the Rimpa Plaza side, as flames continue to emerge from the smouldering debris.



According to South DIG Syed Asad Raza, 15 bodies have been recovered so far by rescue personnel from the now-gutted shopping plaza.
“Samples of eight family members [have been] collected for DNA matching,” he said.
“Fire safety operation has been completed. Cooling process has now started with the removal of debris from the site by KMC, TMC and Pakistan Navy personnel,” said the DIG.
According to DIG Raza, the shopping plaza had a total of 16 gates — 13 on the ground floor and three in the basement — out of which only two gates were open on the ground, while one exit was open in the basement.
Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that five bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi.
CM Murad vows to rehabilitate affected traders
Separately, in a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses.
“We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.



The chief minister also formed a committee that would make recommendations regarding the businesses’ rehabilitation and affectees’ compensation.
“The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire could be known.
Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated.
He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations.
CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes.
He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy.
Scores missing
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
Gul Plaza Traders Association President Tanveer Pasta said over 40 shopkeepers and salespersons were among those missing in the wake of the incident.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, told the media that “more than 70 people” remained missing. DIG Raza stated the same figure.

“The reports of more than 70 missing persons are extremely alarming and constitute a major tragedy,” said the governor, adding that the incident has now “turned into a national tragedy”.
“Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said.
He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire is necessary, the priority for now is to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders.
Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated.
“My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor.
“His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards.
“Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters.



Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday.
“We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added.
The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.”
Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days.
Traffic police announce alternate routes
In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza.
The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.
Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road.







‘Heartbroken’
United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza.
“May strength be with the community at this time,” she said.







The German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.”







The French embassy in Pakistan expressed “profound sorrow over the loss of many lives in the devastating fire”.
“We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and stand with the people of Pakistan in this moment of grief,” the embassy said on X.







‘Delayed response’
The terrifying fire that erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but the delayed response and limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours.
Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.
Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.
A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.

Additional input by Asim Khan</p><small>2026-01-19 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19140559a3f2340.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967848/ptis-participation-in-jcp-meetings-conditional-upon-consultation-with-imran-barrister-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s participation in JCP meetings conditional upon consultation with Imran: Barrister Gohar</strong></a><br><p>Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has said that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan.
Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges.
JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary
Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court today, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”.
When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
He said that the party had serious reservations about the 26th Constitutional Amendment as well, which was enacted into law in 2024.
However, Gohar maintained that despite that, PTI “still wanted to present the party’s point of view and give input in the selection of judges for the superior judiciary, but then our meetings with the PTI founder were severed”.
He maintained that due to no contact with Imran, the party is unable to consult him.
“Just as we boycotted participation from other committees, we also decided to stay away from the meetings of the JCP,” he explained.
“We will make a proper decision in this regard after meeting with Khan sahib,” he added.
Meetings with the PTI founder have been suspended till February 8, Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in December last year.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
‘NA opposition leader not appointed at behest of Nawaz’
On the matter of the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Gohar dismissed reports that the appointment was made at the behest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.
On January 16, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the NA.
Gohar held that it was at the discretion of the speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, to issue the notification.
“I understand that it was done by the speaker National Assembly for which we were grateful,” he said.
Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”.
He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today.
“Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said.
In October 2025, PTI had nominated Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as its candidates for the slots of leader of the opposition in the National Assem­bly and Senate, respectively.</p><small>2026-01-19 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1912244148622c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967843/paf-contingent-arrives-in-saudi-arabia-for-combat-exercise-spears-of-victory-2026-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF contingent arrives in Saudi Arabia for combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a multinational aerial combat exercise, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release on Monday.
The PAF contingent, comprising F-16 Block-52 fighter aircraft alongside dedicated air and ground crew, arrived at King Abdulaziz Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the multinational aerial combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’.
“The exercise is witnessing the participation of fighter jets and combat support elements from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, France, Italy, Greece, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America,” the ISPR said.







“It offers a robust platform to enhance interoperability, operational synergy, mutual understanding and capacity building among participating air forces, particularly in large force employment, night composite air operations, integrated ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance), and operations in advanced electronic warfare environments.”
Through participation in this multinational forum, the PAF seeks to enhance interoperability with partner air forces and “validate its operational preparedness in a contested, technology-driven battle space”.
The military’s media wing elaborated that PAF fighter aircraft undertook a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, “demonstrating the long-range operational reach and expeditionary capabilities of Pakistan Air Force”.







“During the conduct of the exercise, PAF pilots flying advanced F-16 Block-52 aircraft equipped with modern avionics and Beyond Visual Range capabilities will be pitched against air crews of participating air forces operating a wide array of sophisticated combat aircraft,” it added.
The ISPR further said that the participation of the PAF contingent in the exercise not only reflected its firm commitment to regional and international military cooperation, but also underscored its “professional excellence and proven capability to operate effectively in diverse and demanding operational environments alongside leading contemporary air forces”.
In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.</p><small>2026-01-19 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191335254c98c9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967847/trump-no-longer-feels-obliged-to-think-purely-of-peace-after-nobel-snub-he-tells-norwegian-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Trump no longer feels obliged to ‘think purely of peace’ after Nobel snub, he tells Norwegian PM</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said he no longer felt an “obligation to think purely of peace” after not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, and repeated his demand for control of Greenland, in a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre seen by Reuters and Bloomberg on Monday.
A copy of the text of the letter was posted by the foreign affairs and defence correspondent for PBS News, Nick Schifrin, on social media platform X, who said he had obtained it from multiple officials. Schifrin added that the letter had been forwarded to “multiple European ambassadors in Washington”.
“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped eight Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump said in the letter.
“Although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”







As Bloomberg pointed out, the Nobel Peace Prize is not decided by the Norwegian government but rather awarded by an independent committee.
“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway?” the US president added.
“There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.”
Trump also called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) to “do something for the United States”, saying, “I have done more for Nato than any other person since its founding”.
He added, “The world is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!”
“Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, I have several times clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,” Bloomberg quoted Støre as saying in response.
A request for comment sent to the White House was not immediately returned, it added.
Trump has insisted he will settle for nothing less than full ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, threatening tariffs of up to 25 per cent on eight European nations until his purchase of the Danish territory is achieved.
Meanwhile, last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado had given her own medal to Trump in recognition of what she called his commitment to the freedom of the Venezuelan people. However, the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked even if the medal is given away.

It was the deadliest train accident since 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track outside the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela.
The crash happened on Sunday evening when a train operated by rail company Iryo travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz, crossing onto the other track where it crashed into an oncoming train, which also derailed.
The interior ministry said at least 39 people died, raising the toll from 21 given by police late on Sunday.
Another 123 people were injured, including five very seriously and 24 seriously, a ministry spokesperson added.
Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters the disaster took place on a straight part of the track, which was completely renovated.
The first train to derail was “practically new”, making the accident “extremely strange”, he added.
The death toll is not final, Puente said Monday, indicating it could rise from the current figure.
“The death toll has already reached 39 and is not definitive. I want to express my deepest gratitude for the tremendous work of the rescue teams throughout the night, under very difficult circumstances,” he wrote on X.
Rail experts “are very surprised by this accident because it is very strange and very difficult to explain at this stage,” the minister said.
‘Hard, tricky work’
Rail operator Iryo said around 300 people were on board its Malaga-Madrid service.
Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers it was carrying.
Spain has Europe’s largest high-speed rail network, with more than 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) of dedicated tracks connecting major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, and Malaga.
The hundreds of passengers left in the wreckage hampered the frantic work of emergency services.
“The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,” Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Cordoba, told public broadcaster RTVE.
“We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,” he added.
Some of the carriages had tumbled down an embankment of four metres (13 feet), Sanz said.
‘Like a horror movie’
A passenger on the second train, bound for the city of Huelva, who gave only her first name Montse, told Spanish public television the train, “with a jolt, came to a complete stop, and everything went dark”.
She described being thrown around in the last carriage and seeing luggage tumble on other passengers.
“The attendant behind me hit her head and was bleeding. There were children crying,” she added. “Luckily, I was in the last car. I feel like I was given a second chance at life.”
Survivor Lucas Meriako, who was travelling on the first train that derailed, told La Sexta television that “this looks like a horror movie”.
“We felt a very strong hit from behind and the feeling that the whole train was about to collapse, break… there were many injured due to the glass,” he said.
High-speed services between Madrid and the Andalusian cities of Cordoba, Seville, Malaga and Huelva would be suspended on Monday, Adif announced.
‘Night of deep pain’
“Today is a night of deep pain for our country owing to the tragic rail accident in Adamuz,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X.
“No words can alleviate such great suffering, but I want them to know that the whole country is by their side in this tough moment,” he added.
The royal palace said on X that Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were following the news “with great concern”, offering “our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured”.
French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen were among the world leaders offering condolences.</p><small>2026-01-19 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1911470673536c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967841/58-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-gilgit-baltistan-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.8-magnitude earthquake jolts parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan on Monday, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said.
According to PMD, the earthquake struck at 11:21am at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre in Northwestern Kashmir.
According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which uses the Moment Magnitude scale, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck northwestern Kashmir at a depth of 31 km.
It said that the quake was recorded 58 km north-west of Barishal in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
In October 2025, a 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi.
A month earlier, a 5.5-magnitude earthquake was felt in areas of KP.</p><small>2026-01-19 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191230297819bfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967844/australia-rest-cummins-hazlewood-maxwell-for-pakistan-t20-series' target='_blank'><strong>Australia rest Cummins, Hazlewood, Maxwell for Pakistan T20 series</strong></a><br><p>Australia will rest five top players, including Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell, for a three-match Twenty20 series in Pakistan ahead of the World Cup, selectors said on Monday.
Josh Hazlewood, Tim David and Nathan Ellis will also skip the series starting later this month.
Their absence opened the door to fringe players Sean Abbott, Mahli Beardman, Ben Dwarshuis, Jack Edwards, Mitch Owen, Josh Phillippe and Matt Renshaw, who come into the 17-man squad.







Chief selector George Bailey said the five were either returning from injury or having their loads managed ahead of the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka which begin on February 7.
“The series is a great opportunity for those on the brink of selection and some young players we rate highly for valuable experience,” he added.
“Some are already experienced international players, along with Mahli Beardman who has been with the group a number of times, and Jack Edwards who joined for the last one-day match against India in Sydney last year.”
Australia will play Pakistan in Lahore on January 29, 31 and Feb 1, before travelling to Sri Lanka where they are scheduled to open their World Cup campaign against Ireland in Colombo on Feb 11.

The board called the transition to the auction model “a historic move after a decade of success” and said that it reinforced PSL’s “continued growth, competitiveness, and commitment to innovation”.
“This strategic shift is aimed at enhancing competitive balance, increasing transparency, and providing players greater earning opportunities,” PCB said in a statement today.







Under the revised player acquisition framework, each franchise may retain a maximum of four players, limited to one player per category. Previously, every franchise was allowed to retain eight players from their squad, including a mentor, a brand ambassador, and a Right to Match (RTM) option to retain a ninth player in the draft.
The rules pertaining to mentors, brand ambassadors and RTM have been abolished for PSL XI, the statement said.
“Newly inducted teams will be allowed to select and retain four players from the available player pool before the player auction,” it added.
It added that each franchise will also be allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in PSL X, enabling teams to strategically strengthen their squads with fresh international talent.
Further strengthening the league’s commercial and competitive outlook, the player salary purse has been increased to $1.6 million per franchise, which the statement said underscored PSL’s “commitment to rewarding player performance and attracting elite domestic and international cricketers”.
“These progressive measures reflect the League’s strategic trajectory and evolution, while remaining firmly rooted in its mission to promote cricketing excellence, fan engagement, and attaining unprecedented heights,” it said.
According to the statement, PSL 11 will officially commence on March 26. Additionally, Faisalabad has been added as an additional venue to host League matches, “marking the city’s return to (the) spotlight and further expanding the League’s national footprint”.
It added that additional details regarding the player auction process, schedule, and operational guidelines would be shared in due course.</p><small>2026-01-19 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191014339eae7a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967784/how-washington-sells-war-to-the-world-with-words' target='_blank'><strong>How Washington sells war to the world with words</strong></a><br><p>

WHEN the United States attacks another country, it doesn’t just send in troops or launch missiles. It starts with language. What we’re seeing in Venezuela is not random messaging, but a well-designed narrative system — built around three basic steps and repeated through a set of familiar rhetorical tricks. And once you understand how this system works, you start noticing the same pattern again and again.
The first step is disguise. Change what an action is called, and you change how it is judged. So the United States did not refer to its action in Venezuela as an “invasion”. In fact, it did not speak the language of war at all. Instead, it talked about “capture”, “arrest” and “joint operations with law enforcement”.
All of these terms are synonymous with domestic policing and not war. The effect is powerful. Once it is able to make its action look like law enforcement, questions of sovereignty or the United Nations Charter quietly fade out from the conversation.
The violence the US has unleashed is further neutralised through technical language. So, bombing becomes a “precision strike”, invasion becomes an “operation” and the civilian harm it caused is downgraded to “collateral damage”. Such wording does more than soften the blow, presenting war as a form of technical management — something orderly, controlled, almost bureaucratic.
At the same time, the targeted state itself is personalised. A country is reduced to a single leader; sovereignty, institutions and the population fade into the background. Once a state is thus reduced to just one individual, regime change can easily be sold as criminal justice rather than aggression.
The second step is redirection. If attention is diverted elsewhere, legality becomes irrelevant. This is why so much emphasis is placed on elite units and footage of “dramatic raids”. Command rooms, night-vision images and special forces narratives dominate coverage. The audience is encouraged to admire competence and efficiency. The more impressive the operation looks, the less space there is to ask whether it should have happened at all.
Tactical success is then used to conceal strategic violence. A fast, “clean” operation is praised as restrained and responsible, although it says nothing about long-term consequences — regional instability, civilian suffering, economic collapse or endless cycles of intervention. Winning the scene replaces winning the peace.
Public debate is carefully redirected toward procedure rather than substance. Media discussions fixate on whether Congress was informed or whether the timing was appropriate. These arguments divert attention from the core issue — who authorised the US to use force across its borders in the first place.
Cause and effect are then quietly reversed. Interference came first, but the story is told backwards, as if instability demanded interference, rather than interference leading to instability. History is edited to make aggression appear inevitable. The third step is erasure. Control memory, and you control moral judgment.

 

Latin America is not a new story. The US has interfered there more than 40 times. But that history is wiped clean. Each action is presented as exceptional, as if it has no connection to what came before.
And before the public can fully process what happened in Venezuela, new headlines — Trump talking about occupying Greenland within two months, or news about military deployments aimed at Iran — appear. Attention shifts. Venezuela fades. Accountability never arrives.
Even imagery is carefully controlled. The public is shown pictures of Nicolas Maduro — poorly dressed, exhausted, humiliated. What is not shown is the brutal process behind those images: the killing of dozens of Cuban bodyguards who died protecting him, and the violence of the raid itself. The focus stays on spectacle, not cost.
When invasion is reframed as governance, and war becomes routine administration, the most dangerous transformation has already occurred. It doesn’t happen on the battlefield. It is all in the wording.

This is only 7,000 bales higher than the output recorded during the same period last year, indicating near stagnation in cotton production.

 

According to the PCGA report, 2.58m bales reached ginning factories in Punjab, while 2.91m bales arrived in Sindh. Compared to the same period last year, cotton arrivals in Punjab declined by 4pc whereas Sindh recorded a 4pc increase.
The data reveals that textile mills purchased 4.84m bales from ginning factories while exporters bought 176,000 bales. Around 479,000 bales are still available for sale with the ginners.
At present, only 127 ginning factories are operational. Of them 91 are in Punjab while 36 are in Sindh.

Ginners call for ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones; say the challenge has shifted from production to consumption

The PCGA officials noted that during the past two weeks alone, 46 ginning factories in Sindh and 50 in Punjab became non-operational—far more than market expectations.
The association also reported a sharp upward trend in cotton prices over the past week, with prices rising by Rs300 per maund to reach around Rs16,500 per maund. The increase has been attributed to the extremely limited availability of quality cotton in the domestic market and rising international prices of cotton yarn and fabric.
Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq says that despite Pakistan’s cotton production remaining nearly 50pc below annual targets for several years, the real challenge has now shifted from production to consumption. He attributes this to the excessive cultivation of sugarcane in traditional cotton zones, which has not only reduced cotton acreage but also caused environmental pollution that had adversely affected cotton quality.
As a result, he says, many textile mills are forced to import high-quality cotton to fulfill export orders, putting severe pressure on the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
He urges federal and provincial governments to strictly enforce crop zoning laws instead of spending billions of rupees on cotton revival projects. He calls for a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation and the establishment of new sugar mills in cotton zones, which can help restore national cotton production to around 15m bales.
Haq warns that record decline in exports, soaring production costs for exporters and highly lenient import policies have pushed the cotton sector to the brink. More than 150 textile units have shut down completely, many others are operating partially, and hundreds of ginning factories have become inactive, placing the entire cotton industry ‘on a ventilator’.
He cautions that if ‘oxygen’ is not immediately provided to the cotton sector, the national economy itself can slip into ‘coma’. He points out that Pakistan’s cotton industry faces some of the highest electricity, gas, and markup rates in the world, along with multiple high-rate taxes and excessive intervention by various federal and provincial departments, all of which have sharply increased production costs and eroded export competitiveness.
Calling the current situation the worst economic crisis in the industry’s history, Ihsanul Haq urges governments to prioritise industrial revival over cash handouts.
He suggests that instead of spending around Rs1 trillion on welfare schemes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and Ramazan packages, these funds should be directed toward reviving industries, which would not only strengthen the economy but also significantly reduce unemployment and poverty.

Within seconds, burly firefighters point their hose at the fresh flare up, concentrating a high-pressure stream of water that momentarily douses the leaping flames.
By Sunday afternoon, around 16 hours after the Gul Plaza fire broke out, firefighters are still playing ‘whack-a-mole’ with the blaze.
They had a massive audience, as M.A. Jinnah Road is teeming with people — rescue personnel and fire fighters, volunteers, city officials, media crews and the general public.
“It was full of plastic products. It’ll be burning for days,” I overhear one bystander say.

 

“I hear they shut the [market] gates at 10pm,” another chimes in.
“There was a parking lot on the third floor, no telling what has become of that,” a third man volunteers.
Many of them are from the neighbourhood, or own businesses nearby. All eyes are on the section of the building that has collapsed, and many an outstretched finger points to a part of the building’s façade, where key beams seem to have lost structural integrity and the whole thing looks like it’s ready to keel over.
A quick glance at Google Street View shows that the collapsed part of the building housed shops and the entrance to the aforementioned parking area. In addition, the corners of the building next door, Rimpa Plaza, are also showing signs of fire damage. This is because there is virtually no gap between the two buildings.
While the crowds gathered at the scene aren’t disrupting the ongoing operation, security personnel do periodically have to ‘urge’ overzealous camera phone-wielding youngsters to back away.
While there, I spot dozens of water tankers from various official and private firms, since getting water in this congested urban locality is a major challenge. As I walk towards the charred building, bystanders note that another tanker has run out.
As they are speaking, a smaller unit approaches the flames, spraying a jet of what appears to be flame-retardant foam. This continues for a minute or so, before their supply is exhausted. A little while later, a snorkel arrives at the scene, and firefighters are able to turn their hoses to the upper stories, which continue to pour out smoke, indicating that some parts of the building are still on fire.
Amid roaring water jets and wailing sirens, an unsettling silence lingers beneath the rubble as people witness the battle between water and fire.

His voice trembles as he makes an unusual request: “Buy my kinnow at whatever rate you can”. The wedding date of his daughter is fixed, he says, and the fruit on his trees is the only asset he has left to turn into cash.
Factory managers hear such pleas daily this season. What was once  routine commercial transaction has turned into a human drama, reflecting a crisis engulfing Pakistan’s citrus economy  — one shaped by closed borders, rising costs, policy neglect, and the shadow of international sanctions linked to Iran.
Pakistan’s kinnow exporters face a perfect storm as the traditional overland route to Russia and adjoining markets through Afghanistan remains effectively closed. For years, this corridor allowed kinnow to reach Russia, Ukraine and the Central Asian Republics within six to nine days, keeping the fruit fresh and competitive.
With that route blocked due to tensions with Kabul on security affairs, exporters are diverting shipments through Iran — a route that takes around 25 days, significantly increasing transit time, costs and spoilage risk. What was once a backup option has become the primary route, and even that has become geopolitically risky.
Adding to exporters’ anxiety are renewed threats by US President Donald Trump to impose a 25 per cent tariff on countries trading with Iran, raising fears that reliance on Iranian transit and markets could invite penalties or complicate access to Western destinations.
Govt claims vs reality
Last week, the federal government announced that Punjab’s farmers would be allowed to export kinnow and potatoes through “alternative routes.” Growers and exporters say the announcement offers little practical relief.
“Iran was never a newly opened route,” says Hanif Hanjra, a small orchard owner. “It has always been there, mainly used after Iran finishes its own mandarin crop. Calling it an alternative to Afghanistan is misleading.”
According to growers, Iran cannot replace the Afghan corridor in terms of speed or cost. “Through Afghanistan, kinnow would reach its destination fresh and competitive. Through Iran, the journey is simply too long for a perishable fruit. Resultantly, the shipment costs multiply manifold,” Hanjra says.
Growers recall that Pakistan’s presence in Russian, Ukrainian and Central Asian markets was built largely through exporters’ own initiatives, particularly after ASEAN countries restricted kinnow import as Pakistani authorities failed to meet required documentation due to alleged demands for bribes and bureaucratic inertia.
Sajid Wining, a grower-cum-exporter who remained Pakistan’s top fruit exporter for nearly 14 years, said he eventually exited the kinnow business due to chronic policy neglect. “At their peak, kinnow exports earned around $450 million annually,” he said. “Yet fruit and vegetable exports were never treated as a strategic priority.”
He also criticised the failure to develop seedless kinnow varieties, while competitors such as China and Egypt moved ahead with seedless mandarins, capturing premium markets.
Price crash amid bumper crop
The crisis has hit orchard owners brutally. A former MPA and ex-tehsil nazim of Sahiwal, Ghulam Ali Asghar Lahri, said juice factories are offering as little as Rs300 per maund.
He revealed that a contractor who had purchased his orchard for Rs27.5 million — paying Rs1.5m as advance — walked away from the deal, forfeiting the amount because expected losses were far greater. “Some of my relatives are uprooting kinnow plants altogether,” Lahri said. “They don’t see this crisis ending anytime soon.”
Mohammad Mohsin Warraich, patron of Anjuman Kashtkaran, Sargodha, said the irony is that this year’s kinnow crop is bumper and globally appreciated for its taste and appearance. Yet growers are being forced to sell at Rs1,200 per maund or even less, compared to Rs2,500–3,200 last season.
“Factory owners exploit growers by citing Afghan border closures,” he said. “But only C-grade kinnow goes to Afghanistan, and its production is very low this year. A-grade fruit is exported by sea, and that route is open.”
Warraich added that Iran has, unlike previous years, reduced duties on kinnow imports and transit to Russia and CARs from the start of the season. “So why are prices collapsing?” he asked.
Former MPA and citrus grower Iftikhar Gondal said kinnow production costs have multiplied since the sharp devaluation of the rupee in 2022.
Fertilisers, pesticides and labour have become prohibitively expensive, while returns have collapsed.
“One acre of kinnow orchard fetched around Rs100,000 last year; this season it is barely Rs30,000,” he said. “Many growers cannot even find buyers for their orchards.” This uncertainty has also led to a drastic drop in land contract rates—from Rs200,000 per acre annually to Rs70,000, he said.
Gondal alleged that factory owners have formed cartels to fix rates, exploiting farmers while continuing exports. He estimated that nearly 30pc of kinnow orchards have already been uprooted, with farmers shifting to maize, sugarcane and other crops.
Zahoor Haral, a mid-level kinnow grower, warned that repeated crop shocks are pushing farmers toward selling land and migrating to cities or abroad. “The rural economy is collapsing,” he said, noting that contractors, labourers, transporters and shopkeepers all suffer when farmers lose purchasing power.
He dismissed the argument that low prices are driven by border closures alone. “Exporters buying kinnow at throwaway prices are not dumping it locally; they are shipping it abroad. So the excuse doesn’t hold.”
Shadow of sanctions
Hovering over the entire crisis is the geopolitical risk tied to Iran. Trump’s threat of a 25pc tariff on countries trading with Tehran has unnerved exporters, who fear that dependence on Iranian routes could expose them to penalties or market restrictions.
Growers are now calling for structural reforms: the creation of Kissan Markets to allow direct sales to consumers, promotion of value addition through juice, pulp and powder processing units, and the establishment of a Citrus Control Board — similar to the Sugarcane Control Board  — to regulate pricing and transactions between growers and factories.
Until such measures are taken, orchard owners say scenes like the one at the factory gate — fathers pleading to sell fruit at any price to meet family obligations — will only multiply.
And Pakistan risks losing not just export markets, but an entire citrus economy once considered a flagship of its agricultural exports, now squeezed between closed borders, rising costs and global politics far beyond farmers’ control.

Faced with the prospect of daily-use items, groceries and other essentials becoming more and more expensive, it seems that one of the ways city-dwellers are coping with inflation is by changing where they shop.
Once considered a novelty, the ‘dollar’ or ‘discount’ store, and its counterpart ‘fixed price’ shops are now emerging as a ubiquitous entity in markets across Lahore and Karachi.
These outlets, which are also known as ‘sale shops’ or ‘fair-price shops’, can be considered Pakistan’s version of ‘fixed-price’ shops (such as the Poundland chain in the UK). After having their hey-day in the 2000s and 2010s, such stores had petered out post-Covid.
But now, with the rising prices of commodities, the fixed-price concept is seeing a resurgence in popularity, with customers not just coming in to buy trinkets and toys like they used to.
In fact, when Dawn visited a number of such stores across Lahore and Karachi, it emerged that people are primarily stacking their baskets with daily-use and household items from these stores.
Their purchases can include accessories, crockery, cosmetics, handbags, jewellery items, kitchen utensils, toys, cleaning supplies, stationery, or even socks.
During visits to the Saddar, Kharadar, Garden, and Bahadurabad areas in Karachi, and Anarkali, Gulshan-i-Ravi, Fortress Stadium, and Icchra in Lahore, Dawn found people from all walks of life shopping at these outlets.
Despite not being definitely mapped, these ‘sale shops’ have a strategic advantage: a fixed price for all items ranging between Rs100 and Rs280, with only a few integrating a minor selection of costlier items.
But with the dollar hovering around the Rs280 mark – still quite steep for the average city-dweller – most stores have had to abandon the mandatory peg to the prevailing exchange rate, settling for a more affordable price tag that is lower than the actual rate of the greenback on the open market.
In Lahore’s Old Anarkali Bazaar, for example, such shops stock a variety of products, including jewellery items, cosmetics, toys, kitchen utensils, handbags, crockery, and even mobile accessories.
A woman working the storefront at an Rs190 store in Lahore gave the example of a well-known shampoo brand that usually retails for Rs1,500. But at her store, she said, the same product could be obtained for Rs190.
While it wasn’t clear whether the product she was selling was ‘genuine’ or a knock-off, for many shoppers, the distinction mattered little.
At a dollar store in Karachi’s Saddar area, which is selling all items for Rs280 – not too far from the actual value of the dollar – a woman shopper told Dawn she was there to buy “quality essentials at a reasonable price”.
Looking to purchase a set of teacups, she said that she wasn’t happy with the price point of traditional utensil vendors and found this option more suited to her needs.
Comparing the fixed-price shop to weekly bazaars that pop up over the weekends, she said that rather than being open on specific days, the fact that these stores are open all week round adds to the convenience factor.
But a visit to the Clifton Sunday Bazaar revealed that the vendors there were making hay by stocking a wider variety of clothing and household essentials.
‘Sale’ shops, by contrast, seem to be capturing the customers that would previously flock to the ‘landa’, or second-hand market.
De-dollarisation of discount stores
As the prevailing exchange rate has made dollar-pegged pricing unsustainable for shoppers, owners of these ‘fixed price’ stores have rushed to cap their prices in rupees to maintain the aura of affordability.
Shopkeepers in Old Anarkali told Dawn that the outlets were previously branded as ‘one dollar shops’, and that the signage had recently been changed to ‘sale shops’, while the pricing model remained unchanged.
Stores that haven’t localised their business model have struggled to compete. This was evident from Dawn’s survey of ‘dollar stores’ mapped in key parts of Karachi, including DHA and Clifton, which had long since gone out of business.
The owner of one such erstwhile store, who Dawn reached out to through the contact listed on Google Maps, said they had closed when $1 was being exchanged for about Rs180.
According to him, even with prices capped at Rs170, demand was not as strong, and the business wasn’t able to keep pace with the rising prices of goods either.

At the same time, a shopkeeper in Kharadar, who Dawn spoke to, says that they have now opened two more branches for their iteration of a Rs200 discount store, where prices range from Rs40 to Rs200.
Meanwhile, a shopkeeper selling cups and plates at Clifton’s Sunday Bazaar told Dawn that the dollar impact was not felt much in ‘landa’ prices.
Nadeem ul Haque, former vice chancellor at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, told Dawn that this trend of ‘localised’ dollar shops, shows how market forces work.
He said that the concept was born out of excess local supply, which is linked to the “global industrial overload” catering to those whose purchasing power has been reduced in recent years.

Speaking to reporters after congratulating the newly-elected cabinet of the Timergara Press Club, Mr Khan alleged that trucks carrying flour were being stopped at Attock and bribes demanded, leading to severe shortages in Lower Dir and parts of KP, where a 40kg bag of flour was being sold for as much as Rs6,000.
He said the situation amounted to a clear violation of Article 151 of the Constitution, which guarantees free trade among provinces, adding that despite Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being an integral part of Pakistan, the federal government was treating the province unfairly. He also criticised the provincial government for ‘failing to fulfill its constitutional and moral responsibilities’.

 

Responding to a question, Mr Khan said military operations were underway in various parts of the province, but stressed that the growing insecurity must be curbed immediately as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not afford further loss of lives. He said instead of military operations, the capacity of police and other civilian institutions be upgraded to cope with the menace of terrorism.

Inayat says capacity of police should be enhanced instead of conducting military operations

Meanwhile, talking to reporters at the residence of party’s leader Maulana Wahid Gul in Khar area of Bajaur, Inayatullah Khan called for resolving the unrest in the merged districts through dialogue rather than military operations.
He expressed sympathies with the family of the JI leader over the Friday night’s bombing targeting his house, and said his party had long held the ‘principled stance’ that issue of law and order in the tribal districts must be resolved through peaceful means, not by use of force.
The JI leader alleged that military operations in the tribal districts were not only causing destruction and unrest but also adversely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of residents.
Responding to a question, the JI leader said their party was in favour of dialogue on all issues, whether they pertained to security or internal political conflicts.
Condemning the bombing at Wahid Gul’s residence, the Jamaat’s provincial chief called it a cowardly act, stating that such incidents were unacceptable and were intended to silence the voices of peace.
He stated that the relevant authorities must immediately arrest those responsible for the attack.

PROTESTERS scuffle with an ICE supporter who was in downtown for ‘Americans Against Islamification’ rally.—AFP

WASHINGTON: The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government’s deportation drive, two US officials told Reuters on Sunday.
The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent.
President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act.

Army places units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence escalates

Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year.
In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances.
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.
Trump’s threat
“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
The soldiers subject to deployment specialise in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two US Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said.

Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.

 

Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived last night with full force and resources, the scene here would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.

Traders say fire could have been contained sooner, but limited resources and delayed action by authorities allowed it to spread unchecked

A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.
“Had the operation started properly the moment the fire broke out, perhaps so much damage could have been avoided. By morning, everything had been consumed by the flames,” one shopkeeper said, looking over the rubble.

 

“If a proper rescue operation had been in place, people could have been saved, and businesses might have survived. The government doesn’t seem to realise that these weren’t just shops – thousands of households’ livelihoods were at stake,” a clothing dealer lam­ented.
“At first, the smoke kept spreading, and then the fire reached the upper floors. If the teams had arrived on time, perhaps people could have been brought out safely,” a young man on the scene recounted.
Atmosphere of fear and mourning
The fire that could still not be fully extinguished by Sunday night has cloaked the bustling M.A. Jinnah Road and Saddar area in an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and mourning.
The rising sun, usually seen as a symbol of life and hope, appeared sorrowful this Sunday morning in Karachi. The light that every day awakened new hopes in shops and businesses was silent, as if it too had lowered its gaze after witnessing the blaze and destruction.
Along with traders and the relatives of those who died, even the air around Gul Plaza seemed to be grieving.
Some are searching for their loved ones, while others are consumed by the agony of losing their businesses. Every eye looked wet and every face appeared drained and hopeless.
The same market where shopkeepers raised shutters every morning and the voices of bargaining echoed, today stands as a burning skeleton. Where once crowds of buyers gathered, now victims, relatives, rescue workers and onlookers stand clustered together.
The intensity of the fire has already caused part of the building to collapse.
One glance at the rubble is enough to realise the scale of the devastation. Hundreds of shops have been destroyed.
It is clear that when a building burns, it is not only brick and metal that burn. Livelihoods, trust and the hard labour of years also burn to the ground.
The piles of debris and ash have shattered the economic lives of traders within moments.
‘Everything was here’
A middle-aged trader who had been running his business in the building for nearly two decades stood on the road looking at the charred structure on Sunday morning.
After a long silence, he uttered just one sentence: “Everything was here.”
In that single sentence lay the struggle, livelihood and hope of an entire life.
Another affected trader broke down while speaking to Dawn and pointed toward the burning building. People around him tried to console him, but every heart around seemed to be grieving.
Majid, who owned a children’s clothing shop, said he and other shopkeepers had stocked merchandise for the Eid season, but “now everything has turned to ashes.”
A dangerous design, an ageing structure
Among the public, there is also a belief that the scale of the fire is tied to the risks that had accumulated over time.
Gul Plaza is among the commercial centres of Karachi built decades ago. Over the years, thousands of shops, warehouses and stockrooms became packed into narrow corridors.
Fabrics, plastics, cardboard cartons, other goods, cramped pathways and substandard wiring created an environment that made today’s disaster unbearable.
Traders say that such calamities not only destroy wealth, but also push an entire class to stand once again before time and debt to rebuild what was lost.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.

 

Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.

 

He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

• Macron wants ‘never-before-used anti-coercion instrument’ against US• Meloni calls tariff threat a ‘mistake’• Dutch FM dubs it ‘blackmail’• UK, Norway mull over response
LONDON: Global markets face a fresh bout of volatility after President Donald Trump vowed to slap tariffs on eight European nations until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.
Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached.

 

“Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins.
“The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder.
On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

 

An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy.
France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said.
Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat.
Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told the BBC, calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”.
“We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said.
Trade war fear
France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too.
“In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.
Norway, targeted by the tariff threat but, like Britain, not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.
“I think one needs to stop and think so that a trade war can be averted that would lead to a downward spiral. Nobody would win,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told NRK television.

Tajikistan, in Central Asia, shares a mountainous border with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities.
According to Tajik security services cited by the state-owned Khovar news agency, “four terrorists were neutralised” after they refused to put down arms in the southern Khatlon region.
Tajik authorities have reported at least five deadly incidents on the mountainous border, which is some 1,350 kilometres (840 miles) long, since November.
An AFP count using official data found that 16 people have been killed in total. These include Tajik border guards, Chinese workers and what Dushanbe calls “smugglers” and “terrorists”.
After attacks on Chinese nationals in November, Tajik authorities urged the Taliban government to take measures to prevent destabilisation of the volatile border region, where drug traffickers and militants are active.
In December, five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, according to Tajik state media. It added that the people killed in the clash included “three terrorists” and two Tajik border officers.
Dushanbe is also concerned about the presence in Afghanistan of members of the terrorist organisation Islamic State in Khorasan.

DAMASCUS: The Syrian president and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced an immediate ceasefire after fierce fighting, which saw the government forces take control of territories held by the Kurdish SDF.
The Syrian army, in its lightning advance towards the key city of Raqqa in the north, captured Tabqa before reaching a ceasefire with the Kurdish forces on Sunday on all fronts. Al Jazeera, quoting the Syrian state media, said that the SDF forces agreed to withdraw to the east of the Euphrates under the agreement.

 

According to Al Jazeera, the agreement provides for the immediate and complete administrative and military handover of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates to Damascus. The agreement also allowed the government to assume control of all civilian institutions in the two governorates, and current employees would be reinstated through decrees.
The government promised it would not target the SDP supporters or fighters. The ceasefire granted the Syrian government control over all border crossings as well as oil and gas fields in the region. In addition, all civil institutions in al-Hasakah Governorate are to be integrated into official Syrian state institutions and administrative structures, while a presidential decree will be issued naming a candidate as governor.

 

The agreement also stipulated that a list of proposed leaders submitted by the SDP command will be used to fill senior military, security, and civilian posts in the central government, while heavy military forces from the city of Ain al-Arab/Kobani will withdraw. Furthermore, it also envisaged a local police force affiliated with the Syrian interior ministry besides the creation of a security force drawn from local residents.
The agreement also allowed the integration of the administration in charge of the Islamic State camps into the Syrian state structure.
Syrian army advances
Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the Syrian government troops were entering the outskirts of Raqqa and were advancing deeper into the northeast of the country, the last stronghold of the US-backed autonomous Kurdish-led administration. Two Syrian military sources said that tanks had begun entering Raqqa, once controlled by the Islamic State, which the SDF captured in October 2017.
Thousands of residents took to the streets of Raqqa to celebrate the Syrian army’s advances as SDF forces pulled out their equipment, two residents said.
The army, with its Arab tribal allies, had earlier taken control of Deir al-Zor’s main oil and gas fields east of the Euphrates River — a key source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — dealing a major blow to the group.

Addressing a jirga comprising parliamentarians and elders from Bajaur tribal district in Chief Minister’s House here, he said that peace had been restored in 2018, however, deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation.
He stated that decisions, taken behind closed doors, had always worsened the situation.

 

Sources privy to the meeting said that participants discussed law and order and development schemes in Bajaur district. They said that situation could not be brought under control until all the stakeholders were on the same page.
“Governments are run with wisdom. There should be a mechanism where all the stakeholders agree on a point and be on the same page. That is how I believe things will normalise,” former governor Shaukatullah told Dawn.

Elders from Bajaur, Khyber and Kurram apprise chief minister of their issues

Others said that there were issues but they were performing duty, protecting their areas and never allowed outsiders to stay on their land. “As far as military operations are concerned, you know well that the chief minister himself is helpless and cannot stop it in his own hometown, how do you expect him to stop such action in Bajaur,” a participant told this scribe on condition of anonymity.

 

He said that development in the merged district was also discussed in detail in the meeting.
He said that the chief minister promised that if the funds, promised by federal government for merged districts, were not released, he would cut funds from other developmental projects and divert them to Bajaur.
A statement issued by Chief Minister’s House said that the participants of jirga presented suggestions for establishing permanent peace and expressed full confidence in the chief minister, assuring him all out support.
The jirga discussed law and order situation in the province, improvement in Pak-Afghan relations and development strategy.
It said that the chief minister announced increasing compensation for partially damaged houses in Bajaur from Rs0.16 million to Rs0.5 million following recent operations. He said that federal government had promised Rs1 billion annually at the time when the previously tribal areas were being merged with KP, however, over the past seven years, only Rs168 billion was released.
He said that federal government was not providing funds for Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). He issued direction for increasing the upper age limit for recruitment in police department in merged districts.
Also, in another jirga with members from Kurram and Khyber districts, the chief minister said that he understood the agony of military operations. He added that he would not leave his people alone.
He told the jirga members that sectarian issues caused damage and enemies took advantage of the situation. He said that he would soon visit Kurram to resolve issues of displaced persons. He ordered registration of those people, who had left their homes due to the law and order situation, within one week.
Our correspondent from Mansehra adds: Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi said that the street movement launched from Karachi on the directive of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan would bring revolutionary changes in political system of the country.
“This mammoth crowd, which gathered at midnight to welcome the convoy of the street movement from Haripur to different parts of Hazara, is an eye-opener for the government. The people want immediate release of PTI jailed founding chairman, Imran Khan,” he said while addressing cheering crowds at Khatm-i-Nubowat Chowk and College Doraha in small hours of Sunday.
PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Babar Saleem Swati, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar and deputy president Kamal Saleem Swati were also present on the occasion.
The chief minister said that the street movement had successfully mobilised people from Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would soon reach every nook and corner of the country.
“We want to make it clear to the government that this time it cannot suppress the people’s street movement. We have turned every city and every square into D-Chowk,” he said.
Mr Afridi said the country needed Imran Khan’s leadership to steer it out of the prevailing socio-political and economic crises, accusing federal government of failing to address those challenges.
The convoy of the street movement entered Mansehra through Karakoram Highway at Datta, proceeded through Ghazikot and concluded at College Doraha in the early hours of Sunday.

• Dacoits warned to lay down arms            
RAHIM YAR KHAN: A large-scale, joint operation by Punjab and Sindh police is ongoing in the katcha areas of Rahim Yar Khan, including Machka, Kacha Rajwani and Ronti, with 1,700 personnel, drones and armoured vehicles deployed against bandits.
According to Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bahawalpur Ghazi Muhammad Salahuddin, Rahim Yar Khan police had cordoned off Kacha Rajwani, with contingents from Rajanpur (Punjab) and Ghotki (Sindh) taking part. Sindh police and Rangers were also conducting action in adjoining riverine areas.
He said 1,700 police personnel had been deployed along with eight drone teams, six bulletproof vehicles and three armoured personnel carriers.
Modern technology was being used to ensure effective progress and restore law and order in the area, he said, adding that police were conducting action against criminal elements under a coordinated and well-planned strategy.
The RPO clarified that suspects who renounce criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to the police would not be engaged in encounters and would be produced before the courts in accordance with the law. However, criminals have been strictly warned to lay down their arms and surrender.
He further emphasised that the operation would continue until the writ of the government was fully established in the riverine areas.
District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan Irfan Ali Samo stated that action against criminals was ongoing and that ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the public remained the top priority.
According to details, police with a heavy contingent and full combat equipment have launched a decisive operation against bandits after cordoning off the areas of Machka and Kacha Rajwani.
Earlier this month, the Sindh government announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the katcha areas of the province, vowing to eliminate them through the use of state force.
Speaking to reporters after presiding over a high-level meeting on the law and order situation in the Sukkur and Larkana ranges, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said it had been decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”.
“We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits you see on social media,” he said, adding that special focus would be placed on Sukkur and Larkana.
Mr Lanjar stressed that dacoits would be given a chance to lay down their arms and join the national mainstream. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them. There will be a fight and they will be eliminated through the use of state force,” he warned.
The home minister thanked the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation in which a no-go katcha area was vaca­ted. He said individuals kidnapped from Sindh were recovered from Punjab with the full cooperation of the Rangers and other security agencies.

A security official said, “The deceased were apparently planting the mine in the area to target residents.”
Police rushed to the site and shifted the bodies to Sui Hospital. Their identities could not be ascertained till late evening.
Security sources said the operatives were burying an underground landmine when it detonated. Following the incident, police and security forces reached the site and launched further investigations.
Grenade attack
Meanwhile, in another incident, unidentified assailants carried out a hand grenade attack near Aftab Chowk in the Sakran area of Hub district late on Sunday evening. No casualties were reported.
According to police sources, the attackers were riding a motorcycle. After throwing the grenade, they fled the scene. Police said the explosion did not result in any loss of life; however, it caused panic among residents of the area.
Following the incident, police cordoned off the area and launched an investigation.
In 2025, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.
At the start of this year, Balochistan’s top police officer vowed to further strengthen the force in 2026 through improved planning, modern weapons and specialised training.

The development comes after Prime Mi­­nister Shehbaz Sharif, in a meeting with a Chinese delegation, had reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the One China Policy and lauded China’s generous support to Pakis­tan, especially through China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
“The visit will be undertaken on the special invitation of the Chairman of the National People’s Congress (NPC) of China, Zhao Leji”, the statement said.
“The visit marks the first state-level and maiden official visit of the Pakistani Parliament in the year 2026 to the friendly People’s Republic of China.”
It further added that the visit of the Parliament delegation would coincide with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, serving as a “milestone reflecting the enduring and time-tested friendship between the two countries”.
“In recognition of this historic occasion, Pakistan and China have agreed to commemorate the anniversary in a befitting and meaningful manner through the organisation of a series of joint events throughout the year,” the Secretariat said.
It said that the parliamentary delegation led by Speaker Sadiq will hold meetings with the parliamentary and political leadership of China, focusing on “strengthening parliamentary cooperation and further deepening bilateral ties”.

The TTAP delegation, led by the chairperson and the newly-appointed opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has arrived in Sindh for four days. The visit is part of the mobilisation efforts for a nationwide ‘street movement’ called by the PTI, scheduled for February 8.
TTAP members also announced observing “Black Day” and nationwide strike on Feb 8, to commemorate the second anniversary of the last general elections in Pakistan, which they claimed were rigged.







According to the TTAP’s manifesto, “Democracy rests on the foundation of transparent elections; therefore, restoring public trust in the transfer of power is possible only through fair elections.”
The manifesto demanded “the immediate appointment of an impartial chief election commissioner and the holding of transparent elections under a new election commission.”
It further called for an independent investigation into the alleged rigging in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, the identification of those responsible, and their punishment under Article 6 of the Constitution, which corresponds to high treason.
“Through the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments, the independence of the judiciary has been undermined by keeping the sword of judges’ transfers hanging over their heads,” it said.
“Conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, have been sidelined.”
“The TTAP manifesto said it “strongly condemned” the recent actions against Justice Tariq Jahangiri, terming his disqualification the “latest example of an attack on the judiciary”.
It further condemned the “false cases and convictions” against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife.
“TTAP demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, including former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Mian Mahmood ur Rashid, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Hassan Niazi, Ali Wazir, Haji Abdul Samad, Wali Mohmand, Dr Mahrang Baloch, and the detainees of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee,” the manifesto said.
Moreover, it called for an end to restrictions on meetings of party leaders and family with Imran.
Referring to the PECA law, the manifesto termed it a move to “silence critical voices and curtail media freedom”. It labelled the legislation as “black law” and demanded its “immediate revocation”.
During the APC, members slammed the “economic exploitation” of media networks, including Dawn TV, by imposing an advertisement ban.
The manifesto also demanded that the ongoing military operation in the Tirah Valley be “stopped immediately”, urging that the “federal government should take the provincial government into confidence on all matters”.
“All issues with Afghanistan should be resolved diplomatically,” the manifesto read, further asking the “unanimous demands” of the Jirga held in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly be immediately accepted.
‘Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if provinces get their rights’
Speaking to the APC, TTAP chief Achakzai said, “Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if the provinces get their rights.
“We have to understand the problems of every province.”
“Come, let’s save our country,” Achakzai said, adding, “If you call the people of Waziristan and tell them that it is [Pakistan] your country, the terrorism will end.”
He alleged that the mandate of 25 million people was stolen in the Feb 8 elections.
“We have to come out on Feb 8 to protest peacefully,” he added, saying, “people will have to be united.”
‘90 per cent of people are in favour of Imran Khan’
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) head and nominated leader of opposition in the Senate, Allama Raja Nasir, said, “90 per cent of people in Pakistan are in favour of Imran Khan.”
“Despite keeping Imran in jail, they couldn’t keep people away from him. Only the public can pull Pakistan out of this turmoil,” he said.
Abbas also urged people to take to the streets and join the peaceful protest on Feb 8.
“If people come out on Feb 8, we will see a big difference on Feb 9.”
‘Over 200 FIRs and over two years in jail’
Former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said that Imran had been in jail for two years, and over 200 first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against him.
“His wife and nephew are also in jail,” Qaiser said, adding that the PTI founder had always opted for a life of struggle over lavishness.
“Despite problems, he [Imran Khan] stood firm and resolute.”
The ex-speaker said that Imran’s perspective was centred around human rights; therefore, he “will never compromise.”
He further stated that Imran had denied vengeance once he got in power.

“The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi in response to media queries.
“Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added.







The so-called “Board of Peace” has begun to take shape as the US moves on to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which stands decimated after two years of Israel’s bombardment.
Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory.
The United States has invited the heads of around 60 states to join the Board of Peace, including those of Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia.
However, the charter of the board, which does not mention Gaza by name, suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations.
On Friday, the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and his senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel.
According to Reuters, the board also includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza.
Other members of the executive board include UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Sigrid Kaag; Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020.
A Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo on Friday, which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue.

 

Former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, who is leading the committee, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years.
Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.</p><small>2026-01-18 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/18193841fc22843.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967685/policeman-martyred-by-unknown-assailants-riding-a-motorcycle-in-kps-bannu-district' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman martyred by unknown assailants riding a motorcycle in KP’s Bannu district</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: A target killing incident occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, where unknown assailants riding a motorcycle opened fire on a policeman, killing him on the spot.
According to a police statement, the incident occurred in the district’s Mamma Khel area, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Haved Police Station. It added that the martyred policeman was deployed at the Mazanga police checkpoint when he was attacked.
District Police Officer (DPO) Yasir Afridi said, “The martyred policeman, identified as Iqbal, was in his native village of Akhund Mamma Khel, when he was shot.”
“After offering evening prayers, he was on his way back home when motorcycle riders opened fire on him in front of his house, killing him on the spot,” the DPO added.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation, while further investigation into the incident is underway.
The security situation in KP has worsened over the last three years with an increase in terrorist attacks, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire deal with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces, police personnel, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Last month, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan revealed that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025. He added that during the attacks, 79 sustained injuries, while in retaliatory action by the police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
Meanwhile, an important jirga was held in Bannu under the chairmanship of Brigadier Umair Niazi of 116 Brigade and Deputy Commissioner Faheem Khan, with the elders of Jani Khel, during which the security and administrative situation of the district was reviewed.
During the jirga, demands were raised regarding law and order, road repair and construction, action against absentee teachers, and the restoration of 4G internet services.
Brigadier Niazi assured the jirga elders that peace and stability would be ensured, directed government employees to resume their duties, stressed avoiding all contact with terrorists under a zero-tolerance policy, and announced that all roads in Bannu would be opened after the completion of security arrangements.
The elders appreciated the steps taken by the institutions and assured their full cooperation.</p><small>2026-01-18 15:20</small></div><hr>
