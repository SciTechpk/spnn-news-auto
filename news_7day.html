The reforms are expected to boost exports by $5 billion once the adjustments are phased in, starting with the next budget.
The need to boost domestic commodity production for exports as well as local needs is imperative to manage a stable balance of payments.
According to the latest International Monetary Fund report, nearly $17bn were available in the shape of new loans and rollovers to meet Pakistan’s gross external financing needs of $19.2bn; for the $2.4bn gap, the country was securing commitments from foreign creditors. The $19.2bn financing includes $1.5bn for the current account deficit and the remaining for repaying the foreign debt, says the report.
However, the report observes that some of the traditional funding sources are either drying up or will not be available. The World Bank had stopped Pakistan’s budget financing, according to The Express Tribune, a few months ago. And there are uncertain risks from US tariff policies.

The country’s economy is expected to grow by 2.68pc in the current fiscal year — a revision from the earlier projected 3.6pc

Imports of goods during the nine-month period rose modestly to $43.39bn from $39.06bn a year earlier — an increase of just $4.33bn. Exports of goods also increased, albeit at a slower pace of $1.77bn, reaching $24.66bn in the same period. Thus, the trade deficit in goods and services widened to $21.05bn in July-March compared to $18.36bn in the same period last year — an increase of $2.7bn.
The food imports bill surged to nearly $7bn during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, rising from $6.82bn in the same period of last year. The import was primarily driven by higher imports of edible oil, tea and sugar to meet domestic demand. According to the latest official data, agricultural production grew by a mere 0.56 per cent in 9MFY25.

Pakistan’s trade deficit widened to a record $3.5bn dragging the current account surplus down to just $12m in April from a peak of $1.2bn in March

The microeconomic stability achieved so far is quite laudable, but the external sector performance in the single month of April raises questions about its durability. The exports dropped to $2.18 million, a decline of 17.66pc from March and a 7.36pc decrease compared to $2.35m in April 2024. On the other hand, imports for the month this year reached $5.61m, a 16.22pc rise from the previous month and a 15.79pc increase from the same period a year ago.
In April of this year, Pakistan also saw an inflow of $3.2bn in workers’ remittances, according to the latest figures published by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). While inflows rose 13.1pc compared to the $2.81bn received in April last year, they were down 22pc from March, when remittances stood at $4.1bn. Cumulatively, with an inflow of $31.2bn, workers’ remittances increased by 31pc during Jul-April, FY25, compared to $23.9bn received during the same period in FY24.
In the same month, Pakistan recorded a drastic decline in foreign direct investment (FDI), receiving just $25.75m compared to $294.2m in April last year — marking a steep 91pc year-on-year drop, according to SBP data.
The figure also reflects a sharp month-on-month plunge from the $385m in FDI reported in March 2025, indicating growing investor caution amid lingering geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, according to analysts.
As per SBP data, the total advances, considered a vital indicator of economic activity, dropped from Rs14.73 trillion in January to Rs13.14tr by April 2025 — an 11pc fall amounting to Rs1.59tr. On May 20, an official announcement said the country’s economy is expected to grow by 2.68pc in the current fiscal year, a revision from the earlier projected 3.6pc.
The large-scale manufacturing, as indicated by the Quantum Index of Manufacturing for 9MFY25, declined by 1.53pc though reflecting a mixed trend in production across different groups.

Indeed Dawn’s analysts address concerns that lowering tariffs, which Pakistan has until now used as a major source of tax revenue collection rather than for industrialisation and export growth, could lead to higher imports and, ultimately, to another balance-of-payments crisis. Such concerns, they argue, are exaggerated and are being raised by those who have made money using tariff protections. They further explain that there is no doubt that imports would rise, but exports will grow at a much faster pace, reducing trade and creating more jobs.
However, the assumption that a reformed tariff policy can do the magic on its own is misplaced, caution these analysts. Although Pakistan’s import taxes remain higher than its peers, these have come down considerably since the early 1990s, when the country embarked upon the path to economic and trade liberalisation.
Yet the fall in the average tariffs since then has not translated into proportionate export growth or significant integration into the global economy. This means there also are other policies that need to be fixed along with tariffs.

The visit resulted in commitments of more than $2 trillion of investment from the oil-rich Gulf Arab states. Yet a question is making the rounds: Would all those commitments materialise, especially in the backdrop of a subdued oil market and growing budgetary pressures on oil-exporting Arab governments?
Rather than striving for broader geopolitical goals, the trip revolved around business deals. The trader in Trump seemed to be in play.
Conspicuously, the trip itinerary did not include Tel Aviv, which was a major deviation from the past. Further, not much pressure, at least in front of the public, was exerted upon Riyadh to join the Abrahamic Accords and recognise Israel.  From that perspective, Pakistan was also spared of any additional ‘public’ pressure to recognise Israel.
Riyadh was Trump’s first stopover. Results were substantial. As per a White House announcement, Saudi Arabia agreed to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years.

Doubts cast on Saudi Arabia’s ‘unrealistic’ $600bn investment promises to the US amid falling oil prices

Analysts, though, are pointing out that some of the projects listed were already in the works, and an additional 145 deals worth more than $300bn were reportedly signed at an adjacent investor conference attended by several US billionaires and prominent business executives.
The US, in the meantime, also agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142bn — the largest “defence cooperation agreement” Washington has ever made.
The agreement between the two countries included deals with more than a dozen US companies involved in air and missile defence, air force and space, maritime security and communications sectors.
The next day, Trump was in Doha, Qatar, overseeing agreements between the two countries worth more than $243.5bn and outlining plans to increase the Qatari investment in the US to $1.2tr, a White House announcement said.
Later, during a speech at a US military air base in Qatar, Trump said Doha has agreed to invest $10bn in a US military facility and purchase $42bn in weapons from the US.
Besides, Qatar Airways agreed to buy 210 Boeing jets worth $96bn. The New York Times called it the largest deal facilitated by Trump during his Middle East trip.
The next day, Trump was in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), announcing more than $200bn in commercial deals between the two countries.
A deal to construct the largest artificial intelligence data centre outside of the US in Abu Dhabi was also announced during the Trump stopover in the UAE. The Emirati firm G42 is to build the facility covering 10 square miles and have a five-gigawatt capacity, the US Department of Commerce said.
But, despite the flurry of business deals, many stay sceptic. After all, last time Trump was in office, Gulf states made similar, big spending promises. Most didn’t come to fruition. Some say the new pledges must also be seen in a similar context. Michael Hanna, the International Crisis Group’s US programme director, told ABC News, “One of the things that has been a huge problem for Trump, traditionally, is implementation and follow-through.”
Cathrin Schaer, writing for Deutsche Welle, points out a problem with what is being described as a kind of grand “investment diplomacy” of the Gulf states: Falling oil prices. These countries mostly depend on oil for their national income, and that income is currently under pressure.
To balance its 2025 budget, Saudi Arabia needs oil prices on or above $91 a barrel, the International Monetary Fund estimated. That is not the case now. Oil prices are hovering around $65 a barrel, with projections that they may even fall further.
The question then is: how could these oil-exporting countries meet the investment targets they have signed with the United States? As per Ms Schaer, the Gulf states are simultaneously also being asked to commit to regional projects, such as rebuilding in Lebanon, supporting Egypt through its economic crisis and — the most expensive project, such as the reconstruction of Gaza, should the conflict end there.
In the meantime, most Gulf Arab states are also committed to a major domestic investment push. Saudi Arabia, for instance, is focused on its capital-intensive Vision 2030. All this needs considerable cash flow which is currently missing.
Tim Callen, a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told Ms Schaer that when oil prices went down, the Saudis tended to cut back on spending.
“Without the current account surplus, there are no new funds to invest unless you borrow,” Mr Callen said. “If the Saudis want to invest in new ventures, they’re either going to have to borrow in global capital markets or they’ll have to reallocate existing investments.”
With oil prices dropping, “it’s even less likely that these promises can be met”, he argued. If Saudi Arabia spends or invests $600bn in the US over the next four years, that equals $150bn a year, or 12pc of its own annual gross domestic product. “That’s just unrealistically huge”, Mr Callen concluded.
For the UAE, investing $140bn a year in the US over the next decade means the Emiratis would be spending more than a quarter of their annual national income on the US. That’s “not viable”, Neil Quilliam, a fellow in the Middle East and North Africa programme at London-based think tank Chatham House, told Arabian Gulf Business Insight.

He wrote in his 1933 book The Means to Prosperity: “Nor should the argument seem strange that taxation may be so high as to defeat its object, and that given sufficient time to gather the fruits, a reduction of taxation will run a better chance than an increase of balancing the budget.”
More than half a millennium before him, the great Muslim scholar Ibne Khaldun had also argued in his masterpiece, The Muqaddimah, that high taxes were often a factor in causing empires to collapse, resulting in lower revenues despite higher rates.
In between them, Jonathan Swift, the satirist and author of Gulliver’s Travels, in a 1728 article, noted the negative effects of high tax rates on government revenues. He also influenced many of his contemporaries, like Adam Smith, regarding the harmful effects of high tax rates on revenues.
In Pakistan, a debate on the impact of higher tax rates on the economy and growth has been ongoing for the past few years. It has gained momentum in the last year due to an exorbitant increase in income tax rates on salaried classes. Already burdened with the responsibility of helping the government meet its annual revenue targets, the organised businesses, too, are struggling under heavy taxation.

The juice industry, for example, has seen its financial contributions shrink due to increased taxation

Higher tax rates are not the only issue Pakistan is faced with today; its tax policy is at a tangent with the broader economic goals of investment promotion, productivity boost, job creation, and poverty alleviation for faster growth. In Pakistan, the rate of taxation has risen consistently over the last several years. Concomitantly, the economic growth rate has consistently dropped during that period, private investment plunged, unemployment went up and poverty increased.
An article — links between taxes and economic growth: some empirical evidence — on the World Bank website says that evidence from 20 countries, spanning almost the entire spectrum of world incomes, shows that those with lower taxes experienced a more rapid expansion of investment, productivity, employment, and government services, and had better growth rates, without discriminating against the poor.
The evidence suggests that tax policy affects economic performance via two basic mechanisms: (i) lower taxes result in higher real returns to savings, investment, work, and innovation, and higher returns have stimulated a larger aggregate supply of these factors of production and thus raised total output; and (ii) the focus and types of fiscal incentives provided by low-tax countries appear to have shifted resources from less productive to more productive sectors and activities; thus increasing the overall efficiency of resource utilisation.
Even though the study says that establishing a direct causal relationship between lower taxes and economic growth can be challenging, as other factors like economic policies, infrastructure, and global market conditions also play significant roles. Yet, the research on tax policy’s impact on economic growth underlines how tax policy can help policymakers boost investments in those segments of the economy that they want to uplift for greater economic reward, job generation, export growth, and so on. A prudent tax policy aligned with growth objectives, emphasises the author, should stimulate “higher output by increasing incentives to save, to invest, to work hard, and to innovate.”
Pakistan’s tax dilemma — higher rates and policy bias against growth, investment and exports — stems from successive government’s failure to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest in the world, from less than 10 per cent, primarily due to a lack of political will to tax the powerful interest groups, such as retailers, wholesalers, real estate owners, and large farmers, into the tax net. For many years now, the country has been running high fiscal deficits averaging around 7pc, forcing it to tax growth, investment, and savings to bridge the budget’s revenue needs.
There are numerous examples of the negative, growth-inhabiting impact of skewed tax policy on various sectors of the economy, with significant consequences not just for investment and jobs but also for public health. However, the formal, packaged fruit-based juice industry stands out in showing how the regressive taxation on a single product can simultaneously impact various segments of the economy.
In 2023, the sales of the formal juice manufacturing industry were projected to grow to Rs72bn. However, the imposition of federal excise duty (FED) — 10pc in the supplementary finance bill in 2023 and doubling it to 20pc in the budget for FY24 — on top of the 18pc sales tax has led to a dramatic downturn of 45pc in its peak sales to Rs42bn due to substantial increase in the retail juice prices, putting the products beyond the reach of the middle classes and severely affecting the government’s revenue projections from the increased taxation on this sector.
However, the contraction in the organised fruit juice industry is more than a revenue decline; it represents a significant economic disruption that has resulted in stalled investment in expansion and new projects for the past couple of years and job losses.
It also has had negative effects on fruit growers and the larger agricultural economy as mango procurement has dropped by more than a third from 31,000 tonnes in 2017-18 to just 20,233 tonnes in the past year, undermining rural livelihoods, due to decreased demand from the industry.
The higher juice tax has also seen significant growth in cheaper, often substandard products from the undocumented sector because of consumers’ affordability concerns, eroding the market share of the documented industry. Industry estimates suggest that the undocumented segment has grown substantially in the past year, fueled by the tax disparity. These players, who operate outside regulatory frameworks, do not pay taxes, consequently leading to lost tax revenue.
Historically, the packaged juice industry has helped reduce fruit wastage by purchasing large volumes during harvest while stabilising prices, supporting farmers, and introducing best  practices in agriculture and supply chain management. Shrinking industry volumes, however, are reversing these.
In order to revive the structured juice industry and encourage healthier consumer choices, the industry sources plead that Pakistan adopts a more progressive taxation model, similar to the other countries that offer preferential tax treatment to fruit-based products.
Even a 5pc reduction in FED would support the industry in getting back on its feet, enhance product affordability, restore market competitiveness, and generate greater revenues through higher sales volumes and broader tax compliance. Not just that, it would unleash the export potential of the industry, which is already shipping its products to more than 30 countries across the world.
At the same time, the government must address the issue of the unchecked rise of the undocumented sector. This could be achieved by establishing a dedicated task force comprising representatives from the government health department, food regulatory authorities, and the formal juice industry, which will include representatives of the private sector.
The regressive taxation on the formal juice industry underlines every negative impact a bad tax policy can have on growth, investment, jobs, government revenues and public health. Fixing it requires realisation and a lot of political will on the part of the tax policymakers.

• Demands release of Yasin Malik, others detained in Indian jails
MUZAFFARABAD: A civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) campaigning for public rights has given the regional government a deadline of June 8, though Eidul Azha is likely to fall on June 7, to implement its ‘Charter of Demands’, warning of further mass mobilisation in the event of dilly-dallying or inaction.
The announcement was made by Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a prominent leader of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), in his speech in the small hours of Sunday at a massive rally held at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk.
Titled as “Conference of the Martyrs of Jammu and Kashmir and Public Rights”, the rally began on Saturday afternoon, with thousands of participants arriving in caravans from across the region till late evening.
The event continued until dawn on Sunday, during which more than two dozen speakers, including the JKJAAC’s core committee members, addressed the emotionally charged gathering.
 
 

Local hotel and trader associations facilitated the participants by offering free accommodation and meals. The event ended peacefully, much to the relief of the local administration.
The 13-point declaration read out by Mr Mir at the rally addressed internal governance issues, the Kashmir conflict, and the dangers of nuclear war in South Asia.
It stressed that lasting peace between Pakistan and India, as well as in the South Asian region, was impossible without a resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community must ensure the peaceful and permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue as per the collective will of the people and their inalienable right to self-determination under the UN Charter,” the declaration said.
It also warned that if any decision was imposed against the will of Kashmiris, or if war was thrust upon the region, the people across all divided units of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir would reserve the right to peacefully dismantle the so-called “bloody” Line of Control (LoC).
The declaration raised grave concerns about the possibility of a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, and appealed to citizens of both countries as well as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, Afghanistan and Iran to support Kashmiris’ call for self-determination to prevent becoming collateral in such a conflict.
Demanding the release of prominent Kashmiri resistance leader Yasin Malik and other political prisoners detained in Indian jails, the declaration also condemned “enforced disappearances” in the AJK and “arrests of political activists in Gilgit-Baltistan”.
New 16-point charter
The committee warned the AJK government to fulfil commitments made under a previous agreement regarding a 10-point charter of demands. If implementation was not ensured by June 8, the alliance said it would announce its next course of action during a representative meeting in the Mirpur division.
“We caution the rulers: if we are compelled to issue another protest call, they will not be able to escape its repercussions,” Mr Mir said.
The alliance also rejected the recent increase in perks and privileges for AJK’s elite, calling it a mockery of public sentiment. It reiterated its demand for complete reversal of these benefits.
In a strong rebuttal, Mr Mir dismissed Prime Minister Anwarul Haq’s allegations of “RAW funding” for the protest movement, terming them baseless and malicious.
“Our movement is being funded by donations from local residents and overseas Kashmiris, with complete transparency ensured through social media disclosures,” he said.
According to the JKJAAC, the newly introduced 16-point charter — formally adopted at a core committee meeting in Dhirkot (Bagh) on May 21 — would now be pursued alongside the earlier demands.
 
 

The new demands included free and equitable access to education and healthcare, employment opportunities, establishment of international airports in AJK, provision of clean drinking and irrigation water, construction of the Taobat-Bhimber Expressway, elimination of corruption, bribery and favouritism in government departments, interest-free loans for youth, regulation of exploitative cellular companies, quotas and financial support for persons with disabilities, and tax exemptions.
It also called for reform of judicial privileges and procedures, including transparent appointments, timely hearings and judicial accountability, to ensure the protection of public rights.
The declaration strongly criticised the continued violation of Article 52-C of the Interim Constitution and a 2019 AJK High Court ruling on hydropower resources, terming them detrimental to the rule of law.
Another key demand was the abolition of 12 legislative seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees living in Pakistan. The committee asserted that these seats had become instruments of exploitation and obstacles to local ownership and self-governance, and their immediate abolition was essential.
Instead, the refugees residing within AJK should be granted legislative representation and ownership rights, particularly those displaced after 1989, the JKJAAC stressed.
It further demanded an immediate halt to what it called the unconstitutional and unethical diversion of development funds from AJK to the so-called 12 constituencies in Pakistan, describing it as a form of open corruption.
It also opposed job quotas for refugees settled in Pakistan, calling them unjust to the residents of AJK. “The right to employment in the liberated territory must be restricted to those living within it,” it added.

Shockingly, the official vehicles in the use of top-ranked officers were spotted violating the traffic laws. They included inspector general of police, Lahore Commissioner and DC, DGs of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Pakistan Post, Agriculture, Excise and Taxation, Punjab Food Authority and Health Services, Lesco CEO and additional chief secretaries.
It was revealed in a report formed by the City Traffic Police (CTP) Lahore, carrying the record of total 3,896 official vehicles that were spotted ignoring traffic rules.
As per the report, the Punjab Police was at the top among other federal and provincial departments whose 496 official vehicles committed traffic violations in Lahore, followed by 358 vehicles of the Services & General Administration Dept and 328 of the Lahore Electricity Supply Company (Lesco).

Vehicles of IGP, commissioner, DC, FIA DG, other top officers found committing violations, not paying fines

About the departments, the traffic police said many vehicles belonged to the CM Monitoring Cell, Law, Parliamentary Affairs & Human Rights Department Punjab, the Pakistan Railways, Punjab Revenue Authority, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd, National Highways Authority, Ministry of Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines, Punjab Home Department, the Environment Protection Department Punjab, the Lahore Development Authority.
A vehicle (LRZ 6076), in the use of an SP, violated the traffic laws 107 times (highest violations) in Lahore and fines imposed on this vehicle, amounting to Rs50,300, were still unpaid. Another vehicle (LZR 9872), which was under the use of the Punjab Agriculture DG, violated the traffic regulations 83 times and its Rs74,000 fine was not paid. An official vehicle (LWQ 1235) belonging to the additional chief secretary (S&GAD) Punjab committed 47 violations and its fine Rs21,300 was still unpaid. Seven other vehicles belonging to the same officer were spotted violating traffic laws 65 times.
The report further revealed that 300 vehicles which violated traffic laws belonged to Wapda, 184 to Livestock & Dairy Department, 181 PTCL, 130 SNGPL, 122 irrigation department, 117 of PFA Punjab, 107 DC office, 102 belonged to the Lahore Cantonment Board, 104 National Highways Authority, 99 of agriculture department, 89 LDA, 76 Pakistan Railways, 69 Punjab Revenue Authority, 68 of Punjab health department, 61 Punjab Horticulture Authority, 42 of Punjab Home Department, 41 of Ring Road Authority, 40 of Punjab Board of Revenue, 37 of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, 31 of FIA etc.
An official said the statistics came to the limelight when the Punjab Safe City cameras spotted the vehicles and issued them e-challan tickets. The city traffic police conducted detailed investigations and found out that these vehicles belonged to 73 departments.
Another irritating part of the development is that all officials in charge of these vehicles never bothered to pay fines, prompting the traffic police high-ups to write them letters to ‘identify the violators and pay fees’ besides initiating action against them.
Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed has brought the matter to the notice of Chief Secretary Zahid Akthar Zaman and IGP Dr Usman Anwar. He has requested the both higher officers of the province to intervene to stop violations being committed by those running the province.
On the other hand, the traffic police lodged 4,541 FIRs against the citizens for violating traffic rules in Lahore during the last 10 days. Many of them were arrested on the spot, the official said.

The India-Pakistan one from earlier this month was no different.
Its aftermath leaves behind a combination of heightened security for some, and heightened insecurity for many others. Incumbents in power in both countries benefited from the strengthening of their domestic positions. When the adrenaline of nationalism runs high, difficult questions about security lapses, geographic vulnerabilities, and long-term policies are set aside. The mood becomes celebratory, lauding, feting, and consecrating those in the driving seat.
Laudatory outcomes in Pakistan include a fresh promotion for the army chief, another extension for the air chief, a significant bump in public approval for the military as per at least one survey, and unquestioning acceptance of the need for greater defence spending to stave off the Indian threat in the future.
 
 

Civilian partners in the incumbent regime also gained an advantage. They can take some comfort in the renewed vigour and tenure security of their ‘same-page’ arrangement. The PML-N might actually be able to see off an entire five-year term without changing their prime minister. And the prospects of a deal between the establishment and the PTI, one that would be beneficial for the latter and harmful for the incumbent party, appears to be off the table for now.
Mirroring the same in India, the BJP-led coalition government appears to have staved off some growing public apathy and incumbent fatigue. It has won space for its security agenda (as demonstrated in the recent anti-Naxal operations), and set itself up well for the upcoming state elections in Bihar. Under the ambit of a national threat, it has also managed to sideline a few irritants in the domestic media space, and shut off indirect people-to-people cultural contact through YouTube and music-streaming platforms.
Going forward, the Indian population’s view of their neighbours will filter through whatever the state deems acceptable. The task of ‘otherising’ the enemy and creating cultural gulfs amidst shared heritage — a long-term agenda of right-wingers in both countries — will be considerably easier.

The bonanza of security for some, opens up a world of insecurity for most others.

This bonanza of security for some, opens up a world of insecurity for most others. One obvious consequence is the vulnerability felt by common citizens in different parts of the region. People living in Pakistani Punjab’s big cities will now go about their daily lives knowing that they remain fair game for missiles and drones launched from India; knowledge made worse by the fact that the trigger for such an attack may be something relatively miniscule and unrelated to their actions. The same is true for those residing in parts of India along its western borders.
 
 

For those already existing under insecurity, such as the people of Kashmir, the skirmish intensifies distress and caution. Pakistan and India may be bitter rivals, but they appear to have forged an implicit agreement around the cheapened worth of Kashmiri lives. These lives in and around the LoC are deemed to be the most dispensable under the ambit of artillery fire. Their level of dispensability is now up by several notches.
Upon its conclusion, open warfare is also leaving behind ‘sub-conventional warfare’ as a strategy for both states. Civilian populations are fair game. Terrorism will continue to rear its ugly head. No one will be spared, not even — as we’ve recently learnt — children on their way to school.
Vectors of heightened insecurity don’t just operate across national borders, they run through internal fault lines as well. States under siege turn their attention to ‘local collaborators’ and domestic nuisances. For Muslims of India-held Kashmir, the terrorist attack and its subsequent aftermath makes a bad situation even worse. The region is already one of the most militarised in the world. Security force deployment is likely to go up further. The practice of regulating movement and communication will become more common. A state of exception, where fundamental rights and civil liberties are distant concepts, will remain the norm.
In Pakistan, all manner of opposition will experience new forms of insecurity. Freshly legitimised, recently rewarded, and thriving in the afterglow of a successful military response to Indian aggression, the establishment is far better placed to move forward with its domestic agenda. Opposition parties, mainly the PTI, find the already small space available to them shrinking even further.
Other initiatives being pushed by the centre, such as the ones related to land allocation and control in Gilgit-Baltistan, have been quickly approved by the local assembly; opposition to the Land Reform Act was summarily dismissed. Several activists were rounded up and incarcerated.
 
 

In the context of such swift domestic action, it might be unsurprising if the contentious issue of canal irrigation in Cholistan rears its head once again. Will opposition be as vigorous this time around, especially considering how the domestic political situation has changed?
No one asked for war, least of all the average Pakistani. The state responded justifiably well to a blatant act of aggression from across the border. In doing so, it carried out an essential task that defines the modern state — securing territorial integrity through the use of violence.
But that is not the only task of the state. Making citizens feel secure and drawing legitimacy from their security and prosperity are also essential. While one particular form of insecurity — the one posed by a belligerent neighbour — has been addressed, other forms have deepened, either inadvertently or on purpose. Perhaps it makes sense to turn some of our attention to these other forms as well.

The latest victim, Sheema Ibrahim, was undergoing treatment at Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta, where she died of her injuries. She was the daughter of a Levies official and had been in critical condition since the explosion.
 
 

The fatalities now include eight APS students, seven girls and one boy, along with two adults. On the day of the attack, three students — Saniya Soomro (Grade 6), Hafza Kausar (Grade 7) and Ayesha Saleem (Grade 10) — died on the spot. In the days that followed, Haider, Mala­ika and Sehr Saleem succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment. The identity of one more student could not be ascertained.
Security officials have condemned the assault, alleging foreign involvement in the targeted attack on schoolchildren. “Eight innocent lives have fallen victim to India’s campaign of terrorism within Pakistan,” a senior security official said.

With feel-like temperature soaring past 40°C and humidity adding to the misery, frustration among the public reached boiling point.
The Sakhi Hassan hydrant is the only operational hydrant supplying water to the densely populated Central district.
The protesters, including women and children, blocked both sides of the road outside the hydrant, disrupting traffic for hours.
Many carried empty water containers, which is a symbol of the growing desperation in the city, already reeling under infrastructural challenges.

Many areas continue to face severe shortage

For over a month, large parts of Karachi, particularly in the Central district, have been experiencing a severe water shortage.
Areas like Buffer Zone, North Karachi, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area and Shadman Town have reported little to no water supply for weeks, forcing residents to rely on expensive private water tankers or travel long distances to fetch water.
“This is not the first protest,” said Shahid Ali, a resident of Shadman Town. “We protested here two weeks ago. The authorities made promises, but nothing changed. We’re still without water. How long can people survive like this?”
The city’s total daily water demand is estimated at over 1,200 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the supply falls drastically short, hovering around 550 to 600 MGD even under optimal conditions.
Both experts and officials agree that chronic infrastructure issues, rampant water theft, deep-rooted corruption within Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation and poor governance have further exacerbated the situation.
Electricity outage at Gharo pump
The fresh crisis got further deeper when the KWSC issued a statement attributing the latest disruption to a technical fault caused by a power outage at the Gharo Pumping Station — a critical component of the city’s water supply network.
According to the KWSC spokesman, a cable fault at 10:35am led to a complete shutdown of the pumping station.
“Due to a cable fault on KE’s network, the Gharo Pumping Station is non-operational at the moment,” the statement read. “We are in continuous coordination with KE to restore operations. However, the fault has not yet been resolved.”
The Gharo Pumping Station is responsible for supplying nearly 30 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to key areas of Karachi, including Port Qasim, Bin Qasim Town, Shah Faisal Town, PNS Mehran, PAF Base Faisal, and Karsaz. With its operations stalled, several districts face further strain on already stretched water resources.

For good reason.
The slew of actions he took would certainly have troubled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Washington lifted sanctions on Syria and Trump met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Riyadh, praising a man who previously had a US bounty on his head. Trump also praised Turkiye’s President Tayyip Erdogan, another of Israel’s adversaries, whose advice to lift sanctions he said he listened to. Netanyahu had urged Trump not to end sanctions.
Trump also forged a truce with the Houthis in Yemen with both sides agreeing to halt military strikes against each other. This too bypassed Israel. Trump secured the release of the last remaining American hostage in Gaza after direct talks between the US and Hamas. But what would have worried Tel Aviv the most was Trump pursuing direct nuclear negotiations with Iran, which Israel vehemently opposes.
There are reports now of US receiving ‘new’ intelligence about Israel making preparations for a military strike on Iranian nuclear installations. If Israel takes this reckless course, it would sabotage Trump’s diplomatic efforts and damage Netanyahu’s relations with Washington, especially as Trump recently told Netanyahu in a phone conversation that talks were moving in the right direction.
Writing in the Financial Times Kim Ghattas saw Trump’s Middle East moves “springing surprises on Netanyahu [and] cutting Israel out of the deals it is making”. She pointed out that Trump’s patience with Netanyahu was running out even though the “decades-long alliance between Israel and the US will endure”. Other commentators referred to the Israeli prime minister being downgraded to a “spectator” during his visit as Trump moved closer to Israel’s enemies.
Despite all this Trump has been unable or unwilling to get Israel to halt its genocidal war on Gaza even though he has long wanted a quick end to the conflict. Although the White House has warned Netanyahu he would be on his own if he continued the war, Israel has expanded its military offensive in Gaza and continued to block humanitarian aid.
With Palestinians being killed every day by air strikes, Netanyahu has threatened to take over all of Gaza ostensibly to “destroy Hamas once and for all”. Additional military forces have been deployed to carry out Israel’s Gideon’s Chariots offensive targeting both southern and northern Gaza, whose aim is to push Palestinians out of the strip. Hundreds of thousands are again being forced from their homes. Forcible displacement of people outside Gaza has long been Netanyahu’s aim.
This has created a catastrophic situation and worsened the humanitarian crisis, forcing millions of Gazans into starvation. The Israeli offensive and blockade of humanitarian aid has provoked an international outcry. UN Secretary General António Guterres called this dire situation “beyond description, beyond atrocious and beyond inhumane”. Demanding an end to the blockade he said, “The entire population is facing the risk of famine.”
 
 

Even Israel’s closest Western allies lashed out against Tel Aviv. In a joint statement, France, the UK and Canada condemned Israel’s military escalation in Gaza and the West Bank, and threatened “concrete actions” including targeted sanctions, if Israel did not end its offensive and lift aid restrictions. The EU announced it would review its trade relations with Israel while countries such as Spain called for tougher action including sanctions.
Twenty-three countries issued a joint statement calling on Israel to allow aid into Gaza and warning that people faced “starvation”. Under mounting pressure, Israel permitted some aid into Gaza but this was slammed as wholly inadequate by the international community.
The response from Amnesty International was telling: “It is outrageous and morally reprehensible that it took the world nearly 80 days of broadcast starvation and cruelty amidst genocide to exert enough pressure on Israel to even slightly ease its total siege that has blocked the entry of all food, medicine, fuel and other vital goods.”
Meanwhile, efforts to renew the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel are going nowhere at Doha. Despite the Trump administration’s unease with the lack of progress in the talks it has been unable to goad the Israelis in that direction. This seemed a factor behind US Vice President J.D. Vance’s recent decision not to visit Israel this month. Although talks have continued after Israel launched its offensive, Netanyahu has little interest in a truce. He unilaterally broke the ceasefire in March and has repeatedly declared he will not end the war until “total victory” is achieved over Hamas.
 
 

This leaves Gaza facing more bloodshed, displacement and devastation. The US-backed Israeli plan to manage and deliver aid to Gaza is hugely controversial and entails establishing a few central distribution sites where people will have to travel from long distances. These hubs will be secured by the military and private armed contractors.
A Swiss-incorporated company, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, will manage the centres. The UN has denounced the plan as a tool for more displacement, which is a war crime. The UN aid chief also said this makes “starvation a bargaining chip”. UN agencies have refused to be part of this arrangement. Humanitarian organisations have condemned the ‘militarisation of aid’.
With Israel embarked on a relentless military campaign to seize and permanently occupy all of Gaza, its far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich told a news conference the goal is to “destroy everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip” and force the population out of ‘combat zones’. From there, he said, “the population will reach the south of the Strip, and [then] move to third countries under President Trump’s plan”. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has said he will end the war only if Hamas releases all hostages and Trump’s plan to relocate the population outside Gaza is implemented.
It is now incumbent on Washington to clarify if Israel is really carrying out Trump’s plan. This is necessary because if untrue it would put pressure on Israel to stop the offensive. If true, it would make a mockery of the image Trump is seeking to cultivate as a man of peace.

Countries Israel had long counted on as allies have been adding their voices to growing international pressure after it expanded its operations against Hamas.
Madrid is hosting 20 cou­ntries as well as international organisations with the aim of “stopping this war, which no longer has any goal”, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Alb­a­res told France Info radio.
Humanitarian aid must enter Gaza “massively, unimpeded, neutrally, so that it is not Israel who decides who can eat and who cannot”, he said.
The meeting, which also includes representatives from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, will promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A previous such gathering in Madrid last year brought together countries  including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye as well as Euro­pean nations such as Ireland and Norway that have recognised a Palestinian state.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast that the city will continue to face hot and humid weather throughout the coming week, with conditions expected to worsen toward the end of the week.
According to a Met department official, the coming Thursday and Friday could be particularly intense, with daytime temperatures potentially exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.
The rising humidity levels, he said, are also expected to persist, which could result in higher “feels-like” temperatures, raising concerns for heat-related health risks.
“The weather pattern indicates a significant rise in temperatures, especially during the latter half of the week,” said the PMD official. “Karachiites should prepare themselves for extremely hot days and avoid unnecessary outdoor activities during peak hours.”

The mushroom growth of illegal cattle markets in densely populated localities of the city have also posed risks to safety for pedestrians and residents.
Several illegal cattle markets were found established in an organised manner by mounting large tents, provision of electricity, security guards and entry points in different parts of the city.
Illegal cattle markets were established underneath the Gizri flyover, at the backside of Dubai Palace in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Plot 39 and adjacent ground near Mosimiat in Block-6, in Scheme 33, Yousuf Goth and near Rais Goth at Hub River Road in district Keamari and near Kala Pul in district South.
Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, who had recently through a notification imposed a ban on illegal cattle markets and roadside sale of livestock, said that the city’s administration was taking strict measures to regulate market activities and ensure compliance with municipal regulations.

Commissioner has allowed markets for sacrificial animals only at 14 spots in seven districts

He said that any market operating without permission from the city administration was considered illegal and would face action.
The illegal cattle markets, which emerged mainly on roadsides and open spaces along the streets, not only cause traffic disruption in different localities, but also create sanitation issues.
Hundreds of thousands of sacrificial animals from various parts of the country are brought for sale in the city on the occasion of the religious festival and many small traders move the livestock to different areas and set up illegal cattle markets.
In many areas across the city, seasonal traders occupy open spaces along the streets and roads, establishing their trading hubs with a dozen or so animals.
Residents of several localities said that the traders brought their animals on the streets a little after dusk and continue their business late in the night, disrupting both vehicular and pedestrian flow.
A resident of Burns Road, Muhammad Shahid, said that the entire vicinity was stinking with the animal waste as several lanes had become trading hub of the sacrificial animals.
The city administration had imposed Section 144 of the criminal procedure code in the city for one month to ensure orderly arrangements for cattle markets.
As per the commissioner’s order, the sale of animals will be banned at the places, other than the permitted cattle markets.
Karachi’s seven district administrations have allowed animal markets at 14 spots in the city.
Officials said that the strict orders had been issued to the authorised market organisers regarding cleanliness, security, and noise prevention.
They said that an effective system for disposing of animal remains and waste had also been imposed in all markets and action would be taken against violators under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The officials said that the crackdown on illegal cattle market was in full swing and the action against illegal trading hubs was being taken on day to day basis.
They said that over 40 unauthorised cattle markets had so far been removed in different parts of the city.
They officials said that the 18 unauthorized markets were removed in district Malir, three in Korangi, four in Central, 12 in East, three in Keamari and two in South.
The illegal trading hubs have even emerged along with the major arteries of the city, including M.A Jinnah Road.

Lahore Qalandars were Pakistan Super League champions again, sealing their third title in four seasons after pulling off a remarkable chase.
Quetta Gladiators had been in the ascendancy in Sunday’s final, headed towards what they believed was their destiny — a second PSL crown — having clinched their first six long years ago. They had tightened the noose around the Qalandars, who, in their chase of 202, needed 57 runs to win off the last 20 deliveries when Raza joined Perera at the crease.
But the Qalandars found inspiration, as Gladiators lost theirs; Perera played a masterful knock of an unbeaten 31-ball 62 featuring four sixes and five fours, with Raza providing the ideal foil with 22 off seven balls to take their side home with a ball to spare. As their teammates ran onto the pitch in jubilation, the Gladiators sank to the ground, left wondering what could have been.
 


Raza, who had flown in from England after featuring for Zimbabwe in a four-day Test that only ended on Saturday and only arrived 10 minutes before the toss for the final, began the recovery when he deposited the first two balls he faced for a four and a six. The hits, both in the mid-wicket region, came immediately after Mohammad Amir had dismissed Bhanuka Rajapaksa to put the Gladiators on top.

Perera, Raza star in nerve-jangling last-over victory against Quetta Gladiators to seal third title in four seasons

Perera launched the offensive from the other end; the left-hander — who only came into the Qalandars’ side after the PSL was halted with eight games to go due to Pakistan-India skirmishes — hit Khurram Shahzad for two sixes and then punished Amir in the penultimate over for two fours and a slog-sweep for six.
That left Qalandars needing 13 off the final over and Raza came to the fore after Hasan Nawaz, who had earlier scored 76 for Gladiators, acrobatically saved a boundary. The Zimbabwean slashed an audacious six over point and then used his wrists to spark Qalandars’ celebrations in front of a partisan home crowd.
Qalandars skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi ran to lift Raza on his shoulders. The pacer — who was the pick of Lahore’s bowlers with 3-24 — had given his side the ideal start in the final when he dismissed his Gladiators counterpart Saud Shakeel early on. Saud’s opening partner Finn Allen departed in the third over, but Hasan checked Qalandar’s building momentum.
 
 

On the first six balls he faced, Hasan got two fours and a massive six over long-on. Rilee Roussow, at the other end, was also dealing in boundaries; his first three scoring shots being two fours and a pull off Haris Rauf for six. The left-hander then found joy on the off side, getting two fours in the sixth over by Salman, and the Gladiators ending the powerplay at 57-2. Rossouw, however, fell soon after, with Raza striking as the South African found Shaheen at short cover.
Losing his partner didn’t stop Hasan, though. Rishad Hossain was belted for two fours off the first three balls of the eighth over. Raza was then deposited for six in the next over before Hasan took Rishad to the cleaners in the 10th with 6, 4, 4 off the first three balls to raise his 50 off just 21 balls as Gladiators got to 100-3 at the midway point of their innings.
Avishka Fernando (29) hit five fours before becoming Rishad’s first victim, but Hasan — seemingly struggling with an injury — kept going on, using brute force to dispatch Raza over his head for six more and he got lucky when he was spilled by Fakhar Zaman two overs later.
Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with 22, hitting two sixes, before holing Shaheen to substitute Mohammad Azab on the second ball of the 18th over with Hasan’s 43-ball knock ending four deliveries later when he found Raza at wide long-on.
Haris returned to dismiss Amir and Abrar Ahmed as Gladiators seemed to crumble late on, but Faheem Ashraf (28 not out) pulled and flicked Salman for three sixes in the final over to take his side to 201-9.
 
 

Mohammad Naeem (46) got Qalandars off to a flier in their chase, bludgeoning Faheem for two sixes, but just when he was threatening to take it away from the Gladiators single-handedly, he saw his partner Fakhar trapped lbw by Abrar.
Naeem survived after Usman Tariq dropped a sitter and with Abdullah Shafique crunching a glorious late cut for four off Abrar, Qalandars reached 56-1 by the end of the powerplay. Naeem hit six sixes in his 27-ball innings, which ended when Faheem had him caught at deep square, bringing Perera to the crease.
Abdullah made 41 off 28 with four fours and a six, but after he top-edged Usman to be caught in the 13th over, the Gladiators seemed to have reined in the Qalandars, who needed 71 off the last five overs. Rajapaksa never got going, but his dismissal only paved the way for Qalandars’ stunning late charge.

For its part, the government considers the contested expenditures critical to providing relief to the middle class, which is burdened with heavy taxes and elevated cost of living, as well as to strengthening Pakistan’s military defences against India. After multiple inconclusive rounds of discussions on the budget proposals for the coming year, the IMF mission left the country, agreeing to continue talks on tax measures and expenditures virtually over the next week.
 
 

Following its visit, the lender issued a statement calling the discussions with Pakistani authorities on the “budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility” constructive. It said that the authorities had “reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6pc of GDP” during the next fiscal year. It said that the “discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure”.
The difference of opinion on higher allocations for defence following India’s unprovoked aggression and on certain tax relief measures for the salaried class is not something to fret over. Previously too, we have seen both sides disagreeing on fiscal measures before finding middle ground. The IMF mission head’s statement also does not indicate any major gap between the two sides on the budget proposals.
The Fund probably wants the government to cover all the bases through additional revenue measures to absorb the impact on its budget left by any tax relief and increase in defence spending. The government must continue on the path of sound macroeconomic policy and fiscal consolidation to protect its fragile recovery that remains vulnerable to potential slippages on account of, for instance, pressure from the real estate lobby for tax breaks and exogenous shocks.
 
 

Indeed, the government is under a lot of political stress from various segments of the population and industry to provide some kind of relief and push growth. Going forward, the pressure will increase and the political leadership may find it difficult to resist the temptation of creating a feel-good atmosphere in the country.
The question is: is it in a position to break free from the IMF’s conditions? It can hardly afford this. Living off multilateral funds and loan rollovers by friendly countries as it is doing at the moment, Pakistan is at a critical juncture and must carefully weigh every step it takes.

• Both sides reaffirm principled support for ‘core concerns’, including Kashmir dispute; call for Gaza ceasefire
• Premier advocates investments in renewable energy, IT, defence production, agriculture
ISLAMABAD: In the first leg of his four-country tour, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Turkiye, where he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to not only thank Ankara for its support during recent tensions with India but also cement bilateral economic cooperation.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday.
In his meeting with President Erdogan, the PM advocated joint ventures and enhanced bilateral investment, highlighting key sectors, including renewable energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure development, and agriculture as potential areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders also conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reiterated their resolve to elevate the strategic partnership. They also followed up on the implementation of key decisions taken during the 7th session of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC), held in Islamabad on Feb 13 this year. Both sides agreed to take steps to achieve the $5 billion annual bilateral trade target agreed earlier by the two leaders.
 
 

In addition to bilateral issues, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan discussed pressing regional and international developments. They also expressed concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, urgently calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.
PM Shehbaz, who was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent developments in South Asia. He lauded Turkiye’s principled stance and the outpouring support of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan and termed it as a source of great comfort and strength for Pakistan.
 






The premier highlighted the commitment, courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the armed forces of Pakistan and the resolute patriotism that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner, which contributed to Pakistan’s victory in Marak-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
According to state-run PTV News, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minis­ter Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also participated in the meeting.
Moreover, both leaders also presided over a delegation-level meeting between the two sides.
Earlier, on his arrival at the airport, the PM was received by Defence Minister Yashar Guler, Istanbul Deputy Governor Erdogan Turan Ermis, Pakistan’s ambassador in Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, and other diplomats.
After the two-day Turkiye visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan during this week.
During the visits, he is expected to hold “wide-ranging discussions” with the nations while acknowledging their support during Pakistan’s recent escalation with India.
According to Dawn.com, in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Confe­rence on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dus­hanbe, on May 29 and 30.
 
 

The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered ceasefire following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a mediator. According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.
Pakistan, Uzbekistan ties
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mini­ster Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich discussed bilateral relations and the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project in a phone call on Sunday, the Foreign Office said in a press release.
During the conversation, the two leaders expressed optimism about the early finalisation of the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project.
The ministers also exchanged views on the regional situation, according to the statement.

Ukraine’s emergency services described a night of  “terror” as Russia launched a second straight night of massive air strikes, including on the capital Kyiv.
The renewed strikes came after Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones overnight Friday to Saturday, which wounded 15.

Kyiv seeks more global pressure on Moscow

Ukraine’s military said on Sunday it had shot down a total of 45 Russian missiles and 266 attack drones overnight. Air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a total of 298 drones were launched, adding that this was “the highest number ever”.
 
 

Four people were reported dead in Ukraine’s western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv in the south. Emer­gency services said 16 people were also injured in the Kyiv region, including three children.
“Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. “The silence of America, the silence of others around the world only encourages Putin,” he said, adding:  “Sanctions will certainly help.”
EU’s diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called for  “the strongest internatio­nal pre­ssure on Russia to stop this war.”
Russia, meanwhile, said its strikes were aimed at Ukraine’s  “military-industrial complex” and said it had brought down 110 Ukrainian drones.

• Man whose nine children killed battling for life in ICU
CAIRO: Israeli military strikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, including a journalist and a rescue service official, health authorities said.
The latest deaths resulted from Israeli strikes in Khan Yunis, Jabalia and Nuseirat areas, medics said.
In Jabalia, local journalist Hassan Majdi Abu Warda and several family members died when an air strike hit his house.
The air strike in Nuseirat killed Ashraf Abu Nar, a senior official in the territory’s civil emergency service, and his wife in their house, medics added.
There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military.
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Abu Warda’s death raised the number of Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, to 220.
 


In a separate statement, the media office said Israeli forces were in control of 77 per cent of the Gaza Strip, either through ground forces or evacuation orders and bombardment that keeps residents away from their homes.
Islamic Jihad, a wing of Hamas, said that fighters had carried out ambushes and attacks using bombs and anti-tank rockets against Israeli forces in several areas across Gaza.
Meanwhile, the father of nine children killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza over the weekend remains in intensive care, said a doctor at the hospital treating him.
Hamdi Al-Najjar, himself a doctor, was at home in Khan Yunis with his 10 children when an Israeli air strike occurred, killing all but one of them. He was rushed to the nearby Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza where he is being treated for his injuries.
Abdul Aziz Al-Farra, a thoracic surgeon, said Najjar had undergone two operations to stop bleeding in his abdomen and chest and that he sustained other wounds including to his head.
“May God heal him and help him,” Farra said, speaking by the bedside of an intubated and heavily bandaged Najjar.

The Israeli military confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Yunis on Friday. The military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the forces had evacuated civilians from the area before the strike began.
According to medical officials in Gaza, the nine children were aged between one and 12 years. The child that survived, a boy, is in a serious but stable condition, the hospital said.
Najjar’s wife, Alaa, also a doctor, was not at home at the time of the strike. She was treating Palestinians injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza in the same hospital where her husband and son are receiving care.
“She went to her house and saw her children burned, may God help her,” said Tahani Yahya Al-Najjar of her sister-in-law.
“With everything we are going through only God gives us strength.”
Tahani visited her brother in hospital on Sunday, whispering to him that she was there: “You are okay, this will pass.”

The Resettlement Programme in Pakistan has been active since the 1980s and more than 20,000 vulnerable refugees have now departed for resettlement to third countries to find safety and rebuild their lives, UNHCR says in its latest resettlement factsheet on Pakistan Operation.
In 2021, following the changed situation in Afghanistan, there was a renewed interest by the international community in the resettlement of Afghan refugees, leading to an increase in resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
 
 

The US topped the list of nine countries that accepted Afghan refugees for resettlement. The US accepted 10,823 Afghan refugees, followed by Australia (4,362), Canada (2,253), the United Kingdom (954), New Zealand (817), Norway (248), Sweden (182), Finland (116), and Italy (72).

Over 300,000 Afghans returned, deported by Pakistan, Iran in a month, says IFRC

Since 2021, several diplomatic missions in Pakistan established their own “Safe Passage” programmes to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of Afghan nationals affiliated with their foreign missions in Afgha­nistan, they are outside the framework of UNHCR’s Resettle­ment Programme, the agency clarified.
“Resettlement is unique in that it is the only durable solution that involves the relocation of refugees from an asylum country to a third country,” the UNHCR said. Those prioritised include survivors of violence, vulnerable women and girls, at-risk children, and individuals with serious medical conditions.
Worsening crisis
Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) warned that Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis — marked by extreme poverty, food insecurity, and a strained health system — is worsening due to a mass influx of returnees, largely triggered by Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“This influx of Afghan nationals has put further strain on an already fragile infrastructure, complicating efforts to provide essential services to those in need,” the IFRC said.
 
 

Last month, the IFRC launched a Federation-wide Emergency Appeal in response to escalating humanitarian needs, seeking 25 million Swiss francs to scale up multi-sectoral immediate and longer-term assistance.
In April, over 144,500 people returned from Pakistan, with more than 29,900 deported. “During the month of April, between 4,000 and 6,000 people were arriving in Afgha­nistan each day,” the IFRC reported.
The influx of returnees, amidst persistent drought, pre-existing internal displacements, and deteriorating economic conditions, is placing immense pressure on already overstretched services.
Adding to the pressure, returns from Iran are also increasing due to policy shifts hindering access to legal protection. Between March 20 and April 30, 170,200 Afghans arrived from Iran. The combined returns from Pakistan and Iran, exceeding 300,000 in April alone, are placing “extreme pressure” on Afghanistan’s border regions and urban areas ill-equipped for such large movements, the IFRC concluded.

However, its fiscal autonomy remains constrained by structural limitations and continued dependence on often-delayed federal transfers.
The government of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah recently enacted the Sindh Agriculture Income Tax Act, 2025, aligning agriculture income tax (AIT) rates with federal individual and corporate tax rates, as well as with those of other provinces. Despite this legislative effort, actual revenue collection from agriculture income in FY25 remains modest, reportedly under Rs2 billion.
“We don’t expect a major spike in AIT collection this year,” said an official familiar with the matter. “The SRB [Sindh Revenue Board] is still in the process of establishing systems to effectively administer this tax. The sharp contrast between the old and new rates may come as a shock to many taxpayers, potentially triggering resistance to compliance. Moreover, the sector is already under considerable stress due to persistent water scarcity and the abolition of the support price system for crops.”
“A clearer picture of AIT’s impact on provincial revenues will emerge once net agricultural income is assessed and declared by agriculturists in September this year,” remarked a senior board member of the SRB board.

Despite performing relatively better than other provinces and showing steady improvement in revenue, Sindh’s own-source revenues account for barely 12-15pc of its total budget

Realising its full revenue potential will require Sindh to broaden its tax base further, strengthening enforcement through automation and technological upgrades, consolidating multiple tax collection agencies and expanding non-tax revenue streams.
Potential non-tax revenue sources include royalties from natural resources such as oil, gas, coal and minerals; income from land and property through rents, land transfer fees and mutation charges; administrative fees and fines; dividends and profits on public investments; user charges for public utilities and hospital and education fees in government-run institutions; and licenses and permits.
Despite performing relatively better than other provinces and showing steady improvement in revenue collection since the Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment in 2010, Sindh’s own-source revenues typically account for barely 12 to 15 per cent of its total budget. The remainder is covered by federal transfers under the National Finance Commission award. In its 2024-25 budget of Rs3.05 trillion Sindh aimed to mobilise Rs450bn (15pc) through local sources.
Sindh has three primary revenue collection agencies, each with a clearly defined operational domain: the SRB, the Board of Revenue (BOR), and the Excise and Taxation Department.
Established in 2011, the SRB is the province’s leading tax authority. With a lean staff of around 360 employees, it relies heavily on automation to facilitate taxpayers’ compliance and curb chances of corruption by minimising physical interaction between taxpayers and tax collectors. The SRB is responsible for collecting sales tax on services, the Workers Welfare Fund and the Workers Profit Participation Fund. Following the enactment of the Agriculture Income Tax Law in 2024, it has also been tasked with the collection of AIT.
The BOR, with a workforce of approximately 20,000, manages land records across the province and collects stamp duty on property transactions along with registration fees.
The Excise and Taxation Department, employing around 16,000 staff, is responsible for collecting various levies, including import/export duties, infrastructure development cess, motor vehicle tax, license fees and other related charges.
According to reliable sources, the SRB now accounts for approximately 65pc of the province’s own-source revenues, BOR 10pc and excise and taxation 25pc. Since its inception in 2011, SRB has recorded an average annual growth rate of over 20pc. From Rs25bn in its first year, collection rose to Rs237bn in FY24. For the current fiscal year (2024-25), the provincial government set an ambitious target of Rs350bn collection by the SRB. However, the key tax body is expected to fall short by Rs50bn, with projected collections reaching Rs300bn by the year end.
Explaining the shortfall, Dr Wasif Ali Memon, Chairman SBR, stated in an exclusive comment, “While the SRB is on course to collect Rs300bn, reflecting a 27pc growth over last year’s Rs237bn, this still represents a shortfall of Rs50bn against the assigned target. However, this gap must be viewed in context.
“Inflation, which significantly impacts ad valorem taxation, has declined sharply from 23.4pc in FY24 to just 5.1pc in FY25. Moreover, the broader economic outlook has weakened, with GDP growth projections revised downward from 3.2pc to 2.6pc (as per the IMF), directly affecting the service sector. Accordingly, increased litigation in various cases has hindered both enforcement and levy of sales tax on services.
He also noted that the Federal Board of Revenue has similarly revised its own revenue target downward, from Rs12.97tr to Rs12.35tr, reflecting the same macroeconomic constraints.
“Agricultural income tax has long been viewed as a lucrative source of revenue that has not only been virtually beyond the tax net unfairly but also seen as a viable avenue used by tax avoiders to park income from other endeavours. Under the IMF’s tutelage all provinces have promulgated new legislation to remove a major anomaly in the taxation regime. It’s a step in the right direction. The success in terms of revenue generation, however, will depend on multiple factors but most of all on the serious intent and efforts of provincial governments,” commented an analyst.

The sale of both imported and locally made heavy vehicles, cars and two-wheelers has shown a robust trend.
This is evident from the official figures suggesting huge import bills for both completely built-up (CBU) units as well as completely and semi-knocked-down (CKD/SKD) kits being imported by the assemblers for local assembly of vehicles.
Huge imports of any kind usually give a serious jerk to the sale of locally made items, but strangely in the case of automobiles, cash-rich consumers are going wild for both imported and locally made vehicles.
The import bill of CBU buses and trucks, along with other heavy vehicles and cars and bikes, soared to $85 million, $228m and $2.1m, respectively, in 10MFY25 from $45m, $207m and $1.33m in the same period last fiscal, showing a jump of 88pc, 10pc and 54pc.

IMF’s tariff cuts, followed by an increase in the age limit of used cars to five years, may slow down sales of locally made vehicles and harm the country’s manufacturing base

Market pundits believe that electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs are being imported by the new entrants, followed by small volumes of imports of fossil fuel vehicles by the local assemblers. One cannot rule out the huge import of used cars in the overall CBU import bill.
Importers try to hide rising trends in used car imports. The CEO of Indus Motor Company, Ali Asghar Jamali, has recently pointed out that used car imports still represent a significant portion of 29 per cent of the local auto market by value in the current financial year.
He noted during July-March FY25, imports of used vehicles increased modestly by 6pc to 29,590 units from 27,859 in the same period last year.
Likewise, the import of CKD/SKD kits for heavy vehicles, cars and bikes by the local assemblers stood at $330m, $818m and $38m, respectively, during 10MFY25, up by 141pc, 37pc and 11pc over the same period last fiscal year.
As things have been moving in a positive direction prior to the new budget FY26, auto players have received a shock from the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) tariff rationalisation plan followed by tariff cuts in National Tariff Policy 2025-2030 for many sectors, including the automotive sector. The IMF also backs up the reduction in the age limit of used cars to five years and allows the commercial import of vehicles.

In the upcoming budget, the government needs to rationalise tariff structures applied equally to all assemblers — old and new — based on a clear localisation roadmap

These developments have caused anxiety among the executives of the auto sector, who have been continuously engaged in meetings with the Ministry of Industries and Production, pointing out serious repercussions of the IMF-backed programme in which vendors fear loss of over 500,000 jobs in case of tariff rationalisation.
The government, which appears helpless, has also reportedly asked the assemblers to engage foreign consultants to deal with the IMF tariff rationalisation plan.
Tariff cuts, followed by an increase in the age limit of used cars to five years from three years, may slow down sales of locally made vehicles. Used cars arriving under various schemes will further make deeper inroads, as cuts in tariffs on new and used vehicles will bring down prices of these vehicles.
Auto sector expert Mashood Ali Khan said an increase of 40pc in the sales of cars, pickups, sports utility vehicles (SUV) and vans to 111,464 during 10MFY25 has pushed up the import of CKD/SKD kits by the assemblers, thus contributing to the trade deficit.
However, the majority of this volume is dominated by new entrants, mainly Chinese and Korean SUV assemblers. “There is negligible localisation in new models. SUVs and premium segment vehicles assembled by new entrants have very low or zero localisation,” he claimed.
These new players are taking full advantage of tariff concessions under government policies, importing parts instead of developing local supply chains. As a result, local parts manufacturers are excluded from the value chain, while the national import bill continues to rise, Mr Khan explained.
Historically, once imports start rising without industrial safeguards, local manufacturing suffers, leading to factory closures and layoffs.
Speaking about the IMF’s guidelines, Mr Khan explains, “If implemented, this will directly challenge local assemblers, lowering prices of imported vehicles and hurting local auto parts manufacturers. Price competition is welcome — but unfair competition from subsidised imports risks collapsing three decades of local vendor investment.”
He said parts makers are facing enormous challenges like unfair tariff advantages for new entrants, unpredictable localisation obligations, greater preference for imports, low volumes from existing assemblers due to market shrinkage, rising costs of raw materials, utilities, and currency depreciation. There is no structured export policy for auto parts manufacturers, as auto parts exports have been reeling at $20-25m per annum for decades.
In the upcoming budget, the government needs to rationalise tariff structures for fair competition, and tariffs should apply equally to all assemblers — old and new — based on a clear localisation roadmap.
Pakistan cannot afford to sacrifice its local manufacturing base for short-term gains through relaxed imports. The upcoming budget is an opportunity to correct course and support a balanced, fair, and forward-looking industrial policy, Mr Khan said.
Shankar Talreja of Top Line Securities said lifting restrictions on used car imports and relaxing the existing age limit of three years to five years will increase the import of used vehicles, which will impact auto assemblers negatively. However, this will be implemented from July 2026 onwards; only legislation needs to be submitted by July 2025.
Mr Talreja was of the view that hatchback car makers will be more affected than sedan/SUV manufacturers, as the large import market comprises engine capacities up to 1,000 cc, in which largely Pak Suzuki operates, though the Kia Picanto also holds some market share.
The government seeks to “extend the principle of removing the preferential treatment of local production to other industries by July 2026, and this will be implemented in a gradual manner until FY30. Mr Talreja said this will be a problem for local auto vendors, as auto assemblers are currently incentivised to buy locally made parts from Pakistan, as duties on these parts were higher for imports.
After removal of this preferential treatment, both local and imported parts will be on a level playing field. Nonetheless, this will be a gradual shift and will start from July 2026 onwards, he said.

Arne Slot’s side wrapped up their record-equalling 20th English crown with a demolition of Tottenham in April, but the long-awaited trophy presentation was saved for the final game of the season.
Liverpool’s last title in 2020 was won during the Covid-19 lockdown, meaning the trophy was held aloft by then-captain Jordan Henderson in front of an empty stadium.
The Reds made the most of their first title celebration in a packed Anfield since 1990 as the 61,000-capacity crowd partied along with the great and good of Liverpool’s illustrious past.
“It’s always special to win something, but at certain clubs maybe a little bit more,” Slot said. “I don’t think you expect anything like this. If you look at the Premier League in the last few seasons, it was always a race to the end.
“To be part of it was already nice, let alone to win it.”
Alan Hansen, who captained Liverpool in their last trophy lift at a full Anfield in 1990, presented the silverware to current Reds skipper Van Dijk.
Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool’s manager 35 years ago, was watching from the stands, as was Jurgen Klopp, who masterminded the Reds’ Premier League triumph in 2020 before leaving last year.
Fireworks, smoke and red ticker tape filled the air as the trophy was paraded around Anfield, with the famous Kop stand adorned with banners and flags emblazoned with slogans hailing their heroes.
Even Trent Alexander-Arnold — the Liverpool right-back controversially set to leave in a widely-expected move to Real Madrid — was embraced by fans on his final appearance for his boyhood club.
Alexander-Arnold had been booed after coming on as a substitute for the recent draw with Arsenal in the first game following his announcement that he will depart when his contract expires in June.
Rousing scene
With Anfield in party mood, tearful Alexander-Arnold was granted a fond farewell as he was cheered when he came off the bench in the second half, the Liverpool-born defender responding by kissing his badge.
Liverpool failed to win any of their four games after sealing the title.
But that couldn’t detract from the festive atmosphere, which was in full swing before the game even kicked off as Slot’s team were given a guard of honour onto the pitch by Palace’s players, before the Reds returned the favour to salute the FA Cup winners.
Ismaila Sarr’s ninth-minute goal for Palace couldn’t spoil the occasion either.
Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who had been booked for diving, was shown a straight red card after his foul on Daichi Kamada in the 68th minute.
But Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool avoided defeat in their finale when he bundled home in the 84th minute.
Salah’s 29th goal this season equalled the Premier League record of most goal involvements in a season, previously held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer, who both achieved 47 in a 42-game season.
The Egypt forward finished as the Premier League’s golden boot winner for a record-equalling fourth time.
Liverpool’s players gathered in one long line to sing the club anthem ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ in a rousing scene after the trophy presentation.
The party is set to continue on Monday when Liverpool will parade the trophy through the city on an open-top bus.</p><small>2025-05-25 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2520245127bfdf9.jpg?r=204443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913266/nine-terrorists-killed-in-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Nine terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists “sponsored” by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday, according to the military’s media wing.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), nine “Indian-sponsored khawarij” were killed in three separate engagements.
“An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Dera Ismail Khan district, on [the] reported presence of Indian sponsored khwarij,” the military’s media wing said, using the term designating terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
During the engagement, security forces “effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell”.
According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in Tank District and two more Indian-sponsored khawarij were “sent to hell” by the security forces.
In the third operation in Khyber district’s Bagh area, “own troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khawarij”, the ISPR said.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari both expressed appreciation for the security forces following the operations, The Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Due to [the] professional expertise of Pakistan’s armed forces, [the] eradication of terrorists and terrorism was underway at great pace,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
Vowing to foil the designs of terrorists, he said, “Justice will be meted out to the terrorists patronised by India for causing damage to the life and property of the citizens.”
The PM added that the government and security forces were “determined to completely wipe out terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, President Zardari praised security forces for killing the nine terrorists and said that operations against will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism.
“The successful operations of the security forces against the Indian-supported terrorists was commendable,” the president was quoted as saying. “Our determination to root out terrorist elements and defend the country is unwavering.”
Last week, 12 terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the ISPR had said on Monday.
It added that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the TTP in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.
An IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent “five Indian sponsored” terrorists to “hell”, it said. In a second IBO in the Bannu district, two “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were “successfully neutralised” by the security forces.
It further said that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district’s general area of Mir Ali, adding that two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “sent to hell” after the effective response of troops.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of the soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.”
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitnah-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
A significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-25 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25175843b3e71aa.jpg?r=175850' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913259/ex-senator-farhatullah-babar-warns-against-unilaterally-declaring-activists-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Farhatullah Babar warns against ‘unilaterally declaring activists terrorists’</strong></a><br><p>Former PPP senator and prominent human rights defender Farhatullah Babar has warned against labelling Baloch Yakjehti Committee Chief Mahrang Baloch, her group, or anyone “a terrorist” without evidence or trial, terming such statements “extremely problematic” that could “backfire”.
Babar, head of the PPP’s Human Rights Committee, said this in response to remarks made by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry earlier this week, who during a press conference vehemently criticised the BYC and Mahrang, saying that the media needed to “unmask” the group and its membership.
He had said that the group spoke about human rights and missing persons, yet when the armed forces eliminate terrorists and conduct DNA identification, “many of them turn out to be the very individuals listed as missing.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry also talked about the Jaffer Express hijacking incident, in which more than 400 people were taken hostage by the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and said: “Innocent people were targeted […] who is she and who are they (BYC) to claim terrorists’ bodies? It is now clear that the BYC is a proxy of terrorism. Terrorists and their proxies have to be dealt with in the way that any nation deals with proxies. There is no doubt; there should be absolute clarity on that.”
 


In a Saturday post on X, Babar wrote that unilaterally declaring the BYC, or any group or individual, was “extremely problematic” and could backfire.
“[It is] unwise and dangerous to mount a high horse without knowing how to dismount,” the former senator wrote. “Curb the impulse to dub rights defenders as terrorists.”
 






While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang — who has been jailed along with some BYC members since  March for what the government alleges was an attempt to claim the bodies of the Jaffer Express attackers and “inciting people to violence” — is included on its list of proscribed persons.
A day before the arrest, Mahrang and BYC members had faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
In response to the DG ISPR’s comments, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch also published a post on the BYC leader’s behalf on X on Sunday, writing, “My activism is peaceful, principled, and grounded in universal human rights values. I have consistently condemned violence, whether committed by non-state actors or the state itself.”
Calling the DG ISPR’s allegations “unsubstantiated”, Mahrang said that the press conference was “widely misused” to distort her message and that she did not condone any acts of violence during her own press conference in March, according to the statement.
Her statement continued: “In response to the DG ISPR’s latest accusations, I ask: where is the evidence?”
In April, she and other BYC leaders launched a hunger strike to protest alleged “torture” by jail staff, as well as the transfer of activist Beebow Baloch to District Jail Pishin.
Nadia wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi requesting “urgent intervention” against the alleged mistreatment of her sibling and other leaders of the group in prison.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.</p><small>2025-05-25 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25203242aba2932.jpg?r=203452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913267/norris-wins-dream-maiden-monaco-grand-prix' target='_blank'><strong>Norris wins ‘dream’ maiden Monaco Grand Prix</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris won his maiden Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday to close the gap on his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri in the battle for the 2025 drivers’ world title.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc took second, with Piastri completing the podium in the eighth race of the season.
Norris closed to within three points of Piastri after adding the jewel in the F1 calendar to his season-opening win in Australia.
Four-time reigning world champion Max Verstappen took fourth with Lewis Hamilton in the other Ferrari rounding out the top five.
“Monaco, baby! It’s a dream,” Norris exclaimed over the team radio, after becoming the first McLaren driver to win on the sinuous streets of the Principality since Hamilton in 2008.
“It feels amazing, it’s a long, gruelling race. An amazing weekend with pole, with today. This is what we dream of, this is what I did dream of as a kid,” beamed the 25-year-old.
He was pushed hard to the end of the gruelling and at times chaotic afternoon in the Monaco sunshine by Leclerc, who took second, 3.131 seconds behind.
“Lando did a better job and he deserves to win. It is above our expectations here, I thought we would struggle to be in the top 10, so it has been a good weekend, but I wish I’d won,” said the Monaco-born Leclerc.
Piastri rued a tricky time in qualifying on Saturday.
“I got close but not close enough, and you run around here where you started,” said the Australian.</p><small>2025-05-25 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25181733a6208dd.jpg?r=182448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913262/mir-ali-protest-continues-locals-say-will-march-towards-islamabad-if-demands-not-met' target='_blank'><strong>Mir Ali protest continues, locals say will march towards Islamabad if demands not met</strong></a><br><p>Locals in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali district continued their sit-in on Sunday for the seventh day, protesting against a suspected drone strike in the district — that they say is responsible for the death of four children — vowing to launch a long march to Islamabad if their demands were not met.
The suspected strike took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The police have held talks with tribal elders, which have so far remained inconclusive.
Earlier this week, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), had clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the local elders, the sit-in near the Mir Ali cantonment area continued for the seventh day as authorities allegedly blocked all network and internet systems in the district.
The local elders threatened to cut internet cables providing connectivity to the cantonment area if the internet system and mobile signals were not restored in the rest of the district by Sunday evening.
The organisers of the sit-in issued a statement, seen by Dawn.com,  seeking justice for the children who lost their lives in the incident.
“The people of Waziristan will not remain silent and will launch a long march towards Islamabad on May 26, 2025 (tomorrow), if our demands are not fulfilled,” the statement, issued by the Mir Ali sit-in committee, said.
“The long march will commence from the venue of the protest sit-in in Mir Ali, pass through Bannu Bazaar and Township Chowk, and reach Domel Highway Chowk where locals will join them. It will then march toward Karak and Kohat and others will join the procession,” the statement said.
It added that the long march will reach Peshawar where the protesters will stay the night and will be joined by people from other districts.
“The next morning, the participants will march toward Islamabad, after passing through Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan and Swabi where other processions will join them,” it said.
The protests also laid out their demands, including “a judicial inquiry into the Mir Ali incident and punishment of the culprits; justice, protection, and state assistance to the families of the victims; and a complete end to drone attacks”, among other stipulations, according to the statement.
The statement further said that after reaching Islamabad, protesters will hold a peaceful demonstration for their demands in front of government offices and state institutions.
“We believe in peaceful protests and this long march will mark a milestone in the struggle against oppression, injustice, and silence and awaken the nation’s conscience,” the statement said.
In its statement on Wednesday, the ISPR said initial findings had established that this “heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored Fitnah Al Khwarij,” using the term the state uses to refer to the TTP.
“Following a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan’s security forces,” it added.
“These claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces’ steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.”
It said that a “comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated” in response to the accusations.
“It is evident that these elements — acting at the behest of their Indian masters — continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.”
It further said that security forces reaffirmed “their commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.”</p><small>2025-05-25 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25165017f2f82be.jpg?r=165250' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913255/bangladesh-court-begins-first-trial-of-hasina-era-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh court begins first trial of Hasina-era officials</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh on Sunday began the first trial at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.
The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection with the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.
The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
“The formal trial has begun,” Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters. “The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused.”
It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year’s student-led uprising, which ended Hasina’s iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.
The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka’s former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.
Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally. She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka’s extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.
‘Command responsibility’
The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.
Islam said the eight men were accused of “different responsibilities”, including the most senior for “superior command responsibility, some for direct orders … [and] some for participation”.
He said he was confident of a successful prosecution.
“We have submitted as much evidence as required to prove crimes against humanity, both at a national and an international standard,” he said.
Among that evidence, he said, was video footage of the violence, as well as voice recordings of Hasina in “conversations with different people where she ordered the killing of the protesters using force and lethal weapons”.
The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009. It sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death over the following years and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate rivals.</p><small>2025-05-25 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25140645cbe0a16.jpg?r=175023' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913242/trump-defends-block-on-foreign-students-at-harvard' target='_blank'><strong>Trump defends block on foreign students at Harvard</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump defended on Sunday his administration’s move to block foreign students at Harvard after a judge suspended the action, branded by the top university as unlawful.
“Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31 [per cent] of their students are from foreign lands, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay nothing toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday revoked Harvard’s ability to enrol foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
She had threatened last month to block international students at the school unless it turned over records on visa holders’ “illegal and violent activities”.
But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government’s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and unconstitutional action”.
The White House is cracking down on US universities on several fronts, justified as a reaction to what the administration says is uncontrolled anti-Semitism and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.
It has also moved to revoke visas and deport foreign students involved in protests against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, accusing them of supporting Palestinian group Hamas.
At Harvard, the government has threatened to put $9 billion of funding under review, then went on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2bn of grants and $60 million of official contracts. It has also targeted a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.
The loss of foreign nationals — more than a quarter of its student body —could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition.
Harvard is the wealthiest US university with an endowment valued at $53.2bn in 2024.</p><small>2025-05-25 10:54</small></div><hr>
