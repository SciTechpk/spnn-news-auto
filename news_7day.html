Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger urban flooding, deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas. The Meteorological Department had predicted rains in the city from this week.
According to the Met Office, as of 8pm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed recorded the highest level of rain at 170 millimetres, followed by Airport Old Area with 158.5mm, Jinnah Terminal 153mm, Nazimabad 149.6mm, Surjani Town 145.2mm, Keamari 140mm, Saadi Town 140.2mm, Defence Housing Authority Phase VII 134mm, University Road 133mm, PAF Base Faisal 128mm, North Karachi 108.4mm, Korangi 132.2mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 98mm, PAF Masroor Base 87mm, Orangi Town 66.2mm and Bahria Town 4.8mm.
The traffic police advised citizens to take precautionary measures in light of the situation, such as avoiding sudden braking, maintaining a slow speed and a safe distance from other vehicles on the road.
 






Visuals showed main roads and arteries of the city submerged under water with traffic stuck.
Commuters faced challenges as the hours-long rain spell led to the city’s main thoroughfares choked with traffic and long lines of vehicles with people reporting reaching home after several hours.
In another development, a statement from Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL) said it was currently facing data connectivity challenges on its namesake and Ufone services.
“Our teams are diligently working to restore the services as quickly as possible,” the statement said.
Internet tracking monitor Netblocks also said its metrics showed major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan with high impact to backbone operator PTCL.
“Overall national connectivity is down to 20 per cent of ordinary levels,” it said.
 


Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that four walls of a house collapsed due to heavy rains in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12, with five family members buried underneath.
He said the department’s Urban Search and Rescue Team arrived at the spot and retrieved the five from the debris but three of them had died on the spot, a fourth succumbed to wounds during treatment while the fifth person was admitted for treatment. He said all victims belonged to the same family.
Haseeb said an eight-year old child was also killed when a wall of a house collapsed due to the rain in Orangi Town near Khalil Market. He said a Rescue 1122 team rushed to the spot and recovered the body, which was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
The spokesperson further said that a man died from an electric shock in North Karachi, adding that the body was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
In another incident, Haseeb said a man was burnt to death while two others suffered critical burn wounds when a fire erupted at a petrol pump in Malir. He told Dawn.com that the fire, suspected to be caused by a short circuit, occurred around 3:48pm at the petrol pump in Malir-15.
He said three people suffered critical burn wounds and were moved to a hospital but one of them succumbed to his injuries while the other two were in critical condition.
Haseeb said both petrol pump staff and Malir Senior Superintendent of Police Abdul Khaliq Pirzada told the rescue team that a short circuit triggered the fire.
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah directed the district administration, the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), the health department, and Rescue 1122 to remain on high alert amid the situation.
He ordered the immediate drainage of rainwater and instructed the relevant administrations to remain in contact with the  Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the PDMA.
“All deputy commissioners should be present in the field with their staff,” the chief secretary said.
 

A Google Maps screenshot at 7:20pm on Tuesday shows traffic blockages at several thoroughfares across the city.

Separately, PMD, in a weather advisory, forecasted intermittent rains to continue throughout the day.
The minimum temperature is expected to remain at 28 degrees Celsius, while the humidity will be 85 per cent.
In an update posted at 9pm, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said the company’s distribution system was stable despite the city facing urban flooding.
“At this time, power supply continues to more than 1,285 out of 2,100 feeders in Karachi. Restoration work is facing severe difficulties due to accumulated rainwater in various areas.
“Restoration work is ongoing in affected areas as soon as accumulated rainwater recedes and safety clearance is received from on-ground teams,” the spokesperson said.
He also provided the names of areas where power was currently being restored and where it was already back.
 






A weather forecast from the PMD at 4pm predicted “torrential rains” in Sindh and parts of Balochistan in the next couple of days.
“Strong monsoon currents from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country especially the southern parts,” the PMD said.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger urban flooding, deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas. The Meteorological Department had predicted rains in the city from this week.
According to a notification from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Mayor Murtaza Wahab has declared a rain emergency in the city.

According to a notification issued by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), the mayor “cancelled all types of leave, including weekly holidays” for the essential services departments, directing them to remain available.
He also directed the municipal services, the fire brigade and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) departments of KMC to establish a Rain Emergency Cell in coordination with all essential services departments.
 






On the instructions of the Karachi East Zone’s Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Dr Farrukh Ali, the East Zone police is on high alert to deal with the possible effects of rains, the DIG’s Media Cell said in a statement.
“Clear orders have been issued to all SDPOs (sub-divisional police officers) and SHOs (station house officers) to remain present in their respective areas, ensure drainage, traffic flow and take immediate steps to deal with any emergency,” the statement said.
It added that the DIG had instructed that the protection of life and property of citizens should be ensured at all costs, paying special attention to low-lying areas. Rescue teams and helplines should be kept active, and timely guidance and assistance should be provided to the public.
 
 

The DIG statement also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary movement during bad weather, advising them to contact 15 or the nearest police station immediately in case of any emergency.
“Police are with the public at all times in all weathers,” it added.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani contacted various town chairmen, municipal committee chairmen and municipal commissioners over the phone to seek details regarding the situation after the rains.
The chairmen of all towns and union councils and the municipal commissioners should immediately use all resources to drain water from the roads on an emergency basis.
“In the first phase, all important highways should be cleared so that the delivery of machinery or other equipment to the affected areas can be ensured,” he said in a statement from his office, adding that small highways and roads should be tackled next.
He urged citizens to limit their movement due to water on the roads to avoid any accidents, and also urged them to stay away from power poles and other electrical installations.
“In some areas, due to the power outage by K-Electric, sewage pumping stations are facing difficulties. As an alternative, these pumping stations are being operated with emergency generators,” he said.
A rain emergency cell was also established at the Governor’s House, with citizens impacted by the rain and traffic directed to immediately reach out for help at 1366.
The cell will remain active around the clock and provide timely aid to victims.
“Citizens will not be left alone in difficult times; all possible facilities will be provided,” Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori was quoted as saying in a statement.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
On Monday, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani had said that arrangements were in place to deal with the upcoming monsoon spell as parts of Karachi received light rain on Monday.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains expected to impact Karachi and other parts of the province.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.</p><small>2025-08-19 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19175410551382c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931889/after-na-senate-also-gives-nod-to-anti-terrorism-act-amendments-amid-oppositions-uproar' target='_blank'><strong>After NA, Senate also gives nod to Anti-Terrorism Act amendments amid opposition’s uproar</strong></a><br><p>After the National Assembly, the Senate on Tuesday also passed an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, which reinserted powers granted to law enforcement authorities (LEAs) and the armed forces to detain individuals for up to three months, amid the opposition’s uproar.
Last week, National Assembly had passed the amendment to the ATA.
Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Muhammad Tallal Badar moved the Anti-terrorism Amendment Bill 2025 to amend the ATA in the House, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
A copy of the bill, available with Dawn.com read: “The government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case maybe, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this
regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording
reasons thereof, issue order for the preventative detention of any person.”
This amendment was made to sub-section (1) of Section 11EEEE of the ATA.
Any person suspected of activities against national security or safety will be detained, according to the bill, adding that persons involved in target killing, kidnapping for ransom, extortion can be detained for three months.
The bill also added that it applies “against whom sufficient grounds exist of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry”.
The bill available stated that the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
If a detention order is issued by the army or civil forces, the investigation will be conducted by a joint investigation team, according to the bill.
“The inquiry will be conducted by no police officer below the rank of of Superintendent of Police, Intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies,” the bill added.
JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza moved certain amendments to the bill but the House rejected them with majority of votes, APP added.
The house passed the bill through clause by clause reading.
The statement of objects and reasons of the bill said that the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework.
“The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the Act ibid are required to re-inserted to empower the government, Armed Forces and Civil Armed Forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed.
This will also provide law enforcement enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It would facilitate the use of joint interrogation teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.
Earlier, responding to various points raised by lawmakers in the Senate, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said: “Currently the country is facing menace of terrorism and amendments proposed by Syed Naveed Qamar have already been incorporated to make it more effective.”
The bill has also already passed judicial scrutiny tests, he said adding that that a three years sun-set clause has also been added in it.
Tarar said that under Clause 2 of the amendment, the detainee would have presented before the Magistrate within 24 hours.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar of PTI said that they were also against the menace of terrorism and wanted to curb it. However, he continued that “some of its clauses are against the law and constitution so the bill should be referred to the committee”.
Speaking on the occasion, PML-N Senator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui emphasised that no leniency should be shown toward terrorism.
“We do not want terrorists roaming freely while innocent people are slaughtered in different provinces, on passenger trains like the Jaffar Express, or in targeted attacks. These acts weaken our federation and create mistrust between the people and the state,” he observed.
Siddiqui urged lawmakers to view anti-terrorism legislation in its proper spirit as we have lost nearly 100,000 lives to the menace of terrorism. “We must either surrender to militants or legislate to resist them. Such laws can prevent crime and also curb forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions,” he said.
Senator Siddiqui urged all parties to take anti-terrorism legislation in good faith rather than perceiving it as a tool against political opponents.
He said that the government and opposition must ensure transparent communication with the public and media regarding legislative measures, according to APP.
Section 11EEEE of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern over the passage.</p><small>2025-08-19 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191739307f16a11.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931892/markram-maharaj-lead-south-africa-to-crushing-win-against-australia-in-odi-series-opener' target='_blank'><strong>Markram, Maharaj lead South Africa to crushing win against Australia in ODI series-opener</strong></a><br><p>South Africa’s Aiden Markram hit 82 before left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj tore through Australia’s new-look batting order as the Proteas claimed the One-Day International series opener by 98 runs in Cairns on Tuesday.
Sent in to bat, Markram — opening for the first time in ODIs since 2021 — crunched nine boundaries in his 81-ball knock to power South Africa to a formidable 296-8.
Skipper Temba Bavuma (65) and Matthew Breetzke (57) also helped set the tone for the three-match ODI series.
 






In reply, openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head flattened South Africa’s pacemen as Australia raced to 60-0 after seven overs.
But the match flipped after the introduction of spin, with Maharaj conjuring rampant turn, and he picked up four wickets in his first 15 balls.
He finished with career-best figures of 5-33 from 10 overs as Australia were dismissed for 198 in the 41st over.
It was a strong bounce back from South Africa after their 2-1 defeat in the Twenty20 series between the teams.
“I just tried to utilise the conditions and was fortunate to get the rewards,” Maharaj said.
Marsh played a lone hand with 88 off 96 balls in a disappointing batting effort from Australia, transitioning after the recent retirements of veterans Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell from ODI cricket.
“He’s (Maharaj) an outstanding bowler and there was certainly a little bit more spin than we expected,” said Marsh, who is captaining Australia in this series in place of Pat Cummins.
South Africa had been rocked by the news that quick Kagiso Rabada would miss the series with an ankle injury.
An unruffled Markram appeared to be cruising to his fourth ODI century before he was caught behind off left-arm quick Ben Dwarshuis in the 24th over.
A sluggish Bavuma was overtaken by Breetzke, playing his third ODI.
But South Africa lost three wickets for just seven runs with the fall of Breetzke, Tristan Stubbs (duck) and Dewald Brevis (six), before Bavuma kicked on.
 
 

After a breakout T20 series, ODI debutant Brevis hit a first-ball six — but then holed out to Head, who finished with 4-57.
Head’s excellent match continued with the bat until he was stumped for 27, providing debutant offspinner Prenelan Subrayen with his first ODI wicket.
Making his return since being axed from Australia’s Test team, Marnus Labuschagne (one) fell on his sixth delivery after unsuccessfully reviewing an lbw decision off Maharaj.
Cameron Green (three) and Josh Inglis (five) were clean bowled by a pumped-up Maharaj, who also had Alex Carey lbw for a golden duck.
Maharaj was unable to complete the hat-trick, but claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in ODI cricket when he knocked over Aaron Hardie (four).
The second game will be played in the northern Queensland city of Mackay on Friday.</p><small>2025-08-19 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191548516d6e4c4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931887/interior-ministry-reports-200-child-sexual-abuse-cases-since-2022' target='_blank'><strong>Interior ministry reports 200 child sexual abuse cases since 2022</strong></a><br><p>The interior ministry informed the Senate on Tuesday that of the 567 cases of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025, 200 of them involved children.

In July, police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Punjab’s Kasur district went viral online.
In June, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.
In January of 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death, sparking outrage across the nation.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-08-19 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191312589611a38.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931874/at-least-358-dead-as-kp-reels-from-devastating-floods-rehabilitation-efforts-underway' target='_blank'><strong>At least 358 dead as KP reels from devastating floods; rehabilitation efforts underway</strong></a><br><p>At least 358 people died as a result of heavy flooding and downpour in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the last three days, while rehabilitation efforts are still underway as the province recovers from the record deluge, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said on Tuesday.

Separately, the flood-ravaged Baltistan Highway was reopened for all kinds of traffic, according to Shahzad Baig, officer of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA).
He said, “The Baltistan Highway, which was blocked six days ago due to the bridge being washed away following severe flooding in the Istak Nullah, was restored with the joint efforts of the Pakistan Army and GBDMA.”
A large number of mountaineers, tourists and passengers had been stranded due to the week-long closure of the highway, he added.
On Saturday, GB Home Minister Shams Lone [said][1] that the Baltistan Highway bridge had been swept away, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit.
“As soon as the highway was opened, oil tankers and trucks loaded with other necessities of life left for Skardu,” Baig added.
A resident of Skardu, Qasim Butt, said that the closure of the highway caused a shortage of petrol and food items in the four districts, which worried the locals.
“A day before the Istak Nullah, the Baltistan Highway was closed due to the Baghicha RCC bridge being washed away in the flood. However, traffic flow was maintained by creating an alternative route,” he said, adding that the highway was now fully reopened.
22 killed in Balochistan since June 28
Balochistan’s PDMA reported that 22 people have been killed and nine injured in the province as a result of monsoon rain and flooding since June 28, including two killed and one injured in Harnai yesterday due to a roof collapse.
Of the remaining casualties, four people were killed and two injured in Zhob, six killed and one injured in Khuzdar, four killed in Duki, one in Ziarat, two killed and four injured in Musakhail, one killed and one injured in Kohlu, and one each in Lasbela and Loralai.
During this period, 83 houses were reported damaged across the province, including 14 completely destroyed, along with four cases of damage to public property. The PDMA also reported that 357 solar panels were damaged in Dera Bugti.
The National Highway Authority said that work had started on the restoration of the bridge.
Authorities placed on high alert in Punjab
Meanwhile, several cities in Punjab also received heavy rain over the last 24 hours, with PDMA forecasting more showers, expected to last until August 23, according to a spokesperson of the Punjab PDMA.
“In the last 24 hours, 95mm of rain was recorded in Noorpur Thal, 93mm in Faisalabad, 73mm in Murree and 68mm in Rahim Yar Khan,” the statement said, adding that Bhakkar received 67mm of rain, Kot Addu 60mm, Attock 34mm, Gujranwala 28mm, Rajanpur 25mm, Dera Ghazi Khan 21mm, and  Mangla receiving 17mm of rain.
According to the spokesperson, heavy rain was expected in Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Toba Tek Singh, Mandi Bahauddin, DG Khan, Bahawalpur, and Mianwali today.
Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, and Sahiwal were also expected to receive rain.
The spokesperson warned of the risk of flooding in the rivers and canals of low-lying areas as a result of the rain, as well as landslides in mountainous regions such as Murree.
He advised tourists to remain cautious in light of the weather situation and urged citizens to take precautionary measures.
PDMA’s provincial control room and district emergency centres have been placed on high alert, the spokesperson added.
Director General, Punjab PDMA, Irfan Ali Kathi, also directed relevant district administrations to remain on high alert in case of an emergency. He instructed concerned district officers to remain in the field to oversee relief efforts.
Army mobilised for relief efforts: DG ISPR
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry provided a summary of the efforts initiated by the military in the northern areas for monsoon rains.
Speaking during a media briefing in Islamabad today, he said, “On the orders of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army and additional units were mobilised (in affected areas).”
He said that KP received eight units of Infantry and Frontier Constabulary (FC), who were directly involved in search and rescue, and flood relief operations, while GB had one, taking the total to nine units.
He also said that one engineer brigade, two engineer battalions and two urban search and rescue teams were deployed in KP, while two engineer battalions were sent to GB, where they were “working on road opening and removing landslides”.
“Three medical units were deployed in KP, while nine medical camps were deployed in GB. More than 6,304 people have been treated.”
“In search and rescue operations, 6,903 people have been rescued,” he added.
Gen Chaudhry also said that one-day rations were allocated, amounting to 585 tonnes, adding that army aviation was deployed to oversee medical casualty evacuation, emergencies, and transportation of food and medicine.
He highlighted that multiple bridges and roads were repaired, while the telecommunication infrastructure in affected areas, including Shangla and Buner, was being repaired alongside the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.
Speaking more specifically about affected regions, the DG ISPR said that the army deployed two battalions in Buner, two battalions in Shangla, one in Swat, one FC wing each in Bajaur and Dir, and one company in Swabi.
“These are dedicated resources … which were deployed 24 hours for flood relief rescue operations,” he said.
While speaking about logistics support, DG ISPR said that there were bases in Peshawar and Nowshera. “In Peshawar, there were 2,500 ready-to-eat meals and 20 tonnes of rations. In Nowshera, there are 5,000 ready-to-eat meals and 505 tonnes of rations,” he said, adding that they were being transported by road and helicopters.
He also highlighted that 90 roads were damaged in KP. Of those, nine roads were fully operational and 86 were partially restored, he added.
Mansehra, Battagram, Ghizer and Shigar were most affected in GB, he said, where two medical camps were established and distribution of rations was ongoing.
DG ISPR also commended the Pakistan Air Force for doing a “great job” in relief efforts and praised civil society groups operating from Karachi for providing relief.</p><small>2025-08-19 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191535555baf562.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931880/indias-national-sports-governance-bill-becomes-an-act-after-president-murmus-assent' target='_blank'><strong>India’s National Sports Governance Bill becomes an Act after President Murmu’s assent</strong></a><br><p>India’s National Sports Governance Bill has become an Act after President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the legislation, which promises to overhaul India’s sports administration, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on Tuesday.
The development comes days after India said it will bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games, seen as part of a wider push by the cricket-mad nation to host the 2036 Olympics.
The presidential assent came on Monday, stated a gazette notification by the central government.
The legislation has been described as a path-breaking reform by Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, PTI reports.
“The following Act of Parliament received the assent of the President on the 18th August, 2025 and is hereby published for general information — The National Sports Governance Act, 2025,” the legislation stated.
The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) on July 23 and passed on August 11. A day later, it was passed by the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament).
The bill provides for establishing a National Olympic Committee, National Paralympic Committee, and national and regional sports federations for each designated sport.
“The national bodies will have affiliation with respective international bodies.  These bodies will also have affiliate units at state and district levels,” it said.
The Bill empowers the central government to establish a National Sports Board, which will grant recognition to the national sports bodies and register their affiliate units. “Only recognised bodies will be eligible to receive funds from the central government.”
Further, the bill provides for constituting a National Sports Tribunal to adjudicate sports related disputes. However, “it will not have jurisdiction over specified disputes such as those in relation to games organised by international bodies and internal disputes of national sports bodies.”
In addition, a National Sports Election Panel will be set up to oversee NSF polls that are often mired in controversies.
The Act also gives central government the discretionary power to limit India’s international participation in “extraordinary circumstances” and where “national interest” is at stake.</p><small>2025-08-19 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1823063706ca19e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931472/flooded-forgotten-forsaken-pakistans-endless-monsoon-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Flooded, forgotten, forsaken — Pakistan’s endless monsoon crisis</strong></a><br><p>We’ve seen these headlines before. Heard anchors screech body counts as if they’re in a competition for the highest number. Hundreds of lives lost, thousands displaced, homes swept away and losses that won’t ever be compensated.
Pakistan is once again in the midst of a ruthless monsoon season, which began in late June, and on the radar is the country’s mountainous north — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Last week, unprecedented flash floods left behind a trail of wreckage in Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond. A week before that, Muzaffarabad bore the brunt of monsoon rains. Almost a month back, 37 villages across GB were declared calamity-hit.
Visuals coming out of the region are terrifying; monstrous rivers unleashing their wrath and sweeping along anything in their way, from main city bazaars to entire villages. According to a report by the National Disaster Management Authority, at least 392 people have died in KP from June 26 to August 18. The number of fatalities in GB stands at 34, while 15 people were killed in AJK during this period.
 






Each flash flood occurred in just a few hours. Each occurred at a time locals refer to as “flash flood month”. And each caused massive levels of deluge. In Pakistan, flash floods have almost become an annual recurrence, starting from June until September, according to the NDMA. This is primarily because of heavy monsoon rains and rapidly melting glaciers.
The ‘doomsday’
“We have seen floods before, but the level of destruction and the precipitancy of the disaster this time around are unprecedented; it was like a doomsday scenario,” said a Peshawar-based Dawn reporter who recently visited Buner to cover the on-ground situation. The main marketplace in the district, Pir Baba Bazaar, suffered the most damage.
“Houses were reduced to rubble, shops were filled with six- to seven-feet mud carried down by the fast-flowing water, and cars were floating,” he recounted. Acres and acres of millet crop fields were flooded.
 






The journalist said that the plains of Buner, once crowded with tiny abodes, had been completely washed away. From afar, wooden planks and concrete pieces could be seen floating in water — the remnants of a life that once was. “No one knows what happened to the residents of these houses,” he said.
Everywhere, locals had gathered to search for missing people and their bodies — a process that was significantly delayed due to the absence of excavators and other government machinery.
“They were digging through the stones, but it was all in vain … how can humans remove elephant-sized boulders?” the reporter observed. “There was also a sense of bewilderment among them … no one knew exactly what happened. Some said it was thunder rain, others said a part of the mountain had cracked open, yet others said it was a Glof event … but no one knew what exactly had caused these floods.”
Instead, all they knew was that a disaster had struck.
A similar story of destruction was also narrated to Dawn.com by Mohammad Hassan, a resident of Skardu. His village was among those hit hardest by the floods. For the past two weeks, he has been living at a distant relative’s house after the floods destroyed his home.
 






“This has happened for the first time in my life … I have seen many floods, but never did the water reach my town because we have a nullah right at the opening of our village,” he said. “Nearly 80 per cent of our crops are gone and the walls of our homes have caved.”
A confusion, similar to that among the people of Buner, persists in Skardu. While the government announced that the floods were caused by cloudbursts, Hassan said his elders blamed lightning that struck mountain peaks.
“It is common practice in our towns; as soon as the third round of lightning strikes, announcements are made from mosques to evacuate the houses. Women are in charge of taking the children and cattle to safer areas while men rush to the fields to take all protective measures,” he explained.
But this time around, even the crops could not be saved because these flash floods brought with them big stones, sand and mud. “Standing in their way means losing your life … I broke my leg this time,” Hassan added.
Controllables and uncontrollables
According to the national and provincial disaster management authorities, the flash floods that hit the north this year were induced by cloudbursts — sudden and heavy downpour of rain, typically localised and of short duration.
Cloudbursts occur due to a range of atmospheric conditions, primarily when warm and moist air or monsoon winds are forced upwards along mountain slopes, causing the air to expand, cool, and condense rapidly, leading to sudden and intense rainfall, explained WWF-Pakistan Director Haider Raza.
In simpler words, he continued, cloudbursts cause downpour that is not just heavy but also intense, and can range up to 200mm of rain.
 






Of late, Pakistan has witnessed a rise in cloudburst events, with environmentalists blaming it on climate change. Per Raza, summer temperatures have spiked in mountainous areas, reaching up to 45 to 46 degrees. This leads to more rainfall as warm air rises and causes condensation, precipitation and changes in snowmelt patterns.
“And the Himalayas, Hindukush and Karakoram mountain ranges are particularly susceptible to these weather patterns — the impact of which can be seen in towns and villages on or near these mountains,” he said.
For example, Gilgit saw one of its worst flooding events this year, with eight out of 10 villages in the region inundated with floods. Buner, which does not have any rivers flowing through, witnessed a similar situation, with the rains causing unprecedented damage this year.
“Floods are not uncommon, but their frequency and intensity have now increased … climate events that were to take place every 50-70 years are now occurring within just a decade or less,” Raza warned.
Similarly, rainfall patterns have also changed. Normally, monsoon rains in northern areas begin from mid-July and stay until mid-August. But these periods have changed now. Now winter rains extend into spring while the monsoon season continues till September.
“Normally, rainy days are distributed across the year … in some places they last for 50 days, in others they can go up to 100 days,” elaborated Dr Mohammad Rafiq, a climate finance and sustainable development expert who has worked with organisations such as UNDP and WWF.
“But now, we see more rainfall in shorter periods, which is difficult to manage.”
These factors, however, are ‘uncontrollable’ because of their unpredictability, Rafique said. You can’t really do anything about it besides prepare for the worst. But underneath these fatal climate events are also factors that are controllable and completely in human hands: deforestation and land use.
Where are the trees?
All environmentalists Dawn.com spoke to agreed that deforestation is one of the glaring reasons behind climate change-triggered calamities in the north. According to the Pakistan Forest Institute, we are a forest-poor country with only 5.2pc forest cover (4.72 million hectares) with the per capita forest area of 0.0333 hectares, considerably less than the global average of one hectare.
 

Forest cover in KP has declined from 3.78 million ha in 1992 to around 3.09 million ha in 2020–25. The annual loss peaked around 2001–2004 (40,000 ha/yr) but has slowed in recent years, around 11,000 ha/yr in 2020–25, WWF estimates. — Guidelines for Range and Pasture Management in KPK 2025

Tariq Ali Shah, a forest expert who works closely with the KP government, said the province has been losing forests at a rate of about 1.5pc annually, which is equivalent to 8,000 hectares per year — almost the size of Islamabad’s city area — between 2000 and 2023. Wildfires in 2022 alone destroyed 14,430 acres of forest and pasture in KP, much of it in the mountain districts.
A similar trend is also seen in GB, where studies show 1,707km2 of forest area was lost over 20 years, which equals a 0.38pc loss each year. Diamer is one of the districts where deforestation and loss of biodiversity are high.
“This rapid loss of trees uphill has set the stage for nature’s current anger,” Shah told Dawn.com.
Trees and forests are more important than they are given credit for, when in fact they are our frontline soldiers. Leaves are the first defence; they break the velocity of the raindrops and slow down the pace at which they fall. Trees also reduce the water runoff during heavy downpours and support the ground in its absorption of water.
However, when deforestation occurs, land is exposed to sunlight, and the influence of forests on runoff is dramatically reduced, resulting in floods both in rivers and on land. Moreover, hotter and lighter air over deforested slopes rises more rapidly when the monsoon surge arrives. The collision between the cool, moist air from the sea and superheated upslope air produces intense convective updrafts — the perfect recipe for cloudbursts.
This is exactly what happened at the Babusar Top in June, where cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc, Shah pointed out. Being a dry temperate area, it only experiences snowfall and not rain. But this year was an exception, after 40 years. Why? Because there has been a drastic reduction in grasslands on Babusar Top.
Forests also have a deeper link with the incidence of glacial lake outburst floods, as they are perpetually ensuring that the 26,000 glaciers in Pakistan stay cool. Without them, they would melt at a much faster rate, which they already are.
It is therefore extremely important that we not just let nature do its job but also do our part in managing forests well. But, as highlighted by Dr Rafiq, who has worked extensively on de- and afforestation, there are some primary issues here: while people consider forests to be a source of income, there is a dearth of sustainable forest management and incompetence.
And all of these issues are interconnected with one driving factor — money. “People who are in power corridors and even those who aren’t have long benefited from cutting forests, mostly for timber,” the expert said.
In KP, there are two types of timber mafia: one that is run by local contractors, village middlemen and transporters who use tactics such as bribing local forest guards, exploiting weak community forest rights and cutting for immediate cash. The other involves an organised mafia run by wealthier contractors with political influence who supply high-value timber to down-country markets, operate under the cover of permits and allowances, and exploit legal loopholes.
 






Dr Rafiq elaborated that the mafia usually thrives with the help of corrupt government officials who misuse the process of forest marking and allow illegally felled timber from protected areas to be laundered as legal through official permits and transit passes.

Forest marking is a practice where specific trees are selected and marked to be harvested or retained within a forest stand. The process is guided by a forest management plan, considering factors like tree health, growth potential, and habitat value. It’s a crucial step in sustainable forest management, ensuring both timber production and ecological integrity.

Shah concurred and gave an example. “In Bahrain [a town located in Swat district], 350 private woodlots — a designated area, often part of a larger property, where trees are grown primarily for the production of wood for fuel, building materials, or other forest products — were officially marked, each with an average of 1,200 cubic feet of timber, amounting to roughly 420,000 cubic feet in total.
“While on paper this marking appeared legitimate, most of the timber was in fact sourced from nearby designated reserved forests rather than the actual woodlots,” he revealed, adding that in 2024-2025 alone, 420,000 tree markings were done in the forests of Batagram, Hazara and Bahrain.
This is like cutting down an entire small forest daily.
“No one is taking the responsibility to look at trees and forests as a natural reserve,” Dr Rafiq lamented. “Nature has a way of reclaiming what was taken away from it, ways that have far-reaching consequences; to prevent this, we need to protect our forests, and we need to act now.”
Where’s the plan?
The videos and photos of destruction coming from GB, AJK, and KP are not something Pakistanis have not seen before. The visuals are starkly similar to the catastrophic floods of 2022: fast-flowing rivers gulping down multi-storey houses, hotels and roadside resorts.
This year is no different. And at the heart of the problem is unplanned construction up north. In the last decade, the region has witnessed a rampant rise in hotels and guesthouses built right on riverbanks to lure tourists. According to experts, this unchecked expansion is not just degrading fragile mountain ecosystems but also choking the waterways themselves.
“This construction around the river is a hindrance to its natural flow,” said WWF’s Raza. “During the construction, they have one aim: the views. But what they forget is that the river never forgets, and it comes back to take revenge.”
 






The warnings are not hypothetical. In 2022, nearly 30 illegally built hotels along the Swat River were swept away, and another 50 were damaged when floodwaters tore through Bahrain and Kalam. Yet, despite such destruction, the cycle has continued.
A recent provincial probe found encroachments spread over more than 1,800 kanals of riverine land in KP, with 127 illegal buildings sealed and hundreds of structures demolished to clear waterways. In Swat alone, authorities reported removing dozens of obstructions from the floodplain.
Officials and conservationists alike say the effect is the same: narrowing rivers and forcing water to swell with greater ferocity during heavy rains.
Research backs this up — studies on river morphology in northern Pakistan have shown that encroachments reduce the channel’s carrying capacity, block natural drainage paths, and increase the destructive force of floods. Instead of water spreading out safely across the floodplain, it gets funnelled through narrowed passages, eroding embankments and smashing into settlements.
Dr Rafiq, a climate expert, pointed to the power structures behind this. “A land mafia operates in these areas under the garb of development,” he said. “Pakistan lives in an illusion and is slowly sleepwalking into disaster. In KP, there is a lack of building laws, and even where they exist, enforcement remains lax. We need leaders who can think beyond elections and plan for real estate expansion without compromising the rivers.”
WWF’s Raza echoed this, adding that weak rules and regulations mean construction is not only obstructing rivers but also driving up carbon emissions, contributing to higher local temperatures and intensifying floods. He urged the government to map out the most vulnerable zones and prevent human settlement there altogether, stressing that waterways should never be encroached or closed.
The issue extends beyond KP. In Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK, too, settlements have crept dangerously close to river corridors and nullahs. Experts warn that without stronger river acts and strict zoning laws, each new flood will keep washing away the same unplanned structures — taking lives and livelihoods with them.
A never-ending cycle
Beyond the statistics and studies, it is the lived reality of locals that tells the truest story of these disasters. Nowhere is this cycle of devastation more evident than in Buner, where residents like Muhibur Rasheed are living through its worst consequences.
He described the disaster as “the biggest and worst calamity” in the history of the district. Muhib shared that more than half of the Pir Baba Bazaar — the district’s main marketplace — had been submerged, resulting in losses worth billions of rupees. Entire villages, he said, were “gulped down by the floods”, leaving devastation in their wake.
“In every household, four to five people were swept away in the flash floods,” Rasheed recounted on a phone call with Dawn.com, his voice heavy with grief. “There are some families that have been completely wiped out. In one village, a funeral for 40 members of a single family was offered collectively.”

Rasheed also lamented the lack of government support. “Officials are only visiting the area for pictures and photos, not to provide any real help to us,” he said. In the absence of external aid, locals have been forced to help themselves, but their resources are running thin.
“There is a shortage of medicines, food, and other essentials, but the roads are blocked, and there are no mobile phone signals,” he added.
The devastation in Buner has put residents of neighbouring districts, located in the south at a short distance and unscathed from the floods so far, in a perpetual state of anxiety.

Zubair Torawali, a resident of Bahrain in Swat, said that even though his area has not yet been directly hit this year, the fear is palpable. “If the floods reach us, it could mean huge losses,” he said, explaining how villagers anxiously watch the rains shift from north to south every monsoon season.
In the end, it is always the people who pay the price — losing homes, livelihoods, and loved ones — while the state fails to act on lessons learned. Year after year, the water returns. And with it, the losses.

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with
ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
According to the FO’s statement today, “On the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar … Mr Wang Yi is visiting Islamabad for co-chairing the sixth Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on August 21, 2025.”
“The visit is part of the regular high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China to further deepen their ‘All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’, reaffirm support on the issues of respective core interests, enhance economic and trade cooperation, and reaffirm their joint commitment to regional peace, development and stability,” the statement added.
 






The development comes during Wang’s ongoing visit to India. During talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday, Wang said that China and India should “view each other as partners and opportunities, rather than adversaries or threats”.
He pointed to the resumption of “dialogue at all levels” and “maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas” as evidence that bilateral ties were on a “positive trend of returning to the main path of cooperation”.
Last month, Dar met with Wang on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation event, where the pair discussed and reaffirmed mutual support in core sectors, including agriculture, mining, industry and security.
“China is ready to work with Pakistan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push forward the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future,” Wang had said.
In February, President Asif Ali Zardari held a bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, with the two sides vowing to strengthen the Pakistan-China strategic cooperative partnership.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1913084458ae1df.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931872/indian-police-exhume-human-remains-in-mass-burial-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Indian police exhume human remains in mass-burial investigation</strong></a><br><p>Indian police have exhumed human remains in a temple town in Karnataka, officials said, as part of an investigation into allegations that hundreds of murder and rape victims were secretly buried there from around the mid-1990s.
The probe centres on Dharmasthala, home to an 800-year-old temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in the state of Karnataka and is drawing headlines in media nationwide.
A former cleaner at the temple told police last month that he had been forced by superiors to dispose of hundreds of bodies over two decades, many of them women and girls showing signs of sexual assault.
His allegations were made in a police complaint dated July 4 and seen by Reuters.
The man, whose identity authorities have withheld for safety reasons, fled Dharmasthala in 2014 but said he was compelled to speak out now because of lingering guilt.
“If the skeletons now exhumed receive respectful funeral rites, those tormented souls will find peace and my sense of guilt could also decrease,” he wrote in the complaint.
The police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the temple said it welcomed a thorough investigation and hoped police would “bring out true facts to light”.
In the complaint, the former cleaner accused temple officials of forcing him to dispose of the bodies and told police he would name the officials if they protected him and his family. Karnataka’s interior minister told the state assembly on Monday that the protection was now in place.
The former cleaner said he had secretly exhumed a skeleton from one of the burial sites to prove his claims.
A special investigation team formed by the Karnataka government has so far recovered human remains from two of 16 suspected burial sites, according to two senior police officials familiar with the probe. They declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Karnatakas interior minister, Gangadharaiah Parameshwara, said the police have collected bone fragments, soil samples, and other material for testing from two sites thanks to the information from the former cleaner.
“The analysis is ongoing. Only once that is complete can we say the investigation has truly begun,” Parameshwara said.
“My request is to not make this a religious matter.” Sachin Deshpande, a lawyer for the complainant, told Reuters “they have found human remains where our client pointed and we are sure that the truth will come out”.
He declined to make his client available for an interview.
The revelations have revived interest in older unsolved cases, including Padmalatha, a college student whose family alleged she was raped and murdered in Dharmasthala in 1986. Padmalatha, like many in India, went by one name.
Her sister, Indravathi, said the family buried Padmalathas body rather than cremating it according to Hindu custom, hoping that would help with any investigations later.
“We hope that we will get justice one day for her abduction, rape and murder,” said Indravathi, who uses only one name.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19105531fc4aa98.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931860/52-magnitude-quake-jolts-islamabad-rawalpindi-and-parts-of-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.2-magnitude quake jolts Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and parts of KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 5.2-magnitude earthquake on Tuesday jolted Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Seismic Network of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said in a statement.
According to the statement, the quake was felt in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, KP’s Peshawar, Swat, Chitral, and Abbottabad.
The PMD’s press release said that the earthquake originated at 10:20am PKT. Its epicentre was the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 190 kilometres.
 






Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority reported that the earthquake was also felt in the province’s divisions of Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lahore, Multan, Sahiwal and Sargodha.
No casualties have been reported so far, and according to KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi, an emergency has not yet been declared.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
The Hindu Kush region is recognised as one of the most active seismic zones in the world, lying at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates where their ongoing collision generates frequent earthquakes, including rare deep-focus events that can reach depths of over 200km, according to the US Geological Survey.
This seismicity is attributed to subduction-related processes and slab break-off beneath the Hindu Kush–Pamir region, making it part of the broader Himalayan seismic belt that has produced several destructive earthquakes across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.
A 5.1 magnitude earthquake shook Islamabad, Rawalpindi and surrounding regions earlier in the month, swaying buildings and causing panic, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1914031673b22d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931867/babar-rizwan-demoted-as-pcb-announces-central-contracts-for-2025-26-no-players-in-category-a' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Rizwan demoted as PCB announces central contracts for 2025-26; no players in Category A</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday announced central contracts for 30 male cricketers for the upcoming 2025–26 international season, with no players placed in the top-tier Category A.
Last month, the number of male and female players in the central contract lists rose, according to PCB’s 2025-26 budget documents.
According to a press release by PCB today, the contracts, effective from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, “reflect the board’s continued commitment to recognising and supporting national talent.”
This year’s roster sees ten players each placed in Categories B, C, and D, with the PCB acknowledging that “no player has been selected for Category A in this cycle.”
 






Pertinent to mention is that Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan were the only two players in Category A for the 2024-25 season.
The duo have seen their stock fall over the past year; the former batting mainstays having been sidelined from the T20 squad.
“Compared to last year’s list of 27 contracted players, the PCB has expanded the pool to 30, including 12 fresh additions, highlighting the emergence of promising new talent and the board’s strategic focus on squad depth and future development,” PCB said.
 
 

The new entrants are: Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Mirza and Sufyan Moqim.
Five players have been promoted owing to their last year’s performances, PCB said. They are: Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha and Shadab Khan — all promoted from C to B category.
Additionally, nine players have retained their positions in the same categories. They are: Abdullah Shafique (Category C), Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jnr — all in Category D, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Saud Shakeel — all in Category C and Shaheen Shah Afridi (Category B).
PCB noted that eight players have missed out on contracts this year, namely Aamir Jamal, Haseebullah, Kamran Ghulam, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Huraira, Muhammad Irfan Khan and Usman Khan — all in Category (D).
List of this year’s centrally contacted players:
Category B (10 players): Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi
Category C (10 players): Abdullah Shafique, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Sahibzada Farhan, Sajid Khan and Saud Shakeel
Category D (10 players): Ahmed Daniyal, Hussain Talat, Khurram Shahzad, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Salman Mirza, Shan Masood and Sufyan Moqim</p><small>2025-08-19 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1911560560e32e6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931730/terrorist-network-planning-major-attacks-busted-in-kohat' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist network planning major attacks busted in Kohat</strong></a><br><p>KOHAT: Counter Terrorism Department and a federal intelligence agency busted a terrorist network, which was actively planning to carry out a series of high profile major terrorist activities in the district including the bombing of a mosque inside police lines and a Muharram procession, Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed Marwat told a news conference here.
“They were planning to carry out major terrorist attacks,” said Mr Marwat, flanked by senior CTD and police officers.
He said that the arrest of Siraj and Faridoon, both brothers, serving as constables in CTD and police, had facilitated the network of a terrorist organisation and their handlers operating from Afghanistan.
A senior CTD official told Dawn on background basis that initial investigation and interrogation of the accused had led them to unravel a plot to bomb the mosque inside the district police lines that would have caused massive casualties, a re-enactment of a similar bombing in Peshawar which had led to the death of more than a hundred policemen.

RPO says two constables were facilitating terrorists affiliated with banned Hafiz Gulbahadar Group

He said that the arrest of the accused was made possible due to meticulous work spanning over more than four months, piecing together evidence collected from the ground, watching hours of the CCTV footage, surveillance and collection of electronic data.
“Kohat region was relatively quiet but the killing of a DSP and subsequently the killing of two more policemen caught our attention,” he said.
What came as a big surprise was that while the network had affiliation with Hafiz Gulbahadar Group, an organisation that had confined itself to its native North Waziristan but had lately expanded its operation to Khyber and other districts as well, it also had taken oath of allegiance to IS-KP. “We have evidence that there is overlapping and crossovers of militants,” the official said.
He said that militants used encrypted messaging Apps and used aliases instead of their own names to avoid detection. The mobile data, he said, also revealed the amount of money transferred to them using money transfer Apps commonly used in normal transactions in the country.
“The interrogation that we have had reveals just the tip of the iceberg. The mobile data extraction has helped us a lot in exposing the entire network,” said the official.
He said that the accused had made an elaborate video of the police lines and the mosque and possible point of entrance of suicide bomber.
The group had also planned to bomb the district complex of CTD as well as a Muharram procession.
The group had shared its target with its handlers in Afghanistan which had given it to go-ahead after receiving proof of its ability to carry out such attacks. “We have a pretty good picture of their network,” the official said, adding that efforts were on to capture other members of the group.
The involvement of policemen as facilitators led investigators to wonder if militant groups were seeking to infiltrate law enforcement agencies. This was reminiscent of almost a similar case, where a police constable in Peshawar had helped a suicide bomber infiltrate police lines to bomb a mosque.
The constable, Mohammad Wali, was subsequently arrested, who confessed to his involvement besides admitting to killing a Christian priest to prove his usefulness to his handlers in Afghanistan. The case of Mohammad Wali is still pending before the court.
“This is the irony of our system. What we need is a whole of the system response,” a legal expert said. He said that many accused were granted bail, barely days after physical remand and they were back fighting the state and law enforcement agencies.
“This is what happens when you do not interpret the law as it is. The Anti-Terrorist Act is pretty much clear when it comes to granting physical remand of a suspect. Courts, however, in their own wisdom rely on Criminal Procedure Code. This has complicated the matter beyond words,” he said.

The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
India is also part of the Quad security alliance with the United States, Australia and Japan, which is seen as a counter to China.
But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war, the countries have moved to mend ties.
During talks on Monday with Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, Wang said the two countries should “view each other as partners and opportunities, rather than adversaries or threats”.
He pointed to the resumption of “dialogue at all levels” and “maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas” as evidence that bilateral ties were on a “positive trend of returning to the main path of cooperation”.
Wang is also expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his three-day visit.
According to Indian media, Modi might visit China this month, which would be his first trip since 2018.
Relations have improved since October, when Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years in Russia.
Chinese and Indian officials have said in recent weeks that the two countries were discussing the resumption of border trade, which has been halted since 2020.
Its resumption would be symbolically significant, and follows discussions to resume direct flights and issue tourist visas.</p><small>2025-08-19 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191028231004d44.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931786/banks-set-to-gain-from-stability-says-fitch' target='_blank'><strong>Banks set to gain from stability, says Fitch</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Fitch Ratings on Monday projected improved prospects for Pakistan’s banking sector, citing stabilising macroeconomic indicators, falling inflation, and a return to economic growth. The global credit agency expects Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 3.5pc in FY27, with inflation averaging 5pc — a significant shift from the turmoil and high inflation of recent years.
In a brief commentary, Fitch said banks are well-positioned to capitalise on improving operating conditions as macroeconomic headwinds ease. It noted that stronger business volumes, driven by economic recovery and better credit demand, would support banking performance in the near term.
The outlook follows Pakistan’s upgraded sovereign credit profile, with Fitch raising its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘B-’/Stable from ‘CCC+’ in April 2025. The upgrade reflects ongoing reforms, fiscal improvement, and greater economic resilience.
The agency pointed out that consumer price inflation, which had peaked at 38pc in May 2023, eased to 4.1pc in July 2025, aided by a halving of the policy rate since May 2024 to 11pc. Coupled with a more stable external position — marked by reduced currency volatility and current account surpluses — this has laid the groundwork for a sustained recovery.

Forecasts 3.5pc GDP growth for next fiscal year, stable inflation

Fitch projected that lower interest rates and improved macro fundamentals would spur private-sector credit demand and steady growth in loans and deposits. This is expected to reduce the banking sector’s reliance on public-sector lending, with private-sector credit currently at a cyclical low of 9.7pc of GDP (2024). Reforms will be critical to deepening credit penetration and enabling greater commercial lending activity.
However, the agency cautioned that despite impro­vements, Pakistan’s operating environment remains weak. Banks’ creditworthiness will continue to be closely tied to the sovereign, due to their large holdings of government securities and exposure to state-linked entities.
The report noted that Pakistani banks have remai­ned financially resilient. The sector’s impaired loan ratio improved to 7.1pc by March 2025, down from 7.6pc at end-2023, supported by strong loan growth of 26pc. Fitch expects this pace to moderate, but asset quality should remain stable, helped by improved repayment capacity amid lower interest rates.
Return on average equity fell to 20pc in Q1 2025 from 27pc in 2023, reflecting tighter net interest margins and higher operating costs due to inflation. These pressures were partially offset by stronger non-interest income. Fitch expects further margin pressure, but overall earnings should remain supported by loan expansion and treasury operations.
The system’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) rose to a decade-high of 21pc by March 2025, reflecting strong internal capital generation. While the CAR may ease slightly if higher-risk private-sector lending expands, it is expected to stay well above the 11.5pc regulatory minimum.

People, including foreign tourists, make a hazardous crossing after a flood swept away the bridge in Ghanche.—Dawn

MUZAFFARABAD/GILGIT: At least five pe­ople were killed in Azad Jammu and Kash­mir on Monday in different rain-related incidents as monsoon-induced floods ravaged multiple areas in the Ghizer district of Gilgit-Bal­tis­­tan, blocking roads and destroying infrastructure.
In Neelum Valley, a vehicle with tourists on board skidded off the “slippery road” and plummeted almost 250 feet down the ravine. Three people were killed on the spot, while the fourth succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital.
Neelum Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua said a Karachi-based couple along with their two-year-old daughter — who survived the accident — and a helper were coming back from Taobutt when they met the accident near Shundaas.
As a result, Zeeshan Shahid, 38, his wife Anmol Haroon, 32, driver Farooq, 35, and helper Atif died. The couple had travelled to Kel in their car but had rented the jeep for their trip to Taobutt. District Disaster Management Officer Akhtar Ayoub told Dawn that the couple’s funerals had been held and their bodies as well as the child and the car were being sent to Islamabad to be handed over to the family members, arriving there from Karachi.
University teacher swept away
In another incident, a faculty member at the University of Poonch, Dr Gul-i-Lala, 32, was swept away after she tried to cross a swollen stream in her Suzuki Cultus.
According to Registrar Dr Abdul Rauf, Dr Lala had left the Shamsabad campus after delivering a one-hour lecture in the morning and was heading home via Hajira Road.
Eyewitnesses said she was advised to turn back because a torrent was flowing across the road, whereupon she opted for an alternative route on the outskirts of Rawalakot. However, while attempting to cross a culvert where water from an otherwise small stream was rushing over the road, the accident occurred.
Her vehicle, swept away by the water, was retrieved about a hundred feet down the stream, but she did not survive.
Meanwhile, Poonch DC Sardar Umar Farooq told Dawn that rescue teams also evacuated 18 female students from a hostel whose ground floor had been submerged. Five residents trapped in their homes along Hajira Road were also rescued.
In the same district, three men collecting firewood in Karmal village of Rajdhani were stranded on a dry patch in the middle of River Poonch. However, they were rescued.
A flash flood in a water channel in Dhaman Pakhonar village of Sudhnoti district washed away four houses, two suspension bridges, and one RCC bridge, said Deputy Com­­missioner Mumtaz Kazmi. There were no casualties as the residents had already vacated their homes, but they were unable to save their belongings, he added. The DC said the road le­­ading to the village had also been destroyed at several points, but machinery would be deployed to reopen it.
Flash floods in GB
As water shortages and electricity outages continued in Gilgit, Danyor, and other flood-hit areas, flash floods damaged infrastructure in Asumber, Hatoon, and Ishkoman valleys in Ghizer. According to the local administration, the Government Boys High School in Asumber was affected, while in Hatoon, the flood blocked the Ghizer River near the Hasis village. The flood damaged the Ishkoman Road at various places, while a house was affected in Dilnati Ponyal.
On the other hand, the increasing water level in the Ghizer River forced the residents living near its banks to move to safer areas.
The Ghizer-Chitral Road remained closed due to the flood in the Gulapur area. The residents and affected people in Daen village remained disconnected as the only bridge linking the area to the rest of the region was recently damaged. Similarly, the flood-affec­ted areas in Ghizer, Ghanche, Skardu, Astore, Hunza and Diamer remained marooned.
The Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Gulmit-Gojal in Hunza was opened to traffic, as was the Hoper Valley road in Nagar. The traffic on the Baltistan Highway and Naltar Highway remained suspended, but people managed to cross the blocked roads in cases of emergency.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Ghizer was the most-affected district as the mountainous region faced one of the worst floods that had killed 39 people, including tourists, since July. These disasters have caused damage to the tune of Rs30 billion, he added.
“At least two dozen people have been injured so far; 35 small and large bridges have been washed away; a dozen mosques and ‘Jamaat Khanas’ have been damaged, and more than half a dozen buildings of educational institutions have been damaged,” he said. About 350 houses were completely destroyed and at least 600 houses had sustained partial damage, he added.

• Sets strict timelines for resolution of different categories of land and family disputes
• Forms a commission to address delayed orders in commercial, revenue, and fiscal cases
• Urges a mechanism to produce detainees in disappearance cases within 24 hours
ISLAMABAD: The National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC) on Monday specified strict and swift timelines for disposing of different categories of court cases across the country, especially land disputes, family matters and juvenile punishment cases.
The committee in its 54th meeting, chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, categorised cases and approved certain timeframe for the disposal of each. “These timelines would be considered as one of the key performance indicators in judges’ performance evaluation and would be in-built at the Dashboard,” the committee said.
To decide declaratory suit (land disputes), a 24-month deadline has been fixed. Similarly, declaratory suit (inheritance disputes) and recovery suit (public revenue/money matters) will have to be decided in 12 months. For cases of specific performance (contract enforcement), an 18-month deadline has been set. A timeframe of six months has been fixed for injunction suit (land disputes), rent cases, family suit (dissolution/dower/maintenance/guardianship) and execution petitions of family court decree; while for succession cases (uncontested) a deadline of two months has been set.
Other cases along with their respective timeframe include: execution petitions on banking court decree, execution petitions on civil court decree and criminal trial (punishment up to seven years) in 12 months; execution petitions on rent matters in three months; criminal trial (juvenile offenders) and labour cases in six months; criminal trial (punishment above seven years) in 18 months; and criminal trial (murder) in 24 months.
The committee deliberated on key policy issues, reviewed implementation of decisions from its 53rd meeting, and unanimously reiterated its resolve to strengthen institutional capacity, accelerate access to justice and ensure efficient and effective justice delivery.
Committee constituted
On strengthening the commercial litigation framework (CLC), the committee appreciated substantial progress by the high courts, acknowledging the CLC initiative as a major step towards a robust and efficient commercial litigation framework.
To address protracted litigation and injunctive orders in commercial, revenue and fiscal cases, a committee under Justice Shafi Siddiqui was constituted to formulate recommendations. The committee will examine AGP’s suggestions regarding issues arising out of Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and place recommendations in the next meeting.
Also in the meeting, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan assured the committee that a comprehensive mechanism on enforced disappearances for ensuring production of detained persons before the magistrate concerned within 24 hours would be presented at the next sitting.
Judicial independence
The NJPMC commended high courts for formulating SOPs and emphasised adding stage-wise timelines from complaint filing to final action. It decided that all instances of extraneous influence should be reported within 24 hours and action finalised within 14 days.
SOPs should provide immediate redress measures to safeguard the dignity of the complainant judge. A reporting mechanism to the CJP was desired for information and intervention where necessary. High courts will notify SOPs and share them with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP).
On model criminal trial courts, the committee expressed appreciation for progress by SHC and PHC, noting the efforts would enhance access to justice and timely delivery.
Regarding institutionalisation of court-annexed mediation, the committee acknowledged progress by the high courts and underscored the importance of pre-trial mediation.
The AGP assured updates on legislative intervention at federal and provincial levels about mandatory pre-trial mediation in the next meeting.
Other reforms
Agenda items concerning performance evaluation, standardised recruitment, establishment of a District Judiciary Policy Forum (DJPF), parity in terms and conditions of service and access to international exposure opportunities were taken jointly.
The NJPMC unanimously decided to include the LHC chief justice in the committee formulating recommendations on these matters, to be finalised before the next meeting.
The committee expressed satisfaction with progress on the professional excellence index, recognising it as a vital instrument for promoting professional standards and strengthening justice system effectiveness.
It desired high courts to establish accessible, user-friendly public forums at both high court and district court levels for information provision and complaint redressal.
On model civil courts, while appreciating the LHC’s efforts, the forum decided high courts may pilot the initiative for the oldest civil cases in chronological order.
High courts may determine the number of model civil courts in each district, keeping in view the target caseload. District and sessions judges may assign such cases to model civil courts under a time-bound trial regime.
On jail reforms and a national prison policy, the committee resolved to share reports of provincial sub-committees and the prison reform action plan with high courts for input. A national prison policy will be formulated and placed before the next meeting.
The forum was further sensitised to key issues to foster awareness and coordinated efforts, including suspension of sentence pending appeal under Section 426 of CrPC and repatriation of judicial officers of special courts and tribunals.
The LHC CJ assured that biometric verification at the time of institution of cases would be implemented, with progress to be placed before the committee in the next meeting.
The next meeting has been set for Oct 17.
LJCP and AJDF meeting
Separately, the CJP also chaired the 45th meeting of the LJCP, reaffirming its commitment to an accessible and equitable justice system for all citizens and emphasising unwavering dedication to judicial excellence and a fair and just society in Pakistan.
The commission reviewed implementation of decisions from its 44th meeting, particularly progress by the advisory committee for law reforms comprising the law secretary and eminent lawyers. It acknowledged the need for reforms in family laws and the CrPC, 1898, and applauded the committee’s work, expressing hope that, in consultation with stakeholders, it will suggest viable recommendations to improve service delivery in family dispute and criminal matters.
The commission approved the annual accounts of the Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF) for FY 2024-25.
For institutional development and to enhance LJCP performance, it constituted a committee to review LJCP Employees Service Rules of 1992 and suggest reforms to enhance administrative efficiency and enable performance management.
Meanwhile, the AJDF governing body thanked the federal government for a grant of Rs2billion.
The contribution will be utilised for advancing women-centric facilities in courts, solarisation of judicial complexes, provision of clean drinking water and establishment of e-libraries in courts across the country, with a special focus on underdeveloped and remote districts.
The forum verified annual accounts of the fund for 2024-25 and approved significant projects and allocations aimed at strengthening the justice sector by focusing on litigant facilities.
The governing body approved projects of the High Court of Sindh and High Court of Balochistan amounting to over Rs631million, emphasising women-centric facilities within court premises to provide a safe, accessible and inclusive environment for female litigants.
Approval was also granted for projects of the Sindh, Lahore, Balochistan and Peshawar high courts under the Underdeveloped Regions Window amounting to Rs317m, including solarisation of courts to ensure uninterrupted power and the establishment of modern e-libraries in remote and underdeveloped districts.
The governing body sanctioned various training programs for the federal and provincial judicial academies.

The Spanish second seed snapped the world number one’s 26-match winning streak on hardcourts when his ailing rival signalled he could no longer continue while trailing 5-0 in the first set of the final.
“This is not the way that I want to win trophies, I just have to say sorry, I can understand how you must feel now,” Alcaraz told Sinner during the presentation ceremony after capturing his third Masters 1000 crown of the season following his success in Monte Carlo and Rome.
“As I said many times, you are a true champion and I am sure from these situations, you are going to come back even stronger, as you always do. That’s what true champions do.”

Sinner had been bidding to become the first man since Roger Federer in 2015 to win back-to-back Cincinnati titles but he looked uncomfortable early on in the sweltering conditions.
He called it quits after 23 minutes of play.
“I’m super, super sorry to disappoint you,” Sinner told the crowd. “Yesterday I didn’t feel great. I thought that I would improve during the night, but it came up worse.

“I tried to come out, tried to make it at least a small match, but I couldn’t handle more, so I’m very sorry.”

It was also unclear whether the Italian would be fit enough to partner Katerina Siniakova in the revamped mixed doubles event at Flushing Meadows which is due to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Singles action at the hardcourt major begins on Sunday.
Monday’s clash had been expected to be a dress-rehearsal ahead of a potential final showdown between the world’s two best players in New York, with the duo having faced off in the title match at the last two majors.
Alcaraz came from two sets down and saved three championship points to triumph at Roland Garros, while Sinner emerged victorious at Wimbledon.
Monday’s result extended Alcaraz’s head-to-head record over Sinner to 95, including a 62 edge on hardcourts.
Swiatek downs Paolini to claim first Cincinnati Open title
Later in the evening, Iga Swiatek captured her first Cincinnati Open title by beating Jasmine Paolini 7-5 6-4, with the Pole third seed sending a powerful message ahead of the US Open.
The six-times Grand Slam winner did not drop a set on her way to the title and was clinical in the final, converting all six of her break points to clinch her 11th WTA 1000 crown and first since last year’s Italian Open.
She is now the second all-time winner in the WTA 1000 format history, trailing only Serena Williams (23).
“I want to thank my team. I dont know why I won tournaments that were like the last ones in terms of where I thought I would be playing well,” Swiatek said.
“Thank you for forcing me to become a better player and learning how to play on these faster surfaces. I’m shocked and super happy.”

Paolini made the brighter start, surging to a 3-0 lead and pushing Swiatek to the brink of a double break. Yet the Pole responded with a five-game run and, after squandering her first chance to serve out the opening set, closed it on her second attempt.
Swiatek carried her momentum into the second set, saving two break points at 4-3 before holding firm to move within one game of the title. She sealed victory at the first opportunity with a big serve, extending her perfect record against the Italian to 60.
The win ensures Wimbledon champion Swiatek will climb back to world number two, securing the second seed for the final major of the year at Flushing Meadows, where singles action begins on Sunday.
Swiatek is also set to team up with Norway’s Casper Ruud in the new US Open mixed doubles event.</p><small>2025-08-19 04:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a3c17aa2cdc.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931808/berlin-urges-pakistan-to-take-back-over-200-afghans' target='_blank'><strong>Berlin urges Pakistan to take back over 200 Afghans</strong></a><br><p>BERLIN: German foreign ministry spokesman Josef Hinterseher has said more than 200 Afg­hans waiting to be offered sanctuary in Germany had been deported by Pakis­t­­an to their Taliban-run home country in re­cent days and the German government was urging Isla­m­­abad to allow them back.
The deportees are part of a group previously offered refuge in Germany but now caught between Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s tougher immigration policy and a wave of expulsions from Pakistan.
Hinterseher told reporters that Pakistani police re­­cently arrested “around 450” Afghans who were pre­viously accepted under the German scheme for peo­ple at risk from the Taliban. Of those, “211 peo­ple, according to our current information, have been deported to Afgha­nistan,” he added.
Another “245 people were allowed to leave camps” in Pakistan where they had been gathered prior to their scheduled deportation, he said.
“We are continuing to talk to Pakistan to facilitate the return of those who have already been deported.”
 
 

Last week, two German rights groups launched legal proceedings against two German ministers, accusing them of “abandonment and failure to render assistance” to those hoping for German visas under the scheme.
Germany set up the programme under former chancellor Olaf Scholz in the wake of the Taliban’s 2021 takeover, to help Afghans who had worked with German institutions and their families.
It also included people deemed particularly threatened by the Taliban, including journalists and human rights activists.
However, the program­­me has been put on hold as part of a stricter immigration policy brought in un­­der Merz, who took office in May, leaving some 2,000 Afghans stranded in Pakistan waiting for German visas.
A German interior ministry spokesman said that an individual review, potentially followed by security screening, was underway for each person in the admission programme.

• PTI’s counsel rejects AGP’s view, says parliament is sovereign and not subordinate to courts
• Senators alarmed by rising cases of gender-based violence in 2024; conviction rates below 1pc
ISLAMABAD: Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan on Monday called for keeping the doors open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
Making a rare appearance before the Senate, some three weeks after being summoned for an explanation on the alleged interference of the judiciary in internal parliamentary processes, the AGP referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of any proceedings in parliament cannot be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure.
However, he insisted that the bar was not absolute. “There is a lot of sanctity attached to it, but it is not absolute,” he remarked.
He also referred to April 4, 2022, judgement of the Supreme Court, which declared unconstitutional the ruling of the then-deputy speaker on the no-confidence motion against the then-prime minister Imran Khan.
He said the PPP had filed the petition, and he himself and Barrister Ali Zafar appeared before the court as counsel.
 
 

“Now in those circumstances it becomes very important to leave that door open, because sometimes matters could bring everything not just to a standstill but also produce consequences which may not have any resolution within the House. In this particular case, when the ruling came out, the assembly was dissolved. Where would the members have gone? Obviously, they had to go to the court, and the court did interfere,” Mr Awan said.
The Attorney General while talking about stay orders against proceedings of parliamentary committees, said a solution could be worked out. He further said that certain amendments in rules of procedure and conduct of business might be required.
The Attorney General’s remarks followed his meeting with former Senate deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwala who had raised the issue of judicial interference in the House last month. Mr Mandviwala told the House that he briefed the AGP on how the high courts were interfering in the proceedings of the House, issuing stay orders against proceedings of standing committees even before a decision has been taken.
‘No room for granting a stay’
PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar also noted that standing committees were extensions of the parliament and that under the Constitution there was no room for granting a stay against their proceedings.
He noted that there should not be an institutional clash and that a solution should be found.
Mr Zafar, however, said that the Attorney General had wrongly interpreted the Constitution. He said courts can intervene where something is not being done in accordance with clear constitutional provisions. He added that the internal proceedings of the House and the committees cannot be touched. “We are sovereign and not subordinate to the courts,” he remarked.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar fully endorsed the remarks by the PTI leader. He noted that the principles of the trichotomy of powers must be followed by all. He added that how the country is to be run is ultimately for parliament to decide.
Gender-based violence
Senators from both sides of the aisle also expressed alarm over increasing violence against women and low conviction rate. They were speaking on a motion seeking the House to discuss the alarming increase in cases of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in the country and failure of administrative and judicial machinery to administer justice to women.
PPP Vice-President Sherry Rehman, who moved the motion, cited the latest report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation. She said that in 2024 alone, a staggering 32,617 cases were reported across Pakistan. These included 5,339 incidents of rape, 24,439 cases of kidnapping and abduction, 2,238 cases of domestic violence, and 547 so-called honour killings.
She pointed out that despite the shocking scale of violence, justice remains elusive: the conviction rate for honour killings is less than 0.5 per cent, rape less than 0.5pc, kidnapping/abduction 0.1pc, and domestic violence 1.3pc (SSDO, 2024).

Senators Maulana Abdul Wa­­say of JUI-F and Manzoor Kakar of BAP from Balochistan alleged the bill would deprive citizens of a livelihood as authorities plan crackdown on small petroleum related businesses with closures and heavy fines, open floodgates of corruption, thus further alienating the people of Balochistan while large tankers would keep flowing smuggled products across mainland.
PML-N Senator Sadia Abbasi also initially appeared unimpressed by the proposed bill and suggested a meeting with FBR and Customs authorities for the senators from Balochistan. She said there was no point in passing the bill while senators from Balochistan opposed it and recalled that a bill about federally administered tribal areas (Fata) was also passed in the past under US pressure. She said now everybody was saying it was pas­sed reluctantly under US pressure. She cautioned against rushing the legislation, urging wider consultation with the petroleum industry and provincial stakeholders. “This bill directly affe­cts common people in Baloch­is­tan. We must not pass it in haste,” she said.

Senators from Balochistan resist bill over ‘livelihood concerns’

Maulana Wasay said it was an open secret how large tankers of 65,000 litre petroleum products travelled from border to Punjab and who were their beneficiaries. He described the bill as economic devastation for poor families in Balochistan, where, he said, 5,000 to 6,000 small vehicles transporting fuel had already been impounded. “These vehicles are the livelihood of poor people. If this bill passes, what will they do?” he asked, warning that harsher enforcement would fuel resentment in an already volatile province.
Senator Kakar said the vehicles used in transportation of Iranian oil products were issued ‘tokens of movement’ and questioned secretary petroleum if he had the data about such tokens who expressed his ignorance. Mr Kakar said products coming from the border passed through 100 security posts and their carriers paid fixed amounts at every post. 
Power to seal filling stations
The petroleum division briefed the committee that the bill introduced six new clauses aimed at curbing rampant smuggling of petroleum products and empowered authorities to seal filling stations selling smuggled fuel, seize related equipment, and take action against vehicles involved in the trade and impose fines. 
The petroleum secretary requested the senators to pass the bill promising to address their concerns through the enabling rules. He said bill granted deputy commissioners magisterial powers to handle confiscated goods and penalise violators. He said the crackdown would primarily target large oil tankers carrying over 40,000 litres of smuggled fuel.
He said smuggling of petroleum products worth billions of rupees was draining the economy and undermining government revenues, especially after the increase in petroleum levy (about Rs81 per litre at present), which had increased the incentive for smuggling. “The real beneficiaries are not small vehicle owners but powerful smuggling networks.
He assured the senators that licenced vehicles would not be targeted and pledged to incorporate the committee’s recommendations within three days.
