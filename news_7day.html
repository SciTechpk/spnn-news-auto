<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6999097fa15a0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974737/absorbing-population-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Absorbing population growth</strong></a><br><p>FINALLY, the debate about whether rapid population growth is beneficial or pernicious for the economy appears to be settled. While the evidence was extensive and categorical, it has taken several decades for the numbers to be absorbed by our leading economists. In the meantime, we have potentially lost billions of dollars in GDP, experienced the tragedy of several thousand maternal and child deaths, and seen a decline in per capita income as the cost of not pursuing sound population policies and actions to bring down our rapid population growth rate. While all our neighbours, most prominently Bangladesh, took clear and purposeful steps, we have complacently accepted high and even rising population growth rates since 2000.
The consensus created at DawnMedia’s Paki­stan Population Summit last December confirmed several truths. First and foremost is that economic growth and prosperity for Pakistan are impossible under current demographic trends. High fertility and population growth rates are eating into an already low economic growth, resulting in greater poverty and income inequalities. There is categorical evidence that larger households with more dependents save less, spend less on education and eat lower-quality food.
Second, the expectation of a demographic dividend due to the surge in the working population is an elusive dream. In fact, this dream has been shattered by growing unemployment figures and a rising gap in the ability to generate employment to keep up with the millions of youth entering the labour force each year. The finance minister has publicly admitted that it is next to impossible, as not enough jobs are being generated to keep pace with the forecasted surge in the working-age population.
Third, it was proclaimed that urbanisation would be the engine of growth and generate employment. However, it has been pointed out by Pakistan@2050 that structural changes are required to produce more jobs. Rapid urbanisation is being led by a push out of agriculture in rural areas to escape poverty, and not as a pull factor in search of better jobs. In fact, additional jobs in new sectors only provide minimal employment.
The summit brought together a wide spectrum of participants and speakers, generating some optimism that we have turned the corner on population issues. Foremost, a media house took the initiative of organising a summit on population. Another prominent media house has just launched the Waqfa campaign to raise awareness and change behaviour. Much of this positivity is the outcome of the Council of Islamic Ideology and Population Council consultation on the concept of tawazun (balance) and birth spacing last year. This declaration has been endorsed by 37 prominent ulema supporting family planning and birth spacing for improved outcomes for mothers, children and families.

Expectations of a demographic dividend due to the surge in working numbers are misplaced.

Another hopeful sign is the unusual cross-party support for the national issue of tackling high population growth rates. The Parliamentary Forum for Population has had successful meetings over five years, discussing resource-sharing around population. Forum members passed a unanimous resolution in parliament last August.
If a consensus has emerged, why is there very little action at the national or provincial level that reflects a commitment to lowering population growth on an urgent and priority basis? This is not to undermine efforts and statements issued periodically by the provincial and federal leadership.
The need to act is immediate. There is no time for piecemeal efforts or waiting for the provinces to reach the same level of capacity and concern regarding this daunting challenge. The federal government should take the first step and become the dominant partner. It must demonstrate intent, moving beyond statements: theirs should be a policy setting and coordination role with the provinces and regions. Larger provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, can generate their initiatives, but less-resourced provinces and regions definitely require supplemental funds from the centre.
The finance minister has been most consistent and prominent in publicly expressing that population growth is not just an impediment but an existential crisis for Pakistan. Creating the financing and resources to balance population concerns, especially in the most challenging, poorest, remotest and vulnerable parts of the country, must be his ministry’s priority. Direct financing for districts that are most vulnerable and lack the basics, preventing millions of households from accessing education, health and family planning, has to become as much of a priority as other financing reforms.

 

The Benazir Income Support Programme is renowned as one of the largest social protection programmes in the world. It is centred on women. Unwanted pregnancies affect the poorest women most directly, as do unwanted and mistimed births, which are not within their control. A cash transfer programme must be launched that enables poorer households to access family planning services. This programme would follow the same rationale as providing income support to women living in the poorest households through BISP.
The poorest women, when able to fulfil their unmet needs, will provide for improved health outcomes for families and create an economically powerful impetus for improving household welfare. It will present a programme that enables millions to benefit from improving other outcomes — such as their own health, household savings and children’s investments — and trigger a new turnaround dynamic.
In addition, the federal government must activate and announce the CCI mandated population fund. This population fund should be well-resourced and function under the finance ministry; it would be used to award grants to provinces and regions for additional family planning services. Grants can be directly linked with performance in improving health and related outcomes.
Finally, there is a growing consensus that population concerns will not be solved without improving educational outcomes, particularly for women and girls. The most powerful way of empowering women is through education and skills, but especially through paid work, by ensuring their safety, mobility and employability.
It is heartening that the public conversation has shifted towards putting women in the driving seat. It is high time that women’s empowerment is seen as a solution to unlocking greater economic growth by tapping into work and earnings potential and reaping the benefits of increased household savings and positive behaviour.

His sudden departure from the PTI’s tumultuous politics on October of last year, had turned the political dynamics of the province on its head.
In a way, his fate was not too different from that of other PTI-nominated chief ministers who came before him – Mahmood Khan and Parvez Khattak. They too faded into the political wilderness once removed from power.
With the PTI currently in the throes of another leadership crisis, the Sardar from Kulachi returned with a bang. For almost five months, Gandapur shied away from the media limelight that he so loved while in office. But in recent media appearances, he is clearly back to his boisterous self.
While the party’s energies were fully devoted towards highlighting Imran Khan’s health issues and pushing the narrative that he has been denied timely treatment, the jilted former CM’s resurfacing was being viewed with a mixture of trepidation and chagrin.
‘Comeback tour’
Earlier this week, he showed up at a PTI protest in Islamabad, breaking his silence by giving back-to-back interviews to TV channels and podcasts, where he trashed his party and its leadership without restraint.
He even praised Mohsin Naqvi – at a time when the party regards him as one of those responsible for the current plight of their leader – claiming that the federal interior minister had made “more serious and sustained efforts than anyone else to secure Imran’s release from jail.”
This even prompted KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi to remark that Gandapur was Naqvi’s “good boy”.
“Naqvi had adopted him, and I do not think the interior minister has made any attempt to release Imran,” the governor said in a TV appearance following the former CM’s re-emergence.
In his recent comments, the man from Dera also targeted Aleema Khan. This seemed to be a continuation of his gripe with Imran’s sister, whose influence he had previously blamed for his ouster from office last year.
The subjects Gandapur broached upon raised many eyebrows, both among the leadership and commentators, and his behaviour left political pundits guessing: what motivated this sudden outburst, and what is his endgame?
Over the course of the past week, Dawn reached out to PTI central spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram, provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and provincial government spokesperson Shafi Jan for comment.
While the former two did not respond to requests for comment, the latter simply refused to discuss the matter, saying it was “the party’s internal issue and he could not comment on it.”
A spokesperson for Gandapur initially agreed to respond to written queries, but did not respond to subsequent communications.
Then, on Friday night, a few days after opening Pandora’s Box, Gandapur seemed to have a change of heart, issuing a two-minute video, where he reluctantly apologised for his outburst.
“People are creating a controversy out of my angry remarks. If my remarks have hurt someone… I am sorry for the time being,” he said.
Gandapur justified his anger by saying that the party had been unable to secure their legitimate demand of ensuring proper treatment for the incarcerated Imran.
“If someone is not angered by this, than they lack humanity,’” he said.
Party insiders’ views
“The question is why the former chief minister, who remained sequestered from politics in his Dera lair for the past several months, suddenly made an appearance in Islamabad,” a PTI office bearer requesting anonymity, told Dawn.
He said the former chief minister’s staff had cited several court cases against him in the federal capital as the reason why he stayed in his native town. “Now all of a sudden his legal troubles are of no consequence, and he is on every talk show in town.”
However, a local journalist in Dera Ismail Khan contested this assertion, saying Gandapur was staying in Islamabad most of the time after his resignation and visited his native town occasionally. “He had become very active in district politics over the last month,” the journalist said.
In PTI circles, party leaders are especially puzzled by the timing of Gandapur’s statements.
The social media brigade, meanwhile, feels vindicated, having dubbed Gandapur a “sellout and an establishment tout” long ago.
“Gandapur is a good politician, but whenever he faces a camera, he loses control over his emotions,” said one PTI insider.
He said that the PTI honoured him and he should play his role when the party is under pressure, but “the time was not opportune for his utterances”.
“If what he did in Islamabad continues, then he could turn into another Sher Afzal Marwat,” he said.
MNA Marwat, an outspoken lawyer, had risen to prominence by leading demonstrations after the party and workers were at the receiving end of a crackdown in the aftermath of the May 9 violence. He was later expelled from the party’s ranks for similarly divisive statements, upon Imran’s orders.
Gandapur’s outburst, according to a senior party leader, carried even more sinister undertones.
“Ali Amin wanted to undermine his successor, KP Chief Minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi, and his efforts, which is why he has given these statements,” he said.
Describing the former chief minister as ‘a loose cannon’, the senior party leader said Gandapur may be eyeing an opportunity for himself in case of Afridi’s disqualification – the matter of code of conduct violations in the Haripur by-poll is pending against the incumbent before the Election Commission of Pakistan.
“The powers that be have hinted to Gandapur that he has another chance of becoming chief minister if Afridi is disqualified, and that is why he has been flexing [his muscles],” he said.
Gandapur, the senior party leader said, has little goodwill left in the party, and even if Afridi is disqualified, the party was unlikely to entrust him with the responsibility of leading KP again.Meanwhile, Aleema, who has been at the receiving end of several of Gandapur’s attacks, dismissed his outbursts as a case of “shooting the messenger”.
“Since they owe their seats to Imran, they cannot say anything against him, so they target the family instead,” she said, in a recent interview with Independent Urdu.
“And when they are saying anything against us, they are [actually] venting their anger against Imran,” she said.</p><small>2026-02-21 05:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/210946446905654.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974706/energy-discount-fails-to-impress-industry' target='_blank'><strong>Energy discount fails to impress industry</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The country’s business community continues to be unimpressed with the government’s ‘success story on energy tariff incentives’ benefiting more than 127,686 industrial consumers in the first two months and counting.
The two sides have exchanged divergent positions on the benefits of a three-year incremental package with a Rs4.04 per unit reduction for industry and the revision of the base tariff from the fiscal year cycle to the calendar year cycle, with effect from January 1, 2026.
The industrial side claims that the package was benefiting only a few industries that were not in operation. Still, larger segments could not avail themselves of the benefits, were already in the process of scaling up, or were in the larger category of B3 and B4, who contributed no loss to the grid but paid more in tariffs.
The industry also contends that even if a Rs4.04 per unit reduction was considered, higher fuel costs resulting from the calendar-year change and quarterly adjustments would nullify that reduction. They claim that Power Division was calculating the diversion of industrial captive power plants from natural gas to the power grid as success for the incremental package.

Business community claims relief lost in translation, amid fuel cost hikes

The Power Division on Friday released two-month data as an overview of the industrial relief package in December 2025 and January. It said a total of 127,686 industrial consumers benefited from the package, receiving cumulative relief of Rs12.125 billion. “This represents 46 per cent of the total 278,961 industrial consumers,” the Power Division said, adding that small and large industries alike received a benefit of Rs10.3 per unit on the consumption of surplus electricity under the package.
It said that during December-January, a total of 1,176 million units of electricity were sold to industries under the surplus package, accounting for 23.80pc of the total industrial units sold during this period. About 557m units of electricity were sold in December under the surplus package, representing 23pc of the total industrial units sold during that month, it added.
This translated into financial relief of Rs5.743 billion for industrial consumers. In December alone, 125,829 consumers benefited from the package, constituting 45pc of total industrial consumers.
In January, 619m units were sold to industries, accounting for 24.5pc of the total under the package. The financial benefit amounted to Rs6.382bn. The number of industrial consumers benefiting in January totalled 127,686, or 46pc of the total. The Power Division said Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari was personally committed to taking positive measures for the industrial sector and was directly overseeing these initiatives through regular reviews and progress updates.
This appeared to be in response to a letter from the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), which welcomed the government’s decision to reduce industrial electricity tariffs to restore industrial competitiveness and export viability.
“However, industry and exporters are alarmed over recent developments that have substantially diluted the intended impact of this relief,” said FPCCI President Atif Ikram Shaikh in a letter to the power minister.
He pointed out that the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for January reflected an increase of approximately Rs1.78 per unit over the reference fuel charges. In addition, the forthcoming quarterly adjustment was expected to add approximately Rs0.40 per unit. Consequently, the effective benefit of the announced Rs4.04 cut for the January billing cycle reduces to nearly Rs1.70-1.80 per unit. This is because the January FCA reference was revised downwards from Rs11.64 to Rs10.40, resulting in a higher cost of Rs1.24 per unit for industrial consumers. “In practical terms, more than half of the announced relief has been neutralised within the same billing period,” the FPCCI chief said.
He highlighted that tariff rebasing was undertaken in July 2025 and again in January. Two structural resets within a short span had intensified tariff volatility and eroded planning certainty for industrial consumers. Exporters have already recalibrated international pricing, secured forward contracts, deployed working capital, and engaged labour based on the expectation of a meaningful and sustained reduction.

One carrier strike group — spearheaded by the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln — is already deployed 700 kilometres off the Iranian shore. It carries a complement of 60-90 aircraft including stealth fighters, attack helicopters and a full electronic warfare suite. Another carrier strike group, led by the USS Gerald Ford will be arriving in a week or less. The most advanced US carrier in the fleet, the Ford will add 70-plus aircraft to the tally, along with its advanced radar systems. Both carriers are supported by numerous military vessels, including high-tech destroyers, meaning that about a third of US naval assets are, or will soon be, in a position to strike Iran.
F-15 Strike Eagles, F-35A stealth fighters and F-22 Raptors have been deployed from bases in the UK, Spain and Germany to the Middle East with additional assets en route from the US. More importantly, the US has deployed six out of its 16 E-3 Sentry aircraft to the region. The Sentry is America’s most advanced ‘eye in the sky’ command and control platform capable of airborne surveillance and early warning, with the ability to track over 600 targets simultaneously — aircraft, drones, cruise and ballistic missiles — and effectively coordinates the entire airspace of the battle. It’s a flying super-radar and the mother of all force multipliers rolled into one and it is not deployed lightly or for PR purposes. With its inclusion, the US has deployed a quarter of its entire airpower to the Middle East, making it the largest deployment of US airpower in the region since the 2003 Iraq war. Is all this for show? Is such a massive deployment only a bargaining tool? That’s unlikely at best and delusional at worst. Nor is the build-up limited to offence; anti-missile systems are in place across the region to interdict any missile and drone attacks by Iran on Israel or US bases.
Those who believe the US has no intention of attacking Iran point to the lack of boots on the ground, but that calculation is based on the flawed premise that the US has any intention of occupying Iran. It does not; this would run contrary to the Trumpian way of war: short and sharp conflicts that can be sold as a victory for the president while also showcasing America’s unparalleled military might.

 

It is sufficient for the US to simply bomb away all of Iran’s offensive and defensive capabilities, degrade its command and control, and attempt to isolate, incapacitate or decapitate Iran’s military and political leadership. In that calculus it would open up the way, as the extremist evangelical US Senator Lindsey Graham said “for the Iranian people to stage their own regime change”. With the weakening of central authority, one should expect Kurdish militants and separatists in Sistan-Baluchestan to step up their atta­cks, with the Mujahideen-i-Khalq staging guest appearances. All this will undoubtedly receive not just CIA support but also Mossad’s, which we have seen has deep infiltration in Iran. A beaten, broken and balkanised Iran, along the lines of Libya, Sudan, Iraq and Syria, would suit Israel perfectly; it’s what they want for the entire Middle East, as per the Yinon Plan of the 1980s.

The US has deployed a quarter of its airpower to the Mideast

As for the US, only the naïve would believe that there is a difference between their aims and those of Israel, at least when it comes to Iran, and then there are domestic politics to consider; given the fallout of the Epstein files, with even some Republican politicians calling out President Donald Trump. Would it be hard to imagine that he would start a war as a distraction? Didn’t Bill Clinton bomb Afgh­anistan and Sudan just three days after testifying to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky?
But negotiations are still on between Iran and the US and, yes, there is a non-zero possibility they may succeed. What exactly is on the table? What are the face-saving off-ramps? For Iran to give up its enriched uranium is political and strategic suicide; anything less would be unacceptable to America. And then there is the big picture. China buys up to 80 per cent of Iran’s oil – some 1.38 million barrels a day — amounting to 14pc of China’s seaborne crude oil imports. Taking that off the table, or even disrupting it, amounts to economic warfare against China and can be seen as a prelude to containment, much like Venezuela before it. Because if you actually believe the US is ‘managing’ its decline and is happy to allow China its sphere of influence, then you’re wrong. The US plans to be the dominant global power for the foreseeable future and is acting accordingly. In that pursuit, chaos in Iran is indeed a desirable outcome.

Published in Dawn, February 21st, 2026</p><small>2026-02-21 04:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699909a86368a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974738/culture-of-impunity' target='_blank'><strong>Culture of impunity</strong></a><br><p>A RECENT fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths during so-called operations conducted by the Punjab Police’s Crime Control Department, which has allegedly adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”. According to the report, as many as 924 suspects were killed in at least 670 CCD-led encounters across Punjab over eight months in 2025 since the launch of the special branch of police created to curb organised crime and heinous offences. The CCD’s performance has been hailed by Punjab’s political leadership as a great achievement that has protected citizens’ life, property and honour.
However, HRCP has rightly described such killings — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — as “institutionalised practice”. The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022, requires the Federal Investigation Agency to investigate every death in police custody under the supervision of the National Commission for Human Rights. Inquiries by judicial magistrates are required under Section 174 and 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) in the case of custodial deaths. There’s no evidence that these legal formalities were observed to even try to ‘justify’ such fake encounters. It appears that this police culture of impunity has been perpetrated and patronised by those at the helm of political and security affairs in Pakistan’s largest province.

 

HRCP has pointed to the lack of accountability mechanisms behind the CCD’s cold-blooded violence. A uniform template of allegations is followed: suspects open fire first, police fire back in self-defence, and, under highly improbable circumstances, the suspects are killed in their accomplices’ friendly fire; the dead suspects then turn out to be “hardened criminals”. These have been declared “lethal shortcuts” secured by bypassing proper investigation, prosecution and judicial oversight. HRCP wants an immediate “moratorium” on all encounter operations until legal safeguards and independent accountability mechanisms are established.
After a year’s pre-service training at Police College Sihala in 1977, I was sent to Punjab to serve as assistant superintendent of police at Sheikhupura, Pakpattan and Jhang sub-divisions. Punjab Police has a reputation for using strong-arm tactics against criminals. A tough police chief in Lahore was known as ‘Halaku Khan’. Since the 19th century, Punjab Police’s interrogation techniques have been part of folklore. ‘Effective’ police officers were projected as macho figures in Punjab’s vast hinterlands. There were two types of officers: those who believed that the ends justified the means and harsh and extrajudicial measures were effective crime-control methods; the other smaller group comprised those who believed in the rule of law, due process and adherence to a code that gave primacy to human rights and dignity over brutality.

Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian.

My father’s profession as a lawyer and his being a disciple of Mohammad Ali Jinnah set my course; I chose the path less trodden, which followed the rule of law. As SSP, I was appointed Lahore police chief in 1991; a recent predecessor was said to be an ‘encounter specialist’. The younger brother of the then prime minister was heading a crime control committee for Lahore district. It took me a while to make him understand that crime can be controlled through the painstaking tasks of intelligence collection and professional (and not extra-legal) interrogation of suspects, thorough investigations, collection of credible (and not cooked-up) evidence, assiduous prosecutions and meticulous trials. Over the next two years, the Lahore police took a rule-of-law approach to control crime as the media of those years can testify.

 

The same politician became Punjab chief minister in 1997 and his elder brother the prime minister. On the recommendation of the then inspector-general of police (IGP) and chief secretary, he posted me as DIG of Faisalabad region. Terrorism and sectarian violence were at their peak in those days. The Crime Investigation Department was reorganised and an elite police force created to tackle sectarian violence. The Anti-Terrorism Act was promulgated in 1997, and special speedy trial courts were established. Within two years, hundreds of sectarian terrorists, mainly belonging to Sunni and Shia militant groups were arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated. Sectarian violence came down through lawful measures. Later, the CID was upgraded to the Counter-Terrorism Department and further successes were achieved. Both the political and security establishments achieved the desired results through an approach based on due process and the rule of law.
Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian. In the last three years or so, extremely harsh measures have been used against peaceful political protests, and the privacy of homes has been violated. Above all, extrajudicial and custodial killings by the CCD have created an environment of distrust and disgust. The ill-advised promulgation of the Torture and Custodial Death Act in 2022 has not stopped the killer cops from fighting crime by simply eliminating criminals. Will the federal police carry out a scrutiny of the provincial force? I doubt it. They themselves appear to be partners in this crime. The strategy of creating a special crime control department should be re-examined by Punjab’s political leadership. Shortcuts to fighting crime and populist displays of swift justice will backfire. Violence begets violence.
Judicial scrutiny of custodial and extrajudicial killings under Sections 174 and 176 of CrPC is the only way to ensure viable and legal accountability. In our policing days, we were genuinely concerned when high courts took notice of illegal detentions, the misuse of force and deaths in custody. We would not let our juniors run amok. By following the unlawful directions of the ruling elite and deep state, the current police leadership has failed. They must now draw the line and ensure that the police follow the law and enhance their investigative skills and capacity. There are three key public office holders in a province: the IGP, the high court chief justice and the political chief executive. Will they follow the constitutional path or take the illegal course of reckless lawlessness that promotes a culture of impunity? We’ll know the answer for no one can escape scrutiny and eventual accountability that this holy month of fasting and introspection provides to all of us, especially the rulers.

Perhaps the only positive outcome was the news that Pakistan will not be among the five states contributing troops to the International Stabilisation Force to be stationed in Gaza.
Otherwise, there was vague talk of ‘peace’, as well as associated Israeli threats to torpedo the whole plan unless Gaza is demilitarised, which means Hamas giving up its weapons. Billions of dollars have been pledged for the occupied territory, but how many of these promises materialise remains up in the air, as Israel still controls access to the Strip.
Regarding the ISF, an American general will lead the force, while Indonesia has committed around 8,000 troops for the scheme. However, Jakarta has said the mission is “humanitarian”, and that its troops will not be involved in combat roles, precluding any confrontation with Hamas, which US President Donald Trump and Israel insist must be disarmed. Indonesia is aware that any potential confrontation with Palestinian resistance groups will not go down well domestically or in the larger Muslim world.

 

Pakistan has taken the right decision by not committing forces. The BoP and ISF are experimental entities without a clear mandate, apart from establishing ‘peace’ in Gaza, while the possibility of confronting Palestinians and protecting Israeli interests should immediately serve as red flags. Moreover, as per The Guardian, the US intends to build a massive base in Gaza. What is the need for such a facility? Unless there is clarity, the base will represent American occupation of Palestinian land in support of Israel on the sly.
Though plenty of optimism was visible at the Washington meeting, the Palestinians are not so sure this exercise will lead to their liberation and an end to Israeli atrocities. After all, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that that there will be no reconstruction “before the demilitarisation of Gaza”. Unless proved otherwise, Tel Aviv will have an invisible veto at BoP, and all plans will be tailored to its satisfaction, with crumbs thrown at the Palestinians.
Mr Trump told the meeting that “we will help Gaza”. So far no help has been visible as Israel has slaughtered around 600 Palestinians since last October’s ceasefire, while overall the toll of its genocidal violence has crossed 72,000 since October 2023; some studies suggest the toll may be higher. While Muslim states, including Pakistan and Indonesia, spoke for Palestinian rights at the meeting, there were no unambiguous promises from Mr Trump to stop Israel’s land grabs in the West Bank — moves that a recent UN report has said resemble ethnic cleansing. Hence, expecting the BoP to chart a roadmap towards Palestinian liberation is a fallacy.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court on Friday dismissed multiple petitions challenging the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sales Tax on Services Act, 2022, ruling that the provincial levy on construction services does not contravene constitutional provisions governing the division of taxation powers between the federal and provincial governments.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a two-judge FCC bench addressed a number of challenges against a May 13, 2025, Peshawar High Court judgement.
Petitioners including M/s Matracon Pakistan (Private) Limited, Anwar Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Khan, Zhongmei-Al Mehreen Joint Venture, Merryland Housing Society Mardan and Subhan Smart City Society Mardan had challenged Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 to the act.
The challenged provision imposed a 2 per cent sales tax on services provided by construction contractors, architects, civil engineers, property promoters, developers, planners, interior decorators and allied professions.
It specifically covers construction services relating to structures, buildings, roads, bridges, underpasses, flyovers, electro-mechanical works, turn-key projects, and engineering, procurement and construction contracts.
Show-cause notices issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority demanded tax for the period from July 2021 to April 2022 on amounts received by the petitioners pursuant to construction contracts, which included the price of goods to be provided by the contractors.
The legal question before the FCC was whether Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 was unconstitutional.

 

The judgement observed that after examining Entry 49 of the Constitution — which states “taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed, except sales tax on services” — the court found no inconsistency between the impugned law and the Constitution.
Entry 49 clearly stipulates that taxes on services cannot be imposed by the federation and the impugned law conforms to this mandate by imposing sales tax exclusively on construction services, the court said.
While the FCC acknowledged the petitioners’ concern that the revenue authority was levying tax on entire contractual amounts, it noted that Section 2(a) of the act defines “input tax” as cost incurred in the utilisation of goods for the execution of services.
The law allows registered persons to claim adjustments and refunds regarding tax paid under any other law on goods used in providing taxable services.
The FCC also addressed an ancillary matter regarding its jurisdiction to hear tax references not expressly enumerated in the Constitution. It held that Article 175E(5) of the Constitution authorises the FCC to call for the record of any case where a substantial question of constitutional interpretation arises.
The FCC observed that some constitutional provisions were “character-conferring” and also “competence-enumerating”. Article 175E(5) is of this kind, it said.
The court held that Article 175E(5) authorises the FCC to adjudicate matters involving substantial questions of constitutional interpretation, even in the absence of express jurisdiction. In the present case, the court said such a question squarely arose in the form of a challenge to the vires of the law.
The FCC concluded that Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sales Tax on Services Act, 2022, was not ultra vires the Constitution. The judgement explained that the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, when considered together, show no inconsistency.

The oath was administered by AJK Chief Justice Raja Saeed Akram at a ceremony held in the Supreme Court building, attended by members of the legal fraternity and senior civil servants.
The office fell vacant following the expiry of the term of retired Justice Abdul Rashid Sulehria on January 13 last year.
Justice Mughal’s appointment was notified by the AJK government on Wednesday after the President’s office received advice in his favour from the chairman of the AJK Council — the prime minister of Pakistan.
Justice Mughal, who is over 70, previously served as CEC from February 2016 to February 2019 while he was a serving judge — first of the AJK High Court and later of the Supreme Court.
The long-delayed appointment is expected to allay concerns about the timely conduct of AJK’s next general elections, scheduled for July this year.
At the swearing-in ceremony, Justice Mughal declined to take up questions from journalists, saying he would invite media after receiving detailed briefings from election commission officials.

LAHORE: The Crime Control Department (CCD), Punjab, said a comparative review of crime data for the post-May period of 2024 and 2025 showed a significant reduction in crime across Punjab, particularly in Lahore.
According to the CCD, the department commenced operations in Punjab in May last year and held a meeting to review its performance in crime control.
It stated that the provincial capital, Lahore, recorded some of the most pronounced crime reductions in its history.
The CCD said the murder cases fell from 361 to 220 (39pc), while attempted murder declined from 812 to 504 (38pc). Incidents of dacoity dropped from 35 to 15 (57pc), and house dacoity from 33 to 6 (82pc).
Robbery saw the sharpest decline, dropping from 8,213 to 1,823 — a 78pc reduction. Theft within boundary walls fell by 9pc and burglary by 44pc, while motorcycle and car snatching decreased by 69pc and 50pc, respectively.
Punjab recorded significant declines across major crime categories, with murders falling from 3,952 to 3,022 (24pc) and attempted murder down 18pc. Dacoity and robbery dropped by 60pc and 53pc, while theft within boundary walls and burglary decreased by 17pc and 27pc, respectively.
This reduction, however, was not without cost. Across the province, 19 police officers embraced martyrdom, and 167 personnel —including 13 CCD members — sustained firearm-related or other serious operational injuries, according to CCD Punjab.
HRCP findings rejected
Meanwhile, the CCD has rejected allegations made in a fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), terming claims of staged encounters and extrajudicial actions as unfounded and contrary to the department’s operational framework.
The HRCP in its fact-finding report on CCD encounters in Punjab called for an urgent judicial inquiry into related deaths. It said that at least 670 encounters were conducted over eight months in 2025, resulting in 924 suspects killed, while two police officials lost their lives.
In a press release, the CCD stated that it does not follow any policy of staged encounters and operates strictly within the Constitution of Pakistan, the Police Order 2002 and applicable criminal procedure laws. The department maintained that arrest remains the primary objective of its operations and that the use of force is governed by the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.
The CCD said lethal force is employed only as a last resort in situations involving armed resistance and imminent danger to life. It added that Punjab faces a complex security environment in which criminal gangs and organised groups often possess automatic weapons and engage law enforcement personnel with lethal intent, compelling officers to act in self-defence to protect themselves and civilians.
Responding to concerns about abuse of authority, the department acknowledged that any misconduct by individual officers is unacceptable.
According to the statement, officers found involved in corruption, abuse of power, or professional misconduct are being proceeded against under departmental and criminal laws without discrimination.
The CCD reiterated that it maintains a zero-tolerance policy against torture, corruption, fabrication of evidence, intimidation of citizens, and unlawful use of force.

A two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Ayesha A. Malik took up an appeal filed by the finance ministry challenging the FST’s June 26, 2025 order along with an application seeking condonation of a 20-day delay in filing the petition.
Authored by Justice Malik, the four-page judgement described the 20-day delay as inexcusable and criticised the state’s casual approach towards statutory timelines.
The state enforces the law against citizens and expects compliance within prescribed timelines; therefore, it must also hold itself to the same standard, she emphasised.

Observes state is just like any other litigant and must comply with statutory timelines

Through the application, the finance ministry sought condonation of delay, explaining that the case was under process with the deputy secretary (Litigation-II) and awaiting approval from a CPLA committee, which could not be convened due to an insufficient number of cases for deliberation.
It further explained that once the caseload increased and approval was obtained, the draft was sent to the Law and Justice Division for vetting. The division suggested changes, and by the time the final draft was prepared, the limitation period had expired.
Justice Malik observed that if the state were permitted to disregard statutory timeframes on account of its internal inefficiencies, it would create an imbalance in the administration of justice and undermine the constitutional guarantee of equality before the law.
When the state fails to comply with these timelines and seeks indulgence for administrative delay, it transfers the consequences of its disorganisation onto the court and the opposing party, which is often in a weaker position, the judgement emphasised. It added that good governance requires institutional functioning through clear responsibility, internal discipline and adherence to the law.
If compliance depends on convenience rather than structured systems, delays become routine and accountability diminishes. The courts cannot condone such delays without weakening the expectation that the state must maintain efficient systems capable of meeting its legal obligations. Enforcement of timelines and internal procedures strengthens institutional discipline and reinforces public confidence, the judgement observed.

 

Such delay is inexcusable, particularly when no effort has been made to reform or improve the procedure causing the delay, the verdict noted, adding that the state must organise itself to function in a timely manner and meet legal deadlines rather than seeking indulgence for its own inefficiencies.
The judgement observed that enforcement of timelines and internal procedures strengthens institutional discipline and reinforces public confidence that the law applies equally to all under Article 25 of the Constitution.
In this context, the prescribed timeline under the SC rules is 60 days. When a statutory timeframe is set, it is meant to ensure diligence and prevent disputes from remaining indefinitely pending.
If internal file movement, committee scheduling constraints or staff shortages are accepted as sufficient cause, the statutory framework would become flexible at the convenience of the litigant, defeating the very purpose of limitation, which is to ensure certainty and predictability in the administration of justice. The court emphasised that limitation is not merely a technical requirement but carries substantive importance.
Every litigant, including the petitioner, is required to adhere to the prescribed timelines, failing which the remedy stands extinguished unless sufficient cause is shown.
“We find that the explanation provided in the application for condonation of delay is insufficient and reflects a very casual approach towards the prescribed limitation,” the judgement observed.
Consequently, the application for condonation of delay was dismissed and, as a result, the petition itself was dismissed as time-barred.

Andrew Mountbatten Windsor

• With only one conviction in US, legislators accuse justice dept of dragging its feet• Most Americans now find leaders ‘untrustworthy’• Australian PM says referendums ‘hard to pass’ after Andrew’s arrest
WASHINGTON: The arrest of former prince Andrew has underlined the striking contrast bet­ween Europe, where high-profile, powerful people are being held to account over their links to Jeffrey Epstein, and the United States, where the fallout has been limited.
Only one person has been arrested or convicted in the United States in connection with the activities of the late sex offender — Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and accomplice.
Epstein cultivated a global network of powerful politicians, business executives, academics and celebrities — many of whom have been tainted by their association with him.
A number of prominent Americans — from former president Bill Clinton to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates — have had their reputations damaged by their friendships with Epstein, but no one other than Maxwell has faced legal consequences.
A top US Justice Department official suggested recently that no prosecutions may be forthcoming. “I can’t talk about any investigations, but I will say the following, which is that in July, the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the files, the Epstein files, and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CNN earlier this month.
That explanation has not satisfied many US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, who accuse the Trump Justice Department of dragging its feet.
“The UK has officially done more to prosecute Epstein predators than our own government. Shameful,” Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, said on X.
Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, blamed the lack of accountability in the US squarely on Trump, who also was a close friend of Epstein and moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York.
“Countries across the world are holding their Epstein class accountable,” Gallego said on X. “It isn’t happening in America because we have a pedo protector in the Oval Office running a government cover-up for him and his friends.”







A Reuters/Ipsos poll found 53 per cent Americans say the Epstein files “lowered their trust in the country’s political and business leaders”, while 69pc told pollsters the Epstein files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions”.
Republican lawmaker Thomas Massie welcomed prince Andrew’s arrest but said “now we need justice in the US”.
Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pla­yed down the chance of a vote to remove the British monarch as Australia’s head of state following the arrest of former prince Andrew.
“I’m a republican but we had a referendum during the last term. Referendums are hard to pass in Australia,” Albanese said when asked in an interview with The Guardian whether Australia should reassess its ties with the monarchy.

FORMER captain Michael Vaughan has urged the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to “act fast” on reports that Pakistani players will be overlooked by Indian-owned teams in the domestic Hundred competition.
The issue could be a factor during next month’s player auction for English cricket’s Hundred, a 100 balls-per-side competition featuring eight franchises rather than the traditional 18 first-class counties.
BBC Sport and The Telegraph have reported that with four of the eight franchises in the upcoming tournament owned by companies that control teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), it is “an unwritten rule” that Pakistani players would not be considered for those team.
According to the BBC, a senior ECB official indicated to an agent that interest in his Pakistan players would be limited to sides not linked to the IPL.
Vaughan, referencing the ECB’s stated aim of cricket becoming the most inclusive sport in the country, posted on Friday on X: “The ECB need to act fast on this … they own the league, and this should not be allowed to happen … The most inclusive sport in the country is not one that allows this to happen.”







The Pakistan Cricket Board has not commented on the situation so far.
Politics, not sport
Longstanding political tensions between India and Pakistan have led to the rivals only playing each other in international cricket events, although their recent Colombo showdown at the ongoing T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka only went ahead after Pakistan called off a boycott.
Politics has also led to an effective ban on Pakistani players participating in the Indian Premier League, world cricket’s most lucrative T20 franchise competition.
And with several IPL owners now owning teams in several different countries, opportunities for Pakistani cricketers to participate in various leagues are in danger of being reduced further.
Players will go under the hammer in London on March 11-12, with the BBC reporting that the four Indian-affiliated Hundred teams — Manchester Super Giants, MI London, Southern Brave and Sunrisers Leeds — will deliberately avoid selecting players from Pakistan.
Two Pakistani international players — Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim — appeared in last year’s Hundred tournament, which was the final edition before new investors took control.
Others — including Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf — featured in earlier seasons of the men’s competition. No Pakistan players have appeared in the women’s Hundred.
‘Systemic isolation’
The BBC highlighted the exclusion of Pakistan players in what it called “a growing trend in franchise cricket”.
No Pakistanis have featured in South Africa’s SA20, which launched in 2023. All six of its teams are owned by IPL franchise groups — including the four now involved in The Hundred.
In the UAE’s ILT20, franchises controlled by the owners of MI London and Southern Brave have not signed a Pakistan player across four seasons, but have recruited cricketers from 15 other nationalities.
By contrast, American-owned ILT20 side Desert Vipers have signed eight Pakistan players over the same period.
Commenting on the development, BBC cricket pundit Aatif Nawaz said “There is no merit-based reason for Pakistani players to be excluded from any franchise T20 competition”.
“Call it what it really is: systemic isolation,” he wrote on X.







According to the BBC, the ECB sold its 49pc stakes in each of the eight Hundred franchises last year — raising £500m in private investment that has since been distributed to counties and the grassroots game.
The ECB retains control of the competition itself, with a new board featuring team representatives formed to help shape its strategic direction.
The tournament also remains under the jurisdiction of the independent cricket regulator — established following the 2023 Equity in Cricket report, which found discrimination to be “widespread” within the English game.
The BBC quoted the County Cricket Members’ Group as saying: “We expect the relevant county boards and the ECB to hold private partners accountable if there is any reason to believe the non-selection of Pakistan players was a blanket decision based on nationality.”

WASHINGTON: After the US Supreme Court struck down the President’s sweeping tariffs that he pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies, Donald Trump announced on Friday he was imposing an extra global tariff of 10 per cent on US trade partners.
The conservative-majority court ruled the emergency powers law — International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs”, marking Trump’s biggest defeat at the SC since returning to the White House last year.
While hard-hit Canada welcomed the ruling pointing out the levies were always “unjustified”, other US trading partners particularly European powers were cautious in their response, with the UK, Germany and EU stating that they were in contact with the Trump administration and analysing the court decision ‘carefully’.
Trump insisted he would impose tariffs “using alternative authorities” after rebuking certain members of the court for lacking the courage to do what’s right for the country.
He suggested that most trade deals negotiated under the threat of his tariffs remained valid, mentioning specifically India, despite the SC ruling those levies illegal. “The India deal is on,” Trump told reporters in response to a question, while suggesting tariffs under separate authorities would replace the ones overturned by the court. “All the deals — we’re just going to do it a different way.”
“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past,” the president asserted.
“The Supreme Court’s decision today made a president’s ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less,” he claimed while speaking to reporters after the 6-3 ruling upheld a lower court’s decision that the Republican president’s use of the 1977 law “exceeded his authority”.
Trump has leveraged tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a key economic and foreign policy tool. They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.
Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world’s largest economy.
However, Trump’s administration has not provided tariffs collection data since Dec 14, 2025.
Powers to issue taxes, tariffs
The Supreme Court reached its conclusion in a legal challenge by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-governed, against Trump’s unprecedented use of this law to unilaterally impose the import taxes.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner without the approval of Congress.
“Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs” with IEEPA, “it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes,” the court noted
The SC’s three liberal justices joined three conservatives in Friday’s ruling, which upheld lower court decisions that tariffs Trump imposed under IEEPA were illegal.
Trump heaped praise on Brett Kavanaugh, the only justice he nominated who voted with him. Kavanaugh was joined in his dissent by fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
Chief Justice John Roberts, in delivering his opinion, said, “IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties.”
Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.
IEEPA lets a president regulate commerce in a national emergency.
Trump became the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials, domestic military deployments and military operations overseas.
He described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenseless and ruined without them.
Post-ruling strategy
In November, Trump told reporters that without his tariffs “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us”. He said the United States was abused by other countries, including China, the second-largest economy.
After the SC heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan”.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.
Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against American exporters.
None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.
Trump’s ability to impose tariffs instantaneously on any trading partner’s goods under the aegis of some form of declared national emergency raised his leverage over other countries.
It brought world leaders scrambling to Washington to secure trade deals that often included pledges of billions of dollars in investments or other offers of enhanced market access for US companies.
But Trump’s use of tariffs as a cudgel in US foreign policy has succeeded in antagonising numerous countries, including those long considered among the closest US allies.
IEEPA historically had been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. The law does not specifically mention the word tariffs.
Estimates
Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists estimated that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act stood at more than $175 billion. And that amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.
The Congressional Bud­get Office has estimated that if all current tariffs stay in place, including the IEEPA-based duties, they would generate about $300bn annually over the next decade.
Total US net customs duty receipts reached a record $195bn in fiscal 2025, which ended on Sept 30, according to US Trea­sury Department data.
In February and March of 2025, Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.
Trump has wielded his tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a weapon to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariffs ad by Canada’s Ontario province.
Reactions to ruling
The EU said on Friday that it was studying the US Supreme Court ruling. “We take note of the ruling … and are analysing it carefully,” EU trade spokesman Olof Gill said.
“We remain in close contact with the US Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,” he added.
“Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship”.
The British government spokesperson said Britain planned to work with the US to see how the overturning of Trump’s tariffs by the US Supreme Court would affect the trade deal between the two countries. “We will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world,” the spokesperson said, adding that the UK expects its “privileged trading position with the US to continue”.
The Canadian minister responsible for US trade said the US Supreme Court’s ruling affirms that the levies were “unjustified”.
International Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc noted, however, that tariffs causing the most pain in Canada — sector-specific measures affecting the steel, aluminum and auto industries — remained in force despite the ruling, promising Ottawa would work with Washington to “create growth and opportunities on both sides of the border”.
After the ruling, stock markets rose in the United States and Europe, led by shares of affected companies, including Europe’s luxury brands from LVMH to Hermes and Italian luxury outerwear group Moncler, all of which rose after the ruling.
Stocks rise
US and European stocks advanced on Friday and Treasury yields rose as investors absorbed the Supreme Court ruling, while also parsing a weak GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation data.
All three major US stock indexes moved higher immediately following the Supreme Court’s decision. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are on track to notch weekly gains, while the blue-chip Dow is currently flat versus last Friday’s close.
Europe’s STOXX 600 index extended gains following the ruling while gold prices came off the day’s highs in the immediate aftermath.
US Treasury yields rose following the Supreme Court’s ruling. The yield on benchmark US 10-year notes added 1.9 basis points to 4.094pc, from 4.075pc late on Thursday.
The dollar turned lower after the top US court’s tariff decision, but was still on track for its biggest weekly gain since October.

The SPI-based inflation has now increased for 29 consecutive weeks, underscoring persistent pressure on household budgets. The continued upward movement has largely been driven by a sharp rise in the prices of vegetables and other perishables, as well as higher electricity and petrol rates. On a week-on-week basis, the SPI edged up by 1.16pc from the previous week, official data showed on Friday.
The increase was attributed mainly to stronger demand for essential food items during the month of Ramazan, which traditionally leads to higher consumption and short-term price pressures. 
The latest figures suggest that food and energy remain the principal contributors to inflationary trends, with perishable goods particularly sensitive to supply constraints and seasonal demand patterns.

SPI rises 5.19pc year-on-year, driven by higher food and energy prices

An extraordinary surge in the retail prices of sugar and meat has also played a decisive role in reversing the easing trend witnessed in recent weeks. Meat prices, in particular, have been climbing steadily, adding further strain on household budgets already under pressure from elevated food and energy costs.
Weekly inflation had earlier reached a historic high of 48.35 per cent YoY in early May 2023. It subsequently moderated in the following years. The latest movement in sugar, edible oil, pulses, and meat prices suggests that volatility in essential food commodities continues to shape short-term inflation trends, with consumers facing recurring cycles of price spikes.
The items, whose prices increased the most over the previous week included bananas (16.05pc), electricity charges for Q1 (15.41pc), garlic (5.86pc), chicken (5.49pc), onions (3.83pc), tomatoes (3.82pc), diesel (2.69pc), petrol (1.93pc), beef (1.03pc), LPG (0.75pc), mutton (0.69pc) and long cloth (0.28pc).
The items whose prices saw a decline week-on-week included eggs (11.78pc), potatoes (2.24pc), wheat flour (2.02pc), pulse masoor (1.47pc), sugar (0.96pc), vegetable ghee 2.5Kg (0.72pc), pulse gram (0.58pc), cooking oil 5 litre (0.19pc), gur (0.16pc), vegetable ghee 1kg (0.11pc), rice IRRI-6/9 (0.08pc) and mustard oil (0.07pc).
However, on an annual basis, the items whose prices increased the most tomatoes (85.20pc), wheat flour (31.33pc), gas charges for Q1 (29.85pc), electricity charges for Q1 (17.33pc), bananas (15.83pc), chilies powder (15.20pc), beef (13.28pc), LPG (12.22pc), firewood (11.40pc), powdered milk (9.89pc), shirting (9.11pc), mutton (8.77pc) and gur (8.63pc).
In contrast, the prices of potatoes dropped 45.43pc, followed by garlic (27.51pc), pulse gram (23.30pc), chicken (19.36pc), onions (18.10pc), Lipton tea (13.95pc), salt powder (12.52pc), pulse masoor (12.33pc), eggs (8.54pc), pulse mash (5.08pc), mustard oil (2.13pc), sugar (1.43pc) and pulse moong (1.40pc).
The index, comprising 51 items collected from 50 markets in 17 cities, is computed weekly to assess the prices of essential commodities and services at shorter intervals. Data showed that the prices of 17 items increased, 12 decreased, and 22 remained stable compared to the previous week.

The session, which began 45 minutes late under the chairmanship of Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, started with the recitation of the Holy Quran.
The resolution was moved by JUI-F MPA Asghar Ali Tareen, who stated that although Balochistan was Pakistan’s largest province by area and rich in natural resources, it remained underdeveloped and beset by numerous challenges. He argued that meaningful representation was essential to addressing the province’s problems.
The resolution recommended that the provincial government approach the Centre to ensure practical steps were taken to increase the number of seats in the Balochistan Assembly from 65 to 85, and in the National Assembly from 20 to 28. The move, the resolution stated, wou­ld help reduce public anxiety and feelings of marginalisation in the province.

Provincial assembly unanimously adopts resolution for greater share in legislatures keeping vast geography in view

Vast geography
Speaking on the resolution, Mr Tareen pointed out that a single National Assembly constituency in Balochistan was geographically equivalent to an entire district in Punjab. He added that Rakhshan Division’s National Assembly constituency in the province covered an area comparable to the whole of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He noted that legislation to increase Balochistan’s representation was previously considered for inclusion in the 27th Constitutional Amendment but was not ultimately incorporated. He added that since the PPP and the PML-N were coalition partners in both the province and at the federal level, it was an opportune time to amend the Constitution to enhance Balochistan’s representation.
Provincial Planning and Development Minister Mir Zahoor Buledi said Balochistan had not received the attention it deserved in the past.
He suggested that, instead of a marginal increase, the number of National Assembly seats should be expanded by more than 40 overall.
Opposition Leader in the House Mir Younis Aziz Zehri supported the resolution, calling it vital for the province’s interests. He stressed that beyond passing the resolution, practical implementation was necessary. He also criticised past census results, claiming that Balochistan’s population had been undercounted, and remarked that out of 362 National Assembly seats, the province’s share was negligible.
Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Muhammad Sadiq Umrani highlighted that an area in Nasirabad with a population of 600,000 lacked representation in the NA.
He urged the Balochistan Assembly speaker to form a committee to present the province’s case before the federal government with solid arguments.
Members from the National Party, ANP and other political parties also backed the resolution.
A proposal was also made to form a parliamentary committee under the leadership of the chief minister to engage with the federal government on the issue.
With broad cross-party support, the House unanimously approved the resolution, marking a significant step in renewed efforts to enhance Balochistan’s political representation at both provincial and national levels.

• Offers cooperation on critical minerals
• Premier meets regional leaders, IDFC chief
WASHINGTON: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a two-day visit to Washington on Friday, securing a US pledge to cooperate on crit­ical minerals and energy after aligning his country with a US President Donald Trump-led Gaza peace initiative and praising his role in defusing a regional crisis last year.
PM Shehbaz met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday to discuss shifting the bilateral rela­tionship toward economic inv­es­tment while maintaining a partnership in counterterrorism, acco­rding to a State Depart­ment statement.
In their meeting, Rubio thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for its role as a founding member of the “Board of Peace”, which held its inaugural session on Thursday.
The State Department said Rubio also offered condolences for recent terror attacks in Pakistan and “reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counterterrorism”.
The ‘meaningful’ discussions cov­ered Pakistan’s recent participation in the Critical Minerals Min­­isterial in Washington, with the US welcoming Islamabad’s eng­a­gement and discussing commercial opportunities for Ameri­can companies in the country’s energy and mineral resources.
According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, both sides reaffirmed the importance of Pakistan-US strategic ties and expressed satisfaction with the partnership’s progress under President Trump.
They agreed to boost trade, expand economic cooperation and strengthen counterterrorism efforts, while emphasising the need for continued high-level engagement to advance shared goals.

‘A saviour of South Asia’
PM Shehbaz also credited Trump with de-escalating a four-day military crisis between Pakistan and India in May. He called the president “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”, whose intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people”.
Speaking at the summit, Trump recounted his actions during that conflict, saying he warned both countries that the US would halt trade negotiations and could impose steep tariffs.
“I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” Trump said, adding that the economic threat helped achieve a de-escalation.
A notable moment at the summit came when Trump devoted nearly four minutes of his address to praising Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership for their “constructive and responsible role for regional peace and stability”, referencing his meeting with PM Shehbaz and the Chief of Defence Forces, Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots.
Meeting with regional leaders
According to Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz also held informal meetings with several leaders in Washington for the Board of Peace session, including the king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and the presidents of Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.
It described Pakistan’s participation in the board as part of its broader effort to support peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives and “global peace”.
Separately, APP reported that PM Shehbaz met the chief executive of the US International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), Benjamin Black, on Friday. The premier praised the portfolio of more than $1bn and urged closer business-to-business engagement, while Black outlined the agency’s project pipeline and signalled interest in expanding the IDFC footprint in Pakistan.
Officials played down expectations of major agreements, suggesting the visit was aimed more at setting a direction than producing headline deals.

The latest threat came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week.
Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15.
Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: “The most I can say — I am considering it.”
After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the “next step”.
“I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff,” he said, referring to Trump’s main Middle East negotiator.
Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials.
“We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment,” he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW.
“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he added.
His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level.
Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy.
Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities.
‘No ultimatum’
The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman, the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities.
Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks.
On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out.
“We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,” Trump told the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace”, his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States followed through on its threats.
Araghchi, however, insisted that “there is no ultimatum”.
“We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about,” he said.
“We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us,” he said, adding Iran had “no reason to delay”.
Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks.
The Israeli army said on Friday that it was on “defensive alert” regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged.
Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region.
After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East.
Subsequently, the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday.
The carrier was seen transiting the Strait of Gibraltar — which links the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean — in a photo taken from the Gibraltar side of the strait.
Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.</p><small>2026-02-20 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20225341a351d54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974608/imran-to-be-taken-to-hospital-two-more-times-will-be-administered-injection-on-feb-25-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imran to be taken to hospital two more times, will be administered injection on Feb 25: minister</strong></a><br><p>Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Friday that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would be taken to a hospital twice in the coming days and that he had to be administered an injection on February 25.
The ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
The matter was raised again during ARY News programme ‘Sawal Yeh Hai’, where Chaudhry was asked what was the obstacle in the way of Imran’s personal physicians gaining access to him.







In his response, Chaudhry said: “Our top priority is to provide him the best treatment facilities. We previously took him to Pims as well, but in secrecy due to his security.”
He added that Imran was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the advice of doctors who had examined the former prime minister in jail and suggested that he should be treated at a tertiary care hospital.
“We have to again take him to the hospital twice,” Chaudhry said, assuring that he would be provided the best possible medical facilities.
He added that the government had invited the PTI leadership to be present during an examination of Imran at the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is imprisoned, on February 15.
“But they could not decide which leadership to send,” he said, indicating a divide within the PTI. The minister also claimed that PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan’s name was proposed for the visit, but “objections were raised”.
“So they can decide. Imran Khan sahib has to be administered an injection on February 25. If they want to come, they are most welcome. There is no secrecy,” he added.
He also assured that since Imran was in jail at present, the responsibility of his health and treatment lay with the government and the state. “And realising this, we are providing him the best possible facilities.”
The minister again insisted that the government had invited Barrister Gohar in connection with Imran’s treatment and examination and claimed that his “party did not allow him to go”.
He reasserted that a member of Imran’s family, Barrister Gohar and Imran’s personal physician had been invited during his last examination.
“We will try to invite them this time as well during his treatment, but first, they need to decide who will come. Because we waited for around one and a half to two hours, but they did not come,” he added.
Asked if a request was made for Imran’s personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf to be allowed access to him on February 25, would it be accepted, Chaudhry replied that the PTI had been insisting on allowing access to Dr Sultan, but he was not an ophthalmologist.
On January 24, it was revealed that the PTI founder had undergone a 20-minute medical procedure for his eye ailment at Pims, resulting in concerns being raised by the opposition and Imran’s family, who continue to face restrictions on meetings with the incarcerated former premier.
Subsequently, the Supreme Court’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “15 per cent” vision left in his right eye.
A report prepared by a medical board formed by the government that visited Imran on February 15 at the Adiala jail stated that, unaided, the ex-premier’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.
The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health, also doubled down on its earlier demands on Friday.
These included Imran’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports.
Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan have previously said multiple times that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.</p><small>2026-02-20 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/202157067190315.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974600/over-31m-births-registered-with-ucs-yet-to-be-added-to-nadras-central-database-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>Over 31m births registered with UCs yet to be added to Nadra’s central database, says report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Around 31.9 million births registered with union councils (UC) in 2025 are yet to be added to the record in the National Database and Registration Authority’s (Nadra) central database, according to an annual performance report.
The report was recently submitted by Nadra to the interior ministry, according to which a total of 227m individuals are registered with the authority.
Overall, nearly 97 per cent of Pakistan’s population is now included in the registration system, according to the report, which also shows that 52pc of the registered individuals are males and 48pc are females.
As for biometric data, Nadra’s system contains facial records of 170m people, iris data of seven million individuals and 1.68 billion fingerprints, the reports says.
During 2025 alone, the report states, some 445m biometric verifications were carried out, contributing to “improved transparency” and “strengthening of digital governance systems”.
According to the report, national registration increased by 4pc in 2025, registration of children under the age of 18 rose by 11pc, renewal of expired identity cards increased by 24pc and cancellation of identity cards following death registration surged by 900pc. Female registration also saw an 8pc rise during the year.
The reports says that by end of the year, 938 registration centres were operational nationwide. The authority established 75 new centres 138 new counters, while another 126 counters were installed at existing offices.
The reports say that 231 mobile registration vans remained active during the year, including 33 satellite-equipped units for remote areas.
At the UC level, 62 registration counters were operational while six new counters were set up in five countries abroad to facilitate overseas Pakistanis.
According to the report, the Pak Identity mobile application was used to handle 15pc of Nadra’s total workload. The app was downloaded more than 12m times, enabling citizens to access services without visiting registration centres.
In 2025, the federal government approved the National Registration and Biometric Policy Framework to further strengthen the unified registration system. Amendments to national identity card regulations were also introduced, biometric child registration certificates were launched for children as young as three, and family registration certificates were granted formal legal status.
According to the report, Pakistan’s identity registration system now has near-complete coverage, though efforts are still required to further improve the registration of women and young children in certain areas.
Clear policy recommendations have been proposed to close the remaining gaps entirely, the report says.</p><small>2026-02-20 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20213231be347a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974601/babar-moved-down-the-order-in-t20-world-cup-game-against-namibia-for-scoring-too-slowly-says-mike-hesson' target='_blank'><strong>Babar moved down the order in T20 World Cup game against Namibia for scoring too slowly, says Mike Hesson</strong></a><br><p>Batting great Babar Azam was moved down the batting order for Pakistan’s final T20 World Cup group game against Namibia for scoring too slowly, said head coach Mike Hesson on Friday.
Azam, who is the highest run-scorer in T20 international history with 4,571 runs, was moved down the order for the must-win game against Namibia as Pakistan racked up 199-3 and secured a place in the Super Eights by 102 runs.
The 2009 champions face New Zealand in Colombo on Saturday in the opening match of the second phase.
“I think Babar is well aware that his strike rate in the power play in the World Cup is less than 100 and that’s clearly not the role we think we need,” Hesson told reporters after Pakistan’s final practice session on Friday was washed out by rain.
Pakistan left out Azam for the same reason at last year’s Asia Cup and even after a dismal showing in the Big Bash League, he was still selected for the T20 World Cup.
“We brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup,” said Hesson.
“We’ve got plenty of other options who can come in and perform that role towards the end.
“Babar is actually the first to acknowledge that.
“He knows that he’s got a certain set of skills that the team requires and there are certain times where other players can perform that role more efficiently.”
Hesson also defended dropping pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi after he conceded 101 runs in three matches, including 31 in two overs against India.
“We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen, and he bowled incredibly well,” said Hesson.
“To be fair, he was probably really unlucky not to be playing the second and third games.” Hesson was wary of Pakistan’s opponents on Saturday.
“New Zealand have played a huge amount in the subcontinent in recent times, so we have to play at our best. “</p><small>2026-02-20 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/201945034e74ed2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974598/59-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-country-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.9-magnitude earthquake jolts parts of country: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 5.9-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of KP on Friday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said.
The earthquake struck at 6:09pm at a depth of 101 kilometres, with its epicentre located in the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, the department said.
According to DawnNewsTV, tremors were felt in Shangla, Swat, Mardan, Swabi and Nowshera.
In Shangla, tremors were felt at the time of Iftar, prompting people to rush out of their homes. No casualties or damages were reported from the district.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
Earlier this week, a 5.6-magnitude earthquake was recorded 86km northeast of Balochistan’s Khuzdar.
Last month, an earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of KP.
The same month, another 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.

The State Department said the US secretary thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for joining the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” as a founding member.
He also offered condolences over the Jan 31 attacks in Balochistan and the Feb 6 bombing in Islamabad and reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counter-terrorism.
The talks covered Pakistan’s participation in the recent Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington, with the United States welcoming Islamabad’s engagement and discussing cooperation in developing Pakistan’s energy and mineral resources, as well as commercial opportunities for American companies.
Separately, as per a press release issued by the Press Information Department (PID), during his meeting with Rubio, the premier congratulated him and US President Donald Trump on the “successful” inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to “work with the Board of Peace for the implementation of the Gaza peace plan”.
It added that during the meeting, “both sides underscored the importance of Pakistan-US strategic relations and expressed satisfaction over the momentum and positive trajectory of the partnership, under the leadership of President Trump”.
Both leaders also agreed to improve bilateral trade, economic activities, and mutual cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts, it further added.
During the meeting, the premier “emphasised the importance of continued high-level engagement between Pakistan and the US to advance common goals in a rapidly evolving global environment,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Rubio reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and for joining the board.
“In our meeting, we discussed the importance of our strategic relationship on critical minerals development and counterterrorism,” he further said.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar responded to Rubio’s post and thanked him. He said Pakistan valued its “longstanding relationship with the United States”.
The foreign minister added that the two diplomats had “meaningful discussions” on advancing peace, cooperation in fighting against terrorism, and expanding bilateral economic and trade ties.
“We look forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership in all areas of shared interest,” said Dar.







Shehbaz stresses need to end ceasefire violations in Gaza
Earlier, addressing the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 — Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving durable peace in the war-torn territory.
“The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” he said, adding that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions.
Praising Trump’s role, the prime minister said that through his “untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved” and that it would remain his legacy.
Under its charter, the US government serves as the board’s depository and the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace has been designated as its headquarters.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to help establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following the October ceasefire under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas. The truce, however, has remained fragile with repeated violations.
In his remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz also credited Trump with defusing the four-day Pakistan-India crisis in May 2025, saying his intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people” and describing him as “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”.
Speaking before the Pakistani leader, Trump recalled his contacts with both Islamabad and New Delhi during the conflict, saying he had warned the two countries that the United States would halt trade negotiations and could impose 200 per cent tariffs if the fighting continued.
“I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” he said, adding that the threat of economic consequences helped bring about a de-escalation.
Trump also referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and praised the Pakistani leader for publicly acknowledging his role in stopping the conflict.
The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots.
The Washington engagements underscored Pakistan’s effort to expand economic cooperation with the United States — particularly in the energy and minerals sectors — while aligning with a US-led diplomatic initiative on Gaza and highlighting Trump’s mediation role in South Asia.
PM Shehbaz meets global leaders
The prime minister also held informal meetings in Washington with global leaders who had arrived to attend the inaugural session of the Board of Peace, said a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The premier met with the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto.







The statement added that “important regional and global issues” were discussed during the meeting.
“Pakistan’s participation in the Board of Peace reflects its efforts toward establishing peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives, global peace, and the growing success of Pakistan’s diplomatic policy,” said the statement.
Separately, state-run APP reported that he also held a meeting with International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black on Friday.







An APP post on social media platform X said PM Shehbaz praised the corporation’s portfolio of over $1 billion and pointed to the synergies between the economic priorities of Pakistan and the US, which “present mutually beneficial opportunities to enhance B2B engagement”.
For his part, Black briefed the prime minister on the agency’s strategic initiatives, priorities and project pipeline in Pakistan, and showed interest in enhancing DFC’s footprint in Pakistan, the post said.</p><small>2026-02-20 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2016592893c6601.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974588/sc-stays-trial-of-pm-shehbazs-rs10bn-defamation-suit-against-imran' target='_blank'><strong>SC stays trial of PM Shehbaz’s Rs10bn defamation suit against Imran</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) stayed on Friday a trial by the court of an additional district judge in Lahore in a RS10 billion defamation suit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against PTI founder Imran Khan.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for the recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for the publication of defamatory content.
The defamation suit said Imran wrongly accused PM Shehbaz of offering Rs10bn to the latter through a common friend in exchange for withdrawing the Panama Papers case.
The PTI founder had contended in his reply that he had disclosed the alleged incident for the consumption of the public at large, and an act in the interest of the public good did not constitute any defamation. He maintained that he did not specifically attribute any statement to the PM Shehbaz while narrating the incident.
A three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Ayesha A Malik and including Justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, took up a set of review petitions filed by Imran in the case.
The court also issued a notice to the respondent as no one was present on behalf of PM Shehbaz and directed the court office to fix the case for a hearing at the earliest.
Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, who was representing Imran, argued before the SC that his client could not appear before the trial court as he was injured after being shot in the leg, referring to an assassination attempt on the former premier in November 2022.
Zafar said the trial court had closed the right to defend despite previously acknowledging the PTI founder’s injury.
Now, a trial court has commenced recording evidence and testimonies of witnesses in the case, the counsel said.
At that, Justice Malik wondered how the trial court had “terminated the right to defence” after acknowledging that Imran had been injured.
Subsequently, the SC issued a notice to the respondent and directed the court office fix the review petitions for hearing at the earliest.
Imran had filed review petitions in the case after the trial court had close the right to defence — a decision that was upheld by the Lahore High Court (LHC) and endorsed by the SC on February 21, 2023.
The trial court, through its order on October 20, 2022, had dismissed Imran’s objections in the case over the rejection of PM Shehbaz’s interrogatories — a set of written questions served by one party to the other — and directed the PTI founder to submit his answers.
Later, through a subsequent order of November 24, 2022, the trial court struck off the right of defence due to the non-submission of answers to the interrogatories.
Previously, the SC had held in a 2-1 majority judgment in the case that Imran had been “wilfully contumacious and disobedient” throughout the trial court proceedings and that the trial court had not committed any “illegality or material irregularity” in the exercise of its jurisdiction through its orders of closing the right to defend.
The LHC had also rightly declined to interfere in its revisional jurisdiction, former judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had observed at the time in the judgement authored by him.
He had made these observations as the court heard an appeal moved by Imran challenging the December 7, 2022 LHC order of upholding the sessions court’s closure of Imran’s right to defend.
Justice Malik, who was also a member of that bench, had dissented from the majority judgement. She had held that in a case plagued by adjournments since 2017, the court must weigh the balance between a fair trial and the legitimate grounds for the request for adjournment.
She had observed that Imran’s public shooting and subsequent injury at a political rally justified the grant of an adjournment for a reasonable time under the circumstances, adding that the right to defence could not be struck off without considering all relevant factors.
Justice Malik had further stated that the trial court’s order sheet showed it had proceeded in a “mechanical manner” and granted numerous adjournments without so much as imposing costs so as to discourage the same.
“No doubt the courts are overburdened with work, and judges are faced with the daunting task of handling a vast number of cases every day; nevertheless, it is the court’s responsibility to manage each case before it diligently by applying the provisions of the procedural law,” she had observed.
She added that the striking off of the petitioner’s right to defence at that stage, while ignoring the legitimate factors in play, would be a “gross injustice”.
The balancing act of justice must be upheld, and under these circumstances, the right to a fair defence must prevail, Justice Malik had observed while setting aside the trial court order and remanding the matter again to the trial court to grant a reasonable opportunity to the petitioner to file answers to the interrogatories.
On the other hand, Justice Shah had observed that Imran’s conduct disentitled him from the indulgence of this court in its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 185(3) of the Constitution.
He added that his appeal was without substance on merits.
He had observed that interrogatories served as a useful tool to shorten litigation and reduce expenses. However, he added that the process of interrogatories had unfortunately been “abused in the present case and, in fact, misused to prolong the trial”.
The former SC judge had said that such “abuse of the process of interrogatories has to be curbed with a heavy hand”.
The fair use of the process of interrogatories should be encouraged, for it would result in saving considerable time and money, and would thus be beneficial to the parties of the case as well as to the administration of justice in general, Justice Shah had observed.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20193200938324e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974595/pakistan-to-tour-bangladesh-next-month-for-a-3-match-odi-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to tour Bangladesh next month for a 3-match ODI series</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday that the Green Shirts would tour Bangladesh in March for a three-match One Day International (ODI) series.
In a press release, the PCB said, “Pakistan men’s cricket team will tour Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series, the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed on Friday.”
It said that the team would arrive in Bangladesh on March 9 and hold a training session the next day, ahead of the opening ODI against the hosts on March 11.







The board added that the second ODI would be played on March 13, while the third and final match was scheduled for March 15.
It added that all three matches would be played at the Shere Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.
“This will be Pakistan’s second tour of Bangladesh since July 2025. Pakistan last toured Bangladesh for a three-match T20I series in July, which the hosts won 2-1. Meanwhile, Bangladesh toured Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in May/June last year, which the Salman Ali Agha-led side won 3-0,” the PCB said.
The development comes after Pakistan announced it would boycott the match against India during the ongoing T20 World Cup. The decision came after Bangladesh’s request to shift its matches out of India was rejected amid tensions between the two countries, which led to the team being replaced by Scotland in the tournament.
The situation ultimately led to a delegation from the International Cricket Council visiting Pakistan, after which it was announced that Pakistan would play the match against India.
However, the ICC also announced that Bangladesh would not face any penalty for opting out of the tournament and would also host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20185025b89313b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974592/pti-assails-pm-shehbaz-for-attending-bop-meeting-reiterates-objection-to-joining-without-consultation' target='_blank'><strong>PTI assails PM Shehbaz for attending BoP meeting, reiterates objection to joining without consultation</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Friday criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for attending the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, and reiterating its objection to Pakistan joining the board without consultation.
The Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 and originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza — held its inaugural meeting on February 19, attended by several world leaders, including PM Shehbaz.
In a statement posted on X, the party said it once again expressed “grave concern over the government of Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace without transparency, parliamentary debate, or consultation with major political stakeholders of the country”.
“Decisions of such international significance must be rooted in constitutional procedure, democratic oversight and national consensus,” it said.







The party maintained that it did not recognise the legitimacy of the present Parliament, formed after the “manipulated 2024 elections”.
“Nevertheless, even this Parliament was bypassed in this decision-making process, further eroding democratic norms and public trust,” it said.
Drawing a contrast with former premier Imran Khan, the party said that he had “been among the most steadfast and vocal supporters of Palestinian rights on the global stage”.
“His position on Palestine has always been clear and uncompromising,” it added. The party said that it stood “firmly with the Palestinian people and categorically rejects any plan imposed without their consent”.
It reiterated its unwavering support for a just and lasting resolution through an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and long-standing PTI policy.
It said that Pakistan’s role in global peace initiatives must strengthen the United Nations framework rather than promote “parallel arrangements that weaken international law and accountability”.
“Any initiative that claims to advance peace while excluding the very people under occupation contradicts the fundamental principles of justice and self-determination that PTI has always stood for,” the party said.
It also called into question the credibility of the Board of Peace, saying: “Palestinians remain excluded from the process while Israel continues to be included, even as violence persists in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.”
The opposition party stressed that “a peace mechanism without Palestinian representation can only be termed as control”.
The party strongly criticised PM Shehbaz for attending the inaugural meeting and for “making statements that compromise Pakistan’s dignity, independent foreign policy and historically principled stance on oppressed peoples”.
The government’s decision to join the board, first announced last month, was criticised by political parties, including the PTI, and analysts. The government had defended the move in Parliament, with PM Shehbaz later saying that Pakistan had joined after the federal cabinet gave the go-ahead.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20184441f5ff12b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974590/punjab-issues-list-of-proscribed-organisations-warns-citizens-against-giving-charity-to-these-entities' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab issues list of proscribed organisations, warns citizens against giving charity to these entities</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab home department on Friday issued a list of 89 proscribed organisations and unregistered charitable institutions, warning citizens that giving charity to these entities would be treated as a crime under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Patel confirmed that the owner-cum-builder Mohammed Irshad had been arrested after the registration of a first information report (FIR). He said the held suspect had rented out the building to the victims.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Khalid Mehmood at the Soldier Bazar police station under sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 288 (negligent conduct with building), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 337-A (punishment of shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, police received information on early Thursday morning about the collapse of a building in Gul Rana Colony, in which several people were killed and injured.
Upon reaching the spot, the complainant said that one portion of the structure had completely collapsed. He said that the building, spread over 40 square yards, had been constructed using heavy-duty steel channels and nylon sheets. He further said that the building was a ground plus three-storey structure.
The sub-inspector said that a man named Shahid Rasool lived on the first floor with his family. He said that at around 3:30am, Rasool’s wife lit a match to prepare Sehr, adding that the room was already full of gas due to a leakage.
This led to the explosion, which caused the whole building to collapse, he said. The complainant further said that the rescue officials recovered at least 15 dead bodies from the rubble, while 15 others were injured in the incident.
The official stated that the owner of the building had constructed the structure “illegally” in approximately 2007/2008. He said that the gas connection was also provided “illegally through pipes installed in a haphazard and unsafe manner, leading to the unfortunate incident.
According to the FIR, the suspect committed negligence by installing substandard gas lines in an “illegally” constructed building.
The complainant further said that the Bomb Disposal Unit had examined the destroyed building and submitted their report. He said that according to the unit, the gas leakage occurred because of substandard gas pipelines, which led to a gas leak and ultimately triggered an explosion when a match was lit.</p><small>2026-02-20 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20145948aca1e3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974582/policy-efforts-taken-by-pakistan-under-eff-helped-stabilise-economy-rebuild-confidence-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Policy efforts taken by Pakistan under EFF helped ‘stabilise economy, rebuild confidence’: IMF</strong></a><br><p>Policy efforts undertaken by Pakistan under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) “helped stabilise the economy and rebuild confidence,” the lending agency’s spokesperson said on Thursday.
IMF Communications Director Julie Kozack made the statement during a weekly press briefing.
In response to a question regarding Pakistan’s progress in meeting terms set by the Fund, Kozack said, “Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF have helped stabilise the economy and rebuild confidence.”
She further said that fiscal performance had been “strong”. Kozack said that Pakistan currently had a primary fiscal surplus of 1.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), which was “in line with programme targets”.
“Headline inflation has been relatively contained. And Pakistan posted its first current account surplus in 14 years in FY25,” Kozack added.
She also said that an IMF staff team was expected to visit Pakistan starting February 25 for discussions on the third review under the EFF and the second review under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Kozack also highlighted the IMF’s recent Governance and Corruption Diagnostic report, which she said “includes proposals for reforms, including simplifying tax policy design, levelling the playing field for public procurement, and improving the asset declaration transparency”.
It is worth mentioning that an IMF mission led by Iva Petrova is due to visit Pakistan later this month to review the implementation of the $7 billion EFF and the $1.1bn RSF facilities.
During the almost two-week visit ending March 11, the engagements would be of greater significance as both sides would also discuss budget proposals based on performance this year and set broad contours of the upcoming budget (for the fiscal year 2026-27), particularly those relating to provincial finances.
The programme’s performance as of end-Dece­mber 2025 — the period for review — has mostly been up to the mark, alb­eit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities bel­i­eve could be reduced following a recent super tax ruling by the Federal Cons­t­ituti­onal Court that went in the government’s favour.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
The EFF is a longer-term IMF loan programme designed to help countries address deep-seated economic weaknesses and medium-term balance-of-payments problems.</p><small>2026-02-20 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/201445500680854.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974580/ppps-raza-rabbani-calls-for-placing-pact-with-us-for-redeveloping-roosevelt-hotel-before-parliament' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Raza Rabbani calls for placing pact with US for redeveloping Roosevelt Hotel before Parliament</strong></a><br><p>PPP stalwart and former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani on Friday said that the deal inked with the United States to redevelop the Roosevelt Hotel in New York “must be placed” in Parliament.
In a press release, Rabbani said, “The strategic economic initiative, including collaboration with the US General Services Administration, regarding the operation, maintenance, renovation and redevelopment of the Roosevelt Hotel has been signed without taking the people into confidence.”
Rabbani said the hotel was “prime property” in New York and dealings pertaining to it must be transparent.
“Parliament should have been taken into confidence before signing such memoranda of understanding (MoUs),” he said.
He further highlighted that earlier, a deal with the US relating to minerals in Balochistan was “broken by international media”.
“Till date, the details of this deal have not been made public,” he said. Rabbani further said that the PPP should move a private members’ bill, wherein all foreign agreements, once signed, would need ratification in Parliament.
“I had moved such a bill when in the Senate,” he said.
The remarks come a day after Pakistan and the US signed an MoU to launch a structured framework for cooperation on the future of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, marking a key development in Islamabad’s efforts to secure maximum value for the landmark property under its privatisation strategy.
According to the finance ministry, the agreement was finalised in Washington and executed by US General Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Edward C. Forst and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff witnessed the signing.
“It establishes a structured, time-bound framework for joint evaluation of the technical, commercial, and economic parameters of cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to transparent, disciplined, and mutually beneficial progress,” the ministry said.







The statement noted the Roosevelt Hotel’s prime location in Manhattan and the complexity of New York zoning and municipal process, saying the “institutional coordination aims to reduce execution risk, enhance regulatory clarity, and maximise transaction value”.
“Such facilitative frameworks are consistent with international practice in cross-border real estate and infrastructure projects,” it added.
“The objective remains to secure maximum value for this property in alignment with the government’s privatisation strategy while strengthening Pakistan-United States economic ties,” the statement concluded.
Named after former US president Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.</p><small>2026-02-20 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20153716651eaff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974579/interim-phf-president-lifts-ban-on-hockey-team-captain-amid-pro-league-controversy' target='_blank'><strong>Interim PHF president lifts ban on hockey team captain amid Pro League controversy</strong></a><br><p>The newly appointed interim president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani, announced the lifting of the ban on the national team captain, Ammad Shakeel Butt, state-run APP reported on Friday.
On Thursday, former president Tariq Hussain Bugti imposed a two-year ban on national captain Butt, citing findings of a committee regarding alleged misconduct. He also announced his resignation amid controversy over the national team’s tour of Australia for the FIH Pro League.
In a statement issued today, the interim president lifted the ban, stressing that “transparency and fairness would guide all decisions under his tenure,” APP quoted him as saying.
Wani, who was the Secretary of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC), also vowed to “revive and strengthen the country’s national game”.
He gave assurances to the stakeholders that a comprehensive plan would be developed, “aimed at stabilising the federation, rebuilding trust and revamping team management to restore Pakistan’s lost glory in international hockey”.
“As the newly appointed ad-hoc president of PHF, I assure stakeholders of our commitment to revive and strengthen hockey in Pakistan,” APP quoted him as saying.
He added that “immediate steps” were underway to resolve “organisational and administrative issues”.
Wani elaborated that the “short-term” focus of the federation would be to stabilise its affairs, and the medium-term plan involved “developing a clear strategic vision, enhancing coaching and training structures and fostering institutional coordination among relevant bodies”.
The interim president also shared plans that the federation aims to partner with the private sector to ensure improved support to the players.
“Our players should focus on training and matches, while we handle the rest,” he was quoted as saying.
He assured that “welfare and performance would remain at the centre of reforms”.
Additionally, he announced elections for a new PHF leadership and expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for “reposing trust in him” as the interim head, as per APP.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz appointed Wani as ad-hoc president of the federation, following the resignation of his predecessor.
The developments came amid controversy over the national team’s tour of Australia, where accommodation arrangements could not be secured on time, forcing players to spend several hours on the road.
The team’s overall performance in the Pro League also came under criticism.
However, shortly after Bugti’s resignation, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi met the hockey players, including Ammad Butt and Hanan Shahid.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, when asked about the reported two-year ban, Butt said Naqvi told him there was no ban and that the same team that toured Australia would travel to Egypt.
The ban had reportedly been imposed under the PHF constitution, raising questions over the process for its reversal.</p><small>2026-02-20 09:44</small></div><hr>
