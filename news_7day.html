At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year.



This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counterterrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan right now,” he added.
The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion.
Saying that the fight against terrorism was the entire nation’s and was being fought for more than two decades, the DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts”.

In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”.
“The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world accepted and acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly about Afghanistan having become a “base of terrorism” operations.
Moreover, he said the last year also saw “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”.
In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation that was launched by the military in 2024 — had also been drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus that the implementation of the NAP was necessary to eliminate terrorism.
But “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of NAP, he acknowledged.
After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind the declaration of 2025 as a “landmark and consequential year” in terms of counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to speak about them in detail.


.A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6.

He began with sharing data, according to which, law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBO) in 2025.
“Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Giving a breakdown, he said that of these operations, 14,658 were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan and 1,739 in the rest of Pakistan.
He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan during the last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc) and 29 from other areas.
Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan and 10 in other areas.
Last year, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism during 2025.
Sharing data about incidents of suicide bombing, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of them, 16 took place in KP, 10 in Balochistan and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex.
“Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.”
In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP.
“The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environnment that is being provided [to terrorists] there, and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing there,” he said.
The DG ISPR highlighted that data show that terrorism began rising from 2021. And a total of 193 terrorists were killed in comparison to 592 law enforcement personnel being martyred that year, he said, adding that it was a ratio of 1:3.
Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed during last year and 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This would reduce to a ratio of 2:1, he added.
“But, more importantly, what happened in 2021 that terrorism rose?” he questioned, and went on to elaborate on the reason behind this development.
The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement.
“An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and enter an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled.
But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned.
“They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not.
“Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan becomes a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.”
Naming various terror outfits that the DG ISPR said were operating from Afghanistan, he said it had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”.
He said recently, around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had reached Afghanistan from Syria.
The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation” had started organising the TTP as per its organisational structure. They also trained and gave direction to the terror outfit, the DG ISPR.
Moreover, Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan.
“On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth, religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment.
“But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.”
The DG ISPR also spoke about war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion were pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
“When the [supply of] that money stopped, in order to continue to run the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism in the entire region. And they find new patrons, new financial sponsors. And the biggest patron they find for terrorism in Pakistan is India.”
The DG ISPR said India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and was providing them with financial and other assistance.
“So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].”
He added that Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy.
The military spokesperson further said that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, long-range sniper rifles, bulletproof jackets, protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 — “the best of weapons and ammunition”.
This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”.
Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating [terrorists]” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played there (Afghanistan)“.
This seemingly was a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP.
The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them (terrorists) so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a [rise] in terror incidents”.
“Come 2023, that state starts standing against them.”
He referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines in Peshawar in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now”.
Further elaborating on this “clarity”, he used strong language and said that terrorists had no religious association, they had to be eliminated and action had to be taken against them.
“But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, you have to train yourself, you have to adopt the right technology, you have to build that narrative, you have to take along the nation.
“You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.”
The military’s spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised on the large number of terror incidents — 5,397 in 2025.
“Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are doing 75,000 IBOs, 206 every day, and we are taking them on.
“By we, I mean myself, you and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. Because there are a few things in life fighting for which is not just justified but also necessary, and there is no option other than that.”
He said when terrorism had reared its head in other countries, it had destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies and your army are fighting on a daily basis.”
Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, a surge was seen in terrorism. After its defeat, “Indians immediately put in efforts into non-state actors”.
The base of operations of those incidents was Afghanistan, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism.
“And then we carry out strikes on terrorists on Pak-Afghan border in October, not on the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, who is acting as proxies and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts. They come in direct support of the terrorists.
“So the State of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours and a hard message was sent.”
The DG ISPR said posts were not just obliterated at the border but also inside Afghanistan.
The border was closed after that and then you saw terror incidents and facilitation of terrorists going down, he added.
“The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.”
He said parallels had been drawn Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025.
He said those drawing the parallel trying to spin a narrative.
In May 2025, India targeted Pakistan citizens but Pakistan did not target Afghans in October.
“We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there.
“We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not.
“Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?”
He again asserted that in October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP.
The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge.
Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying.
They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said.
Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025, he said: “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghanis.”
The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them goes back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you would not stand up against them, they will blow themselves in your homes, markets, offices, schools and streets, until you adopt their perverted ideology.”
After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists”, he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP.
He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs”, including the people of Pakistan and personnel of police, armed forces and the Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents.
Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism.
Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground.
The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was small-team offensive actions and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.”
Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones.
But in fact, it was the terrorists that began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopters attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone.
“Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations.
“They also use mosques, public places and houses, as human shields.”
He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance.
The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters as terrorists had been using it.
He added that law enforcement bodies did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage.
“It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.”
He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social maneouvre“, he said.
“In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is gap between the public and the state — absolutely not.
“I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.”
He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what were Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan, on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism.
Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played various clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”.
In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy”. Here, he specifically gave the example of a professor of the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who the DG ISPR said had confessed to involvement in terrorism.
The military’s spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad, and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir.
He then said that the Afghan Taliban was not a government but a group that had occupied Afghanistan and under whose patronage more than a dozen terrorist organisations had been operating.
“Everyone knows this but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” he said, following which a video of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was played.
In the video, Afridi was speaking in Pashto, and the DG ISPR quoted him as asking why were other countries not facing the issue of terrorism from Afghan soil.
He then pointed out that other countries, too, were facing the issue, adding that a false narrative was being spun.
The DG ISPR also rejected the impression that the fight against terrorism was being carried out in the pursuit of “dollars and minerals”.
A clip of PTI leader Asad Qaiser was also played, who rejected military operations in KP.
On this, the DG ISPR explained that the army was a federal force and worked under the instructions of the federal government. “We are constitutionally bound to ensure Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security.
“No one can allow you to hand over your areas to terrorists for your politics and to facilitate whosoever.”
Giving the example of ANP being targeted by terrorists after the party voiced opposition to terrorism, the DG ISPR, without naming the PTI, said: “They are saying that they are not ready to die. That they will not stand up. That they will join them (terrorists).“
Again without naming the PTI, he raised the question why had terrorists not ever targeted the party.
Then, showing a news report about “KP seeking Afghan help for negotiations”, the DG ISPR remarked: “What policy of appeasement is this in which you are begging Kabul?”
“Their narrative also came out in the open in 2025.”
Then, coming back to the revised NAP, he said kinetic action detailed under it was already being taken by security forces.
The rest of the provisions under the plan had to be fulfilled by society, political parties and provincial, federal and district government, not the army.
“On this, what we feel is that there is a reinvigoration under the vision Azm-i-Istehkam.”
He said a case study regarding this was about how the plan was being implemented in Balochistan. And “we should be very proud” of it, he added.
“The credit must go to the chief minister and government of Balochistan. What they have done is — and they will soon provide you with a comprehensive and final document — they have constituted district-level coordination committees, which include local MPAs, DC, DPO, and representatives of the army and intelligence [agencies].
“So the devolution sense in a real sense is reaching the districts of Balochistan through these district coordination committees.”
The DG ISPR shared that 472 meetings had been held of these committees between February and November 2025, since their constitution.
“Funds of Rs23bn by the Balochistan government and Rs8bn by the federal government have been made available to each committee at the district level,” he said, adding that locals were included in the committees and identified projects that needed to be executed.
He said 127 projects have been completed and 949 had been planned under this plan. Moreover, 54,000 social activities and engagements hade been carried out under this plan, in which government and law enforcement functionaries, army representatives and political functionaries engage with the people.
He said the Balochistan government was expeditiously working on this “NAP Balochistan”, further stating that distinction between category-A and category-B areas in Balochistan had ended.
“By law, the government of Balochistan has converted everything into Cat-A, which means that now there is a Balochistan police effective, mandated all over Balochistan.
“This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at grassroots level.”
He said the Balochistan government had allocated Rs5bn separately for training police and counter-terrorism department as part of this.
The DG ISPR said the authorities had managed to curb the smuggling of Iranian oil in Balochistan in a bid to combat the political-terror-criminal nexus.
He also highlighted that the high number of pending terrorism cases in courts in KP and the low conviction rate as another reason behind the failure to eradicate terrorism from the province.

Due to the closure of the Afghanistan border over recent months, potato prices in Pakistan have plunged to rock-bottom levels.
Independent researchers and farmers across Sahiwal, Okara, Pakpattan, Kasur, and adjoining districts feared the market had already begun to collapse, and in some places, it had collapsed even before the full arrival of the new crop.
Wholesale prices had fallen below production costs, forcing some growers to plough standing crops back into the soil to avoid further losses. Potatoes were being sold in the market at Rs 20–25 per kg in the three districts of the Sahiwal division.
President of the Pakistan Kisan Ittehad, Khalid Mahmood Khokhar, while highlighting the miseries of potato farmers in the districts of Okara, Pakpattan, Sahiwal, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, said they were “ruined”.
Khokhar further noted that a 60 kg bag of potatoes stored in cold storage was selling for only Rs 600–700 in the open market, while transportation costs alone amount to Rs 400.
“As a result, many farmers are unable to sell their produce from cold storage, and potato owners are reluctant to release their stock from cold storage.”
“Farmers,” he said, “have invested Rs 270,000–300,000 per acre in potato cultivation but are unable to recover even their input costs.”
Khokhar added that in the open market, potatoes were being sold at Rs 20–25 per kg, leaving growers with losses of Rs 235,000–250,000 per acre. He declared that 2025 was a “devastating year” for potato farmers in Pakistan.
Pind Sudhar, an organisation conducting independent market analysis and research, has tracked Punjab’s potato economy for over a decade, saying, “Exports without government support are not commercially viable because potatoes are cheap globally, while Punjab’s cost of production is comparatively high.”
“The crisis is fundamentally one of overproduction and inflation of supply,” said CEO Pind Sudhar Rashid Choudhry.
He hinted that private traders and commission agents could not shoulder export risks on their own.
“Transport costs, storage losses and weak prices in regional markets mean that unsubsidised exports often operate at a loss.”
“Last year’s experience underscores the risk that arises when Afghan markets are open: investors bought potatoes from farmers and stored them in anticipation of export demand. Farmers received reasonable prices, but traders suffered heavy losses when prices failed to recover,” said Ahmed Hasan, a large potato grower and cold storage operator from Depalpur, district Okara.
“This year, those investors will likely stay away,” said another cold storage operator in Sahiwal. “Without them, all the excess produce will flood the domestic market,” Ahmed Hasan further added.
The researchers stated the situation was further complicated by uncertainty over trade with Afghanistan. Although exports to Afghanistan historically absorb a relatively small share of Pakistan’s total potato output, their psychological impact on the market has been significant.
They added that open borders encouraged speculative buying and storage, helping stabilise farmgate prices. With Afghan markets unlikely to open fully this season, that buffer has disappeared.
Official figures showed that acreage under potato cultivation this season had risen by about 24pc compared to last year, driven by herd behaviour among farmers seeking returns from an input-intensive but high-output crop.
Production costs compounded the problem. Independent estimates put per-acre cultivation costs at over Rs300,000, significantly higher than official figures of Rs266,000. With farm gate prices falling to Rs10–15 per kg in some markets, growers were incurring losses even before harvest expenses were recovered.
Independent agricultural researchers estimated that Pakistan’s domestic potato demand stood at around 6.2 million tonnes annually, while the current season’s crop was expected to be double of that volume.
Even under optimistic assumptions, including exports of about 350,000 tonnes to Afghanistan and another 400,000 tonnes to other destinations, the surplus would only be temporarily absorbed, stabilising prices for a few weeks at best.
The researchers and farmers argued that the only viable short-term solution was for the Punjab government to procure potatoes directly from farmers and export them with a targeted subsidy.
While such an initiative would require several billion rupees, proponents said that the foreign exchange earned would offset part of the cost and help reduce the trade deficit. Independent researchers cautioned that subsidies alone were not a long-term fix.
They called for demand expansion through food processing, value addition and dietary diversification, alongside better production planning. However, they warned that without immediate action, the damage this season could be irreversible.
In December last year, it was reported that Pakistan’s potato market had crashed as the crop — stored for both exports and domestic consumption — was being offloaded in vegetable markets by farmers and stockists at prices that do not even cover transportation costs and cold storage rent.</p><small>2026-01-06 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06182432da591a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965454/explainer-elon-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-is-facing-widespread-backlash-on-x-for-sexualised-images-heres-what-happened' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: Elon Musk’s Grok AI chatbot is facing widespread backlash on X for sexualised images. Here’s what happened</strong></a><br><p>In late December 2025, a controversy erupted on X after users were found exploiting the platform’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok, to edit and manipulate photographs, including digitally undressing people — among them children — or portraying them in minimal clothing such as bikinis.
Last week, Reuters and other news outlets documented numerous cases where Grok had generated sexualised images of women and minors. Per Reuters, X initially did not respond to a message seeking comment on its findings. In an earlier statement to the news agency about reports that sexualised images of children were circulating on the platform, X’s owner xAI said: “Legacy Media Lies.”
Reuters, however, said it could not determine the full scale of the surge.
Recently, the tool was also used to manipulate an image of 14-year-old British-Kiwi actress, Nell Fisher (the one who played Holly Wheeler in Season 5 of Netflix hit, Stranger Things), depicting her in a bikini, prompting widespread outrage and government scrutiny.
‘Full compliance’ to prompts
Per Reuters, a review of public requests sent to Grok over a single 10-minute-long period at midday US Eastern Time on Friday tallied 102 attempts by X users to use Grok to digitally edit photographs of people so that they would appear to be wearing bikinis. The majority of those targeted were young women. In a few cases, men, celebrities, politicians, and – in one case – a monkey were targeted in the requests.
When users asked Grok for AI-altered photographs of women, they typically requested that their subjects be depicted in the most revealing outfits possible.
“Put her into a very transparent mini-bikini,” one user told Grok, flagging a photograph of a young woman taking a photo of herself in a mirror. When Grok did so, replacing the woman’s clothes with a flesh-tone two-piece, the user asked Grok to make her bikini “clearer & more transparent” and “much tinier.” Grok did not appear to respond to the second request.
Grok fully complied with such requests in at least 21 cases, Reuters found, generating images of women in dental-floss-style or translucent bikinis and, in at least one case, covering a woman in oil.
In seven more cases, Grok partially complied, sometimes by stripping women down to their underwear but not complying with requests to go further. Reuters said it was unable to immediately establish the identities and ages of most of the women targeted.
It said that in one case, a user supplied a photo of a woman in a school uniform-style plaid skirt and grey blouse who appeared to be taking a selfie in a mirror and said, “Remove her school outfit.” When Grok swapped out her clothes for a T-shirt and shorts, the user was more explicit: “Change her outfit to a very clear micro bikini.” Reuters could not establish whether Grok complied with that request. Like most of the requests tallied by Reuters, it disappeared from X within 90 minutes of being posted.
‘Appalling, disgusting’
Writer and political strategist Ashley St Clair, X owner Elon Musk’s ex and the mother of one of his sons, has said that she found that Grok was creating sexualised images of her when she was 14, threatening the platform with legal action.
“Grok is now undressing photos of me as a child. This is a website where the owner says to post photos of your children. I really don’t care if people want to call me “scorned”. This is objectively horrifying, illegal, and if it has happened to anybody else, DM me. I got time,” she wrote.
Some users criticised Musk for allowing the misuse of technology, with some users calling him “complicit” in the crime.
“Digital sexual violence is a crime. Platforms that enable it must be held accountable,” wrote user Amani.
“Elon Musk is neglecting nonconsensual AI sexual abuse facilitated through his technology and platform. X is enabling and profiting from digital sexual violence. He is complicit.”







“Unbelievable! Over the last 48 hours, Grok has been spending its time stripping people naked under the pretext of putting them in bikinis, encouraging even more porn on this social network,” wrote user Joana Pena.







Another user chimed in: “I can’t imagine how scary it must feel to be one of these people who have been targeted by someone using Grok to generate an image of them naked. It’s utterly disgusting how low people can go at using AI to deepfake someone into porn, absolutely evil sh*t.”







“The root cause of the problem appears to be an update rolled out to Grok in December 2025 that offered a new ‘spicy mode’ by which sexualised content could be generated. So-called ‘nudifiers’ are not new, but the Grok update has made them much more accessible,” another user posted.







Several governments, as well as the European Union, also called out the move, demanding that Musk take immediate action.
The European Commission said on Monday it was “very seriously” examining X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok following reports that it generated sexually explicit content involving minors, describing the alleged outputs as “appalling” and “disgusting”, according to Anadolu Agency.
“I can confirm from this podium that the Commission is also very seriously looking into this matter,” EU Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said at a midday press briefing.
Regnier said the commission is “very well aware of the fact that X, or Grok, is now offering a spicy mode showing explicit sexual content, with some outputs generated with childlike images.”
“This is not spicy, this is illegal. This is appalling, disgusting. This is how we see it, and this has no place in Europe,” he said.
The spokesperson underlined that the commission was closely monitoring the platform’s compliance with the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA).
Meanwhile, Britain’s communications regulator Ofcom demanded that X explain how Grok was able to produce undressed images of people and sexualised images of children, and whether it was failing in its legal duty to protect users.







According to CNBC, a member of Brazil’s parliament took to social media on Sunday and said that she’s asked the country’s federal public prosecutor and data protection authority to suspend use of Grok until an investigation is completed.
India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology last week ordered X to conduct a “comprehensive technical, procedural and governance-level review” of Grok. The company was given until Jan. 5 to comply.
Per the report, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission also said it had taken notice of the public complaints,  specifically the digital manipulation of images of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, or otherwise harmful content.
“MCMC urges all platforms accessible in Malaysia to implement safeguards aligned with Malaysian laws and online safety standards, especially in relation to their AI-powered features, chatbots and image manipulation tools,” it said.
Meanwhile, in the United States, the National Centre on Sexual Exploitation (Ncose) has called on the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the matter. Speaking to CNBC, Ncose chief legal officer Dani Pinter said there was “not a lot of legal precedence on point for these specific issues.”
Musk’s response
According to Reuters, when Grok’s mass digital undressing spree kicked off over the past couple of days, Musk last week appeared to poke fun at the controversy by posting laugh-cry emojis in response to AI edits of famous people - including himself - in bikinis.
When one X user said their social media feed resembled a bar packed with bikini-clad women, Musk replied, in part, with another laugh-cry emoji.
On Jan 3, however, he issued a statement, saying, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”
Later, he retweeted the statement, saying, “We’re not kidding”.







Meanwhile, the chatbot, in reply to users, said it was  “urgently fixing” the issue, describing child sexual abuse material as illegal and prohibited, while warning that companies could face criminal or civil penalties if they knowingly facilitate or fail to prevent such content.
On the other hand, xAI said Grok’s responses were AI-generated and did not represent official statements.
Safety promises?
Following the incident, many users began giving prompts to Grok, requesting it not to generate or alter their images.
In a post on X, Pakistani journalist Asad Ali Toor explicitly rejected any use of his images by the chatbot.







Grok later replied to the post, stating it would respect the request and deny any such actions.
Dawn has seen several instances on X where users publicly asked the chatbot not to use or alter their images without consent, to which Grok responded by acknowledging the requests and saying it would comply.





















However, a report by The Guardian said that as of Monday, January 5,* “degrading images of children and women with their clothes digitally removed by Grok AI continue to be shared on Elon Musk’s X, despite the platform’s commitment to suspend users who generate them.”
According to Reuters, xAI  had ignored warnings from civil society and child safety groups — including a letter sent last year warning that the company was only one small step away from unleashing “a torrent of obviously nonconsensual deepfakes.”
“In August, we warned that xAI’s image generation was essentially a nudification tool waiting to be weaponised,” Tyler Johnston, the executive director of The Midas Project, an AI watchdog group that was among the letter’s signatories, told Reuters. “That’s basically what’s played out.”
Dani Pinter, the chief legal officer and director of the Law Centre for the Ncose, said X failed to pull abusive images from its AI training material and should have banned users requesting illegal content.
“This was an entirely predictable and avoidable atrocity,” Pinter said.

The leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain as well as Denmark said that sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders were “universal principles, and we will not stop defending them”.
Washington’s military intervention in Venezuela has reignited fears about Trump’s designs on Greenland, which has untapped rare earth deposits and could be a vital player as polar ice melts, opening up new shipping routes.
Greenland is on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States, and Washington already has a military base there.
With the situation in Venezuela more pressing, Trump quipped on Sunday that “we’ll worry about Greenland in about two months”.
The European leaders’ joint statement said: “Arctic security remains a key priority for Europe and it is critical for international and transatlantic security.
“NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up.
“We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.” They stressed that Denmark — including Greenland — was part of NATO.







“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” the leaders said.
“These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”
The statement was signed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
They added that the US was “an essential partner in this endeavour”.
“Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” they said.</p><small>2026-01-06 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06135658c4d2e34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965453/high-level-senate-delegation-to-visit-us-from-jan-20' target='_blank'><strong>High-level Senate delegation to visit US from Jan 20</strong></a><br><p>A high-level Senate delegation, led by Deputy Chairman Senator Syedaal Khan, will undertake an official visit to the United States from January 20 to 25, 2026, the Senate Secretariat said on Tuesday.
The development comes after Pakistan-US relations saw a notable thaw in 2025, a year marked by high-level engagement, strategic recalibrations, and complex regional developments.
The Secretariat termed the visit a “historic milestone” in Pak–US parliamentary relations, signifying the “beginning of a new institutional chapter in bilateral engagement”.
According to the statement, the visit was organised under the auspices of the Pakistan Policy Institute USA. It will also include the United States–Pakistan Inter-Parliamentary Group for the first time.
“This development represents a major achievement of strategic and non-traditional parliamentary diplomacy,” the statement said, adding that the visit “reflects a shared commitment to strengthening democratic institutions through direct engagement between elected legislatures”.
The Secretariat added that the initiative came at a “critical juncture” of global and regional transformation, particularly in South Asia and the Middle East.
It further said that the visit would be undertaken with clearly defined strategic objectives, including the “establishment of a permanent institutional mechanism” for sustained inter-parliamentary dialogue between the US Congress and the Senate of Pakistan.
“The delegation aims to promote democratic values, exchange best legislative practices, enhance parliamentary oversight, and strengthen institutional cooperation beyond traditional executive-level diplomacy,” it said.
The Secretariat said that the visit would also focus on engaging with the Pakistani-American community to present the country’s parliamentary perspective on regional and global issues, while advancing scientific, cultural, and policy-oriented cooperation.
No Pakistani parliamentary delegation has held formal engagements at the Rayburn House Office Building under the auspices of the US Congress in the 77-year history of Pakistan–US relations.
The Secretariat said that the program would also include a press conference and media engagements at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., as well as community and policy receptions in New Jersey.
It further said the visit would lay the foundation for regular parliamentary exchanges, enhanced legislative cooperation, and a sustainable institutional partnership between Pakistan and the United States—anchored in mutual respect, democratic principles, and long-term strategic engagement.
In April last year, a US Congressional delegation visited Pakistan, describing their visit as “highly successful and productive”.
The delegation, comprising Congressmen Jack Bergman, Tom Suozzi and Jonathan Jackson, held meetings with senior Pakistani officials, including Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p><small>2026-01-06 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06160008bfbde6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965439/head-smith-centuries-put-australia-in-charge-of-final-ashes-test' target='_blank'><strong>Head, Smith centuries put Australia in charge of final Ashes Test</strong></a><br><p>Run-machine Travis Head hit a swashbuckling 163 and Steve Smith a composed unbeaten 129 as Australia built a 134-run lead over England to seize control on day three of the fifth and final Ashes Test on Tuesday.
It was destructive opener Head’s third ton of the series, to go with the phenomenal match-winning 123 he made in Perth and 170 at Adelaide.
Smith was equally impressive, with his first hundred of the series driving the hosts to 518-7 by stumps at a packed Sydney Cricket Ground in reply to England’s 384.







Beau Webster was alongside him on 42 at the close.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another morale-boosting win after victory at the previous Test in Melbourne.
“Nice batting wicket out there. Nice to start my innings on the back of a great innings from Travis Head,” Smith told Fox Sports.
“When you’re out there with him they forget about you and I was able to get into my work. Worked out well today.”
Head brought up three figures off just 105 balls and seemed destined to score 200.
But he came undone in the third over after lunch by the part-time spin of Jacob Bethell, who was bowling for the first time in the series.
In his second over, Bethell trapped the 32-year-old lbw attempting a sweep shot to end a magnificent knock.
Skipper Smith treated Bethell with contempt, launching him for a big six on his way to a 37th Test hundred.
It was Smith’s 13th Ashes century to move past England legend Jack Hobbs. Only Donald Bradman with 19 has more.
Usman Khawaja, in his 88th and last Test after announcing his retirement, fell lbw to Brydon Carse for 17 while Alex Carey made 16 before Josh Tongue enticed an edge.
Nightwatchman Michael Neser made 24 and Cameron Green 37.
“This is proper Test cricket now in terms of the graft and the stuff that you have to put in,” said Bethell, as the tourists attempt to finish a dismal series on a high.
“Yeah, it was a tough day, but you know, that’s what it’s about. We’ve got to come out tomorrow, take those three wickets early on and get back in again.”
Dropped catches
Head resumed on 91 and Neser on one after Jake Weatherald (21) and Marnus Labuschagne (48) were out on Monday.
Head clattered an early midwicket boundary off Ben Stokes and reached three figures with his 17th four, crunched through the covers from Tongue, windmilling his bat in celebration.
It was his 12th century and first in Sydney to cement his reputation as one of the game’s most versatile batsmen.
Head only moved to the top of the order in the second innings of the first Test in Perth due to Khawaja’s back injury, but he has made the position his own.
With his hundred secure, he banged three straight fours off Matthew Potts then had a massive letoff on 121 when he pulled Carse and Will Jacks dropped a sitter near the ropes.
Neser ably stuck around for 90 balls to foil England, who wasted their last two reviews on him.
Batting like a top-order batsman, he smacked four boundaries before getting a thin edge to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith off Carse.
Smith, on 12, was dropped at leg slip by Zak Crawley but safely made it to lunch and passed 50 with a drive down the ground.
When Khawaja departed, Carey produced a series of textbook strokes before being dismissed in similar fashion to his last two Tests.
Unruffled, Smith slammed Stokes to the ropes for four to put Australia in the lead for the first time and, steely eyed, kept going to yet another stylish century.
All-rounder Green came into the Test under increasing pressure after failing to fire with either bat or ball through the series, with his automatic selection being questioned.
He produced a glorious cover drive and a big six to show flashes of what he can do.
But he then needlessly spooned Carse to Ben Duckett in the deep to throw away his wicket.

Strict security arrangements were made by the police when the two reached the court along with their lawyers.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Mansoor Ahmed presided over the hearing, during which the counsel for the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) stated that the investigating officer was busy with proceedings before the Lahore High Court (LHC).
Therefore, the NCCIA counsel asked the court to allow time for producing the record.
Subsequently, Judge Qureshi extended the bail of both TikTokers till January 26 and directed the NCCIA to present the record at the next hearing.
The judge had earlier allowed Butt and Mubarak to leave the courtroom after marking their attendance.

 

The content creators are no strangers to legal trouble.
In September 2025, Butt was booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling apps in his YouTube and TikTok videos, as well as on Instagram stories for limited periods of time.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car. On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, which is associated with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
Punjab Bar Council restores licence of Rajab Butt’s lawyer
Separately, earlier in the day, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) restored the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, the counsel representing Butt.
The decision came a day after LHC’s Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Advocate Ashfaq challenging the suspension of his licence to practise law. The court had summoned the complete record of the PbBC about the licence suspension and also directed the council’s vice chairman to afford the lawyer an opportunity of a personal hearing and decide the matter by 2pm today.

The PbBC had suspended Ashfaq’s licence on a complaint from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) for representing Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the bar.
On Tuesday, PbBC Vice Chairman Muhammad Ashfaq Kahooti said that Ashfaq’s licence had been “restored”. It stated that the same day the complaint against Ashfaq had been received, “a short notice was issued to him and, without affording him a proper opportunity of hearing, his licence to practice as an advocate was suspended” by the bar’s executive committee.
However, the order noted that the objection raised by Ashfaq regarding the lack of authority of the PbBC’s executive committee was “turned down as the said contention is misconceived”.
The vice chairman referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings and directed the office to inform the LHC about the decision.
The PbBC order stated that Ashfaq had submitted an application in the shape of an objection petition challenging his licence suspension. His application argued that the December 31 order was a “clear violation” of Article 10-A of the Constitution, as well as the “principles of natural justice, as the order was passed in absentia without providing him an opportunity of hearing”.
Ashfaq further contended that he had not “committed any misconduct either towards the legal fraternity or against the dignity of the legal profession”. The lawyer had described the complaint filed by KBA as “biased, mala fide, and motivated by certain members of its cabinet”.

 

The KBA had called the strike in protest against the alleged victimisation of its former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro.
The PbBC’s December 31 order had noted that while defending his client, Ashfaq made statements against the legal fraternity, which the council described as serious professional impropriety.
The PbBC’s executive committee then unanimously decided to suspend Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect. It referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation.
Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.</p><small>2026-01-06 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06133114023ced2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart' target='_blank'><strong>Procurement of JF-17 aircraft comes under discussion during meeting between air chief, Bangladeshi counterpart</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two military conflicts with India in 2019 and 2025.

 

The press release issued by ISPR said Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad.
The Bangladeshi air chief led a high-level defence delegation during the visit, it said.
“The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” it said.
According to the press release, the visiting air chief was accorded a guard of honour.







Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.
“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.
“The Bangladeshi air chief praised PAF’s combat record and expressed interest in benefiting from its operational expertise, seeking assistance in maintenance support for Bangladesh Air Force’s aging fleet and integration of air defence radar systems to enhance air surveillance,” the statement said.
“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” it said, adding that the delegation also visited key PAF facilities.
“The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership,” it added.</p><small>2026-01-06 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/061259142a97ad9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965448/azerbaijan-will-not-send-peacekeepers-to-gaza-president-says' target='_blank'><strong>Azerbaijan will not send peacekeepers to Gaza, president says</strong></a><br><p>Azerbaijan has no intention of sending a contingent of its troops to take part in peacekeeping operations outside its borders, including in Gaza, President Ilham Aliyev said late on Monday.
Aliyev, interviewed by Azeri television channels, said Azerbaijan had been in contact with Donald Trump’s US administration with a list of questions about the operation of a peacekeeping force in Gaza, the  proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
“We prepared a questionnaire of more than 20 questions and provided it to the American side. No participation in peacekeeping forces is envisaged,” Aliyev said.
“I am not considering participation in hostilities outside Azerbaijan at all.”
An Azeri government source had said last November that Azerbaijan would provide no troops for such an operation unless there was a complete halt to fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Meanwhile, diplomats involved in the discussions told Dawn on Monday that despite deep reservations and fears of domestic backlash, most Muslim-majority countries associated with the Gaza peace process want the proposed ISF to succeed, arguing that only such a force can ensure the security and survival of Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
“Israel has already killed [more than] 70,000 people in Gaza, and only an international force with a clear mandate can stop this genocide,” said a diplomat from a Muslim nation, directly associated with the process.
Another diplomat acknowledged that participation in the ISF would place contributing states in an extremely difficult position, but said the alternatives were even bleaker.
“We know we would be pushed into a very difficult situation if we joined the ISF,” he said. “But the alternative is even worse — uninterrupted bloodshed in Gaza, and that’s not acceptable to us.”</p><small>2026-01-06 08:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0611360054ff32d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965443/amnesty-says-27th-amendment-part-of-sustained-attack-on-judicial-independence-calls-for-urgent-review' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty says 27th Amendment part of ‘sustained attack’ on judicial independence, calls for ‘urgent review’</strong></a><br><p>Human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday said the 27th Constitutional Amendment was the “crescendo of a concerted and sustained attack on the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and the rule of law in Pakistan”, calling for an urgent review of the legislation.
The 27th Amendment, passed by Parliament after five days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, was widely criticised for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and introducing changes to the military leadership structure by rewriting Article 243 of the Constitution (command of the armed forces).
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the rights body said the Amendment was a “crescendo of a concerted and sustained attack on the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and the rule of law in Pakistan”.







It called on authorities to conduct an urgent review of the Amendment to “ensure that all its provisions fully comply with Pakistan’s international human rights law obligations and commitments”.
It added the Amendment “insulates the president and heads of the naval, armed and air forces from accountability”.
“The Pakistani authorities must immediately take all appropriate measures to safeguard the impartiality, independence and safety of judges, ensuring that they can carry out their judicial functions without any inappropriate or unwarranted interference and any restrictions, improper influences, pressures and threats, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason,” the rights body said.
It noted that the Amendment violated “international human rights law, particularly undermining the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and justice and accountability”.
It urged Pakistani authorities to “uphold their international human rights obligations, effectively protect the human rights of everyone in the country, and ensure access to justice and effective remedies for victims, as well as respect the separation of powers and the rule of law”.
Amnesty maintained that the 27th Amendment had ensured the establishment of the FCC, which “lacks independence, erodes judges’ security”.
It noted that despite the Amendment’s “far-reaching consequences”, it was passed through Parliament with “no consultation with civil society and opposition parties”.
It recalled that on the day the Amendment was signed into law, two senior judges of the Supreme Court — Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah — had resigned. It added that two days later, a Lahore High Court had also resigned, referring to ex-judge Shams Mehmood Mirza.
The rights body said the 27th Amendment “further erodes judicial independence,” which it maintained had been “already weakened” by the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed in 2024. It noted that the 26th Amendment was “passed with similar haste, in less than 24 hours in October 2024”.
It added that the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — the body responsible for the appointment of judges of the Supreme and high courts — was changed under the 26th Amendment. Members of Parliament were added to the commission and judicial members were reduced to a minority, the statement said, adding that the “change in composition to include the legislature of the JCP risks politicisation” of the appointment of judges.
Amnesty noted that the 26th Amendment transferred “the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction — the authority to hear cases at its own initiation — and advisory jurisdiction and authority to provide opinion on significant questions of law or public importance referred by the president — to the newly created Constitutional Benches”.
It said that the benches had “exclusive jurisdiction for cases that dealt with the interpretation of the Constitution.”
“A little over a year after the Constitutional Benches were constituted, the twenty-seventh amendment abolished the bench at the Supreme Court level and replaced it with a separate court — the Federal Constitutional Court.”
Concerns about ‘attacks on judiciary’
Amnesty noted that the 26th and 27th Amendments were brought “amid larger concerns regarding attacks on the judiciary”.
It noted that “in the past two years, various judges have raised concerns over interference with the judiciary as well as threats to judges deciding key cases involving the ruling coalition and military.”
The group recalled an open letter written by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — in March 2024.
It said that the letter, which was addressed to the then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, spoke of “intimidation by the military’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), abduction of family members of judges and surveillance in the judge’s private homes as tactics to pressurise them regarding ongoing cases, particularly those related to the former Prime Minister Imran Khan”.
Subsequent to the letter, Amnesty recalled, the case was then taken up by the SC that sought replies from the respective high courts, out of which the Peshawar High Court (PHC) responded that “interference in judicial matters by the executive was an ‘open secret’.”
In its reply, the PHC maintained that judges “faced threats from intelligence agencies while hearing ‘political’ cases. Judges are also subject to threats online and physically”.
The Amnesty statement also recalled an April 2024 incident, where various judges of the SC, as well as the high courts, received letters containing suspicious powder.
It added that in the same month, “an online campaign was launched maligning Justice Babar Sattar of the Islamabad High Court, one of the judges who had written the open letter.”
The rights body continued: “In March 2024, an anonymous complaint was filed against another author of the open letter, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, accusing him of ‘bias’ and ‘favouritism’.”
“It was subsequently not adjudicated upon by the SJC (Supreme Judicial Council).”
Amnesty recalled that another signatory to the letter — Justice Jahangiri — was removed over a case questioning the validity of his law degree in December 2025.
“Justice Jahangiri had raised concerns regarding his trial, arguing that it bypassed the procedure for removal of judges in the Constitution and that the bench hearing his case had [a] conflict of interest, as it included the [Islamabad High Court] Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, against whom Justice Jahangiri had filed a case at the SC challenging his eligibility as chief justice.”
‘Hastily adopted’
Amnesty noted that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk had referred to the 27th Amendment as “hastily adopted” and said that the process of its passing lacked “broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society”.
It said that the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also raised alarm over the hasty passage of the Amendment.
The HRCP, in a statement, had said that the Amendment was passed in “the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society”.
“Amnesty International notes that there was no consultation with civil society and the draft was made public only on November 8 when it was presented in the Senate, mere hours after approval from the federal cabinet.”
Detailing further parliamentary proceedings that led to the eventual passing of the Amendment, the rights group said that “at no point during this process were civil society and other stakeholders consulted or given an opportunity to provide feedback on the draft amendment”.
Amnesty also took note of the “contested” composition of the parliament at the time of the passage of the Amendment.
In its statement, Amnesty said, “This amendment was passed at a time when opposition leaders in both houses had been disqualified after their convictions by anti-terrorism courts for alleged involvement in protests following the arrest of Imran on May 9 2023.”
It also recalled the issue of PTI’s reserved seats in the National Assembly (NA).
The PTI was stripped of its election symbol right before the 2024 general elections, following which the party nominees were forced to contest the polls as independent candidates.
The 80 PTI-backed independents in the NA had then joined the Sunni Ittehad Council to be able to claim reserved seats.

 

Amnesty said that in July 2024, a 13-member bench of the Supreme Court also “ruled that the PTI was entitled to its share of reserved seats”.
Had the 2024 judgment been implemented, the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council bloc would have been the single largest party with 114 seats in the National Assembly, the Amnesty statement said.
“The verdict, however, was challenged at the Constitutional Bench after the 26th Amendment was adopted, and the bench ruled in June 2025 that the party was ineligible for the reserved seats.
“PTI’s reserved seats were then distributed among three parties, PML-N, PPP and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), effectively giving the ruling coalition a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.”
Implications of FCC’s establishment
Amnesty also raised alarm over the implications resulting from the establishment of the FCC.
The rights group warned of “serious implications for access to justice and human rights as cases relating to the application of fundamental rights under the constitution shall now lie with the new court”.
It further recalled that “powers of the Supreme Court to validate and review bans on political parties imposed by the federal government — under Article 17, which guarantees the right to freedom of association — have been transferred to the Federal Constitutional Court.”
“This has severe implications as the government has publicly made statements intending to ban its largest opposition party, PTI, in the past and the Punjab Assembly has passed a resolution to ban the PTI for being a ‘national security threat’.”
Amnesty said, “The absence of clear rules delineating jurisdiction between the Supreme Court and the Federal Constitutional Courts [also] creates significant confusion on which forum would hear particular cases.”
It added that the ambiguity was “likely to cause procedural delays, to the detriment of litigant’s access to justice.”
Amnesty also warned of the possibility of “further confusion regarding the interpretation of the Constitution since the new court is not bound by past precedent of the Supreme Court”.
It also raised alarm over the process for the appointment of judges to the FCC and noted that the first batch of FCC judges was appointed directly by the executive branch.
“The first batch of judges to the Federal Constitutional Court and its chief justice are to be appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister, bypassing the JCP process under Article 175-A of the Constitution. These initial appointments raise concerns regarding direct political interference by the executive branch.
“Concerns persist for future appointments given the composition of the JCP after the 26th Amendment, as members of Parliament outnumber the judicial members and can thus dictate all future appointments.”
Amnesty quoted the United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers as saying that “there is a risk of court capture when laws establish that political branches should be involved in selecting judges to hear certain politically sensitive cases.”
“Additionally, the president also has powers to determine the number of judges for the new court, allowing the ruling government to change the composition of the court if certain judges are deemed unfavourable,” the rights group said.
These apprehensions deepened when the chief justice and first four judges of the FCC were sworn in on November 14, 2025, less than 24 hours after the 27th Amendment became law,” it added.
“No criteria or justification for the appointments were provided.”
It also took note of the changes made to the process of the transfer of high court judges under Article 200.
The Amendment “gives the president absolute powers to make transfers, subject merely to recommendation from the JCP. The arbitrary and executive-heavy nature of this power now opens the possibility of transfer used as a punitive measure against judges who rule against the Pakistani authorities”.
Amnesty further noted that the Amendment also declared that any judge who refused transfer would be suspended and their case would be reviewed by the SJC, which now has powers to remove them for refusal of transfer under Article 209.
“This is in direct violation of the Basic Principles that state that removal of judges must only be for reasons of ‘incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties’,” it said.
Lifetime immunity ‘paves way for unchecked and arbitrary use of power’
Amnesty — referring to the lifetime immunity granted to the president from criminal prosecution and arrest, as well as to the ranks of Field Marshal, Marshal of Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet under the 27th Amendment — said that the absolute lifetime immunity for such positions “paves the way for unchecked and arbitrary use of power and disregard for the rule of law.”
The group warned that “the wide-ranging nature of the immunity violates the fundamental principle of equality before the law enshrined in Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”.
It also noted that the clause violated the “right to remedy under Article 2(3) for anyone pursuing legal recourse under criminal law for actions done by these officials”.
Amnesty maintained that while immunity was permissible under international law, it still had limits, “particularly in cases of war crimes and major violations”.
“The International Court of Justice has also held that immunity only extends for ‘officials acts’, and serious international crimes cannot be regarded as official acts,” it added.
Amnesty also noted that military officials with the ranks of Field Marshal, Marshal of Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet had been declared “national heroes” under the 27th Amendment and “‘shall not be removed from office except on the ground or charges and in the manner provided under Article 47’, which deals with the removal and impeachment of the president who can only be removed on grounds of ‘physical or mental incapacity’, for violating the Constitution, or ‘gross misconduct’ as well as a resolution by two-thirds or more of the membership of Parliament”.
“It bears noting that the current chief of army staff was appointed as Field Marshal after the conflict with India in May 2025, and stands to benefit directly from these protections,” Amnesty said.</p><small>2026-01-06 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06114346aead559.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965445/ex-nazim-injured-in-ied-blast-outside-his-office-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-nazim injured in IED blast outside his office in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: The former nazim of Bannu district’s Domel tehsil, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on Tuesday.
Asif Hassan, the Bannu police spokesperson, confirmed the incident to Dawn, saying that a pre-installed improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated at the office gate in the Domel Bazaar area.
Soon after it was reported, a heavy contingent rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area and formally initiated an investigation.
Police and local sources said the explosion occurred outside the main gate of the former nazim’s office in Domel Bazaar.
At the time of the blast, Wazir was present in his vehicle and sustained minor injuries, they said.
As a result of the explosion, his vehicle was completely destroyed, while the office gate and the surrounding area also suffered damage, they added.
It is worth mentioning that Wazir has previously played a leading role in peace movements against terrorism and remained at the forefront in forming tribal lashkars to establish peace in the area.
On Tuesday, an important gathering of tribal elders was expected to be held at the same office. The former nazim was on his way to attend the meeting when the incident occurred.
Meanwhile, tribal elders came out onto the streets and announced a strong protest and harsh response by gathering at the scene of the incident. Further, armed individuals were also spotted along the Bannu Kohat Road.
The Bannu police spokesperson said the situation was being closely monitored.

 

The incident comes a day after a man and his son, belonging to the Hathikhel tribe, were allegedly abducted by suspected terrorists in Bannu. Police and locals said on Monday that Ahya Jan and his son were travelling in a car with their family to visit their relatives in the area when unidentified armed men intercepted them near Jhandokhel in Domel, made them disembark from the vehicle and shifted them to an unknown location.
On Sunday, a police constable was martyred when armed assailants shot him in Bannu‘s Kashfi Khel area. The same day, three traffic police personnel were martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in Lakki Marwat district’s Serai Naurang area, police said.
On December 2, then-Miranshah assistant commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in Bannu.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.</p><small>2026-01-06 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06101906658b37d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965438/venezuelan-opposition-leader-vows-to-return-home-as-soon-as-possible-rejects-countrys-interim-president' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuelan opposition leader vows to return home ‘as soon as possible’, rejects country’s interim president</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said on Monday she plans to return home “as soon as possible,” and slammed the interim president in Caracas.
In her first public comments since a social media post over the weekend, when the US military forcibly removed and kidnapped President Nicolas Maduro, the Nobel Peace Prize winner vowed to return to her country.
She had left Venezuela last month to travel to Norway to accept the award, and hasn’t returned since.

 

“I’m planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible,” Machado told broadcaster Sean Hannity on Fox News, speaking from an undisclosed location.
Machado openly rejected the country’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, saying she “is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narcotrafficking”.
Rodriguez, who has signalled her willingness to cooperate with Washington, was Venezuela’s vice president under Maduro.
Machado said Rodriguez is “rejected” by the Venezuelan people, and voters were on the opposition’s side.
“In free and fair elections, we will win by over 90 per cent of the votes, I have no doubt about it,” Machado said.
Machado also vowed to “turn Venezuela into the energy hub of the Americas” and “dismantle all these criminal structures” that have harmed her countrymen, promising to “bring millions of Venezuelans that have been forced to flee our country back home”.







Machado says she hasn’t spoken to Trump since Oct
Machado also said on Monday she hasn’t spoken to US President Donald Trump since October 2025.
“Actually, I spoke with President Trump on October 10, the same day the (Noble Peace) Prize was announced, (but) not since then,” Machado said on the Fox News programme.
She was awarded the prize for her fight against what the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a dictatorship.
She also welcomed the US actions as “a huge step for humanity, for freedom and human dignity”.
Trump on Saturday had dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying “she doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.”
CIA concludes regime loyalists best suited to lead Venezuela: sources
A classified CIA assessment presented to Trump has concluded senior Maduro loyalists, including vice president Rodriguez, were best positioned to maintain stability if the Venezuelan leader lost power, two sources briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an exclusive report by the Wall Street Journal.
Trump was briefed on the report, and it was shared with a small group of his senior national security team, the sources said.
The assessment was one reason why Trump decided to back Maduro’s vice president, Rodriguez, instead of opposition leader Machado, the sources said.
The White House declined to confirm the report.
“President Trump is routinely briefed on domestic political dynamics all over the world. The president and his national security team are making realistic decisions to finally ensure Venezuela aligns with the interests of the United States, and becomes a better country for the Venezuelan people,“ White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to a query.</p><small>2026-01-06 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06101428ca239ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965324/exotic-fish-species-are-threat-to-aquatic-biodiversity-govt-warned' target='_blank'><strong>Exotic fish species are threat to aquatic biodiversity, govt warned</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P) has called upon the government to keep a vigil on the introduction of exotic fish species in the country and to establish quarantine facilities for keeping fish species imported for aquaculture and aquarium trade. 
The organisation issued a statement on Monday, describing invasive fish species a looming threat to aquatic biodiversity and fisheries economy after an unusual fish was brought to the Karachi Fish Harbour from Sukkur on Sunday and no one there was able to identify it.
“It was an Amazon sailfin catfish. This fish, which has thick armoured body covered with bony plates, is an exotic fish that has an exotic species accidently introduced into natural water bodies and is spread in the provinces of Sindh and lower Punjab,” the WWF-P said, adding that the catfish is native to Latin America and is popular around the world as an aquarium fish. 
It said: “This species is among the 26 invasive fish species that have been introduced in Pakistan accidentally or deliberately, and have become invasive, have a detrimental impact on the aquatic biodiversity of Pakistan, and are threatening the delicate balance and function of the ecosystem.

WWF-Pakistan calls for strict oversight on fish imported for aquaculture and aquarium trade

“Invasive fish species are known to severely disrupt aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting natives for food and space, preying on them, introducing diseases, and altering habitats, leading to biodiversity loss, economic damage to fisheries, and even ecosystem collapse, with impacts ranging from increased water turbidity to native fish extinctions and significant losses in commercial fishing revenue. The spread of invasive species is considered a serious threat to delicate aquatic ecosystems in natural water bodies, including rivers, streams, and lakes in Pakistan,” the organisation said.
Considering the serious impact of invasive fish on the aquatic ecosystem, WWF-P has ensured inclusion of these species in the recent revision of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan under the Convention on Biological Diversity as a potential threat to national biodiversity. 
“WWF-Pakistan has requested all concerned organisations including the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, and the Animal Quarantine Department (under the Ministry of National Food Security and Research), to keep a vigil on the introduction of exotic fish species in Pakistan and to establish quarantine facilities for keeping fish species imported for aquaculture and aquarium trade,” the statement said.

The statement was made at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) summoned to discuss the recent developments in Venezuela. This is also the first meeting for the year of the UNSC, with Somalia in the chair.
The US had launched a shock military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with special forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a nighttime raid.
Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”.
He reminded Council members that the UN Charter bound states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to uphold sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
Ambassador Jadoon added that unilateral military action contravened these “sacrosanct principles” as well as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, warning that such actions set dangerous precedents and risked eroding the foundations of the global legal framework.
He cautioned that such actions also fuel instability, which, “as history has shown time and again, can lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes for years to come“.
Calling for de-escalation, the Pakistani envoy said that at this critical juncture, “the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy,” stressing that durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means and with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, free from external interference.
He expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised as a ‘Zone of Peace’, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards enhanced regional cooperation and improved prosperity.

Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation, and engage in dialogue, including by utilising sincere offers of mediation.
Jadoon noted that the offices of the secretary-general remained available for that purpose.
Concluding his remarks, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility for addressing threats to international peace and security by diffusing tensions, promoting pacific settlement and upholding respect for international law and the UN Charter.
“Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said.
UN chief concerned about instability in Venezuela, legality of US operation
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela after Maduro’s capture.
“I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo.







Guterres called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue, adding: “I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward.”
He also expressed concern that the US operation to capture Maduro in Caracas on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.Pakistan urges restraint, dialogue on Venezuela
‘Surgical law enforcement operation’
As UN officials and several UN diplomats sharply criticised Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, US Ambassador Michael G. Waltz defended the action before the Security Council as a justified “surgical law enforcement operation”.
“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this Charter as a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” Waltz asked.
The US envoy said Washington had acted to apprehend two indicted fugitives, naming President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, and insisted the operation did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people.
He described Maduro as a fugitive and the leader of a “vicious foreign terrorist organisation”, alleging links to international drug trafficking networks that use “illegal narcotics as a weapon”.

Waltz compared the action to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
Citing broader human rights concerns, the ambassador referred to allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions in Venezuela, and said more than eight million Venezuelans had fled the country.
China’s representative said his country was “deeply shocked by, and strongly condemns” what he described as the United States’ “unilateral, illegal and bullying acts” against Venezuela.
He accused Washington of “wantonly trampling upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests“, placing power above multilateralism and military action above diplomacy.
Warning of a grave threat to peace in Latin America and beyond, the Chinese envoy urged the United States to heed what he called the “overwhelming voice” of the international community and return to dialogue.
Russian Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia condemned the United States for what he called armed aggression against Venezuela in violation of international law, urging Washington to immediately release the “legitimately elected President” and his spouse.
Calling on Council members to abandon double standards, Mr Nebenzia warned against justifying “such an egregious act of aggression” out of fear of what he termed the “American global gendarme”.
He further accused the United States of seeking control over Venezuela’s natural resources, saying its actions were generating “fresh momentum for neocolonialism and imperialism”.
Following Maduro’s capture, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place”.
“We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.”

They said solutions must “preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states,” singling out Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and the Gaza Strip.
A recent internal conflict in Yemen involves the internationally recognised government and the separatist Southern Transitional Coun­­cil (STC).

Sisi welcomes Riyadh’s proposal to host ‘inclusive conference’ for southern groups

President Sisi on Monday welcomed Saudi Arabia’s proposal to host an “inclusive conference” for southern Yemeni groups, while Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty called for de-escalation and a Yemeni-led political settlement.
On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Saudi crown prince in a phone call that his country was ready to help dialogue between Yemen’s factions.
Erdogan told Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during the phone call that Turkiye “is ready to contribute to efforts aimed at bringing parties together”, according to his office.

The announcement was made on Monday by PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, where senior leaders vowed to take Imran Khan’s “clear and unequivocal” message directly to the people.

 

Framing the tour as a turning point, Mr Sheikh said Imran Khan had personally entrusted CM Afridi with the mission of mobilising the masses and challenging what the party described as an assault on the public mandate.
“PTI is not a party of one province or one city. From Karachi to Kashmore, from Hyderabad to Thar, Imran Khan’s message will echo through the streets of Sindh,” he added.

Haleem Adil says KP chief executive will tour Karachi and other cities from Jan 9 to 11

According to the announced schedule, CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on Jan 9 and arrive in Karachi at around 11am, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. A rally will then accompany him to Insaf House, followed by a series of meetings with party leaders and delegations.
His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a Meet with the Press at the Karachi Press Club, and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir.
He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice.
The momentum will carry into Jan 10 as CM Afridi travels to Hyderabad. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah.
The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the High Court Bar Association and Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad.
An ISF convention and city-wide street mobilisation are also planned before CM Afridi returns to Karachi later that night.
On Jan 11, the focus shifts back to Karachi, with organisational meetings, media talks and street movements planned in District Central, Keamari, West and East.
The KP chief minister will also visit Mazar-i-Quaid, where he is expected to address supporters, while the PTI Youth Wing launches a special mobilisation drive.
The PTI Sindh chapter president said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on Jan 12, pending official confirmation.
He added that senior PTI leaders, including Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, ministers, and parliamentary leaders, will accompany CM Afridi throughout the tour.
Warning against any obstruction, Mr Sheikh said PTI hoped the Sindh government would avoid “fascist tactics,” stressing that public mobilisation was a constitutional right.
Declaring February 8, 2024 a “black day”, he said the party was united and ready to intensify its struggle for judicial independence and Imran Khan’s release.

PARIS: Iran refused on Monday to offer “rioters” leniency while defending citizens’ right to demonstrate, a defiant stance taken after US President Donald Trump warned Tehran would “get hit very hard” if authorities killed more demonstrators amid deadly unrest.
Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei ordered officials to take a hard line against those causing instability as protests, which erupted over economic stagnation, expanded to include political demands.
“I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency.
He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”.
Demonstrations have taken place in 23 of Iran’s 31 provinces, affecting at least 45 different cities to varying degrees.
The unrest has been concentrated in the west and consists mostly of small or medium-sized gatherings, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports.
At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed in localised clashes since Dec 30, officials announced.
Since the protests began on Dec 28 — sparked when shopkeepers in the capital of Tehran staged a strike over high prices — officials have struck a conciliatory tone regarding economic demands while vowing to crush destabilisation.
Trump threats
Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US was watching the situation “very closely”.
“If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump said.
Iran’s economy has been hit hard by tough international sanctions.
The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, and inflation is in the double digits.
To alleviate economic pressure, the government announced Sunday a monthly allowance for every citizen equivalent to roughly 3.5 per cent of the average monthly wage.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country stood “in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom.”
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei, speaking at a press conference, accused Israel of trying “to exploit the slightest opportunity to sow division and undermine our national unity.”
Israel fought a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined with limited strikes on Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities.
Explosives seized
Police intelligence officers in Tehran have identified a suspected hideout used by “rioters,” seizing “weapons, ammunition, and materials for making improvised explosive devices,” according to Mizan.
The Fars news agency reported on Monday that “the trend observed on Sun­day night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geogra­phic reach compared to previous nights.”
While videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify, local media’s accounting is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed coverage of the demonstrations.
Most shops in Tehran were open Monday and residents went about their business. However, riot police were deployed at major intersections and officers were stationed outside some schools. Several universities have resumed classes, though only online.
The reformist newspaper Arman Melli said Monday that authorities had “heard the voices of the protesters”, while the conservative papers Javan and Kayhan accused the United States and Israel of financially supporting rioters.
Protests have also taken place among the Iranian diaspora.
“With each new protest, Iranian men and women gain ground,” Sahar Aghakhani, a 29-year-old French-Iranian translator, said at a demonstration in Paris on Sunday. “Movement by movement, we’re getting closer to the end of the regime.” Iran has experienced several outbreaks of nationwide protests in recent years, most notably in 2022 over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for an alleged breach of the country’s strict dress laws for women. The current protests have not yet reached the same scale.

A sessions court on Monday granted pre-arrest bail to the qawwal after he was booked in a case for performing a song associated with ex-premier Imran Khan during a government-sponsored cultural event.
In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event a “political colour” as he sung “Qaidi No. 804” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist, who appeared before the court along with his lawyer.
Faraz’s counsel submitted that the petitioner had no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants in the cultural programme.

Qawwal gets pre-arrest bail for singing a song linked to party leader; 7 wedding guests detained for raising slogans for Imran

He requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”.
After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail till Jan 13 and sought the case record from the police.
Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on Jan 3.
According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.”
The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order.
The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In the other incident, the Gujranwala district administration detained seven supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after they chanted slogans carrying pictures of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a wedding function near Rahwali Cantonment.
Gujranwala Deputy Commissioner Naveed Ahmed, on the basis of a report from the Gujranwala police, issued the detention orders of seven PTI supporters under section 03 of the maintenance of public order (MPO) for the period of 14 days from January 03.
Earlier the local police had arrested the PTI supporters including Istikhar Ahmed of Talwandi Khajoor Wali, Tariq Mehmood of Lambawali, Kareem Bhinder of Rahwali, Zahid of Shareefpura, Imran Beig of Salamat Pura, Zeeshan of Kashmirpura and Ayaz of Tarragari. They were later sent to the Gujranwala district jail.
These detained people had chanted slogans in favour of Imran Khan while carrying his posters at the stage of a wedding ceremony of Hassan Malik in a banquet hall near Rahwali.
The local police reported to the administration that these PTI supporters had planned to stage a protest demonstration by blocking the main GT road in favour of the party leader.

KARACHI: After sealing the entire motorcycle market on Akbar Road, authorities on Monday sealed the automobilespareparts market off M.A.Jinnah Road near Tibet Centre, as well as hundreds of shops in other parts of the metropolis.
The expansion of the drive against encroachments — from owners of roadside eateries to traders who contribute millions in taxes daily — raised many eyebrows.
Officials claimed that as many as 86 shops in the autospareparts market were sealed because vehicles parked in front of the shops for repairs encroached on the main road, causing traffic snarls.
A similar reason was given by the authorities for sealing as many as 115 shops in the Akbar Road motorcycle market, which remained shut on Monday, as well as dozens of other shops in the city’s business district.
Deputy Commissioner South Javed Nabi Khoso said that the shopkeepers at Tibet Centre had been given warning three times to remove encroachments in front of their shops.
He claimed that most mechanics and electricians who worked on the roadside in front of the sealed shops were hired by shop owners, seeking to grow their businesses. “Due to double parking of vehicles, the road had become too congested, affecting the flow of traffic,” he said.
Shopkeepers told to submit affidavit
A meeting held on Monday decided that any shopkeeper who does not submit an affidavit providing written assurance of compliance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) will not be allowed to open shops.
It was decided that shops which submitted undertakings to the DCs would be reopened in a phased manner and any establishment that violated the SOPs would have its premises sealed for three days.
The DC-South said that after the affidavit was submitted, any further breach of the SOPs would result in arrests and the registration of FIRs against the violators.
Officials said that the authorities had sealed as many as 196 eateries in different parts of the city during the past three days.
Karachi Commissioner SyedHassanNaqvi told Dawn that the city’s antiencroachment campaign would remain in force, and that no shop or eatery would be permitted to place articles or goods on walkways.
He said that the crackdown would continue to curb the growing trend of encroachments and obstructions on footpaths, roads and service lanes.
‘Action may harm economy’
However, traders dismissed the government action as unnecessary, warning that it would harm their businesses and the country’s economy.
Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, a former officebearer of the Motorcycle Dealers Association, said that showcasing automobiles and bikes in front of their outlets is a worldwide practice.
“Authorities should have marked a lane in front of the shops for displaying motorcycles,” he demanded.
“The whole exercise, under the guise of an antiencroachment drive, is simply aimed at raising rates,” alleged another bike dealer, without elaborating.

The meetings are crucial to the administration’s hopes of getting top US oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.
The three biggest US oil companies — Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron — have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s ouster, according to four oil industry executives familiar with the matter, contradicting Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, both before and since Maduro was seized.

 

“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources said on Monday.
The upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to boost crude oil production and exports from Venezuela, a former OPEC nation which sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be refined by specially designed US refineries.
Achieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.
It is unclear what executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.
The White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move into Venezuela.
“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.
Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump told NBC News the US may subsidise oil companies to enable them to rebuild Venezuela’s energy infrastructure.
Asked if the administration had briefed any oil companies ahead of the military operation, Trump said, “No. But weve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”
“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News.
“But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”
He told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies.
“I speak to everybody,” he said.
CBS News, citing an unnamed source, said executives from the three were expected to meet on Thursday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
One oil industry executive told Reuters the companies would be reluctant to talk about potential Venezuela operations in group settings with the White House, citing anti-trust concerns that limit collective discussions among competitors about investment plans, timing and production levels.
Big plans, big problems
US forces on Saturday conducted a lightning raid on Venezuela’s capital, arresting Maduro in the dead of night and sending him to the United States to face narcoterrorism charges.
Trump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars boosting Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to around a third of its peak over the past two decades due to underinvestment and sanctions.
But those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the countrys political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.
Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Exxon and ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalised by former President Hugo Chavez.
“I don’t think you’re going to see any company other than Chevron, who’s already there, you know, commit to developing this resource,” said one oil industry executive, who asked not to be named discussing the issue.
Conoco has been seeking billions of dollars in restitution for the takeover of three oil projects in Venezuela under Chavez. Exxon was involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country in 2007.
Chevron, which exports around 150,000 barrels per day of crude from Venezuela to the US Gulf Coast, meanwhile, has had to carefully maneuver with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country in recent years.
Investors were optimistic, betting Washington’s move against Venezuela’s leadership would allow US firms access to the oil reserves.
A US embargo on Venezuelan oil remained in full effect, Trump said.
The S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025, with heavyweights Exxon Mobil rising 2.2 per cent and Chevron jumping 5.1pc.</p><small>2026-01-06 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/060740216024eb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965386/section-144-extended-in-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>Section 144 extended in Quetta</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan government has extended Section 144 restrictions in Quetta through Jan 31, citing the “prevailing law and order situation”.
The Balochistan Home Department issued a notification confirming the extension, which includes a ban on the display of weapons, public processions and the use of tinted vehicle windows.
The order prohibits public gatherings of five or more people. Authorities also banned the operation of unregistered motorcycles and the covering of faces in public using masks or mufflers. Pillion riding remains forbidden, though exceptions allow for the transportation of women and children. Violators will face legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the notification.

The dispute emerged in November 2020 when the CCP — an independent regulatory body established in 2007 under the Competition Act with an objective to ensure a level-playing field in markets by preventing anti-competitive practices such as cartels, deceptive marketing and mergers that may harm competition — issued identical show-cause notices to the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and different sugar mills across the country, accusing them of violating Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010, which bans cartelisation.
A four-member CCP panel after hearing the case had a split decision in August 2021 whereby two members, including then chairperson Rahat Kaunain Hassan, found the mills guilty and the remaining two members sought a fresh inquiry. However, the chairperson cast a deciding vote that resulted in the imposition of Rs44 billion fines on almost 72 sugar mills for alleged manipulative practices.
The sugar mills challenged that decision before the appellate tribunal, which in May 2025 ordered a new hearing by a member who had not signed either opinion. In September, the SC struck down the tribunal’s order and CCP’s casting-vote decision, and while annulling the fines referred the matter back to the ‘tribunal’ for fresh proceedings based on the original 2020 notices.
Instituted by senior counsel Asma Hamid, the review petition sought a clarification on the SC’s decision to remand the matter to the tribunal instead of the CCP for fresh hearing.
The review petition pleaded that the power to make an order on the basis of inquiries/show cause notices vests with the commission in exercise of its powers under Section 30 of the Competition Commission Act, 2010. It is in exercise of powers vested in the commission that the inquiries were conducted and show cause notices were issued, orders made and penalties recovered for the contraventions of the act committed by the parties (sugar mills), it argued.

The rally was organised by All Parties Kech in collaboration with traders, the Doctors Association and civil society.
Marchers moved through main roads and streets of the district headquarters of Kech district, starting from Officer Bazaar, passing through various routes, reaching the Press Club and then proceeding to Shaheed Fida Chowk, where the march turned into a protest.
“The protection of citizens is the responsibility of the state and its institutions,” National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said while describing the situation in Kech as “alarming”.

Political leaders warn of district-wide strike

Demonstrators demanded the recovery of two recently abducted youths, Haseeb Haji Yaseen and Shah Nawaz Gul Jan, and called on state institutions to protect citizens.
Mr Malik, while demanding the recovery, warned that attempts were once again being made to push Kech toward instability, but said the people of Kech would resist such efforts.
He urged the district administration to provide protection to citizens and said that for the past month, affected families and political leaders had approached relevant institutions, but each continued to shift responsibility to others.
All Parties Kech Convener Nawab Khan Shambezai announced that a district-wide strike would be observed on Jan 7 if the two youths did not return.
The Kech Bar Association boycotted court proceedings in solidarity with the families of the abducted.
Advocate Syed Majeed Shah, the association’s president, condemned the kidnappings.
Business activities and daily life have been severely disrupted by the recent wave of crime, according to local leaders.
Mir Ghafoor Ahmed Bizenjo, a former minister, said that citizens were “living under a sense of fear” and called on the state to ensure public safety.
Human rights defenders and other speakers at the rally said the insecurity affects the entire Makran region, demanding an end to the kidnappings that have particularly targeted the business community.

In its first of the kind “Fiscal Risk Monitoring Framework for Contingent Liabilities of PPP Projects”, in line with commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ministry’s Debt Management Office reported a total of Rs472.3bn in such liabilities as of Dec 2025.
More than 71pc (Rs335.6bn) of the total pertained to contingent liabilities of the Sindh government, which has the largest portfolio of 17 PPP projects — almost half of 36 across the country.

Total liabilities exceeded Rs472bn by end of last month

The federal government’s total contingent liabilities against PPP projects amounted to Rs90.6bn, or 19.3pc of the cumulative amount, followed by Punjab at Rs26.5bn (5.6pc) and Rs19.6bn (4.2pc of the total) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
Balochistan has no such liabilities, although its five projects were among the 36 total PPP project portfolio across the country.
In its latest written commitment to the IMF, the government had promised to improve the risk monitoring framework of public-private partnerships, including those at the provincial level.
“We will subject PPP-funded projects to the same rigorous selection criteria applied to projects funded through other sources”, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said, adding that Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other stakeholders, was in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for quantifying contingent liabilities related to PPPs for publishing estimates by end-December 2025.
Contingent liabilities are those contractual obligations of the state for which public sector entities have assumed risks against these PPP projects and are calculated in nominal values calculated over the life of the contract.
Of the total liabilities, Rs368.3bn pertain to contingent fiscal responsibilities that may accrue due to minimum revenue guaranteed by the respective governments against a specific project, cost escalation, interest rate fluctuations or terminal liabilities, while another Rs104bn have been pitched as financial guarantees.
Cost escalation
The report suggests Sindh’s direct contingent liabilities because of cost escalation, minimum revenue guarantee and terminal liabilities stand at Rs255.5bn, accounting for close to 70pc of the Rs368.3bn consolidated national amount. Sindh’s largest risk exposure for contingent liabilities stems from cost escalation estimated at Rs146.6bn, followed by Rs61bn for minimum revenue guaranteed by the provincial government to private partners.
This is in addition to about Rs80bn in financial guarantees.
The federal government’s total PPP liabilities of Rs90.6bn include Rs83.7bn on account of termination liabilities and Rs7bn in financial guarantees. Financial guarantees are instruments issued against a financial commitment agreed to be undertaken by the public sector like viability gap financing support.
The report highlighted ‘high’ risk of these contingent liabilities becoming actually due on account of Rs150bn each for cost escalation and termination liabilities, Rs104bn on account of financial guarantees and about Rs66bn for minimum revenue guarantees, led by Sindh with Rs61bn.
IMF stipulation
The framework is required under the IMF programme to establish a consistent system for identifying, quantifying, and reporting contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects at both federal and provincial government levels.
This is because the PPP contracts can create fiscal exposures that do not immediately appear in budget or debt statements, but could materialise later through guarantee calls, revenue support mechanisms, indexation adjustments or termination-related payments.
The framework provides a uniform methodology to classify and quantify both direct and contingent liabilities and to consolidate these into a single national PPP fiscal exposure dataset managed by the RMU of the Ministry of Finance.

And if it is, where does the title come from?
But before that, a bit of geography: the rolling, well-watered grassland sits at an average height of 4,000 metres above the sea, just south of Skardu in Baltistan division. Covering an area of roughly 4,500 square kilometres, it is hemmed in by peaks rising another 1,000 metres higher. It is home to a wide variety of mammals, the Tibetan brown bear being its signature species.
SPLICING IN HISTORY
The earliest reference we get to it, only by association, is from the Shah Jahan Nama, when we hear that, in 1637, the Lahori Arain Zafar Khan, then governor of Kashmir, led an army comprising 2,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry to capture ‘Little Tibet’, as Baltistan was known. This was after an earlier attempt during Jahangir’s rule had ended in a disastrous retreat, with a huge loss of life.
The Shah Jahan Nama tells us that Zafar Khan took the ‘Gurach route’, which I have not been able to identify. However, we read of the Mughal army reaching Sadpara in a narrow gorge (such indeed is its situation), where locals had set up stout defences and where the earlier rout had taken place. 

Everyone now calls it the ‘land of giants’, but the Deosai Plateau’s true name honours just one: a simple-minded giant who tried to farm at 4,000 metres above sea level and fled when winter came early. Travel writer Salman Rashid explains the etymology from Gujjar folklore to show how a plural error obscured a delightful singular tale

Zafar Khan, however, was able to push his way through to Skardu. Now, because the army fought at Sadpara, we know that, setting out from Srinagar, it would certainly have traversed Deosai, even though no mention of it is made. Two years later, in 1639, another incursion was mounted to oust invaders from Ladakh. And again, the army coming up from Srinagar would have come through Deosai.
In the summer of 1835, English traveller Godfrey Thomas Vigne (pronounced Vine) passed through ‘Deotsuh’, where he noticed several bears. He also met up with Ahmed Shah, the Raja of Skardu, who was in pursuit of a band of robbers. Vigne watched the outlaws being ambushed and every single one of them being dispatched either by musket or by sword.
Vigne wrote that, after the summer thaws, the entire plateau was so flooded that it becomes a virtual lake. In 1835, when Deosai would have had a regular winter cover of some five metres of snow, this might have been true, but it is no longer so. 
And from the expanse of water that Vigne saw, he wrote that it was difficult to cross it during one month of the thaws and, therefore, its name meant ‘lake of the Deo.’ He was wrong about the meaning of the name and had no other story of the deo to tell his readers in his two-volume Travels.
IN SEARCH OF THE DEO
In mid-June 1990, I trekked for the first time across the Deosai Plateau and, because the thaws had swelled them up, my two porters and I had to walk to the headwaters of three streams to ford them. In the five days we spent on Deosai, the two men regaled me with tales of djinns and fairies that came out in the dark to do mischief to unwary travellers.
One of them even said that his maternal uncle and a friend, once benighted on a journey across the plateau, were so terrorised by the djinns that both fainted. When the uncle came to in the morning, he found that he had been rubbing his heels so hard against the frosty earth that his bones were exposed.
Sadly, and this despite the three of us being the only humans on the plateau at that time, we met with no evil djinns nor delectable pixies. Nevertheless, my 1995 book Between Two Burrs on the Map has a chapter titled ‘Through the Land of Djinns.’
Around the time of the publication of that book, I met with a Gujjar elder near Jhelum, who told me that his clan and their large herd of livestock spent the summers on Deosai. By his account, his ancestors had made Deosai their summer home many centuries earlier and, now, there were several groups of Gujjars who had allocated themselves areas where they grazed their cattle.
He also told me the story of the Dev (as he pronounced the word) or giant. Here, I have reproduced and paraphrased text from my book, Deosai: Land of the Giant, published in 2013:
“Such an immense wilderness that could have harboured a vast population, but being entirely devoid of human life was, naturally, the abode of spirits. This notion tickled their imagination and so, in their own image, the Gujjars invented the Dev or Deo — the giant. Simple of mind and uninitiated to the ways of nature, this itinerant giant chanced upon this vast flat grassland. Here, he thought, was farmland capacious enough to meet all his food needs. And so, as spring thaws began to erode the cover of snow and ice, he set about ploughing the land to sow his paddy.”
The book expands on the folklore to point out that on Deosai, the summer lasts barely eight weeks and along came a wily little fox to taunt the ignorant giant. ‘Fool, you wait here for your paddy to ripen while people in Skardu feast on the finest apricots. The blizzards will soon kill your fields. Begone, before you too are smothered by the snow!’
And sure enough, the snows came even before the giant could harvest his crops. He fled but, in Gujjar lore, the land where the Dev had set up his farming became Dev Vasai — their exact pronunciation — meaning land settled by the giant. Even today, Gujjars will pronounce it clearly as Dev Vasai.”
And so, my book on Deosai calls it ‘Land of the Giant’, in singularity with the simple-minded Dev of Gujjar lore. It is not the land of giants, which it became because of the national lack of reading. Very few have read my book but, somehow, the title got around and because its raison d’être was unknown to an unreading public, Deosai became ‘land of giants.’
This attempt to correct the title may please be heeded.
The writer is the author of several books and a fellow of The Royal Geographical Society.
