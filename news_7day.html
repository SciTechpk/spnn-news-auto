Naek told reporters after a meeting that was convened to deliberate on the proposed changes.
He said that he and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had been authorised to make changes to some clauses of the bill, without sharing anymore details about the said clauses.
Alongside him, Tarar said they would submit a report on the proposals finalised by the committees to the Senate tomorrow (Monday).
The bill for Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled before the Senate yesterday, hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.
That initial draft of the bill proposed the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
Subsequently, the bill was referred to the Senate’s and National Assembly’s
Committees on Law and Justice for further deliberation. The committees had met for the purpose yesterday, and the session was reconvened today.
Senate Committee on Law and Justice Chairperson Senator Farooq H. Naek and his counterpart for the National Assembly panel, MNA Chaudhry Mahmood Bashir Virk, co-chaired today’s meeting.
 
 

Lawmakers of the PTI, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), meanwhile, continued their boycott of the parliamentary committee today.
Tarar and Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik were also among those who participated in today’s meeting. Deputy Prime Minister and PML-N leader Ishaq Dar, too, briefly attended the proceedings.
PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu, Awami National Party’s (ANP) Hidayatullah Khan, and PPP MNAs Kasim Gilani and Syed Abrar Ali Shah were also part of the joint moot, while PML-N MNA Shumaila Rana attended via video link.
Discussion remaining on 3 points: Naek
Earlier, when the meeting was paused for lunch break, Naek said while speaking to the media that “discussions on three points were yet to be completed — transfers of cases from one high court to another high court, transfer of judges from high court to another high court and Article 243 (command of the armed forces).”
The discussion on these matters would be resumed after lunch, he said, adding that some objections had been raised pertaining to the transfer of judges and cases.
“Discussions are ongoing regarding this and it is hoped that a consensus will be reached,” he further stated.
Prior to today’s meeting, when Naek was asked about suggestions made by various ruling allies and whether “two parties had come face to face on the immunity for the president and prime minister”, the PPP senator had affirmed that all parties had a right to voice their opinion.
Noting that the proposals of the PML-N and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) would be considered in today’s meeting, Naek said, “Decisions will be taken based on whatever the majority’s opinion is.”
During another break, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan had told reporters that the committee had sought time until tomorrow to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, Tarar had told reporters it was decided that provinces be taken into confidence on changing the province’s name. MQM-P’s suggestion regarding local governments was also discussed, he added.
Earlier, Tarar had said the joint committees had completed “85 per cent of the work” and expressed the hope that the deliberations would be over by the evening.
He had also highlighted PM Shehbaz Sharif’s directives issued earlier today to withdraw the amendments proposing legal immunity for premiers.
Referring to the JUI-F’s absence, the law minister had stated its members had informed the committee yesterday about their party’s policy. He emphasised that parliamentary parties should utilise their right to vote, rather than boycotting the process altogether.
After yesterday’s meeting, Tarar had told reporters that all parliamentary parties were participating in the process and that the government had also “requested the opposition to contribute constructively”.
“Till the time we do not reach a consensus, from all members of both Houses, the discussions will continue,” the law minister had said.
 


Prior to today’s meeting, it was reported that the standing committees were likely to finalise the mechanism for the transfer of high court judges through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — a process which may not require the consent of the judges being transferred.
The panels cleared nearly 80 per cent of the proposed bill yesterday in a joint in-camera meeting, including most clauses of the judicial reforms package. But deliberations on the field marshal’s status under Article 243 (command of the armed forces) of the Constitution were deferred to today.
 






Opposition to the bill
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes the PTI, has announced a nationwide protest movement against the 27th Amendment, urging the people to take a stand against the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
PTI parliamentary lea­der Barrister Ali Zafar has contended that the debate on the bill was inappropriate in the absence of a notified leader of the opposition. He accused the government and its allies of being in a “hurry” to pass the amendments.
 
 

“These amendments strike at the very foundation of the constitutional structure by undermining the independence of the judiciary and eroding the delicate balance of powers that the 1973 Constitution so carefully created,” he told Dawn.
However, the PML-N and the PPP have rejected the impression that the 27th Amendment bill was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the MQM-P, the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), the ANP and the PML-Zia.
However, no meeting was reported between the government and the PTI.

The 26-page Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes, just hours after its approval by the federal cabinet.
Senate Chairperson Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani is presiding over the session today, which began with the House remembering Allama Iqbal on his birth anniversary. Later, the house also passed a resolution in relevance to Iqbal Day.
During the session, PTI lawmakers had pictures of their party founder Imran Khan placed on their desks. At the beginning of the proceedings, a PTI leader raised an objection, to which Gilani replied that as per his ruling yesterday, the senator could bring his concerns to the Senate chairman’s office.
‘You cannot force a Constitution through bullets’
Addressing the upper house of the parliament, PTI Senator Ali Zafar detailed “five points” that he said formed the basic spirit of the 1973 Constitution and were now being “punctured” in the 27th Amendment.
 


The first, he said, was that Pakistan was a federation with autonomous provinces. Secondly, the elected parliament had authority but was bound to the Constitution. Zafar said the third point was the fundamental rights provided therein, with courts formed to protect and implement them.
Fourth pillar of the Constitution, he added, was an independent judiciary to protect people’s rights and guarantee democracy, while the fifth one was civilian supremacy.
“If you alter this balance of five pillars even slightly through any amendment, the entire Constitution will be shaken and can result in major chaos,” Zafar warned.
At one point, Senator Sarmad Ali objected to the PTI bringiung framed pictures and placards, pointing out that it was against the Senate rules, at which Gilani requested the opposition to refrain from doing so.

After presenting his arguments against the proposed legislation, Zafar urged the House to reject the bill for it and invited the treasury benches for further discussions.
“We can sit and think. There are a lot of options how to reduce the pendency of cases. We are ready to talk with you to consider amendments that will benefit the people, but we will not tolerate that you harm the public,” the PTI leader said.
During his speech, Zafar stressed that the Constitution was a contract between the state and the public, with a “spirit of its own”. He added that the document was a pledge that everyone, regardless of the region they hailed from, would live according to the laws.
“When you make any change in the Constitution, it is equal to tampering with the foundation of a building, and if you make any mistake, the entire building can collapse,” he contended.
 
 

Recalling that two dictators made amendments to the 1973 Constitution that “broke it”, Zafar highlighted that even they took “a lot of time” to be passed. He added that the “real spirit” of the 1973 Constitution was restored through the 18th Amendment in 2010.
The PTI senator underscored the need for a consensus on making any changes to the Constitution, contending that consensus and a two-thirds majority were separate things. “You cannot force a Constitution through bullets.”
Arguing that the PTI represented millions of people and was rejecting the 27th Amendment, Zafar said, “Respect the mandate of the people and kindly do not vote for this amendment.”
The lawyer asserted that those bringing any constitutional amendment should be “genuinely elected”, with no personal motives or wishes to stay in power. “This parliament, in my opinion with due respect, is not authorised to pass these amendments,” he added.
Zafar also claimed that the proposed changes related to provincial shares and rights under the 18th Amendment, which were dropped in the current draft, were a “face-saving for the PPP” so certain originally intended amendments could be passed.
He said the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would end the judiciary’s independence, and the president having the authority to appoint the judges could result in “selection of his choice”. He added that the increase in retirement age of FCC judges from 65 to 68 years was an “incentive for judges to become pliant judges”.
The PTI lawmaker highlighted the powers given to the FCC, including considering cases related to fundamental rights, and cautioned that the court not following previous judicial precedents would result in a “collapse of the system”.
Zafar further termed the provisions related to the transfer of judges without their consent as a “hanging sword” of being moved from one high court to another. “This will bring the judiciary under the executive’s total control,” he argued.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The senator also slammed lawyers citing the reason for the formation of FCC as pendency of cases, calling them “intellectually dishonest”, and asserted that the SC pendency only amounted to two per cent of cases pending across the country.
The PTI senator recalled how the parliament “systematically” reached the 27th Amendment today, highlighting the “slow, gradual but effective erosion of democracy and the Supreme Court”.
Zafar went as far back as March 2023, when the SC had ordered that elections be held for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab assemblies within 90 days.
He pointed out that the ruling was violated, alleging that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) “colluded to make those 90 days’ government into a year and a half”.
The PTI senator then mentioned the Jan 13, 2024 verdict by a bench led by then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, which revoked the PTI’s electoral symbol a month before the general elections. He also recalled the SC’s ruling in the Article 63A case that struck down an earlier order and allowed the ballots of lawmakers who voted against party policy to be counted.
 
 

“It was as if the judiciary opened the gates for the 26th Amendment through this decision,” Zafar claimed, further alleging that the ruling coalition coerced some lawmakers to vote in 26th Amendment’s favour. The senator clarified that the PTI had never agreed to even the formation of constitutional benches, and had instead termed them “lesser of the two evils” compared to a constitutional court.
The senator then highlighted three verdicts handed by the SC’s constitutional benches — the reserved seats ruling that distributed seats earlier awarded to the PTI to the coalition partners, the order allowing the military trials of civilians, and the ruling in the judges’ transfer case to allegedly “control the Islamabad High Court”.
The upper house of the parliament broke into a loud exchange at one point, when Gilani gave the floor to PTI’s Faisal Javed to speak but a lawmaker interjected. “Who are you to say this to me when the chairman has allowed me to speak?” Javed asked.
Necessary to bring some improvements in judicial system: PML-N’s Pervaiz Rashid
From the treasury benches, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid regretted that Barrister Zafar had presented just one side of the picture, “which is likeable to them”. Zafar did not mention anything about the effort in the past to “convert the judiciary into a tool of a political party”, Rashid said.

The PML-N lawmaker said the members from the opposition benches had spoken on just one point of the proposed amendment, which pertained to the judiciary. He added that he would take it as their acceptance of the rest of the clauses of the proposed amendment.
Rashid further stated that he would have been pleased had opposition members also participated in the meetings of the standing committees so that their input would have been included in their reports and subsequently discussed in the house.
He said that “some individuals had hidden a political party’s flag under the robes of judges they adorned”, appreciating Senator Hamid Khan for acknowledging controversial court judgments.
“I am not saying that we need to take revenge, but it is necessary that some improvements are brought in the judicial system,” Rashid asserted, slamming the PTI for “promoting the politics of sit-ins”.
Meanwhile, PPP Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan said the PTI lawmakers were “confused”, which led to an eruption of responses from the opposition benches.
He reiterated Rashid’s point that the PTI was silent on the “real matters, which means there is something fishy”, apparently referring to the proposed changes to Article 243.
In his fiery speech, Ahsan stated that the PPP had “seen bodies” of its slain leaders, including ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, his daughter ex-premier Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto, Shahnawaz Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto.
“You are in the parliament, you are sitting with politicians, you are also ready to enact legislation with political individuals, but you are willing to talk with someone else only,” he said while addressing the PTI.
The PPP senator also said he wanted the opposition to take part in the meetings of the standing committees, just as they were participating in the Senate proceedings.
 






You cannot end judiciary’s independence because of past decisions: Hamid Khan
In his speech, PTI Senator Hamid Khan took exception to the manner in which the government was trying to amend the Constitution.

“Constitutional amendments are not promulgated in this manner. You first reach a consensus and then amend the constitution,” he asserted.
Khan further stated that he considered the 26th Amendment “the death of the Constitution” and the effort to promulgate the 27th Amendment was akin to an “effort to bury the Constitution”. “Both these amendments are truly something to be ashamed of.”
He went on to say that some political parties had “complaints that when the judiciary was liberated in the true sense, it issued orders to disqualify prime ministers”.
 
 

“But this does not mean that they (political parties) get personal […] They [shouldn’t try to] put an end to the same Constitution under which [the prime ministers] were disqualified, to bring about the end of that same judiciary that disqualified them,” he added.
Khan clarified that he understood that those decisions were “controversial to some extent” and he was not supporting those decisions. “But this does not mean that you end the independence of the judiciary because of judges’ past decisions. […] Both right and wrong decision are made in history, but then don’t become a reason to ban courts.”
He question that if the existing judicial system was brought to an end, “who will you go to for your fundamental rights?”.
“We are at a historical moment [at present]. And if, for any reason, […] we take a step that results in the destruction and distortion of the Constitution, all of us will have to face its consequences — those who will vote [in favour of it] and the coming generations as well,” he warned.
PTI Senator Azam Swati, addressing the Upper House with a black ribbon tied around his arm, hailed the “amazing” 1973 Constitution introduced by Bhutto and other political leaders, adding that the 27th Amendment would ruin it.
Swati contended that the Statement of Object and Reasons in the proposed bill did not even address the amendments suggested in it, terming them “vague and incomplete”. He further said that the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) had been torn into pieces, and that Articles 175 and 191 did not make up for it.
“May God give you long life, this (legislation) will bite you back one day and you will admit that we made a major mistake,” the PTI leader said.
PTI’s Mohsin Aziz also questioned the “haste” in passing the Amendment, adding that certain “knowledgable” individuals already knew that this legislation would be introduced.
He said most of the Amendments made so far were “benign”, while certain were major such as the 13th, 18th and 25th. “So why is there a need for two amendments in just two years?” he asked.
The PTI lawmaker defended the speeches given by Zafar and Hamid, saying they were not political. “They spoke as opposition not for the sake of opposition, but opposition for the sake of betterment of this country.”
He further said, “Do not be in haste. If there are good amendments, we will definitely sit proudly with you and agree on it.”

The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia after decades of enmity could shake up the political and security landscape in the Middle East, potentially strengthening US influence in the region.
Trump said last month he hoped Saudi Arabia would “very soon” join other Muslim countries that signed the 2020 Abraham Accords normalising ties with Israel.
But Riyadh has signalled to Washington through diplomatic channels that its position has not changed: it will sign up only if there is agreement on a roadmap to Palestinian statehood, two Gulf sources told Reuters.

The intention is to avoid diplomatic missteps and ensure alignment of the Saudi and US positions before any public statements are made, they said. One said the aim was to avoid any confusion at or after the White House talks on November 18.
The Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, “is not likely to entertain any possible formalising of ties in the near future without at least a credible pathway to a Palestinian state”. said Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer on the Middle East.
MBS is likely to try to use his influence with Trump to seek “more explicit and vocal buy-in for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state,” said Panikoff, who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.
Trump’s upbeat comments on Abraham Accords
Next week’s visit is the Crown Prince’s first to Washington since the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, an MBS critic whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul caused global outrage. MBS denied direct involvement.
The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco have already normalised ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, and Trump has said he expects an expansion of the accords soon.
“We have a lot of people joining now the Abraham Accords, and hopefully we’re going to get Saudi Arabia very soon,” he said on November 5, without offering a timeline.
 
 

In a television interview broadcast on October 17, he said, “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in.” But the agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco sidestepped the issue of Palestinian statehood.
The two Gulf sources said Riyadh had signalled to Washington that any move to recognise Israel must be part of a new framework, not just an extension of any deal.
For Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its two holiest sites, Makkah and Madina, recognising Israel would be more than just a diplomatic milestone. It is a deeply sensitive national security issue tied to resolving one of the region’s oldest and most intractable conflicts.
Such a step would be hard to take when the Arab public’s mistrust of Israel remains high over the scale of its military offensive during the war against Hamas in Gaza, despite a fragile ceasefire in the conflict that followed the group’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
Saudi Foreign Ministry official Manal Radwan has called for a clear, time-bound Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the deployment of an international protection force and the empowerment and return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza.
These steps, she said, are essential to the establishment of a Palestinian state — the prerequisite for regional integration and the implementation of the two-state solution.
With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia sees no immediate prospect of satisfying Trump’s demand that it normalise ties with Israel, the sources told Reuters.
Progress on that front depends on concessions neither Washington nor Israel is currently prepared to make, Saudi officials say.
Trump and Crown Prince set to seal defence pact
Saudi officials are intent on steering the Trump-MBS meeting towards defence cooperation and investment, wary that the politically charged issue of normalisation of ties with Israel could overshadow the agenda.
 
 

The meeting is expected to seal a pivotal defence pact defining the scope of US military protection for the de facto ruler of the world’s top oil exporter, and to cement America’s military footprint in the Gulf. The prospective deal has, however, been scaled back.
Two other Gulf sources and three Western diplomats said the defence deal falls short of the full, Congress-ratified treaty Riyadh once sought in exchange for the long-promised normalisation of ties with Israel.
The agreement, loosely modelled on an arrangement with Qatar that was established through an executive order in September, expands cooperation to include cutting-edge technology and defence.
Riyadh, according to the two Gulf sources, pushed for provisions to allow future US administrations to elevate the pact to a full treaty — a safeguard to ensure continuity for a non-binding pact, vulnerable to reversal by future presidents.
“It’s not the treaty they want; they might not see it as perfect, but it’s a stepping stone [to a full treaty],” said David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute, where he directs a project on Arab-Israeli relations.
The linkage between the defence pact, normalisation with Israel and Palestinian statehood has produced a complex negotiating equation, pushing Riyadh and Washington to settle for a limited defence deal in the absence of progress on the other two tracks, the Gulf sources and Western diplomats said.
That compromise, they say, could eventually evolve into a full treaty if normalisation advances.
“The Saudi-American negotiations have undergone a fundamental shift in environment and context following the developments in Gaza since October 7,” said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Institute think tank.
He said the direct linkage between normalisation of ties with Israel and Palestinian statehood remained, but Riyadh now wanted Saudi national security requirements addressed separately.
“The Saudi position is clear: meeting the Kingdom’s national security demands will help shape its broader stance on regional issues, including the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” he said.
Threat from Iran receding
A Nato-style defence pact appears a distant prospect, given the shifting regional calculus and the political hurdles in Washington.
Iran, the main threat once driving Riyadh’s pursuit of binding US guarantees, has been strategically weakened over the past year by Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure.
The Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen have also suffered heavy blows.
With pressure from Iran easing, the appetite for a treaty requiring two-thirds congressional approval has diminished, especially in the absence of normalisation with Israel.
The two Gulf sources said such a pact would likely come with conditions, including curbs on Saudi Arabia’s expanding economic and technology ties with China, complicating Riyadh’s drive to balance strategic autonomy with US security guarantees.
The current deal would expand joint military exercises, deepen cooperation between US and Saudi defence firms, and include safeguards to limit Riyadh’s military-industrial ties with China, the sources said.
It would also fast-track advanced US weapons sales to the kingdom, bypassing the delays and political hurdles that have stalled previous deals.</p><small>2025-11-09 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09184241554914f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954090/karachis-university-road-to-remain-closed-from-from-nov-10-dec-30-due-to-new-work' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s University Road to remain closed from from Nov 10-Dec 30 due to new work</strong></a><br><p>A new wave of road closures is set to cripple Karachi once again, as after the much-delayed Red Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project turned major arteries into construction zones, the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project (KWSSIP) is bringing fresh digging, roadblocks and traffic congestion to one of the city’s busiest corridors — University Road.
According to officials, a section of University Road between Nipa Chowrangi and Federal Urdu University will remain closed from November 10 to December 30.
“The closure is necessary for laying new 96-inch and 72-inch pipelines as part of the K-IV augmentation plan,” said a senior official. “This stretch, which is roughly 2.7 kilometres long, will form part of a new network that’s crucial for improving the city’s water supply.”
However, for millions of daily commuters, the Red Line BRT’s construction already brought endless congestion, dust, and frustration to residents of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Johar and adjoining areas.
The first phase of the new water project will cover the Nipa Chowrangi to Federal Urdu University stretch, while the second phase will extend from Hasan Square to Nipa Chowrangi, according to project documents.
Officials have set December 30 as the deadline, but many remain sceptical given the city’s track record of repeated delays and missed timelines.</p><small>2025-11-09 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091852100322c36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954093/pakistan-saudi-arabia-vow-to-deepen-defence-ties-enhance-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia vow to deepen defence ties, enhance bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries, a statement from the military’s media wing said.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the commitment was made during a meeting of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, with the Chief of General Staff of the Saudi Armed Forces, General Fayyadh bin Hamed Al-Ruwaili, in Saudi Arabia. The Pakistani official is on an official visit to the Kingdom.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the report said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”
 






In recognition of his significant contributions in deepening Pakistan-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relationship, in particular the military to military ties, the CJCSC was conferred with the “King Abdulaziz Medal of Honour of the Excellent Class,“ the report said.
It further added that the Saudi military leadership lauded the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In September, the two countries signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-11-09 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091634186d3679d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954086/afghan-taliban-used-talks-to-prolong-temporary-ceasefire-not-take-action-against-terrorism-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban used talks to prolong temporary ceasefire, not take action against terrorism: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday stated that the Afghan Taliban only participated in talks with Pakistan this past week to prolong a temporary ceasefire between the two nations and did not take any action against terrorist elements operating from their soil.
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands.
In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna-al-Khawarij) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/Fitna-al-Hindustan) elements present on Afghan soil.”
 
 

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.”
The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.”
Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.
The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action.
“Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.”
The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control.
“More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated.
“[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.”
The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.”
The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.”
The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s.
Narratives and propaganda
The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy.
“Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression.
Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan.
“It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read.
“More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.”
‘Strong lobby’
The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”.
“In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read.
“These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.”
Border clashes and talks
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.
However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”</p><small>2025-11-09 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091709218f0667e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954087/pakistan-saudi-arabia-formally-ink-haj-2026-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia formally ink Haj 2026 agreement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia formally signed an agreement for Haj 2026, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
According to the report, “Saudi Deputy Minister for Haj and Umrah Dr Abdulfattah Bin Sulaiman Mashat and Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs of Pakistan Dr Syed Ata-ur-Rehman signed the agreement in Jeddah on Saturday.”
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
Dr Syed Ata-ur-Rehman expressed gratitude for the Saudi government’s excellent efforts in hosting and providing facilities to the guests of Allah, the report added.
“Like last year, Pakistani pilgrims will be provided with high-quality services this year,” the report quoted Dr Rehman as saying.
The secretary further expressed the determination of the Ministry of Religious Affairs to complete arrangements for both government and private Haj schemes in a timely and effective manner, in accordance with the guidelines of the Saudi government.
In July, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistical measures for the pilgrimage season. The following month, the government started accepting Haj applications.
This year, the Kingdom allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators, according to the ministry.</p><small>2025-11-09 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09141258eab6037.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954078/ttap-rejects-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance TTAP rejects suggested ‘person-specific’ changes in Article 243</strong></a><br><p>Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Saturday rejected certain changes suggested to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment, claiming they were “person-specific”.
Yesterday, hours after the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act 2025 was tabled in the Senate, the TTAP announced a nationwide protest movement against the proposed legislation starting today.
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who leads the alliance, TTAP Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas addressed a joint press conference in Islamabad.
“Fundamentally, the concept of social contract implies how the state will take care of an individual’s basic rights. This is what the Constitution is all about,” Khokar noted. He stressed the concept of separation of powers provided in the 1973 Constitution, which meant that “no one institution will become so strong as to overpower other institutions”.
“Social contracts have nothing to do with personalities. The amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution are person-specific. They have been drafted by keeping in view the benefits of one position, the position of the field marshal,” Khokhar claimed.

Among the various proposals in the 27th Amendment bill are changes to the military leadership structure by rewriting Article 243 of the Constitution (command of the armed forces).
The bill proposes creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and abolishing the long-standing office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which was the top military role. If passed, the Amendment would also make the army chief the constitutionally recognised CDF, placing him at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.
The proposed legislation also vests broader, constitutionally protected powers and privileges in the country’s top military leadership.
 
 

Khokhar also termed the proposed lifetime immunity for the president from criminal proceedings as “person-specific”, quipping that the “theatre of the absurd” left the TTAP in surprise.
“These have no connection to the public […] half of Pakistan has gone below the poverty line, but the political, military and judicial elite are making amendments in the Constitution to protect themselves and attain their interests,” the former senator alleged.
“Why should we not think that this is to reward the existing judges in the Supreme Court whose retirements are due,” he added, contending that it was the duty of every segment of society to oppose such legislation.
Khokhar detailed the TTAP’s movement against the proposed Amendment, which included a National Consultative Conference to be held in Islamabad next week, where the future plan of action will be decided.
Khokhar stressed that the fundamental objection to the amendments was that the parliament was “not a representative” of the public as the “mandate was manufactured”, reiterating the rigging allegations during the February 2024 general elections.
The former senator also recalled the “way the 26th Amendment was passed”, indirectly referring to the claims of the PTI and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) of their leaders being pressured to vote in favour of it.
Khokhar also criticised the Supreme Court for playing the “most important role” in the preparations for the 27th Amendment by allotting the reserved seats to the ruling coalition parties. The ruling, given by the court’s Constitutional Bench formed under the 26th Amendment, struck down an earlier SC verdict that had declared the PTI eligible for those seats.
“They (coalition partners) then got the required number [of lawmakers], as a result of which today they are about to pass the 27th Amendment,” the politician contended.
“We can’t shy away from the facts before us. This parliament does not have the ethical or legal legitimacy to carry out such big amendments,” he asserted.
 


Meanwhile, Achakzai contended that the SC judges should have summoned those parties involved in the Amendment for “attacking the Constitution”. “Until the judges do this, we will take this case of Article 6 (high treason) before the public’s court.”
Addressing the media, the MWM chief detailed the suggested changes to Article 243 and said, “You are giving all the power to one person and making them the head of all, and giving them lifetime immunity. They are making another god.”
Abbas underscored the need for checks and controls on powers, adding that the country was “heading towards fascism”. He alleged that the public’s mandate was “stolen” in the 2024 elections.
“You have destroyed the parliament, as well as the judiciary, and now where are you taking the institution that has to protect Pakistan’s borders?” Abbas said.
“We promise our public to challenge this amendment as much as we can,” he asserted.
Course of action
Later, the opposition alliance also shared its planned course of action to resist the proposed legislation.
The TTAP said in a statement that a “national consultative conference” would be called in Islamabad to devise a strategy, adding that in case of the approval of the bill, a black day would be observed the next day after the development over the “violation and demolition of the Human Contract of 1973”.
It also urged “judges having conscience” to express their stance and reservations over the proposed legislation through letters or in press conferences.
The statement further stated that following the 27th Amendment, the Constitution would no longer be the one agreed upon in 1973 but “an insurance policy for protecting and prolonging the power of Pindi, Lahore and Larkana”.
In this connection, the TTAP stressed that either the Constitution be restored in its original form, as it was till the promulgation of the 18th Amendment, or a debate should be started in Pakistan for a new human contract.
A plan should be presented at the meeting in Islamabad for holding rallies and corner meetings across the country, and an initiative for building public opinion should be undertaken by forming a committee to begin meaningful consultation with and gain support of civil society, media and business community.
“Such committees should be formed up to the union council level and hold meetings with the influencial representatives of trader associations and neighbourhoods and farmers’ bodies.
“Article should be written for local and international newspapers and magazines to present the case of the people of Pakistan on a regular basis,” the statement read.
It further said that the participation of lawyer bodies in this movement should be ensured, and a delegation should be constituted to convince the retired judges of Supreme Court and high courts to participate in the movement or at least gain their support.
PTI parliamentary lea­der Barrister Ali Zafar has contended that the debate on the bill was inappropriate in the absence of a notified leader of the opposition. He accused the government and its allies of being in a “hurry” to pass the amendments.
However, the PML-N and the PPP have rejected the impression that the 27th Amendment bill was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.</p><small>2025-11-09 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09154911e28ebdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954084/turkiyes-top-officials-to-visit-pakistan-next-week-over-tensions-with-afghanistan-president-erdogan' target='_blank'><strong>Türkiye’s top officials to visit Pakistan next week over tensions with Afghanistan: President Erdogan</strong></a><br><p>Türkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin will visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday.
He made the announcement while speaking to reporters on his flight returning from Azerbaijan.
Talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down on Friday without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism, officials and sources said.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” Asif told Geo News, alleging that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and was unwilling to sign a written agreement.
A senior security source confirmed that discussions had hit an impasse. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” he said.
However, it is understood that a fragile ceasefire between the two countries is still holding. The defence minister also said that the truce stands for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks began on Thursday in Istanbul and was planned to continue for two days. Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.
The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
Reports from Istanbul suggest that the Pakistani delegation had left the hotel for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.
The ISI chief and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process. A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials have stayed behind to work with the mediators.
For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.
He added, “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism. They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”
The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Turkiye and Qatar then stepped in to mediate.
The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.
The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.
Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed on Friday that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islama­bad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive”, suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.
According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation”.
A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive”.
Iranian FM calls Pakistani, Afghan counterparts
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday spoke to his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul, the Iranian and Afghan foreign ministries said.
According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi announced Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.
“Expressing concern about the current situation between Afghanistan and Pakistan, he emphasised the need for continued dialogue between the two sides with the cooperation of influential countries in the region to resolve differences and reduce tension, and announced the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any kind of assistance to achieve this goal.
FM Dar, while explaining the latest situation and the results of the talks between his country and Afghanistan following recent developments, stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region, according to IRNA. The two sides also agreed to continue consultations in this regard.</p><small>2025-11-09 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09114136db963ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954074/syrian-president-arrives-in-us-for-landmark-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian president arrives in US for landmark visit</strong></a><br><p>Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa arrived in the United States on Saturday for a landmark official visit, his country’s state news agency reported, a day after Washington removed him from a terrorism blacklist.
Sharaa, whose rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad late last year, is due to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.
It’s the first such visit by a Syrian president since the country’s independence in 1946, according to analysts.
The interim leader met Trump for the first time in Riyadh during the US president’s regional tour in May.
US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said earlier this month that Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement to join the international US-led alliance against the militant Islamic State (IS) group.
The United States plans to establish a military base near Damascus “to coordinate humanitarian aid and observe developments between Syria and Israel”, a diplomatic source in Syria told AFP.
The State Department’s decision Friday to remove Sharaa from the blacklist was widely expected.
State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said Sharaa’s government had been meeting US demands, including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.
 
 

“These actions are being taken in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership after the departure of Bashar al-Assad and more than 50 years of repression under the Assad regime,” Pigott said.
The spokesman added that the US delisting would promote “regional security and stability as well as an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process.”
The Syrian interior ministry announced on Saturday that it had carried out 61 raids and made 71 arrests in a “proactive campaign to neutralise the threat” of IS, according to the official SANA news agency.
It said the raids targeted locations where IS sleeper cells remain, including Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs, Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and Damascus.
After his arrival in the United States, Sharaa shared a video on social media of him playing basketball with Centcom commander Brad Cooper and Kevin Lambert, the head of the international anti-IS operation in Iraq, alongside the caption “work hard, play harder”.
Transformation
Sharaa’s Washington trip comes after his landmark visit to the United Nations in September — his first time on US soil — where the ex-jihadist became the first Syrian president in decades to address the UN General Assembly in New York.
On Thursday, Washington led a vote by the Security Council to remove UN sanctions against him.
Formerly affiliated with Al-Qaeda, Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was delisted as a terrorist group by Washington as recently as July.
Since taking power, Syria’s new leaders have sought to break from their violent past and present a moderate image more tolerable to ordinary Syrians and foreign powers.
The White House visit “is further testament to the US commitment to the new Syria and a hugely symbolic moment for the country’s new leader, who thus marks another step in his astonishing transformation from militant leader to global statesman,” International Crisis Group US program director Michael Hanna said.
Sharaa is expected to seek funds for Syria, which faces significant challenges in rebuilding after 13 years of brutal civil war.
In October, the World Bank put a “conservative best estimate” of the cost of rebuilding Syria at $216 billion.</p><small>2025-11-09 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091319524033933.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954077/must-remain-fully-accountable-pm-shehbaz-orders-withdrawal-of-immunity-for-premier-in-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>‘Must remain fully accountable’: PM Shehbaz orders withdrawal of immunity for premier in 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday ordered the withdrawal of proposed immunity for the PM as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, urging that the premier must remain “fully accountable”.
Taking to X, he ordered the withdrawal of a clause seeking to grant immunity to the PM in the 27th Amendment and said, “On my return from Azerbaijan, I have learnt that some Senators belonging to our party have submitted an amendment regarding immunity for the prime minister.”
“While I acknowledge their intent in good faith, the proposal was not part of the Cabinet-approved draft. I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
 






“As a matter of principle, an elected prime minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people.”
Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking to reporters today, said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity,” owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister.
“The other positions being granted immunity do not have any executive functions,” Tarrar explained.
The statement comes as Senate and National Assembly committees continue to hold discussions on the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure. A set of clauses in the bill also proposes life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star ranks of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet.
 
 

Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47.
Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.
Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.”
On Saturday afternoon, the federal cabinet approved the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment, welcoming it to “the fullest extent.”
Subsequently, it was tabled before the Senate, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.
PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion.
It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.”</p><small>2025-11-09 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09130036677e6d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954076/redefining-disability-sana-bahadars-journey-to-global-squash-stardom' target='_blank'><strong>Redefining disability: Sana Bahadar’s journey to global squash stardom</strong></a><br><p>All was quiet in Sana Bahadar’s mind when she entered the squash court on the last day of October for her quarterfinal at the CNS Squash Championships. Her immediate aim: to clinch the fourth game and move a step closer to claiming another title.
It wasn’t to be. The hotly-contested first three games had been indicative of a battle to the end and Sana would soon have to put her body on the line to win when her opponent’s racket hit her in the throat. Struggling to breathe as she clutched her throat, Sana stumbled out the glass door and into the stands.
Her father, Sher, rushed over and crouched in front of her, asking what happened. He told a concerned referee rushing over that she had been hit in the throat, but the referee told him not to interfere during play.
“I was speaking for Sana because you don’t understand sign language,” Sher quipped to silence the referee. He opened his mouth to argue with Sher but shut it just as quickly, staring at the medical officer and Sher attending to Sana. Her opponent, Sadia Gul, eyed the cluster from across the arena.
Sana is entirely deaf and mute, and although she communicates using sign language, the rest of the world doesn’t.
The 19-year-old became the first deaf squash player in Pakistan and across Asia when she began competing a decade ago, followed by her younger brother Saifullah. Both only have 10 per cent of their hearing — able to hear a jet plane soaring above, but not a conversation someone is having with them.
This is how every squash game unfolds for Sana; not the rough play and string of injuries she’s unable to articulate, but the constant need for her father to step in and speak on her behalf. She signs to her father, he then speaks in Pashto, Urdu, English, depending on where in the world she’s competing. There were no accommodations for her deafness, no special training centres or sign language interpreters; this setup with Sher is all she has.
After a three-minute medical break, Sana signalled a thumbs-up to the referee to resume the fourth game, which she ultimately lost to Sadia despite protesting more foul play.
The deciding fifth game was equal parts aggression and theatrics; Sadia was arguing with the referee after calling him out on a first-name basis when he awarded the point to Sana; moments later, the duo collided and Sana slammed to the floor. At 10-10 game and match point, Sana equalled the score and roared in triumph to cheers from the sparse audience. Sadia was once again a single point away from winning when Sana turned the score 11-11, with the mildest of contact between the two players prompting Sadia to stumble backwards until she slammed into the court’s glass wall.
Moments later, Sadia hit her head against the wall and sent her racket flying, which Sana picked up and returned to her before offering a helping hand. The game point bounced between the two for a few more points until Sadia won it 16-14 to advance.
They embraced before walking off court. Sana clapped her hand against her racket to thank the referee before slumping down next to her father and brother.
Tempers flaring, Sher walked up to Sadia and congratulated her before accusing her of foul play.
Hours later that Friday evening at the Koh-e-Noor Hotel, Sher had calmed down. He kicked off a shoe and tucked one foot under his thigh as he sat on the edge of his bed. Sana and her brother, Saif, were playfully wrestling on another bed in the narrow room. Sana gestured to her throat and opened a fist as though holding a cricket ball to emphasise how much her throat had swollen.
“Believe me, I’ve cried three or four times today since the match,” Sher said slowly as he looked down at his dark grey kameez. The air in the room hung heavy, punctured only by the flashing light of Sana’s phone buzzing for a notification. His children were oblivious of the conversation unfolding, just as they were to almost everything other than squash.
Neither was aware that Sher had already emailed the Professional Squash Association (PSA) asking them to independently review and assess the match footage. He alleged that unqualified “referees” officiating local matches like these were why foul play was allowed unabated.
“Sana works so hard,” Sher continued after a deep breath. “The angst of this match kept her up till midnight last night. “I told her I want her to be happy, not just win in this sport.”

Squash was unaffordable for a young Sher from a middle class family in Charsadda, some 42 kilometres from Peshawar where he lives now. Watching squash matches on a tiny black-and white Russian TV set they owned was the closest he ever got to the sport.
“I’ve instilled what I call ‘Charsadda discipline’ in her; I don’t want to teach her to be snide or do anything that brings dishonour to where I’m from.
“When we compete abroad, I want Sana to hold herself in a way that brings respect to Pakistan, and to herself,” Sher said.
Contrary to the CNS quarterfinal, Sana’s international matches end with Sher being showered with praise for Sana’s exceptional skills on court, her sportsmanship, her vibrant personality and equally glowing smile.
When asked what squash means to her, Sana signed that it pulled her out from the cloak of invisibility her deafness put her under.
“I was a nobody when I was younger. But when I started playing squash, people began to recognise me,” Sana signed to her father, who then translated in Urdu. She tugged the Pakistan logo on her shirt and signed that it was a dream come true to don the green jersey.
“They began acknowledging me, greeting me, taking pictures with me. I’ve become famous, and it makes me really happy,” she signed, her smile growing wider when she said top ranked players Nour El Sherbini and Nouran Gohar wanted photos with her, in awe of her capabilities. Most of her opponents have never competed against a deaf player before.
Sana has close to a dozen national titles to her name and was ranked No. 1 in all the national age-group categories through the years. She’s also bagged a handful of international titles while competing across Australia and the US, where she reached a career-high PSA ranking of 212.
Sher has scraped together money to finance international tours that most squash players attain through long-term sponsorships, which Sana has only ever had in the short run. He knows that if given more exposure through international competitions, Sana would make it to the upper echelons of squash rankings.
Financial shortfalls aside, Sana and Saif have come to experience a “normal” life because Sher challenged the limitations of disability imposed on them. He chaperones them everywhere and translates conversations for them, picks and drops them from every practice session, wakes up at 5am for physical training before school.
But his devotion has come at a price. Age is catching up with him, and worries for his children’s future often seep into the present.
“I pray to Allah for life and courage because 10 years like this has been exhausting, and I often get disheartened,” he admitted quietly as he stared at his hands. Even so, he does his best for his children and leaves his fate in the hands of Allah and the blessings of his aged parents.
Ironically, Sher has literally outrun age catching up to him as he joins Sana during her morning runs before school. “If she runs 4 kilometres for training, I run it with her. I do everything in tandem so she feels like she has my support,” Sher said.
“Even today’s fight is a win for her — she learned what life is like, and what hurdles she’ll have to face.”
Sana’s journey ahead is long. She wants to be the contemporary version of Pakistani champions like Jansher Khan and Qamar Zaman, who once dominated the sport’s hall of fame. “We’ve come this far, and we’ll keep going till we reach that goal,” Sher said.

• Supporters believe new constitutional court will modernise judiciary
ISLAMABAD: The initial draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, ta­­b­led in the Senate on Saturday, has led many legal experts to believe that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the Sup­r­e­­me Court as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to a proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
However, proponents of the amendment say the new constitutional court would modernise the judiciary, reduce backlogs and separate constitutional and appellate jurisdictions — a reform they argue will improve efficiency and clarity in the justice system.
“Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’,” remarked a senior counsel who asked not to be named.
He warned that the government could now amend laws like the Elections Act 2017 and others to route appeals to the FCC instead of the Supreme Court.
 
 

Amendment to Article 175, he said, was “virtually the end of the judiciary as we knew it”, arguing that the Supreme Court had been “amended out of the Constitution by making it irrelevant”.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar said the essence of the package was twofold.
First, the insertion of a new Chapter 1A in the Constitution that, in his view, tightens executive control over the superior judiciary through expanded powers to transfer high court judges, and establishes an FCC “empowered by disempowering the Supreme Court”.
Second, an amendment to Article 243 that formally vests the office of Chief of the Defence Forces in the Chief of the Army Staff and constitutionally guarantees the Field Marshal rank for life.
 
 

Another lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the senior-most of the two chiefs would chair the Judicial Commission of Pakis­tan, “for all other purposes, the FCC will be in the commanding position”.
He pointed out that wherever the oaths of judges of the Supreme Court and FCC are mentioned, the FCC is referenced first. “It is clear now which court is higher in terms of hierarchy,” he said.
He noted that under the amended Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC is listed before the chief justice of the Supreme Court and will have a longer tenure, retiring at 68, compared to the current retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court judges.
‘Forward-looking reform model’
In contrast, senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar welcomed the initiative, calling the proposed 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in the justice system.
He said the creation of two separate apex courts — the existing Supreme Cou­rt dealing primarily with appellate functions, and a new FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, inter-governmental disputes and matters arising under Article 199 — ref­lected “a forward-looking reform model”.
This division, he argued, would bring Pakistan closer to systems in many established democracies where constitutional and advisory jurisdictions are institutionally distinct, providing “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence”.
He said the reforms could help depoliticise the higher judiciary, eliminate internal divisions, reduce backlogs and prevent overlapping between constitutional and appellate benches.
Mr Khokhar said the amendments to Article 243 were in line with “modern constitutional democracies”, with a unified advisory framework under a principal military adviser answerable to the prime minister, the defence minister and the National Security Committee.
Meanwhile, newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rasheed supported the idea of setting up an FCC, and said the association was considering convening an All Pakistan Lawyers Convention, in consultation with the Pakistan Bar Council and other bar bodies.
“I am glad that an FCC is being established in the country by amending the Constitution with consensus and unanimity,” he said.

Here are some of the developments this year in climate science:
Warmer, faster
Global temperatures are not just climbing, they are now climbing faster than before, with new records logged for 2023 and 2024, and at points in 2025. That finding was part of a key study in June that updated baseline data used in the science reports done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27 degrees Celsius each decade — or almost 50 per cent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2°C per decade.
 
 

Sea levels are rising faster now too — at about 4.5 millimetres per year over the last decade, compared with 1.85 mm per year measured across the decades since 1900.
The world is now on track to cross the 1.5°C warming threshold around 2030, after which scientists warn we will likely trigger catastrophic, irreversible impacts. Already, the world has warmed by 1.3-1.4°C since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.
Tipping points
Warm-water corals are in an almost irreversible die-off from successive marine heatwaves — marking what would be the first so-called climate tipping point, when an environmental system begins to shift into a different state.
Researchers in October also warned that the Amazon rainforest could begin to die back and transform into a different ecosystem, such as savannah, if rapid deforestation continues as global warming crosses 1.5°C, which is earlier than previously estimated.
They said meltwater from the thawing ice sheet atop Greenland could help cause an earlier collapse in the ocean current called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, that keeps winters mild in Europe.
In Antarctica, where ice sheets are also under threat, scientists are worried about declining sea ice surrounding the southernmost continent. Similar to what is happening in the Arctic, ice loss exposes dark water that can absorb more solar radiation — which amplifies the overall warming trend. It also jeopardises the growth of phytoplankton that consume much of the world’s CO2.
Land on fire
Along with heatwaves and drought, wildfires still threaten to be frequent and severe.
This year’s State of Wildfires report, led by a group of weather agencies and universities, counted some 3.7 million square kilometres as having burned between March 2024 and February 2025 — an area about the size of India and Norway combined.
That was slightly less than the annual average burned for the last two decades. But the fires produced higher CO2 emissions than before, as more carbon-dense forests burned.
Deadly heat
Researchers are working on ways to assess heat-related health risks and tolls, as UN health and weather agencies estimate about half the world’s population is already struggling.
 
 

The agencies also estimate worker productivity dropping 2-3pc for every degree above 20°C, while another study in the Lancet journal in October estimates global losses of more than $1 trillion from that lost productivity for last year alone.
There is no consistent international definition for a heat-related death, but technological advances are helping scientists to bridge data gaps and compare conditions from place to place.
For example, in Europe, one team at the UK’s Imperial College used mortality trends to estimate more than 24,400 deaths this summer related to heat exposure across about 30pc of the European population.
They attributed up to 70pc of those deaths to climate-fueled heat, based on the same mortality trends applied to a model of Europe without global warming.
For last year’s record-hot European summer, another team used computer modelling to examine mortality statistics along with temperature data and health parameters, estimating more than 62,700 heat-related deaths across 32 countries, or about 70pc of the continent’s population.
Science under attack
The US administration under climate-denying President Donald Trump is hoping to slash funding for agencies that collect and monitor climate and weather data, worrying a scientific community that says US leadership will be hard to replace.
 
 

Trump’s 2026 budget request, yet to be approved by Congress, proposes halving the annual budget for NASA Earth Science to about $1 billion and cutting NOAA’s spending by more than a quarter to $4.5bn while eliminating its climate research arm, among other cuts.
Elsewhere, however, public science spending is increasing, with record budgets for science research in China, the UK, Japan, and the European Union. The EU also last month opened its real-time weather data monitoring to public access.</p><small>2025-11-09 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08213126ff3ddc6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953906/pml-n-ppp-dismiss-claims-of-27th-constitutional-amendment-being-passed-in-haste' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N, PPP dismiss claims of 27th Constitutional Amendment being passed in haste</strong></a><br><p>The PML-N and the PPP on Saturday rejected the impression that the 27th Constitutional Amendment was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.
Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said there was “no urgency” in convening the cabinet meeting even though Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the session virtually from Baku, Azerbaijan.
Malik said there was “a lot of discussion” about the proposed constitutional amendment, adding that deliberations were continuing within party committees and that it was the parliamentarians’ right to propose amendments.
He maintained that a “wrong impression” had been created that the process was being hurried. The state minister also said that some changes can be made to the draft as it is under debate in parliamentary committees.
When informed by the show’s host that the 18th Amendment was passed after over a year of consultations and the 26th Amendment was debated for more than a month, while the proposed 27th Amendment appeared to have moved from draft to agreement in less than a week, with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari receiving the draft on Monday, holding a Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting, and reaching consensus shortly after, Malik acknowledged the unusually rapid pace of the process.
PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan, however, credited his party, highlighting that hours-long sessions were held during the two-day CEC, with every member participating in a detailed and open discussion on issues ranging from Article 243 to dual nationality. He assured that there was adequate debate within the PPP on the proposed changes.
“If law-making is done in a hurry, the public becomes suspicious for no reason,” Chan said.
When asked about revision in the NFC formula, Chan said that the federation grants tax exemptions worth Rs300 billion and oversees around 25 departments that do not even conduct audits.
“You cannot fix your own tax system and then say you will take money from the provinces,” he said.
The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar, who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting), requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
The PTI did not attend the subsequent session of the parliamentary committees and called it a “conspiracy against the Constitution”.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-09 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08200814a5716e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953897/pti-terms-27th-amendment-conspiracy-against-the-constitution-boycotts-committee-discussions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI terms 27th Amendment ‘conspiracy against the Constitution’, boycotts committee discussions</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has called the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution” and refused to become part of the proceedings of the committee established to discuss the bill.
“The proposed 27th Amendment is nothing short of a conspiracy against the Constitution. The entire process is being carried out in haste, without consultation or deliberation, in complete disregard of democratic norms and parliamentary traditions,” Senator Ali Zafar said while talking to Dawn.
“These amendments strike at the very foundation of the constitutional structure by undermining the independence of the judiciary and eroding the delicate balance of powers that the 1973 Constitution so carefully created,” he said.
“Any change to the Constitution must come only through broad-based national consensus, not through secret drafts or executive dictates. The Constitution belongs to the people of Pakistan, not to any government of the day, and no one has the right to mutilate it for political convenience,” Senator Zafar said while explaining why his party has decided not to become part of the debate.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said the proposed constitutional amendment is a “ploy to enslave us”.
“Subjugating the Supreme Court to a new court, whose judges will be the favorites of the current Form 47 government, is to turn the judicial system into an instrument of coercion,” said the PTI leader in a post on X.
 






Former Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said that PTI has a clear stance that the current parliament cannot do any legislation as it lacks the mandate of the masses.
“We will use all possible tactics and platforms, including protest, to stop the legislation. I believe that fresh elections should be held before any such legislation because the current government is a Form-47 government and it does not have the mandate of the people,” he explained.
Asad Qaiser said that a meeting of the party leadership will be called to devise further strategy to resist the move.
Earlier, while talking to the media outside the Parliament, Senator Zafar claimed that the draft of the 27th Amendment had 50 amendments.
He said it was strange that the amendments were being made without sharing them with the masses. Zafar added that his party’s Senators would not be able to discuss the amendment in the committee, as they had not read the bill.
Replying to a question, he said that the civil society, legislators and other stakeholders discussed the draft of the 18th Amendment for over a year and gave their recommendations and proposals, but this time “efforts were being made to pass the amendment in haste”.
Senator Zafar said that it was unfortunate that the spirit of the 1973 Constitution was being changed, and the PPP is supporting it.
Earlier today,  the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
The bill proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.

He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the Awami National Party (ANP) and the PML-Zia.
However, there was no meeting between the government and the PTI.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-09 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/090852203c99ddb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953943/sindh-high-court-decides-to-examine-whole-concept-of-keeping-zoos-and-caging-animals' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh High Court decides to examine ‘whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals’</strong></a><br><p>• After Rano’s relocation to Islamabad, bench broadens scope of petition to welfare of all zoo animals
• In written order released on Saturday, court orders formation of new committee comprising govt officials and civil society members
to inspect zoos across Sindh
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered formation of a new committee to visit zoos across the province and suggest steps for improvement as well as sending the exotic animals to their natural habitats.
Inviting suggestions to phase out zoos in the entire province, a two-judge SHC bench comprising Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah declared that the court had decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.
The remarks were part of a written order issued on Saturday regarding the Nov 6 hearing of a petition seeking shifting of lone female bear Rano from Karachi Zoological Gardens to Bear Sanctuary, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
The order stated that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and other respondents filed statements and reports and submitted that Rano had been successfully transported to the federal capital on Nov 5 in compliance with the orders issued by the bench earlier.
However, the bench enhanced the scope of the petition from Rano to the welfare of all animals kept in zoos and invited suggestions as to how to phase out zoos in the entire province.
Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar proposed that a committee may be constituted with the municipal commissioner, forest & wildlife secretary, wildlife conservator and KMC’s senior director-zoo as its members.
 
 

Representing the petitioner, Mohammad Jibran Nasir also suggested that philanthropist Ava Ardeshir Cowasjee, Dr Uzma Khan from Asia lead for WWF Pakistan, Advocate Nazia Hanjrah, Zhalay Sarhadi and petitioner/animal rights activist Jude Allen Preira may also be made part of the committee.
The bench ordered constitution of the committee and inclusion of all the names suggested by the wildlife conservator and the petitioner’s counsel.
The bench in its order stated: “In addition, the committee shall be given mandate to co-opt experts of the subject fields, who shall visit the zoos in the province and suggests steps for improvement in the zoos and identify issues being confronted by them at the moment to resolve them as a short term measure. As a long term measures, they shall recommend steps to be taken which may include but not limited to sending the exotic animals to their natural habitat.”
It further stated that as per the petitioner’s counsel the committee, constituted by the chief minister for shifting of Rano, had visited Karachi Zoo and found all the medical equipment out of order.
 
 

The bench stated that Zoo Director Aklaq Ahmed Yousufzai had undertaken to replace all out-of-order machines immediately and to outsource vets for treatment of the animals.
The hearing was adjourned till Nov 21.
At a previous hearing, the bench had directed the committee formed by the CM to visit the Karachi zoo and prepare a detailed report about the number of animals kept there as well as their physical and mental health.
It also asked the committee to examine the circumstances under which animals are being kept as well as to identify the animals as natives or exotic and must also make recommendations for improving the situation if it found the animals were kept in improper conditions.
The bench further ruled that since the issue was not of one bear but hundreds of animals being kept in captivity apparently just for entertainment of people and court has decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.

Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
The TTAP is a coalition of six opposition parties and was formed last year. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, in a video statement, said the protest movement would begin from November 9 (Sunday).
 






Abbas said that democratic institutions in the country have been “paralysed” and the “nation must step up”. Lamenting the proposed changes, he said the government was given even more power through “to the powerful”.
“In this hour, it is the responsibility of the people of Pakistan to take a stand and speak against such an extremely dark and extremely dangerous constitutional amendment, which is the 27th (Amendment).
Leader of the opposition-designate Achakzai said the alliance, through the protest movement, will show that the “will of the people” of Pakistan will be the final decision.
“I have given an oath, at least on five different occasions, that I will safeguard the Constitution. Our parliament is attacking our Constitution,” said the PkMAP leader, who is also the chairman of the opposition alliance.
He added that as the parliament is representative of the people, the opposition alliance is approaching the masses directly. “The way they are attacking the parliament, and the manner in which they are shaking the foundations of the Constitution and Pakistan, we are left with no other option.”
Achakzai appealed to all political parties to participate and said their movement would kick off on Sunday night. “Every night, with a new slogan, we will awaken the consciousness of the people. The slogan of the people is the supremacy of the Constitution,” added the veteran politician.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
Key clauses of the proposed amendment
Tarar, while tabling the bill in the Senate, said it would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.
“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-09 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091036503df80be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954056/essay-when-was-allama-iqbal-actually-born' target='_blank'><strong>ESSAY: WHEN WAS ALLAMA IQBAL ACTUALLY BORN?</strong></a><br><p> 

Allama Iqbal

Allama Iqbal’s date of birth has always been a contentious issue among scholars. Though the government of Pakistan had officially declared November 9, 1877 as Iqbal’s date of birth and the year 1977 was celebrated as Iqbal centennial year, some scholars have had their doubts and argued that it could not be said with absolute certainty that Iqbal was born on the official date.
A great many articles have been written, both in Urdu and English, elaborating the issue of Iqbal’s date of birth. Going through these articles and some books — notably Allama Iqbal Ki Tareekh-i-Vilaadat: Aik Mutal’a, compiled by Waheed Qureshi and Zahid Muneer Aamir (Bazm-i-Iqbal, Lahore, 1994) — there are some interesting facts which emerge. Firstly, during the last 100 years or so, scholars have mentioned different dates while discussing Iqbal’s life. Second, despite the official announcement, disagreement still exists on Iqbal’s correct date of birth.
Akber Hyderi Kashmiri, an Indian scholar, in his article published in Nuqoosh’s special issue on Iqbal (1977) listed contrasting years that different writers had mentioned as Iqbal’s birth year. These included: 1870, 1872, 1873, 1875, 1876 and 1877.
Muhammaduddin Fauq (1877-1945), editor of Kashmiri Magazine, was among the scholars who penned the earliest writings on Iqbal. Fauq had mentioned 1875 as Iqbal’s year of birth, in his article published in 1909, but when Zulfiqar Ali Khan — in his book A Voice from the East (1922) — said Iqbal was born in or around 1876, Fauq changed his stance and, in Nairang-i-Khayal’s special issue on Iqbal (1932) wrote that Iqbal was born in 1876.

Today, November 9, is celebrated as Muhammad Iqbal’s birthday and Iqbal Day every year. But there is still debate about Allama Iqbal’s actual date and year of birth

One of the reasons for this confusion was Iqbal’s own indifference to his year of birth. Once, when Fauq tried to gather some biographical details, Iqbal did not cooperate and wrote back in a letter (1922) saying that “there was nothing in it.”
Dates and debates
Scholars had been quoting different years as to when Iqbal was born, but an editorial note and its correction in Inqelaab, one of Lahore’s leading newspapers at that time, sparked a debate that lives on even today.
Inqelaab had published, after Iqbal’s death (April 21, 1938), December 1876 as the month and year of Iqbal’s birth. But in its May 7, 1938 issue, another editorial note appeared, saying that Iqbal’s date of birth mentioned in a previous issue was based on what Sheikh Ata Muhammad, Iqbal’s real brother, had said. The note further said that it was established after research that Iqbal’s correct date of birth was February 22, 1873 and, according to the Islamic calendar, it was Zilhaj 23/24, 1289 Hijri.
This caught on and some writers began to quote Iqbal’s newly assumed date of birth. For instance, Muhammad Tahir Farooqi, in his Seerat-e-Iqbal (1939), wrote that he was born on 24 Zilhaj 1289, which corresponded to February 22, 1873. In 1951, the government’s archaeology department sent a letter to Bazm-i-Iqbal, Lahore, asking for the authentic date on which Iqbal was born, wrote Waheed Qureshi. Bazm-i-Iqbal constituted a committee which, after obtaining some records from Sialkot’s Municipal Committee and others from Iqbal’s school and college, discussed the issue in detail to resolve that Iqbal was born on February 22, 1873.
The committee decided to convey the date to the archaeology department to amend the year of Iqbal’s birth inscribed on his tombstone, which read 1292 Hijri (corresponding to 1875-76). Interestingly, the tombstone had been presented by the government of Afghanistan and nobody knew where they had got the year from.
With this authentication from Bazm-i-Iqbal, some writers — such as Abdul Majeed Salik in his Zikr-i-Iqbal (1955) — mentioned February 22, 1873 as Iqbal’s date of birth. Also, Pakistan’s postal department issued a commemorative postage stamp on Iqbal’s 20th death anniversary in 1958 and it carried 1873 as Iqbal’s year of birth.
Iqbal’s own account
But in 1958, Prof Jan Marek of Prague University published a research paper titled ‘The Date of Muhammad Iqbal’s Birth’ in which he said that, according to Iqbal’s own account, he was born on Ziquad 3, 1294 Hijri, in Sialkot which, according to the Gregorian calendar, was November 9, 1877, though Iqbal had mistakenly thought that it corresponded with 1876.
The renowned German scholar Dr Annemarie Schimmel wrote in Gabriel’s Wing that “9th November 1877 would correspond to this hijra date and this date would match also better with the different phases of Iqbal’s life in college and university than 1873” (Iqbal Academy, Lahore, p.35).
Faqeer Vaheeduddin, Abdul Vahid Moini and some other scholars agreed that Iqbal had wrongly assumed that 1294 Hijri would correspond to 1876 and his correct date of birth was Nov 9, 1877. So it was generally accepted as Iqbal’s correct date of birth and Pakistan’s postal department issued two commemorative postage stamps on April 21, 1967, giving 1877 as Iqbal’s year of birth.
Further research
In 1971, Khalid Nazeer Sufi, who was related to Iqbal, published his book Iqbal Daroon-i-Khana and in it, quoting from Sialkot Municipality’s register of births and deaths, he claimed that, as per the record, Iqbal was born on December 29, 1873.
To discuss the issue, Bazm-i-Iqbal, Lahore, constituted a sub-committee in 1972. On the committee were renowned scholars like Syed Nazeer Niazi and Allama Iqbal’s son Justice Dr Javid Iqbal and others. Later on, Waheed Qureshi, too, was included in the committee and he and two other members of the committee visited Sialkot to obtain the records.
Government committees
While Bazm-i-Iqbal’s sub-committee was still researching the matter, the government of India announced the formation of a committee, with the then prime minister Indira Gandhi as its head, to celebrate Iqbal’s centennial in 1973, assuming that Iqbal was born in 1873. This prompted the Pakistan government to declare that Iqbal’s centenary would be celebrated on a grand scale here, too.
But the issue of Iqbal’s correct date of birth, however, was yet to be resolved. To settle the issue, a committee was constituted by the government of Pakistan. So Bazm-i-Iqbal’s sub-committee stopped its work. The committee formed by the government, after deliberations, decided that the date of birth mentioned by Iqbal himself in his PhD dissertation, ie November 9, 1877, should be accepted as authentic.
Disagreement
But some members included in the government’s committee, such as Waheed Qureshi and Hameed Ahmed Khan, disagreed and insisted on adding a clause to their work that said “until no further evidence is available, November 9, 1877, should be accepted as Iqbal’s date of birth.” In other words, they had accepted this date tentatively. But when the official announcement was made, the clause was missing and it was officially pronounced that the year 1977 was to be celebrated as Iqbal’s centenary year.
At least four scholars, Khalid Nazeer Sufi, Dr Waheed Qureshi, Malik Ram and Dr Akber Hyderi Kashmiri, were of the view that it was more probable that Iqbal’s correct date of birth was December 29, 1873. Waheed Qureshi in Nuqoosh’s Iqbal number (vol. 2) and Malik Ram in his book Tehqeeqi Mazameen have discussed the issue in detail.
The three dates
Of three dates, often quoted as Iqbal’s correct date of birth, the first one is February 22, 1873. Inqelaab wrote that it was based on Sialkot’s Municipality’s records. But Justice Dr Javid Iqbal, Iqbal’s son, quoting senior members of his family, said that this date referred to a baby boy born to Iqbal’s parents before Iqbal’s birth and that boy died in infancy.
The second date, December 29, 1873, is — as claimed by Khalid Nazeer Sufi — recorded in Sialkot’s Municipal register of births and deaths. Sufi’s claim was rejected by Javid Iqbal on the basis that the entry assumingly referring to Iqbal, in fact, belonged to a baby boy whose father shared the same name as Iqbal’s father. Also, the other details, such as father’s caste and profession mentioned in the register, did not match with Iqbal’s father.
But Waheed Qureshi, while mentioning Iqbal’s educational records and the years in which Iqbal attended certain educational institutes, said this date was most probably Iqbal’s correct date of birth, as it coincided with Iqbal’s life events. Malik Ram, too, said that if this date is accepted as Iqbal’s date of birth, the other events of his life, such as passing certain exams at educational institutes, fitted in well.
As for November 9, 1877, it is not recorded in Sialkot’s Municipal register. But it can be safely assumed that, for some reason, the birth was not reported to the municipality and not being reported is not a proof of not being born. What gives credence to this date is that Iqbal himself mentioned it in his doctoral dissertation note, though he had mistakenly written 1876 instead of 1877.
On the basis of this evidence, some scholars believe November 9, 1877, should be accepted as Iqbal’s correct date of birth.

The cleric from Punjab’s Attock district had once served quietly as a government-appointed prayer leader in Lahore. Yet, by 2015, he had emerged as the fiery voice behind rallies demanding the release of Mumtaz Qadri, the police guard who had murdered Punjab governor Salman Taseer in 2011 over his views on Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.
Rizvi was, by all appearances, an unlikely revolutionary. Paralysed after a 2006 road accident, he spoke with a mix of crude Punjabi humour, caustic wit and eloquent Urdu, often quoting Allama Iqbal to give profound gravity to his fiery sermons.
Initially attracting only a small following from the Barelvi school of thought, Rizvi’s fusion of intense religious fervour and populist anger quickly resonated across Pakistan’s disillusioned and devout segments. His thunderous speeches transformed him from a fringe preacher into the architect of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a group capable of mobilising massive rallies and paralysing entire cities.
Five years after Rizvi died in 2020, the TLP has not only survived but also thrived under his son, Saad Rizvi. The movement has cemented its status as one of Pakistan’s most volatile and potent political forces, blurring the boundaries between religious extremism, political populism and state authority.

The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) is once again facing a ban after being accused of being involved in terrorism. Five years after the death of its founder Khadim Hussain Rizvi, his party remains one of the country’s most disruptive political forces. But the TLP’s story is not just about weaponisation of religion — it’s about class, power and a state caught between crackdown and appeasement

This October, familiar scenes of unrest resurfaced following a protest call by the TLP. Major cities, including Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, came to a standstill as mobile services were suspended, schools closed and highways blocked with shipping containers. Clashes near Lahore turned deadly, reigniting memories of the group’s previous confrontations with the state. In response, the government once again imposed a ban on TLP under anti-terrorism laws.
 
 

Yet, as many analysts note, such prohibitions may restrict the group’s legal status but do little to diminish its ideological influence, particularly on the deeply sensitive issue of blasphemy in Pakistan.
To understand this enduring paradox, this piece traces the TLP’s trajectory: from its rise through blasphemy politics and the revival of Barelvi identity, and the state’s continuing struggle to contain the growing political power of faith on Pakistan’s streets.
THE BARELVI POLITICAL AWAKENING
For many, the TLP’s rise was not a disruption but a long-awaited moment of identity assertion. It is the awakening of Pakistan’s Barelvi community, a vast majority who have long felt both politically and religiously marginalised.
“The TLP is not just politics for us, it is the powerful reclamation of our Barelvi identity,” Aamir Mustafai, a teacher at a local madrassa [seminary] in Punjab’s Jhelum district, told me during the 2024 election campaign. “This is the continuation of a forgotten struggle, echoing the same battle for dignity and faith that Syed Ahmad Barelvi led against the Sikh Empire in Punjab generations ago.”
The Barelvi school of thought has historically had a strong influence among Pakistan’s rural populace, due to its deep association with Sufi orders and shrine networks. Politically, the Barelvi movement found its organised expression in the post-Independence era through the urban-based Jamiat-i-Ulema Pakistan (JUP). 
Under the leadership of Allama Shah Ahmad Noorani, a Karachi cleric, the JUP rose to national prominence as he unified fragmented Barelvi clerics and revived the party in the late 1960s, leading it into the 1970 general elections. However, its political strength was centred in urban Sindh, especially Karachi and Hyderabad, where it won seven National Assembly seats, the peak of organised Barelvi representation. By the 1980s, however, the rise of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and deepening internal rifts pushed the JUP into political obscurity.
Analysts note that this decline was further compounded by Cold War-era geopolitics. After the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan’s Deobandi institutions emerged as the principal intellectual and logistical backbone of the Afghan ‘jihad’, benefitting from state patronage, US support and Gulf funding.
“In the decades that followed,” says Israr Madani, an Islamabad-based researcher studying Islamist movements, “the influence of Deobandi scholars, madrassas, religious parties and militant groups expanded across the region, especially after the rise of the Taliban, which drew heavily on Deobandi ideology and networks. In contrast, the Barelvis increasingly felt invisible and irrelevant in the political and religious landscape, despite being a demographic majority.”
In this vacuum, new urban-based actors emerged. Saleem Qadri, a Karachi cleric, founded the Sunni Tehreek (ST) in 1990, to militantly protect Barelvi mosques from encroachment by Deobandi and Ahl-i-Hadith (Salafi) groups. Its slogan, “Jawaniyaan lutayein gey, masjidein bachayein gey [We will sacrifice our lives to protect our mosques]”, reflected its militant defensive posture. 
But following Noorani’s death in 2003, the JUP weakened further, and the ST’s influence waned after its leadership was killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi in 2006. 
Barelvi clerics, grounded in Sufi traditions of devotion and restraint, largely avoided the jihadist and sectarian conflicts of the era. This distance, as Mustafai noted, “made us invisible and irrelevant.” The community eventually sought a more assertive voice, one it ultimately found in the TLP’s aggressive political activism.
Now, the centre of power of Barelvi politics had moved from the urban centres of Karachi to the rural and small-town populace of Punjab. Furthermore, the nature of leadership shifted from Noorani’s intellectual-clerical approach to Rizvi’s populist mobilisation, focused intensely on the issue of blasphemy.

THE POLITICS OF BLASPHEMY
“Gustakh-i-Rasool ki ek hi saza, sar tan se juda [The only punishment for blasphemy is beheading]” has become the defining chant of TLP rallies, encapsulating both the group’s ideological core and the mechanism through which it mobilises large crowds. 
The TLP emerged directly from the campaign to defend the convicted Qadri. Qadri’s execution in 2016, after the government’s resistance to immense pressure, became a formative moment in Pakistan’s modern religious politics. The vast, impassioned crowds at his funeral showed the dormant strength of Barelvi supporters across Punjab and Sindh, a constituency long considered apolitical or organisationally fragmented.
In the days following the funeral, senior Barelvi clerics convened in Islamabad to deliberate the future political direction of their community. Some advocated restraint, warning against politicising devotional sentiment. However, a majority endorsed Rizvi’s call to form a new movement capable of channelling Barelvi grievances into organised political influence. The result was the creation of the Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah, later renamed as the TLP.
The group entered electoral politics in January 2017 at Karachi’s Nishtar Park and gained national attention that same year by contesting a Lahore by-election. This transition marked its evolution from a street protest movement into an organised political force, willing to confront the state through both ballots and large-scale blockades.
TLP’s rapid rise is rooted in its strategic — critics say weaponised — use of Pakistan’s stringent blasphemy laws. By portraying Qadri as a martyr and redefining religious devotion as political resistance, the party transformed traditional Barelvi piety into a defiant and uncompromising street movement, sharply diverging from the sect’s historically Sufi orientation.
The party first tested the state’s limits in 2017, when it staged a weeks-long sit-in near Islamabad over a minor amendment to the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat [Seal of the Prophets] oath in the Election Act. The protest brought Islamabad to a standstill and ended only after the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government conceded to the group’s demands, including the resignation of the law minister.
A year later, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government faced similar pressure over the appointment of Princeton economist Atif R. Mian, an Ahmadi, forcing his removal. And when the Supreme Court in 2018 acquitted Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, TLP-led protests erupted across the nation, demanding the judges’ execution.
The party’s influence has since extended to foreign policy. In 2021, the TLP organised nationwide protests demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador over blasphemous caricatures published in France, underscoring its capacity to steer both domestic and diplomatic discourse.
CLASS, POPULISM AND STREET POWER
In Lahore, the TLP’s street-level appeal cannot be missed. Hundreds of rickshaws bearing portraits of Rizvi and the insignia of the Labbaik Rickshaw Union weave through the city, turning public transport into rolling political billboards. “We support the TLP because it’s a party led by people like us, not Sharifs, Bhuttos or Khans,” Jamil Butt, a rickshaw driver, told me a week before the 2024 elections.
Analysts argue that the TLP’s strength lies in its social composition, particularly in Punjab, where rapid urbanisation has transformed villages into sprawling peri-urban settlements. This shift has produced a frustrated, alienated lower-middle class that feels excluded from both elite politics and economic opportunity.
“Rickshaw drivers, shopkeepers, small traders and farmers saw in him [Khadim Hussain Rizvi] an authentic voice of their frustrations,” says Umair Rasheed, a US-based PhD scholar researching the TLP. “His aggressiveness, his language, the way he challenged the ruling elite, all of it allowed him to appear as ‘one of them’ — a man of the people rather than a distant politician.”
This dynamic, analysts note, is why even the PTI, despite its broad populist appeal, struggled to capture this segment of Punjab’s electorate. Some observers describe the TLP as “the PTI of the poor.”
Rasheed added that Rizvi also cleverly exploited class tensions within the Barelvi community. By empowering local mosque-level maulvis [clerics], he positioned himself against the established Barelvi clerical elite, including pirs [spiritual leaders] or sajjada nasheens [custodians of shrines], whom he frequently condemned in his sermons. This intra-sect critique further endeared him to lower-rank clerics and their followers, who long felt marginalised by hereditary religious hierarchies.
Adam Weinstein, an analyst at the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, who witnessed the TLP’s violent 2017 protest observes, “Enforcing blasphemy is the rallying cry, but beneath it lies rage at a society that offers no way up, and enraged young men always turn on minorities and the state itself.” He argues that what appears to be a religious movement is, in many ways, “class-based fury wrapped in religious language.”
The TLP in Karachi, however, draws strength from an additional and influential source: the conservative Memon business community, giving it both financial muscle and urban legitimacy. Several prominent Memon traders have even contested elections on TLP tickets, fusing economic power with religious populism.
ELECTORAL PERFORMANCE AND POLITICAL DISRUPTION
The TLP built its electoral identity around slogans such as “Deen ko takht par lana hai [Bring religion to power]” and “Vote ki izzat Nizam-i-Mustafa mein hai [The sanctity of the vote lies in the Prophet’s system].” These messages positioned the party as a force seeking to fuse religious absolutism with state authority. 
Unlike many traditional religious parties, the TLP showed an unusual ability to transform street agitation into electoral momentum, drawing in voters disillusioned with mainstream parties and eager for a political vehicle that promised dignity, certainty and confrontation.
Its urban expansion became most visible in Karachi. The 2022 by-election in Korangi, typically a battleground for MQM-Pakistan, demonstrated the TLP’s ability to unsettle entrenched political actors. Groups of TLP supporters appeared at MQM-P rallies, loudly chanting “Labbaik, Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah [O Prophet of God, We Are Ready]”, creating an atmosphere of fear among MQM workers wary of mob aggression. A widely circulated video from the campaign captured MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal accusing the TLP of “using religion as a political weapon.” Clashes erupted between rival workers on the polling day. 
During the campaign, several TLP supporters described their political migration from MQM after a paramilitary crackdown weakened it. Abid Qureshi, a TLP activist, says, “When MQM’s muhalla [neighbourhood] committees disappeared, the local mosque and milad committees became new centres of influence. That’s where TLP stepped in and filled the vacuum.”
Political analysts argue that the TLP’s rise reflects not only religious fervour but also patterns of political displacement in Pakistan’s two largest provinces. Yet the party’s sociology differs sharply between Punjab and urban Sindh. In Punjab, its growth largely came at the expense of the PML-N. A 2018 Gallup Pakistan survey found that 46 percent of TLP voters had backed the PML-N in 2013, indicating a significant transfer of conservative, lower-middle class support toward Rizvi’s movement.
The party’s electoral breakthrough came in the 2018 general elections, when it secured more than 2.2 million votes nationwide, around 4.2 percent of the total, becoming Pakistan’s fifth-largest party by vote count. Although the first-past-the-post system prevented it from winning National Assembly seats, the TLP gained a foothold in the Sindh Assembly, winning two general seats in Karachi, along with one reserved seat for women.
Its disruptive impact extended beyond Punjab. In Karachi’s Lyari, historically a PPP stronghold, the TLP outperformed PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, relegating him to third place and indirectly facilitating a PTI victory. This outcome symbolised how the TLP had begun altering urban political equations.
Despite widespread doubts over the credibility of the 2024 elections, analysts note that the TLP’s vote bank expanded further, reaching roughly 2.89 million, an increase of nearly 700,000 votes since 2018.

DEVASTATING SOCIAL TOLL
In August 2023, the Christian neighbourhood of Jaranwala in Punjab’s Faisalabad district descended into chaos after allegations of Quran desecration against two Christian brothers. Within hours, mobs armed with sticks and stones swept through the streets, burning churches, desecrating Bibles and ransacking Christian homes. Over 20 churches and nearly 100 houses were torched, forcing hundreds of families to flee.
Subsequent police investigations confirmed that the violence did not erupt spontaneously. Local clerics affiliated with the TLP had used mosque loudspeakers to summon crowds, urging them to “defend the sanctity of the Quran.” Punjab authorities later arrested over 100 people, several of them identified as TLP activists.
The Jaranwala tragedy was not an isolated episode — it revealed the deepening fractures in Pakistan’s social and moral order. Over the past decade, the TLP’s aggressive brand of religious populism has fundamentally reshaped the country’s political and social discourse, causing an explosion of blasphemy accusations, a surge in mob lynching and renewed fear among religious minorities, particularly Ahmadis and Christians, according to police officials and rights activists. 
They say that mob violence triggered by mere rumours of blasphemy has become “common, deadly and difficult to contain.” A police officer pointed to a recent Lahore incident, in which a woman wearing a dress decorated with calligraphy was nearly lynched by a mob on the mistaken assumption that the dress was sporting Arabic verses from the Quran. According to him, TLP activists, often backed by sympathetic lawyers, regularly pressure local police to register blasphemy cases without evidence, deepening local law-and-order crises.
A Dawn report on October 18, 2025 cited police officials who linked TLP workers to at least 25 attacks on churches and other religious sites in Punjab during the past three years. These mobs often vandalised property, set buildings ablaze and left several people dead and dozens injured.
Muhammad Amir Rana, an Islamabad-based security analyst, highlights the grave threat posed by the TLP’s Fidayeen Jathay, organised squads whose members reportedly take death oaths and pledge to sacrifice their lives at Saad Rizvi’s command, mirroring the suicide tactics of groups like the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). 
“The TLP’s Fidayeen operate openly among the population,” Rana says, “unlike the TTP’s more concealed camps in Afghanistan. And because the TLP is rooted in Punjab, the country’s political heartland, the emotional charge surrounding its mobilisation may be even more volatile.”
The pattern is disturbingly consistent. Last year, a local PPP member of the National Assembly (MNA), together with TLP leaders in Sindh’s Mirpurkhas district, garlanded police officers to praise them for killing a blasphemy suspect in a staged encounter. 
In 2018, PML-N leader and then Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal narrowly survived an assassination attempt by a TLP sympathiser. There have also been reports of teachers killed by students over alleged “disrespectful remarks”, as well as mobs torching police stations for protecting blasphemy suspects.
GLOBAL REACH
During the 2024 general election campaign, posters of TLP candidates across Punjab featured not only Qadri, the executed assassin, but also Tanveer Ahmed, a British-Pakistani taxi driver from Bradford serving a life sentence in Scotland for murdering an Ahmadi shopkeeper in Glasgow in 2016. Ahmed’s framed portrait, surrounded by slogans praising his “sacrifice” underscored the transnational echo of TLP’s message.
In 2017, an audio recording attributed to Ahmed, who was in jail in Britain, widely shared on TLP social media, urged listeners to attend a rally in Karachi that drew tens of thousands. On stage, the party’s leader, Khadim Rizvi, hailed Ahmed as a hero who had “surprised all of Europe.”
The global resonance of this militant trend is now a concern for Western governments. In 2020, a Pakistani man who stabbed two people outside the former Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine — which had published caricatures of the Prophet (PBUH) in 2006, 2011 and 2012 — told investigators he had been radicalised by watching Rizvi’s speeches online.
Last year, the British government’s Commission for Countering Extremism released a report warning about the emergence of a UK-based wing of the TLP, describing it as “an extremist Pakistan anti-blasphemy political party.” The commission’s findings were unequivocal: the ideological current that propelled TLP’s rise in Pakistan was being mirrored, in subtle but significant ways, among segments of the British Pakistani diaspora.
THE STATE’S DILEMMA
The Pakistani state’s relationship with the TLP has long been defined by a cycle of confrontation and accommodation, bans followed by negotiations, and crackdowns followed by concessions. This cycle reflects the state’s enduring struggle to balance public order with the fear of provoking a religious backlash. Every attempt to contain the group has been tempered by anxiety over the explosive power of blasphemy politics, which the TLP has mastered more effectively than any other contemporary movement.
Since the 2017 sit-in in Faizabad near Islamabad, and until last month, successive governments have oscillated between repression and reconciliation, consistently bowing to the group’s ability to paralyse major cities. 
Some analysts argue that the TLP’s initial ascent was not entirely organic but may have been enabled by certain establishment factions that viewed it as a counterweight to the PML-N, whose leadership had, at the time, adopted a confrontational posture toward the military. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz recently reiterated this claim while defending the provincial government’s renewed crackdown on the TLP.
However, many experts dispute the extent of such alleged state patronage, noting that, while some level of tacit support may have existed, the TLP swiftly developed an autonomous and potent street force. Its resonance within segments of the Barelvi community, particularly around issues of blasphemy and perceived socio-religious marginalisation, allowed the movement to evolve beyond any initial political engineering.
Repeated negotiations with the group, including the lifting of the previous ban in 2021, the release of detained leaders and the further tightening of blasphemy laws have sent a clear, detrimental message: mass religious mobilisation can successfully extract concessions from the state.
The latest ban, recommended by the Punjab government amid fresh unrest, appears to signal a potentially tougher stance, though the state’s sincerity remains debatable. 
The October operation in Murdike, near Lahore, involving thousands of law enforcement personnel, had dispersed the TLP supporters planning to march towards Islamabad. Punjab police registered 75 cases, including terrorism and murder charges, against TLP leaders and workers. The undisclosed whereabouts of key figures, brothers Saad Rizvi and Anas Rizvi, have deepened speculation and internal anxiety.
Since then, most TLP candidates from Punjab who contested the 2024 elections have started distancing themselves from the party, stating that “violence and mob action cannot bring meaningful change by attacking the state.“
Before the ban, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met senior Barelvi scholars in Karachi, including Mufti Muneebur Rehman, who had earlier mediated between the government and TLP, assuring them the crackdown targeted the TLP’s network, not the broader Barelvi community. The TLP claims over 300 of their mosques and seminaries have been sealed. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz later confirmed their transfer to Mufti Muneebur Rehman. 
However, analysts opine that the Punjab government’s attempt to counter the TLP through engagement with traditional, moderate Barelvi clerical elite, which Rizvi frequently targeted, may have a limited impact. As scholar Umair Rasheed remarks, the state is once again resorting to the flawed logic of “Good Barelvis, Bad Barelvis”, an echo of earlier strategies of distinguishing between “Good Taliban and Bad Taliban.”
FUTURE SCENARIO
The TLP’s future is acutely uncertain, hanging on the state’s political resolve, the judiciary’s response and the party’s enduring populist appeal. The current official strategy, an immediate ban followed by legal proceedings for dissolution, signals a more assertive posture. 
As one Islamabad-based security official tells me, “The state has decided that it has had enough. Given rising regional tensions and the surge in terrorism across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, it cannot afford internal instability triggered by the TLP’s street agitations.”
Officials signal an intention to dissolve the TLP as a registered political party, though legally establishing its terrorist credentials remains challenging. Among more than 80 proscribed groups, the TLP stands out for its deep grassroots networks, rapid mobilisation capacity and emotive religious appeal, making it far harder to suppress through conventional law-enforcement measures.
The party’s trajectory will also depend on its leadership. The death of Khadim Hussain Rizvi was expected to fracture the party, but his son Saad Rizvi has maintained its coherence and its capacity to bring cities to a standstill. 
If political stability is maintained and the TLP is unable to trigger new crises, its influence may gradually decline ahead of the next election cycle. Yet, the ideology it embodies, combining religious populism, vigilantism and emotionally charged rhetoric, has already permeated Pakistan’s socio-political mainstream.
According to Weinstein, “TLP is the classic Pakistani dilemma — an extremist movement born from within society, tolerated and, at times, weaponised, until it became a menace. But its followers are still your neighbours, and the blasphemy issue isn’t going anywhere.”

Officials said that the number of violent incidents against polio teams had decreased in the current year due to foolproof security measures, as four policemen and one civilian were killed and three police officials suffered injuries. Also, 17 health workers were kidnapped during house-to-house vaccination campaigns.
 
 

Official data shows that a total of 96 people have been killed by alleged terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2012 and they included 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians. Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, were injured in attacks on polio teams.
During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns.

KP records better vaccination coverage

Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women, according to an official report.
However, the current year has proved to be relatively peaceful, enabling health workers to bring down the number of children who missed polio drops earlier either due to vaccination refusal by their parents or for being accessible to vaccinators in security-compromised areas.
Officials said that it was a welcome sign for the polio programme as health workers would be able to reach most children targeted in polio drives.
They said the continued violence against polio teams had also caused scare among health workers, so the number of unvaccinated children continued to rise.
The officials, however, said that in the current year, vaccinators were covering more children than those vaccinated in previous years due to enhanced supervision and surveillance both from the government and Emergency Operations Centre for Polio.
They said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had recorded 18 polio cases, most in the countrywide tally of 29, due to strong surveillance, which led to the collection of “most samples from suspected children.”
The officials said Sindh had recorded nine polio cases, while one case each was reported in Punjab and GB.
A recent report by the Independent Monitoring Board, which works on behalf of international donor agencies, said that Pakistan faced continued transmission in core reservoirs, particularly southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, alongside ongoing operational challenges that include missed children, security constraints and the urgent need for strengthened essential immunisation systems.
According to an IMB report released in September, security assessments have revealed a more nuanced picture than is often portrayed.
Of Pakistan’s 45.4 million target children, only 1.2 million face direct security constraints, primarily those in southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The report, titled “The Glass Mountain,” said that escalating circulation in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with more than 100,000 unreached children represented the most immediate threat to interruption of transmission.
It noted that there were persistent access constraints and accumulated vulnerability, while many children missed vaccination in rounds after rounds, so intensive new approaches were required.
The polio programme has divided south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa into three categories, including green areas (71 per cent of the population, 159 union councils) with good access but quality challenges; community-led vaccination initiative areas (20 per cent of the population, 80 union councils) utilising community-led approaches; and black areas (nine per cent of the population, 26 union councils) requiring intensive engagement to achieve house-to-house access.
Officials said that new strategies and approaches were paying off with the unprecedented support of the government and security forces.
They said the innovative strategies had strengthened security due to which the vaccinators felt secure and took part in the campaign fearlessly.
The officials also said that recently, health secretary Shahidullah Khan transferred three district health officers and one district coordinator for showing laxity in polio drives.
They said that chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah, as the chairman of the provincial task force on polio, was likely to take action against the deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners for similar reasons.

The Justice Rana Bhagwandas Family Park and Dr Fareduddin Sethna Family Park were renovated in 2022 under the World Bank–funded Karachi Neighbourhood Improvement Project (KNIP) using public funds.
The residents expressed concern that these newly upgraded parks — complete with walkways, greenery, benches, and lighting — are being dismantled for private purposes, bringing late-night lights, noise, and traffic to peaceful residential areas.
“These parks were built for the community, not for commercialisation,” said a resident representative from the Save Bhagwandas Park Campaign. “Millions were spent under KNIP to create safe, family-friendly spaces. It’s unacceptable that public parks are being torn down just two years later.”

Oppose plan to convert family parks into padel courts

It may be noted that the Sindh High Court and Supreme Court have both ruled that public amenity land — including parks — cannot be leased, granted, or converted for private or commercial use.
Residents have also become parties to a constitutional petition at the SHC to legally halt all commercial construction and ensure that these parks remain public, peaceful, and non-commercial spaces.
Boundary walls of Beach Park, Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim demolished
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has torn down the outer walls of the Beach Park and Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim in Clifton to “show green beauty vibrantly and openly to the public like parks in other countries”.
A KMC spokesperson told Dawn that the decision would only be applied to the two parks facing Clifton Beach.
Regarding a video that went viral on social media showing some people taking out iron bars from the rubble, he said that it was KMC staff and the iron bars will be used in future infrastructure projects.
Meanwhile, Opposition Leader of the Karachi City Council Advocate Saifuddin strongly condemned the demolition of the protective walls of Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim and Beach Park, calling the move a criminal act.
He has sent an official letter to Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi, with copies forwarded to Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah and mayor Murtaza Wahab.
In his letter, Mr Saifuddin demanded an immediate halt to the demolition and the reconstruction of the destroyed walls, stressing that tearing down park walls built with millions of rupees in public funds is a gross misuse of authority.
 
 

He questioned, “Who can authorise the demolition of properties worth crores? The parks are being destroyed, and now their beautiful walls are being razed as well. Without these protective boundaries, how will the park’s safety and demarcation be ensured?”
He termed the action incomprehensible and regrettable, calling for a thorough investigation and strict punishment for those responsible.
Such a major decision cannot be made without the City Council’s approval, he said and reiterated that Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim is a landmark of Karachi, and protecting and maintaining it is the primary responsibility of municipal authorities.

• US coordinates Gaza aid flow but Israel maintains oversight, officials say
JERUSALEM: Israeli forces continued to wage deadly assaults across the Palestinian territories and southern Lebanon on Saturday, in a series of air and artillery attacks that violated ceasefire agreements on both fronts.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops shot dead two 16-year-old boys, adding to the mounting number of Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces.
The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah identified the victims as Mohammed Abdullah Moham­med Ateem and Muhammad Rashad Fadl Qasim, both from the village of Judeira. The ministry said Israeli forces were withholding the boys’ bodies.
The Israeli military acknowledged the killings, referring to the teenagers as individuals it had “eliminated” — a term frequently employed by Israeli authorities to obscure civilian deaths and dehumanise Palestinians.
At the same time, in the besieged Strip, Israeli gunfire killed one Palestinian and wounded another near the Bureij refugee camp.
A separate attack in western Khan Younis left another Pales­tinian wounded, medics reported.
Three killed in Lebanon
In a separate escalation, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed three people and wounded several others on Saturday.
Lebanon’s National News Agency said two brothers from the town of Shebaa were burned alive when an Israeli missile hit their SUV. A separate strike in Baraashit killed one person and wounded four. Another Israeli strike on Saturday morning on a car near a hospital in the southern city of Bint Jbeil wounded seven people, according to the ministry.
The latest attacks came as the European Union voiced concern. “Focus by all parties must be on preserving the ceasefire and the progress achieved so far.”
Body exchange
Simultaneously, under the cea­­sefire’s prisoner exchange plan, for every one dead Israeli prisoners returned, the bodies of 15 slain Palestinians are handed back by Israel.
On Saturday, Israel identified the latest prisoner remains sent back from Gaza as those of Lior Rudaeff. Meanwhile, the Nasser Medical Centre in Khan Younis reported receiving the bodies of 15 Pales­tinians.
US, Israel coordinate aid
Meanwhile, according to the Washington Post, US forces are now involved in coordinating aid through the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that will replace Israel in overseeing aid into Gaza. It cited a US official and people familiar with the matter as saying Israel was part of the process but that CMCC would decide what aid enters Gaza and how.
 
 

However, an Israeli security official confirmed that Israel remains part of the supervision and monitoring process, with decisions made jointly. This suggests little change to the stifling Israeli control over what aid enters Gaza.

Trump had announced in September that Vice President JD Vance would travel to the meeting later this month instead of him, but has now said that US representatives will skip it entirely.
“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”
Trump said that Afrikaners — descendants of the first European settlers of South Africa — “are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated”. He added that he looked forward to hosting the 2026 G20 summit in the US — which the billionaire US president will controversially hold at his own golf resort in Miami, Florida.

South Africa calls Trump’s decision ‘regrettable’, pledges smooth summit

The South African foreign ministry cal­led Trump’s comments “regrettable” and said it was looking forward to hosting a “successful” summit set for November 22-23.
“The characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution is not substantiated by fact,” it said in a statement.
Pretoria chose “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability” as the theme for its G20 presidency but has faced some resistance, including from Washington.
“South Africa’s focus remains on its positive global contributions,” the foreign ministry said.
“Drawing on our own journey from racial and ethnic division to democracy, our nation is uniquely positioned to champion within the G20 a future of genuine solidarity.”
Trump has singled out South Africa for harsh treatment on a number of issues since he returned to the White House in January, most notably on his false claims of a “white genocide” in the country.
He ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval office earlier this year, playing a video in which he alleged a campaign against white farmers by the post-apartheid government.
South Africa’s government denies any such policy. Trump’s administration announced plans last week to drastically cut back the number of refugees to be accepted annually by the United States to a record low of 7,500 — and give priority to white South Africans.

According to the 2025 Review of Climate Ambition in Asia and the Pacific, released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), Pakistan needs significant investment and coordination to upgrade and expand its grid network to integrate large-scale renewable energy while maintaining system stability.
The report says that a successful phase-down of coal in Pakistan will require a comprehensive energy transition plan with clear targets, strong policies and engagement of all stakeholders. The transition, it adds, must be “just” to avoid disproportionate impacts on workers, businesses and households.
Renewable edge over coal
The UN report highlights that solar and wind energy are now cost-competitive with coal, giving Pakistan an opportunity to accelerate its shift towards cleaner energy. Data from the SDG-7 Roadmap for Pakistan show that the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind generation is significantly lower than that of coal-based power.

Solar and wind can cut power costs, but weak infrastructure may slow carbon-free transition

The energy landscape, the report notes, is evolving as global pressure to cut emissions increases. However, Pakistan’s transition will depend on long-term policy stability, financial support and institutional reforms that encourage private investment in renewables.
Regional context
The report places Pakistan’s situation within a broader Asia-Pacific context, describing the region as being at a “critical juncture” amid accelerating economic growth and intensifying climate pressures. Economic activity in the region expanded 4.6pc in 2024, contributing 60pc of global GDP growth over the past decade. Yet, rising debt, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to expose countries to mounting risks.
Despite these challenges, the Asia-Pacific has maintained its position as a global leader in renewable energy, accounting for 70pc of new capacity additions in 2024. Governments are increasingly adopting net-zero targets, revising climate policies and integrating them into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to meet emission-reduction goals.
Policy and carbon pricing reforms
To translate these commitments into action, countries are reinforcing their legal and regulatory frameworks to attract investment in clean energy. The report says private companies also have a crucial role in implementing deep decarbonisation strategies across their operations and supply chains.
The region remains heavily reliant on coal, producing 84pc of the world’s coal-fired power in 2024 and consuming 81.7pc of global coal output in 2023. The UN stresses that phasing down coal will require strong political commitment, removal of fossil fuel subsidies and coordinated policy frameworks to support renewable growth and energy efficiency.

The crackdown, which spanned Lahore and other districts over the last 24 hours, led to the arrest of the violators and resulted in fines totaling over Rs1.067 million imposed on 491 people. An additional 38 individuals were issued warnings for environmental violations.
 
 

According to the breakdown provided by the spokesperson, the operations targe­ted key sources of pollution. A total of 209 smoke-emitting vehicles were cited, alon­gside 101 incidents of crop residue burning and 7 violations related to brick kilns.
This recent enforcement action is part of a larger, year-long initiative.
The spokesperson revealed that since the beginning of the current year, the police have registered a significant 2,275 cases and arrested 2,027 violators. The financial penalties have been substantial, with fines exceeding Rs227.1m imposed on 87,780 individuals, while 11,268 others have received warnings.
 
 

The annual data highlights the scale of the problem, with 52,872 violations for smoke-emitting vehicles, 3,365 for brick kilns, 1,725 related to industrial activities, and 1,166 cases of crop residue burning.
IG police Dr Usman Anwar has directed officers to further accelerate the anti-smog crackdown.
In his directives, the IG emphasised a zero-tolerance policy, ordering strict and immediate action against all those found violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) designed to combat smog. The operations are to be intensified on highways, in industrial areas, on agricultural lands, and at other key locations contributing to poor air quality.

However, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to first seek the IMF’s clearance for the incentives proposed under the new policy.
Officials said a meeting between IMF representatives and a team led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan is expected later this month to discuss the annual fiscal cost of the incentives planned for various sectors.
The policy targets $60 billion in exports by 2030, GDP growth of 6pc and manufacturing growth of 8pc annually by the end of the decade. It aims to provide a roadmap for industrial competitiveness, job creation and export expansion.
Key constraints
The NIP identifies a range of structural and policy-related challenges impeding industrial growth. These include macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, costly industrial land, excessive regulation, unreliable and expensive power supply, and limited access to long-term credit.

NIP targets $60bn exports by 2030; identifies high costs, weak regulation and uneven taxation as key hurdles

The ministry said local industries face high borrowing costs and limited access to capital markets. Weak investor protection and an inadequate insolvency framework have further discouraged lending, leaving banks with few tools to restructure loans.
The policy notes that uneven taxation across sectors discourages industrial investment. While manufacturing bears a heavier tax burden, sectors such as real estate, construction, wholesale and retail remain undertaxed, reducing returns on industrial ventures.
Manufacturing firms also face foreign exchange constraints, with frequent delays in accessing dollars for importing raw materials. In some cases, foreign investors struggle to repatriate profits, deterring foreign direct investment.
The NIP highlights weak standards compliance, which hampers exports, and calls for reforms to improve product quality and certification systems. It also stresses the need for inclusive industrialisation, noting that women remain largely excluded from industrial entrepreneurship and management.
 
 

“Women remain at the periphery and suffer from a sense of not belonging. This needs to change, and more women industrialists must be promoted,” the document states.
The policy proposes a predictable and transparent taxation regime consistent with IMF-backed reforms. It recommends widening the tax net and ensuring that all sectors contribute proportionately to their share of value-added in GDP.
The NIP also calls for the review and simplification of corporate income tax (CIT), currently set at 29pc, higher than the regional average of 26pc, which affects export competitiveness. The super tax, levied in addition to the CIT, should also be reassessed to ease the burden on industries, the document says.
Structural measures
To support struggling firms, the policy proposes setting up a National Industrial Revival Commission (NIRC) to oversee company rehabilitation and coordinate regulatory support.
It further calls for strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) through accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and enhancing the enforcement capacity of the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan (IPO) to counter counterfeiting and piracy.
Reducing port charges, particularly those levied by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) — among the highest in the world — is also recommended to improve export competitiveness.
Officials said the policy, once approved, will serve as a framework for industrial transformation through improved governance, fiscal discipline and an enabling environment for private investment. However, its implementation will depend on IMF endorsement of the incentive package, given Pakistan’s commitments under the ongoing economic stabilisation programme.

Yet, the city often attracts ill-informed and reactive commentary, particularly from those unfamiliar with its unique historical, sociological and geographical underpinnings.
The city’s complexity is often oversimplified into political statements — as if mere political allegiance dictates whether one likes or dislikes it. This tendency even affects some Karachiites, whose view of the city fluctuates between ‘doing well’ and ‘hell’ based on which party holds power. To truly understand Karachi, one must look beyond politics, to its identity as a thriving port city.
Karachi’s coastal location has endowed it with a ‘maritime mindset’ — a characteristic shared by port cities globally. A 2021 study in the European Journal of Creative Practices in Cities and Landscapes notes that port cities have historically been “nodes for global flows of goods, people and ideas”, fostering an environment of diversity and tolerance. 
Residents in port cities are often more accustomed to change and open to new ideas than those in landlocked areas. The sea itself is embedded in the collective consciousness, capable of evoking awe and serving as a backdrop for reflection. However, for a majority of present-day Karachiites, this consciousness is relatively recent.

Karachi’s maritime soul — once buried under waves of migration from landlocked regions — is now re-emerging and redefining

Before 1947, the majority of Karachi’s inhabitants — mostly Sindhi-, Balochi- and Gujarati-speaking Muslims, Hindus and Zoroastrians — were strictly tied to the port and the sea. But the city’s demography and culture underwent a seismic shift post-Partition. Millions of Urdu-speaking Muslims (Mohajirs) began arriving from landlocked regions of India, quickly becoming the majority. 
This migration initially brought a cultural struggle against the city’s inherent maritime identity. For example, the local seafood culture almost vanished, replaced by the ‘Mughal dishes’ of the newcomers. Early Urdu cinema established in Karachi rarely featured the sea, instead replicating the urban imaginations rooted in the landlocked environs that the Mohajirs had left behind. The sea only began to appear in films from the late 1960s, mostly as a ‘picnic spot.’ The Mohajir community took decades to develop a maritime mindset.
As Karachi rapidly industrialised, further landlocked communities arrived. Pakhtuns from present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa became the primary labour force, building factories and homes, and later dominated transport (buses, rickshaws and taxis). Punjabis migrated here, continuing the British-era practice of joining the city’s police force. Sindhis from so-called ‘interior Sindh’ also began a gradual move to the metropolis. And in the 1980s, Afghans from landlocked Afghanistan began to settle in the city as well.
As landlocked communities came to form the majority, Karachi’s maritime mindset began to disintegrate. The city became home to ethnic ghettoisation and conflict. Settlers often compared it unfavourably to their places of origin, using Karachi as a temporary abode rather than a home to be owned. This disconnect contributed to political volatility.



 
The Mohajir community, represented by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) after 1985, often lamented this fractured identity. However, as the Mohajir majority began to shrink and other groups opted for different political parties, especially the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), many Mohajirs began to revert to their earlier landlocked disposition.
But despite the struggles, the city’s inherent maritime mindset has returned, driven not by a single group, but by the undeniable economic, social and cultural impact of the sea. 
John M. Eger, Emeritus Professor of Public Policy at San Diego State University, highlights that “port cities are more tolerant, mostly because ports tend to attract people with fewer prejudices than the inner cities.” Tolerance becomes a prerequisite for survival in such a fluid environment.
Interestingly, it has been the city’s non-Mohajir communities that have largely led the way in restoring Karachi’s original maritime identity. Regardless of ethnic group or class, Krachiites now increasingly see the sea as something that defines them, and not as something that looked alien and even scary to their elders, who arrived here from ethnically homogeneous, landlocked regions. 
And for those who visit Karachi but don’t like it, I’d suggest they visit one of its many magnificent beaches, sit in front of the sea and reflect. One has to mould oneself according to the nature of the city because no city in the world will mould itself for you. This is especially true of folk coming from landlocked regions to port cities. Port cities don’t give a hoot what you think of them. They’re too busy and fluid, making a country’s economy run. And yours too. 
Landlocked shouldn’t mean one becomes brain-locked. Karachi is an open city like no other in the country. It can’t be locked inside a particular view of a ‘likeable city.’ It is a city inside which are many cities run by multiple departments. This confuses its many landlocked guests. There are many Karachis but each is defined by one sea. Visit one of its beaches on a Sunday and you shall understand.

Normally, home supporters would’ve quietened at seeing Fakhar Zaman cleaned up early on in a small chase – potentially a harbinger of things to come; perhaps an all too familiar collapse in the offing.
But here on Saturday night, there were loud roars with chants of “Babar” echoing across the venue with Pakistan’s batting superstar set to come next. Babar didn’t disappoint, dispatching the South African bowlers with his trademark elan, and alongside Saim Ayub set Pakistan on their way to a rousing seven-wicket victory that sealed the three-match One-day International series 2-1 in their favour.
The venue had gone silent after Babar’s departure in the 11th over, disappointment filling the air that they weren’t able to see more of him when he was looking close to his best, run out for 27 after stroking five crisp fours.
But they soon found their voice as Saim tore into the South African attack with a 70-ball 77 that featured 11 fours and a six and although he fell with Pakistan nearing victory, Mohammad Rizwan (32 not out) took them through with Salman Ali Agha hitting the winning boundary.
The foundation for Pakistan’s victory, under new skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi for this series, had been laid by the spinners as the visitors were bundled out for 143 in 37.5 overs. South Africa captain Matthew Breetzke had elected to bat and his side were coasting smoothly with openers Quinton de Kock (53) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (39) well set until their lineup collapsed in the face of spin.
Salman (2-18) provided the first two wickets before Mohammad Nawaz (2-31) followed with the big dismissal of De Kock until Abrar Ahmed (4-27) ran through South Africa’s spine and Pakistan eventually secured their first-ever ODI series triumph at home against their opponents.
“The credit goes to the players,” reflected Shaheen at the post-match ceremony. “We didn’t get much help in the first five or six overs but when the spinners came in, they made it really tough for them.”
On a sun-kissed afternoon, the 72-run opening stand between Pretorius and De Kock ended after the former, who had hit four fours and a six, was caught at long-off by Babar and Salman struck again four overs later when Tony de Zorzi chipped him to the cover fielder.
De Kock, whose splendid century in the second game had helped South Africa level the series, completed his half century off 68 deliveries with his sixth four, a sweep of Nawaz, only to be trapped lbw by the spinner two deliveries later. The left-hander also hit a six.
South Africa then slipped from 106-2 to 109-4 with player-of-the-match Abrar cleaning up debutant Rubin Hermann on the first ball of the 26th over. Bails were flying once again, twice off two balls, two overs later as Abrar worked his magic. First Donovan Ferreira was bowled round his legs before a googly that stayed low knocked back Corbin Bosch’s off-stump.
Pakistan had South Africa on the ropes with Breetzke (16) running out of partners quick and fast as Nawaz had Bjorn Fortuin lbw, and the writing was on the wall for the Proteas when their skipper was caught behind off Abrar, who recorded his career-best ODI figures, as they slipped to 130-8.
Pakistan captain Shaheen (2-18) then cleaned up the tail with two wickets in two balls – both of them bowled, including the wicket of Nqabayomzi Peter who made a defiant 16.
“Batting conditions were pretty tough and we didn’t get enough runs and they batted freely because of that,” rued De Kock, who was named player-of-the-series.
The sentiment was echoed by Breetzke. “Not enough runs… we were probably looking at 250. It was tough conditions and unfortunately we lost too many wickets there.”
Nandre Burger’s dismissal of Fakhar, knocking his stumps through the gate, brought Babar to the crease and after a quiet opening couple of overs, the right-hander, who had scores of seven and 11 in the opening two matches, got Pakistan off the mark in the third which ended with a boundary of Saim’s bat – a punch through the covers.
A deft touch of Lundi Ngidi then brought Babar’s first boundary before Saim flicked away the pacer for four. Babar then pulled Burger away for four before treating the crowd to two delightful boundaries off Ngidi in the sixth over.
Boundaries were flowing for Pakistan – three of them coming off the eighth over off Bosch, all of them from Saim with the first a six. At the other end, Babar showed his elegance with a scrumptious cover drive for four as Pakistan reached 59-1 after the first 10.
Babar would soon be run out, but Saim took over and was unrelenting. He reached his 50 of just 39 balls with his eighth four, pulling away Burger. Fortuin and Ferreira were then swept for boundaries before the latter was hit for a one-bounce four.
Saim fell when he couldn’t get the distance off Fortuin but by then the job was done with Rizwan closing it out. Rizwan, who was replaced by Shaheen as skipper ahead of the series, hit three fours and a six – over midwicket – to leave Pakistan four runs away and Salman finished it off with 24.5 overs to spare.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08151301a8b0e27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953879/bill-for-27th-constitutional-amendment-tabled-in-senate-after-federal-cabinets-approval' target='_blank'><strong>Bill for 27th Constitutional Amendment tabled in Senate after federal cabinet’s approval</strong></a><br><p>Shortly after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate on Saturday and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
A joint session of both the NA and Senate standing committees on law and justice was then summoned to discuss the amendment.
However, during the session of the standing committees, two Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) members, Aliya Kamran and Senator Kamran Murtaza, boycotted the meeting and said the proposed draft included amendments that were discarded in the 26th Amendment bill.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
‘Discussions will continue till consensus is reached’
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, speaking to the media after the adjournment of the committees, said all parties were participating in the session and they had also “requested the opposition to participate”.
“Aliya Kamran had informed us that they have instructions from their party not to attend the session; however, all other parties were in attendance. We even asked the opposition to be a part of the session.”
Tarar said the “long-awaited” proposed amendment has been in discussion for the last 10-15 years. “Even today we are having a constructive debate on the matter.”
“At the time of the 18th Amendment, it was on the constitutional agenda, and even earlier, during the 26th Amendment, but due to certain reasons, one of which was Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s suggestion that such a major change should not be made and that it would be better to move towards transition and form constitutional benches,” said Tarar.
The law minister elaborated that the formation of the benches increased the workload of the judiciary, as the same judges were hearing cases fixed for the bench and otherwise.
“The objective was to ensure that the cases fixed in the Supreme Court are not delayed further and the common man gets relief.”
Tarar added that one of the aims of the proposed changes is also to do away with the criticism of a “court within a court”.  “All members have reviewed it (proposed constitutional amendment) and we have completed arguments on around 60pc of the clauses.”
The law minister said a few questions have been raised by some members, clarifying that they are legal in nature and “not fundamental issues”.
“We will reconvene again tomorrow morning at 11am and continue our discussions. And till the time we do not reach a consensus, from all members of both Houses, the discussions will continue,” said the law minister.
The Senate and standing committee sessions will resume on Sunday, November 9.
Farooq H. Naek said no decision has been reached yet after deliberations on the proposed constitutional amendment, and claimed around 80pc of the bill was discussed.
He added that certain “mistakes” in the draft will be corrected and the law ministry has been made aware.
When asked about changes to Article 243, he said it was not discussed during today’s session.
Tarar tables bill in Senate
The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by the law minister, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar — who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting —  requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
 


During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said that debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
“I would suggest that instead of sending it to the committee, let this Senate be treated as a committee as a whole,” he said, suggesting the bill be debated by all individuals. He further said that the opposition had received the draft today and had also not yet read a word of it.

“We cannot debate something we have not read,” he said.
Law minister details key clauses
Meanwhile, the law minister said that the bill would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
 
 

He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.

“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
Federal govt approves draft
Shortly before the Senate session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had chaired the cabinet meeting via video link from Azerbaijan, according to state-run PTV News.
“The federal cabinet approved the draft for the 27th Constitutional Amendment and welcomed it to the fullest extent,” it had added.
“Everyone made joint efforts for the 27th Constitutional Amendment for strengthening the Centre’s relations with the provinces and the country’s wider interests,” the premier was quoted as saying. He commended the law minister’s efforts, as well as those of the attorney general of Pakistan.
 






Shehbaz noted that he had taken PML-N President Nawaz Sharif into confidence for the amendments and sought his guidance on them. “I also took President Asif Ali Zardari into confidence regarding the Amendment and we are deeply grateful to him for their approval,” the premier said.
He went on to specifically thank PPP Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and heads of other allied parties who held discussions with him and “strongly supported” the draft. The prime minister noted that Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan, PML-Zia head Ijazul Haq and other politicians were also apprised of the legislation.
He stressed that everyone must work together for the country’s progress and prosperity.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the ANP and the PML-Zia.
After the federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, the law minister had briefed the media on some of the key features of the draft and informed that the bill would be tabled in the Senate.
Moreover, Tarar recalled that at the time of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the MQM-P had contacted the prime minister and the PML-N seeking changes to Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish local governments (LGs).
“They had introduced a bill in the Senate, which was referred to a committee and on the directives of the premier, I, as the law minister, also gave a note in its support,” Tarar said.
“As that bill is already pending, the cabinet has also directed me today that when today’s bill is referred to the committee after being presented in the senate, the committee should also mull over [the one tabled by the MQM-P],” he said.
Tarar said that the government would try to convince its allied partners to develop a consensus on this bill so it could be passed, adding that a recent resolution by the Punjab Assembly regarding LGs would also be discussed.
He further said that Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) leaders, in their meeting with PM Shehbaz earlier this week, had directed his attention to a bill pertaining to an increase in the seats for the Balochistan Assembly.
“So both these bills, which are already pending before the law and justice standing committee, will be debated,” the minister said.
“Pakistan is going through very tough circumstances, and I think the country’s greatest need today is political consensus and political stability,” the law minister stressed.
The proposed constitutional tweaks have been heavily criticised by lawyers and politicians, who termed them an attempt to revoke provincial rights granted in the 18th Amendment.
The federal cabinet meeting was originally scheduled for Friday, but was postponed due to PM Shehbaz’s commitments in Azerbaijan, sources in the PM Office said. However, some were of the opinion that the meeting was put off due to a lack of consensus between the ruling PML-N and the PPP over the Amendment.
The PPP has said it would support amendments to Article 243, which defines the powers of the armed forces, but has rejected proposals related to provinces’ shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and any rollback of the 18th Amendment.
The PPP’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) yesterday decided that it “agrees in principle with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed” — a proposal also mulled during the 26th Amendment discussions last year.
The MQM-P presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong and autonomous LGs across the country. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which met with an MQM-P delegation on Thursday, has opposed any amendment that would reduce the powers granted to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:09</small></div><hr>
