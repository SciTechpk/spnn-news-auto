6.6: Kamindu deposits Haris for six!
 


Pakistan’s man in form Haris arrives and causes another Sri Lankan casualty — and that too a big one in Perera.  Haris, however, followed it with waywardness and was punished by the incoming Kamindu Mendis.
The power play ends with both sides exchanging blows — Pakistan got wickets but the Sri Lankan batters kept on scoring boundaries.

Nissanka doubled the sixes column with another beautiful shot, but Shaheen bounced back with yet another wicket as the opener nicked it to the keeper. The left-armer followed that up with a dangerous beamer before Perera pulled for six again off the free-hit.

Over 2 — Sri Lanka - 12-1
Faheem Ashraf into the attack.
Pakistan’s old tormentor with the bat, Kusal Perera, greets Faheem with a six over mid-wicket!

Shaheen Afridi has the new ball.
Shaheen brings the first ball into Pathum Nissanka.
Pakistan draw first blood! Kusal Mendis gets a leading edge and Hussain Talat grabs an easy chance at mid-wicket.
An early breakthrough for Pakistan in the very first over has given them a flying start and Shaheen Shah Afridi must be licking his lips with the seam on offer. While Kusal Mendis’ dismissal came off a shot from the middle of his bat, Shaheen followed it with sharp outswing against Pathum Nissanka.
 



Anthems:
The Sri Lankan anthem is being played first.
The Pakistani anthem follows.
 


Pitch report:
“It looks beautiful,” former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull said in the pitch report.
“There is a nice grass covering, and that should help the ball come onto the bat,” he said, adding that there might be a bit of early help for the pacers, and Doull reckons there may not be a lot of spin.
Dawn’s Mir Shabbar Ali reckons that the pitch is a batting-friendly one and will reward good cricketing shots as it did for Oman in their fighting loss against India in the Group A fixture —the last match played on this venue.
Sri Lanka also chased down a decent target set by Afghanistan in their group match on this surface. But in that game only, Nuwan Thushara’s slingy pace bowling flourished early on, which shall be a good sign for not only Thushara but Pakistan’s in-form bowler Haris Rauf as well.

Pakistan: Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Hussain Talat, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Haris, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Abrar Ahmed, and Haris Rauf.
Sri Lanka:  Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wicket-keeper), Kusal Perera, Charith Asalanka (captain), Dasun Shanaka, Kamindu Mendis, Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Dushmantha Chameera, and Nuwan Thushara.

Reeling from early setbacks in the Super Four stage, both Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be desperate to register their first win in this critical stage of the Asia Cup.
Defending champions Sri Lanka, who breezed through the group stage unbeaten, were jolted by a four-wicket loss to Bangladesh in their Super Four opener. The defeat not only disrupted their rhythm but also snapped an impressive eight-match winning streak in the Asia Cup.
On the other hand, off-field issues have dominated headlines around the Pakistan team, overshadowing their middling performances on the field. They are in a spot of trouble after suffering yet another humbling defeat at the hands of arch-rivals India on Sunday, their second loss to their archrivals in this tournament.
India and Bangladesh have two points each, with Suryakumar Yadav’s men leading the standings owing to a superior net run-rate. Sri Lanka and Pakistan occupy the third and fourth spots, respectively.
With little time for recovery, Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha and his side now face a must-win situation under mounting pressure.</p><small>2025-09-23 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2320262782a7cc6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944143/trump-administration-proposes-new-h-1b-visa-process-favouring-higher-skilled-better-paid-workers' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration proposes new H-1B visa process favouring higher-skilled, better-paid workers</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration released a proposal on Tuesday that would rework the H-1B visa selection process to favour higher-skilled and better-paid workers, according to a related Federal Register notice, a move that follows a White House proclamation on Friday introducing a $100,000 fee for the visas.
The new process, if finalised, would give heavier weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said.
The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers, it said.
President Donald Trump launched a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office in January, including a push for mass deportations and trying to block citizenship for children of immigrants in the United States illegally.
In recent days, his administration intensified its focus on the H-1B programme, popular with tech and outsourcing companies for hiring skilled foreign workers. The Trump administration said on Friday it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas.
Some big tech companies warned visa holders to stay in the US or quickly return, sparking a chaotic scramble to get back to the US. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new visas.
The planned regulation, posted on Tuesday, would change an existing lottery process to obtain the visas if demand surpasses supply in a given year, creating wage tiers where higher-paying jobs would have a better chance of being selected.
The process to finalise a regulation can take months or even years. The notice suggested that the new rules could be in place for the 2026 lottery, meaning before a March registration period.
Trump, a Republican, sought to reshape the H-1B process during his 2017-2021 presidency, but was stymied by federal courts and limited time at the end of his presidency.
A similar regulation that aimed to shift the lottery process toward higher-paid applicants was delayed by Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, before it could go into effect in March 2021. It was then blocked by a federal judge in September 2021 and withdrawn by the Biden administration three months later.
The total wages paid to H-1B workers would increase to $502 million in fiscal year 2026, which begins on October 1, the notice said, citing US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates.
Wages would increase by $1 billion in fiscal 2027, $1.5bn in fiscal 2028 and $2bn in fiscal 2029-2035, it said.
An estimated 5,200 small businesses that currently receive H-1B visas would suffer a significant economic impact due to the loss of labour, DHS said.
US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which issued the proposal, will give the public 30 days to comment beginning on Wednesday, the notice said.
The visa allows American firms to hire skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping them competitive. The programme’s supporters include Elon Musk, a naturalised US citizen born in South Africa, who has himself held an H-1B visa.
Critics argue that the programme allows firms to suppress wages and sideline Americans who could do the jobs.
India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of the approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.</p><small>2025-09-23 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23165730321b3c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944117/former-umpire-harold-dickie-bird-dies-aged-92' target='_blank'><strong>Former umpire Harold ‘Dickie’ Bird dies aged 92</strong></a><br><p>Former Test umpire Harold “Dickie” Bird has died at the age of 92, Yorkshire County Cricket Club announced on Tuesday.
Bird was one of the best-known and most respected officials in the game, standing in 66 Tests and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals.
Yorkshire issued a statement on their website saying Bird, “one of cricket’s most beloved figures”, had died peacefully at home.
“Dickie Bird enjoyed an illustrious career as an international umpire, writing his name into history as the most famous and popular official in the game’s history,” the club said.
“He is synonymous with Yorkshire Cricket, where he has been one of the most loyal supporters. In 2014, he was named president of The Yorkshire County Cricket Club, a role he held with pride and distinction.”
 


Bird played for English counties Yorkshire and Leicestershire but made his name as an international umpire.
“Over a distinguished career, he officiated in 66 Test matches and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals — earning the admiration of players and fans alike for his integrity, humour, and unmistakable style,” Yorkshire’s statement said.
He was given a guard of honour at Lord’s by England and India players before his final Test.
Geoffrey Boycott, the Yorkshire and England batting great, had an enduring friendship with Bird from their days playing for Barnsley Cricket Club in the 1950s.
The 84-year-old summed up Bird’s quirky nature when he recalled how his friend used to insist on calling him Gerald, despite his protestations.
“I would say, ‘My name’s not Gerald, it’s Geoffrey’,” Boycott wrote in the Telegraph. “It made no difference telling him because he would then say, ‘OK, put the gloves on for me Gerald’.
“Dickie was a character and he was always fun. He was respected, admired and loved. He will be given a fond farewell.”
Former England captain David Gower hailed Bird as “one of the best umpires ever to take the field”.
“He certainly set himself high standards as an umpire, but that smile on his face at all times, whether he’s giving you out or not out, whatever he was doing out in the middle, you just knew that Dickie was in the place that he loved best,” Gower told the BBC.
“He was just a very, very good umpire. He had a sense of humour. He had the ability in his own very quirky and slightly barmy way of being able to get on with everyone.”
Graham Gooch, another former England captain, fondly recalled Bird’s habit of becoming embroiled in unusual incidents during matches.
“At Headingley once they had a leaking pipe, right where Dickie was standing,” said Gooch. “Coming up like a sprinkler. It could only happen to him.”
Colin Graves, chairman of Yorkshire, told TalkSport: “It’s a sad day.
“He was a brilliant guy who loved being part of the Yorkshire set-up and everything we do here. He will be sadly missed at Headingley.”
ESPNcricinfo also posted about Bird on X.
 






“[Marylebone Cricket Club] is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Harold “Dickie” Bird,” Lord’s Cricket Ground posted on X.
“An Honorary Life Member of the Club, Dickie enjoyed an illustrious career as an umpire and was one of the most popular officials in the history of the game.”

The government had been optimistic about 2026, pencilling in 4.2% growth on the back of a rebound in farming and manufacturing after the economy was stabilised under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout.
Instead, record monsoon rains since late June, amplified by dam releases from India, have submerged large swathes of Punjab and Sindh.
While waters have yet to recede in many districts, officials and analysts warn the hit could be deeper than in 2022, when a third of the country lay under water, due to dual shocks to agriculture and manufacturing.
Out on the plains, satellite images have traced the scale. A report from agricultural monitoring initiative GEOGLAM estimates at least 220,000 hectares of rice fields flooded between August 1 and September 16.
In Punjab, 1.8 million acres of farmland have been inundated, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
“About 50% of rice, and 60% of cotton and maize crops have been damaged,” said Khalid Bath, chairman of the Pakistan Farmers Association.
He said losses could exceed 2.5 million acres, worth up to Rs1 trillion.
“This is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades,” said Iqrar Ahmad Khan, former vice chancellor of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad.
He estimates at least a tenth of the country’s crops are destroyed, with vegetable losses topping 90% in some districts.
The timing is perilous: Pakistan is about to sow wheat, the crop that provides nearly half of the country’s caloric intake. National reserves remain comfortable after a strong 2024 harvest, according to Crop Monitor, but the sowing window is at risk in fields still slick with silt and mud.
“Food insecurity is coming, not just higher prices,” Khan warned.
Underplaying risks
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal acknowledged the floods would “set back” GDP growth and said a clearer damage tally would be ready in about two weeks.
The country’s central bank said the deluge would cause a “temporary yet significant supply shock,” and it put growth near the lower end of its 3.25–4.25% range.
It argued the shock would be less severe than the $30 billion disaster in 2022, with stronger forex reserves and lower interest rates offering some resilience.
But prices for wheat, sugar, onions and tomatoes have jumped, pushing a sensitive price index to a 26‑month high.
IMF resident representative Mahir Binici said an upcoming review of the Extended Fund Facility this week will assess whether the 2026 fiscal year budget and emergency provisions can meet the nation’s needs. Iqbal called on the fund to “help us mitigate the damages”.
Some economists say policymakers are underplaying the risks.
“The floods will increase the current account deficit by $7 billion. They are worse than the previous floods,” former finance minister Hafeez Pasha said.
Counting losses
In industrial cities such as Sialkot — a hub for the textiles, sporting goods and surgical equipment that underpin Pakistan’s exports - several workshops were marooned.
The hit to agriculture is also a blow for manufacturers. Industrialists say cotton shortfalls will ripple into the textile sector, the country’s top foreign exchange earner, while rice exporters warn Pakistan risks losing competitiveness to India as prices rise.
“We had 400 acres of cotton, but only 90 are left,” farmer Rab Nawaz said, near the city of Multan.
At least 1,006 people have been killed since June 26, the National Disaster Management Authority said, while over 2.5 million people have been evacuated in Punjab and Sindh.
In Lahore, homes and small businesses were gutted.
Mohammad Arif, a 50 year old rickshaw driver and father of five, said he moved his vehicle to higher ground as his home was inundated.
“We have been on the roads for three days,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-23 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/231733207cc40eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944113/three-killed-one-injured-in-separate-karachi-accidents-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three killed, one injured in separate Karachi accidents: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people died and one was injured on Tuesday in two separate road accidents in Karachi, according to police.
According to a handout by Malir traffic police, a dumper truck crashed into a motorcycle coming from the opposite direction in Dur Muhammad Goth around 7.30am. “As a result, one of the men on the motorcycle died on the spot, while the other was injured,” the handout said.
The injured was shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, it said, adding that the accident was caused by the dumper truck driver’s negligence and reckless driving.
“The driver was arrested on the spot and taken to Memon Goth police station,” the handout said.
It added that both vehicles involved in the accident were also taken to the police station for legal procedure.
Police said further investigation of the incident was underway.
Meanwhile, a young man was injured in a traffic accident in Karachi’s Nazimabad area.
Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre reported that the man was injured while one-wheeling. He died during treatment at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
In another fatal speeding accident near the fire brigade office in Nazimabad, two boys riding a motorcycle lost their lives in a collision with a parked vehicle.
According to a report by the accident branch of Karachi traffic police said the two victims were injured and sent to the hospital via ambulance.
“Both the motorcycle riders died during treatment,” it added.
Separately, a handout by the central traffic police said a motorcycle rammed into a stationary car in Nazimabad around 6.35am. As a result, both people on the motorcycle were injured and taken to the hospital.
Both of them died during treatment at the hospital.
According to the police, the cause of the accident was speeding.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
At least seven members of a family lost their lives earlier this month when a truck crashed into their car on a national highway near Moro.
Last month, three people were killed and one was injured after a car hit a motorcycle at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass.</p><small>2025-09-23 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23180339f8c9caa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944124/ihcs-justice-jahangiri-moves-sc-for-early-hearing-of-plea-against-bar-on-judicial-work' target='_blank'><strong>IHC’s Justice Jahangiri moves SC for early hearing of plea against bar on judicial work</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri has approached the Supreme Court for an early hearing of his plea challenging the September 16 restraining order that barred him from performing judicial functions after a divisional IHC bench raised serious questions about the validity of his law degree from Karachi University (KU), it emerged on Tuesday.
A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council last year in July while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from KU’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
In an extraordinary development last week, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri challenged the decision in the SC last Friday in person, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The judge subsequently filed an application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, for an early hearing a day ago through Advocate Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah.
The application said the judge was restrained from performing his judicial functions and could not dispense justice, despite the “settled position” in law that such a restraining order could not be passed to stop a high court judge from performing his functions.
“The case concerns the important questions of law relating to the functioning of a judge of the high court and the independence of the judiciary, which are of grave concern to any jurisdiction. Hence, urgent intervention of this court is required.
“The impugned order opens the floodgates to litigation where any pending reference/complaint/petition, against any judge, can permit a high court to prevent him from performing his function. Hence, urgent intervention of this court is required to correct course and prevent such actions from straitjacketing the performance of judges of the high court,” the application said.
It argued that the impugned order was passed without considering Dawood’s bona fide, adding that the petition was not maintainable in the absence of such bona fide.
“Hence, this determination must be made at the onset to close the door to any such mala fide litigation initiated against constitutional functionaries. The crucial decision to restrain a judge from performing his function was made without even hearing the counterposition. The petitioner was never heard. Hence, it is imperative that the objections to maintainability to the petition filed against the petitioner be considered at the very onset, to prevent the litigation from unnecessarily precluding the petitioner from dispensing justice in the high court that he serves in.
“The petitioner can only serve as a judge of the high court till a particular age, and time lost due to the operation of the impugned order cannot be regained by him. Hence, this court must urgently intervene in the matter so that the petitioner can be restored and can continue to dispense justice in the high court that he serves in,” the application said.
The judge requested that his petition be fixed for a hearing this week.
The matter is only one of the controversies plaguing the IHC since five judges — namely Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Jahangiri, Saman Rafat Imtiaz and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan — had submitted separate petitions at the apex court together on Friday against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.</p><small>2025-09-23 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/231733233e7ea68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944122/saudi-arabias-grand-mufti-sheikh-abdul-aziz-bin-abdullah-al-sheikh-passes-away-royal-court' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia’s Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh passes away: Royal Court</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia on Tuesday announced the death of Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
“The Royal Court announced today the passing of Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh, who also served as the head of the Council of Senior Scholars, the General Presidency of Scholarly Research and Ifta, and the Supreme Council of the Muslim World League,” SPA reported, adding that the funeral prayers would be him at Riyadh’s Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque today.
The report said King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud also ordered that funeral prayers in absentia also be performed at Makkah’s Grand Mosque, Madina’s Masjid-i-Nabvi and in all mosques across the kingdom.
 






The Saudi Gazette said in a post on X that he was 82.
 






“The Royal Court stated that with his passing, the kingdom and the Islamic world have lost a distinguished scholar who made significant contributions to the service of Islam and Muslims,” SPA said.
It added that King Salman and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also extended their condolences to the grand mufti’s family, the Saudi nation and the Muslim world.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief over the death, calling it a great loss for the Muslim world.
The president said that Sheikh Abdulaziz’s religious services and scholarly guidance would always be remembered.
 






PM Shehbaz said the deceased was a great religious scholar who spent his entire life in religious activities and forwarding the cause of Islam.
 


“His efforts and scholarly insight for the unity of the Muslim ummah will always be remembered. The Pakistani people and government share equally in the grief of the people of the brotherly country of Saudi Arabia and the Saudi leadership,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that the grand mufti’s services were a “bright chapter in the religious and scholarly tradition”, adding that future generations would continue to receive guidance from his scholarly legacy.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also extended his condolences to the Saudi leadership and people over the grand mufti’s death, paying tribute to his lifelong services and contributions.
He noted that Sheikh Abdulaziz’s scholarly, jurisprudential and religious legacy would remain a “guiding light” for the Muslim world.
“Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah Al-Sheikh held the distinguished honour of delivering the Haj sermon more times than any other scholar, a testament to his profound influence and revered standing in the Islamic world.”

In his address to the General Assembly this year, PM Shehbaz will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, the government statement posted on X said. It added that the PM will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.
PM Shehbaz’s “participation in this biggest annual gathering of global leaders will showcase Pakistan’s strong commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations and to highlight Pakistan’s longstanding contribution towards the shared objectives of peace and development,” the statement read.
 






The prime minister, who reached New York late Monday night after departing from London, will be accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, other ministers and senior officials.
On the sidelines of the UNGA session, he will hold meetings with Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker, Kuwait’s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Khalid, World Bank President Ajay Banga and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
According to the government statement, the PM will exchange of views on issues of mutual interest during his bilateral meetings with world leaders and senior UN officials.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN Member States to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council. “
Moreover, he will attend several high-level events, including important meetings of the UN Security Council, a high-level meeting of the Global Development Initiative on the theme “Recommit to our Original Aspirations, United to Build a Brighter Future of Global Development” and a special high-level event on climate action, the government statement said.
Trump’s meeting with Arab, Muslim leaders
In New York, PM Shehbaz will also attend a special summit of Arab and Muslim countries, co-hosted by the United States and Qatar, in which US President Donald Trump will also participate.
The prime minister has been specially invited to participate in the summit.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump will hold a multilateral meeting with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan.
A person familiar with the matter said Gaza will be discussed, according to Reuters.
Axios reported that Trump will present the group with a proposal for peace and post-war governance in Gaza.
In addition to freeing hostages and ending the war, Trump is expected to discuss US plans around an Israeli withdrawal and post-war governance in Gaza, without Hamas involvement, according to Axios.
Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported.
Dar in New York
Ahead of the start of the UNGA session today, France and Monaco extended formal recognition to the State of Palestine at a high-level conference in New York on Monday.
Foreign Minister Dar, who represented Pakistan at the conference, was not among the speakers — which inc­luded heads of state and government from countries such as Turkiye, Australia, Brazil and Canada, among others.
However, he welcomed ann­ouncements regarding the recognition of Palestine by several countries on X.
 






According to state-run PTV News, Dar met Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand today on the sidelines of the UNGA session. “They acknowledged the positive trajectory of Pakistan–Canada relations, agreed to further strengthen economic and trade ties and recognised the vital role of the Pakistani diaspora in Canada,” PTV News reported.
 






Dar also posted a picture of his with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on X. In his post, he said he had “reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Syrian people”, in his meeting with the Syrian president. “And we shared the resolve to further deepen historic Pakistan–Syria friendship through cooperation across diverse domains, including trade, human capital and development.”
 






State broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported that the foreign minister also met Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Secretary General Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi.
Dar underscored during the meeting the importance Pakistan attaches to its ties with the GCC and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation with the Council member states, the report said, adding that both sides discussed ways to enhance collaboration across various sectors and to expand institutional linkages between Pakistan and the GCC.
According to the FO, the foreign minister also met his Hungarian counterpart today.
“The two sides expressed their resolve for the early finalisation of the agreement for the protection of mutual investments, agreement on cooperation in the area of civil aviation and commencement of direct flight operations between the two countries, as well as finalisation of visa abolition agreement for diplomatic and official passport holders,” the FO statement said.
 






Yesterday, he took part in the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting at UN Head­quarters. He also participated in consultations hosted by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Other participants included the deputy prime ministers of Jordan and UAE, and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye. He also met with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand.

An ATC in Rawalpindi was hearing a case against Imran pertaining to an attack on the army’s General Headquarters GHQ) on May 9, 2023, when the PTI founder’s arrest had sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were torched and vandalised.
During today’s hearing, Imran was included via a WhatsApp call, following the court’s dismissal of a plea for his in-person appearance last week.
His lawyers, Salman Akram Raja and Faisal Malik, sought Judge Amjad Ali Shah’s permission to talk to the ex-premier. But during the call, Imran’s voice was disrupted and his face appeared blurred on screen, leading his lawyers to boycott the court proceedings.
They stated that such a trial was “unfair”.
The court, however, recorded the statements of eight witnesses, including the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority additional director, the Federal Investigation Agency’s technical assistant and the Pakistan Information Department deputy director.
For their part, the PTI lawyers said they “rejected” the recording of witnesses’ statements in this manner.
The court then adjourned the hearing, summoning more witnesses on September 27.
Imran was indicted in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.
PTI files plea
After boycotting the court proceedings, Raja also expressed his grievances during his interaction with the media.
“A mobile phone was placed before Khan sahib in jail, on which a video call was made. On this side, the judge received the call on a phone he had,” he said. He added that during the call Imran could not hear what was being said in the court and those present in the courtroom could not hear him.
“Then obviously, Khan sahib is unaware of the testimonies being recorded,” he said.
 






He also shared that they had requested the judge to let them talk to Imran, but they were unable to do so. “The judge said that [we] were unable to talk [to Imran] because the link was very weak.”
He also highlighted that they had the right to talk to Imran alone. “But this right, too, was denied,” he added.
Raja said they had prepared an application, which Malik would be submitting to the court.
“And we have conveyed to the court that it is not possible for us to remain a part of this process … There should be an open trial and the accused should be given the chance to talk to his lawyers,” he continued.
Raja said that they had also filed a plea “against this process” with the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench.</p><small>2025-09-23 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23160640eb93f52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944115/china-penalises-bytedance-and-alibaba-platforms-in-content-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>China penalises ByteDance and Alibaba platforms in content crackdown</strong></a><br><p>China’s top internet regulator said Tuesday it would take action against ByteDance-owned news app Jinri Toutiao and Alibaba’s internet browser company UCWeb for allegedly displaying harmful content, a day after announcing a two-month social media crackdown.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) vowed on Monday to combat content containing “malicious incitement of conflict” and “negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.
Beijing requires social media companies to moderate content on their platforms, with posts strictly controlled to avoid anything deemed to be too subversive, vulgar, pornographic or generally harmful.
The CAC had already announced penalties this month against three popular digital platforms — micro-blogging platform Weibo, short video app Kuaishou and Instagram-like Xiaohongshu — for allegedly neglecting content management duties.
Authorities have not specified what punitive actions are being taken against those platforms.
The CAC said Tuesday that measures taken against news aggregator app Toutiao included “summoning the company for a meeting, ordering rectification within a specified time limit, issuing a warning, and strictly dealing with those responsible”.
The platform had failed to fulfil its primary responsibility of managing information content and allowed “harmful content” to appear on the main section of its trending search list, “thereby damaging the online ecosystem”, the statement said.
It gave no further details about the content type or punishments.
“Internet regulators will continue to focus on prominent illegal and non-compliant activities that undermine the online ecosystem,” the CAC added.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, the CAC said it would take similar measures against UCWeb after the Alibaba-owned platform displayed entries relating to “extremely sensitive and malicious” events and topics such as “online violence and the privacy of minors”.
The two-month campaign announced Monday by the CAC aims “to regulate the malicious incitement of conflict and the promotion of violence and vicious currents”, the CAC said.
The statement then listed specific online issues authorities hope to tackle in the crackdown, including “exploiting social hot spots to forcibly associate identity, region or gender with other information, stigmatising and hyping them”.</p><small>2025-09-23 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23151313334ba53.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944111/new-wb-report-highlights-rise-in-national-poverty-rate-calls-for-people-centred-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>New WB report highlights rise in national poverty rate, calls for people-centred reforms</strong></a><br><p>A new report published by the World Bank (WB) on Tuesday called attention to the rising national poverty rate in Pakistan, highlighting the need for sustained and people-centred reforms to protect vulnerable populations.
The report, titled “Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan’s Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment”, marks the first comprehensive evaluation of poverty and welfare trends in the country since the early 2000s, according to a WB press release today.
According to the release, the national poverty rate has begun to rise again since 2020, after a steady decline from 64.3 per cent in 2001-02 to 21.9pc in 2018-19.
“This is largely owing to compounding shocks — including COVID-19, inflation, floods, and macroeconomic stress — but also because the consumption-driven growth model that delivered early gains has reached its limits,” it said.
The report explored data from 25 years of household surveys, now casted projections, and geospatial analysis, as well as unique sources of administrative data.
The Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) informed the WB’s official poverty estimates. Beyond the latest available survey round in 2018-19, it used microsimulation models to project estimates, saying that new poverty estimates and trends would be produced after the release of the recently collected HIES 2024-25 data.
 
 

The WB found that the reduction of poverty was primarily a result of rising income from non-agricultural labour, with more households moving from farm work to service jobs.
“However, slow and uneven structural transformation has hindered diversification, job creation, and inclusive growth,” it said, adding that this resulted in low productivity across sectors that constrained income growth. It also pointed out that over 85pc of jobs remained informal and women and youth remained “largely excluded” from the labour force.
Other observations included that nearly 40pc of children were stunted and that a quarter of primary-school-aged children were out of school, while 75pc of those attending primary school had very limited reading comprehension skills.
Additionally, the report found a widespread deficit in public services, with only half of all households having safely managed access to drinking water in 2018 and 31pc lacking safe sanitation.
“The report underscores systematic, complex, and persistent spatial disparities in welfare across Pakistan,” the press release said. “Rural poverty remains more than twice as high as urban poverty, and many districts that lagged behind decades ago continue to do so today. Furthermore, unplanned urbanisation has led to ‘sterile agglomeration’ — crowded settlements with low living standards.”
The WB report called for “sustained and people-centred reforms” to protect vulnerable families, improve livelihood opportunities, and expand access to basic services to alleviate these concerns.
One of the lead authors of the report, Senior Economist Christina Wieser, said, “Reforms that expand access to quality services, protect households from shocks, and create better jobs — especially for the bottom 40pc — are essential to break cycles of poverty and deliver durable, inclusive growth.”
The report outlined four pathways to restoring progress in the fight against poverty. It highlighted the need for investment in people, places and public services, accompanied by strengthening local governance, and advocated for responsive and inclusive safety nets to increase household shock resilience.
It also stressed the importance of progressive fiscal measures, including improving municipal finance and targeting investment in the poorest of the country, and recommended investing in timely data systems to support efficient decision-making processes and track progress.
“It will be critical to protect Pakistan’s hard-won poverty gains while accelerating reforms that expand jobs and opportunities — especially for women and young people,” said Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
“By focusing on results — investing in people, places, and access to opportunities; building resilience against shocks; prioritising fiscal management; and developing better data systems for decision-making — Pakistan can put poverty reduction back on track.”
In January, the World Bank pledged to provide $20bn to Pakistan under a 10-year country partnership framework (CPF) to support inclusive and sustainable development within the country.</p><small>2025-09-23 10:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23150140143a3de.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944109/phc-grants-imaan-mazari-husband-protective-bail-in-tussle-with-ihcba' target='_blank'><strong>PHC grants Imaan Mazari, husband protective bail in tussle with IHCBA</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday granted rights activist Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha transit bail, three days after the couple was booked following a clash with the president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA).
The police had registered a case against Mazari, her spouse, Zainab Janjua and several PTI-linked lawyers, including Naeem Panjhuta and Fateullah Barkiunder, under anti-terror laws after the IHCBA alleged that the bar leadership was “assaulted” by the lawyers, the suspects had also raised slogans against state institutions.
Mazari and the other booked lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
The hearing was presided over by PHC judge Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, who granted a protective bail to the couple and asked them to appear before a relevant court by October 9.
Mazari and her spouse appeared in the court today along with their lawyers
Ataullah Kundi, Jahanzeb Mehsud, and Tariq Afghan.
Meanwhile, Additional Attorney General Sanaullah appeared on behalf of the IGCBA.
 
 

Advocate Ataullah Kundi told Justice Shah that “a case was registered against the two petitioners in Islamabad,” to which he asked whether both of the petitioners were lawyers.
Kundi responded: “Yes, both of them are lawyers and would like to appear in the court.”
Addressing the petitioners, Justice Shah asked if this was their first time in Peshawar, to which Mazari replied in the affirmative, prompting Justice Shah to remark, “At least you came to Peshawar on the pretext of the FIR.”
“You people never come to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa anyway,” he added.
Advocate Kundi argued in front of Justice Shah that “Imaan Mazari is the voice of the people of KP and Balochistan,” adding that she was also a social worker in Islamabad.
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, recently also approached inquiry committees of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
The lawyer announced the development on X, saying that she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
This followed her altercation with Justice Dogar during a hearing earlier this month and his subsequent remarks over the exchange, which she described as “sexist”.
Meanwhile, she and husband Hadi also face charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media.</p><small>2025-09-23 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23132533464547d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944102/3-injured-as-grenade-explodes-at-scrap-shop-in-kps-mardan-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 injured as grenade explodes at scrap shop in KP’s Mardan: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people were injured after a grenade exploded at a scrap shop in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district, police said on Tuesday.

Expert Opinion by High-Level Panel on Public Interest Media
Governments around the world are chasing the AI dream, pinning their hopes on these technologies to drive economic prosperity. And yet, they are not investing in the foundational resource that underpins all our 21st century economies — independent, verifiable information.
Well-functioning economies rely on widely accessible, verified, and trustworthy information. Public interest journalism provides a vital supply of such information: it exposes corruption, fraud, and market manipulation, brings stability to financial markets, checks misinformation, and it empowers economic actors to make informed investments. Without it, national economies, international trade, and capital flows between countries cannot function properly, with wide-ranging and negative impacts on social welfare.
But this valuable resource is facing an existential financial and political crisis worldwide.
The High-Level Panel on Public Interest Media, including two Nobel laureates, was formed to assess the economic and social implications of the crisis confronting public interest media globally. We have reviewed the evidence and surveyed global trends with a growing sense of alarm.
We are concerned that our economies are increasingly vulnerable to information that is neither independent, nor accurate. In 2024, as many as 90 countries were targeted by foreign state-sponsored efforts to manipulate information. The rise of Generative AI risks accelerating these tactics and heightens the challenges in thwarting the spread of false information online. Meanwhile, independent journalists and media organizations are coming under increasing political and economic pressures as autocracies and vested interests take hold.
Our report, The Economic Imperative of Investing in Public Interest Media, shows why market forces alone are incapable of sustaining this vital public good: historically profitable business models are failing as revenues migrate to online platforms, allowing powerful interests to co-opt, intimidate or neutralize independent media.
While donor support for public interest media has always been low, it is now dwarfed by the amount invested by autocratic actors on propaganda. Russia spends on disinformation and propaganda, including on content directed outside its borders, at least three times the foreign aid of the world’s largest democratic nations in support of free and independent media, and is not alone in doing so.
The situation is even more complicated in developing economies, where growing inequality regarding access to information requires championing local innovation to correct systematic biases and digital inequalities, as can be observed in the African media ecosystem, for example.
Without reliable information, we cannot address the most pressing economic, social, and environmental challenges of our times. From tackling the climate crisis to managing global pandemics, the proliferation of disinformation over facts carries immense costs. Without decisive action, both at domestic and global levels, we are heading towards what Nobel laureate Maria Ressa has called “an information Armageddon” that will jeopardise global economic stability, social welfare, and sustainable growth.
We urgently call for decisive public action now, and lay out two priority sets of action to protect public interest media, and develop the policies needed to shape tomorrow’s information markets for economic prosperity and social welfare.
Both require a fundamental reappraisal of the economic and social value of independent, verifiable information as a foundational infrastructure for thriving markets and societies.
First, governments should invest in the new models needed to incentivize, support and safeguard free and independent media. Financial support to public interest media is one of the most cost-effective interventions to ensure accountable, well-functioning economic systems with potentially large future economic and social returns. However, such investments must be accompanied by strong safeguards to prevent government capture and should foster a pluralistic media ecosystem that includes the private sector and a vibrant civil society.
They should be channeled through proven and effective national and multilateral mechanisms that sustain the supply of factual information and provide guardrails against undue influence. Mechanisms like the International Fund for Public Interest Media demonstrate how independence and scale can be combined to deliver significant global impact, as similar pooled vehicles have done in areas like health and education.
Second, governments need to actively shape information markets in ways that foster independent, pluralistic and reliable information sources. An ‘information industrial policy’ is needed to foster a viable and independent media ecosystem - one that incentivizes market dynamism along with carefully managed regulation fit for an AI-driven economy. Such a policy must better incorporate public needs and oversight, which will be critical in developed and developing economies alike, and reward facts over lies. Multilateral cooperation frameworks like the International Partnership for Information and Democracy can help foster shared learning and best practices on policy interventions.
First signs of progress are emerging. In a few weeks, the Presidents of France and Ghana will host an International Conference to strengthen the response to the global information crisis. Yet more leaders must urgently embrace this agenda. Without decisive action, our information ecosystems will continue to deteriorate rapidly, weakening the benefits of the AI revolution and threatening both global prosperity and social welfare. The moment to act is now.

Published in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025</p><small>2025-09-23 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1814384913684ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937964/digital-battlefield-militants-vs-the-state-in-the-war-of-narratives' target='_blank'><strong>Digital battlefield: Militants vs the state in the war of narratives</strong></a><br><p>In September last year, militants attacked a police station in Swat district, martyring one policeman and injuring two others. The attack itself wasn’t out of the ordinary — after all, Swat is no stranger to terrorist attacks. What was different about this attack was the modus operandi adopted by the militants.
Over the course of the next several days, investigators pieced together clues on the attack, which they later confirmed was carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED). “They had used an improvised explosive device, made of a power bank, which is mostly used for charging mobile phones,” District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah later told Dawn.
The investigators, said Dr Zahidullah, pored over hours of CCTV footage to identify one of the militants, who in turn gave up the names of two other suspects. But the biggest breakthrough came during the course of the investigation when the militants admitted that they never used common means of communication to contact each other. Rather, they would communicate via the chat room of a popular video game, ‘Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds’, popularly known as PUBG, both to motivate new members and plan attacks. “The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” the DPO explained.
The revelation should have raised alarm bells in the power corridors: that a local affiliate of a terror outfit was using a gaming platform not only to recruit, but also to plan attacks is rather concerning, given there isn’t much law enforcers can do to access or monitor these chatrooms. However, this cat-and-mouse chase with terror outfits when it comes to the use of digital technologies has become a norm now — not just in Pakistan, but across the world.
Propaganda tool
There was a time when militants published newspapers, periodicals, posters, magazines, and distributed CDs to fuel their propaganda machinery. In recent years, however, they have become as equipped in the use of digital media as state actors, if not more.
Moreover, militants’ transnational outreach with like-minded jihadists has helped them formulate advanced propaganda techniques to counter the state narrative. This digital battle is waging at the same time as the conflict on the ground, highlighting the complexities of modern warfare, where state and non-state actors find themselves at the same level.
Of late, an interesting yet concerning trend has come to light, where Pakistani state-run social media accounts, established over the last few years, are actively engaged in posting content related to militancy, countering militant propaganda, and building a state narrative. At the same time, the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) appears to have launched just as many social media accounts to counter the state’s messaging.
 
 

Many of the accounts run by the terror outfit pose as news and research platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). They often appear with a blue tick, which lends them more legitimacy and makes viewers more likely to follow them, who in turn believe accounts genuinely represent news and research organisations.
Recently, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, as well as several state-linked accounts on X, posted links to militants’ WhatsApp accounts, urging the platform to take down these accounts for disseminating terrorist propaganda.
In many cases, militant propaganda is as lethal as their actual acts of violence. With the advent of social media, where respective platforms struggle to distinguish between state and non-state actors, terrorists gain an advantage in exploiting local social grievances against the state, which in turn helps them with both recruitment and fund generation.
Offline vs online
Currently, every militant group, whether jihadist outfits or separatist groups like the Baloch insurgents, has dedicated propaganda teams. The TTP’s propaganda team, for example, is almost entirely focused on running the organisation’s propaganda efforts without participating in ground operations.
Following the TTP, the Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), an emergent alliance of three Pakistani Jihadist factions, has made significant strides in its propaganda efforts. The latter produces high-quality, multilingual content, including infographics, videos featuring trainings and attacks, posters tailored to specific contexts and events to influence target audiences, and statements providing daily updates on attacks carried out by the alliance.
Jihadists worldwide have amply developed the ability to globalise their agenda, opening a door for anyone to be part of a “digital” jihad as volunteers. These volunteers, unable to interact physically, play key roles in propagating jihadist propaganda, viewing it as a religious duty, and do so without expecting monetary returns, instead utilising their own resources to further the jihadist cause.
In this context, the Islamic State and its regional affiliate, the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), have conducted or attempted to carry out attacks globally, from Russia to the US, by leveraging the power of digital propaganda to inspire others. Utilising sophisticated and hard-to-trace encrypted communications, they have expanded their reach worldwide, leaving state authorities struggling to keep pace.
 
 

This is why security analysts worldwide emphasise that winning the war of narratives is just as crucial as winning the war on the ground.
The extensive advent of social media and AI has enabled militant groups to disseminate their ideologies swiftly and widely, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers, with reduced costs and threats of being traced. This allows militant organisations to maintain a presence on the propaganda front, even if severely compromised operationally. In such situations, militant outfits’ core objective remains to inspire others through propaganda and ultimately regain lost strength.
From gaming apps to secret chat rooms
Pakistani security officials maintain that transnational jihadists have increasingly turned to online gaming applications as a means of secure communication, aiming to evade detection.
“After PUBG, there are indications that they are now using Ludo Star for communication to evade possible detection. Militants, particularly the transnational ones, are more tech-savvy than domestic ones. However, these transnational groups often act as trainers, sharing their technical expertise with local groups. We are faced with multi-domain threat scenarios and are battling it on a daily basis. You have to fight it both in the real world and the virtual one,” said a senior Pakistani security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The ISKP is a prime example, which, despite suffering significant setbacks in recent years, has persisted with an intense propaganda campaign to attract fresh recruits and thereby maintain its standing as the most dreaded militant outfit globally.
The latest report by the UN sanctions monitoring team, based on intelligence inputs from member states, has raised serious concerns about the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and various communication platforms for propaganda and recruitment purposes, allowing terrorist groups to evade detection by state authorities.
“Both Al-Qaeda and ISIL (the militant Islamic State in Levant) continued to experiment with different communication platforms to glorify violence and promote an idealised life under their rule. ISIL tried to exploit TikTok’s reach and algorithmic power for recruitment. Al-Qaeda continued to try to exploit gaming platforms for recruitment. Once an initial contact has been made, potential recruits were directed to encrypted apps (such as Telegram, Element, Discord, Threema, or Zangi), for tasking. (These) groups also continued to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI), mostly for recruitment, and to enhance propaganda,” the report says.
Al-Qaeda’s propaganda tactics, utilising modern tools, then trickle down to its like-minded jihadists, such as the TTP. Al-Qaeda has long been regarded as the architect of propaganda tactics for both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. Both ISKP and Al-Qaeda, along with the latter’s local jihadist allies, consider propaganda an integral part of their existence, just like their operational part.
A war Pakistan cannot fight alone
Militant groups have consistently outmanoeuvred law enforcement authorities on multiple fronts in recent months, employing sophisticated propaganda strategies, adapting revenue generation methods and frequently changing operational tactics in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, while the state remains entrenched in traditional approaches.
 
 

Beyond the digital outreach of militants, including the TTP and Baloch armed separatists, to their target audience in the cyber realm, a growingly alarming trend that has emerged in recent months is the increased physical accessibility of militants to locals in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, compared to state officials.
In areas with high militant concentrations, state authorities often find themselves confined to government compounds, while locals’ interactions with militants are becoming routine occurrences, causing a significant disconnect between state representatives and locals. This distance substantially benefits militants in bolstering both their physical presence and ideological outreach through preaching.
The threat posed by militancy cannot be defeated by a single country; its multidimensional nature demands a collaborative approach involving multiple nations. Even the world’s most advanced countries struggle to combat terrorism alone, so it’s unrealistic to expect Pakistan, with its meagre resources, to tackle it solo.
Furthermore, the increasing use of proxy wars, which has become a norm in the region, where militants are employed by rival states to weaken adversaries without going into direct confrontation, creates a perilous cycle. This trend prompts retaliatory measures in kind from the target state, fuelling further instability and inadvertently strengthening the militants’ threat.
If Pakistan is to effectively combat militancy, it must effectively work on building alliances with other countries in the region as well as incorporate a more transnational approach aimed at countering militants’ propaganda and digital warfare. Militants are now more adept than ever at leveraging digital technologies. It’s time the state caught up too.

In an extraordinary news conference at the White House, the Republican president delivered medical advice to pregnant women and parents of young children, repeatedly telling them not to use or administer the painkiller and suggesting that common vaccines not be taken together or so early in a child’s life.
The advice from Trump, who acknowledged he is not a doctor, goes against that of medical societies, which cite data from numerous studies showing that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, plays a safe role in the well-being of pregnant women.

“I want to say it like it is, don’t take Tylenol. Don’t take it,” Trump said.
“Other things that we recommend, or certainly I do anyway, is … don’t let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you’ve ever seen in your life,” he said, referring to vaccines.
Trump administration backs leucovorin as treatment
Trump’s team suggested leucovorin, a form of folic acid, as a treatment for autism symptoms.
Dozens of medical, research, and autism advocacy groups, including the American Academy of Paediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, decried the president’s announcement.
“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer,” the Coalition of Autism Scientists said in a statement.
Standing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who has argued that no vaccine is safe, Trump called for a reexamination of a link between vaccines and autism, a theory that has been repeatedly debunked.
 
 

“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said in a statement.
Kenvue shares recover in late day trading
Shares of consumer health company Kenvue recovered five per cent in extended trading after slumping more than 7pc in Monday’s trading session.
The stock remains down about 14pc since September 5, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Kennedy planned to link acetaminophen to autism. Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023.
Trump said he is a big believer in vaccines, having led in his first-term the pandemic initiative to speed Covid-19 vaccine development. Still, he called for the removal of mercury from vaccines and said children should not get the hepatitis B vaccine before the age of 12. It is normally given in the first 24 hours after birth. He also said the measles-mumps-rubella combination vaccine should be split into three separate shots.
The Tylenol-autism link announcement was reminiscent of Trump’s regular press briefings in the early months of the pandemic, when he would frequently dispense advice that was not founded on science, including his suggestion that people ingest bleach, which his supporters later said was not serious.
Studies have shown that vaccines are safe, eradicating childhood diseases such as polio and measles in the US. Over the last 50 years, it is estimated that essential vaccines have saved at least 154 million lives, Unicef USA President & CEO Michael J. Nyenhuis has said.
Only one in four Americans believes recent recommendations for fewer vaccines from the Trump administration were based on scientific evidence and facts, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed this month.
“I cannot say that I’ve ever experienced anything like this in vaccines,” said Dr Norman Baylor, former director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.
Trump administration announces steps it will take
The Trump administration has asked drug companies to be prepared to ramp up production of leucovorin as a treatment for some autism patients, Food and Drug Administration chief Marty Makary told reporters.
The FDA approved a version of the drug made by GSK, aimed at treating a condition associated with autism, but which the drugmaker no longer manufactures. Once it is established for use, the administration said Medicaid insurance for low-income people would cover the drug for autism symptoms.
The FDA, in its approval process, cited a review of the use of leucovorin in 40 patients with a rare metabolic disorder called cerebral folate deficiency that can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, some of which are seen in people with autism.
The FDA said it would seek a label change for over-the-counter Tylenol and its generic versions to reflect evidence suggesting that use during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD in children. The FDA also sent a letter to doctors with a similar warning, but said a causal relationship had not been established.
Researchers say there is no causal link
Researchers say there is no firm evidence of a link between the use of Tylenol and autism. A 2024 study of nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden found no causal link between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders.
A 2025 review of 46 earlier studies did suggest a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of these conditions, but the researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Harvard University and others said the study does not prove the drug caused the outcomes.
They advised that pregnant women should continue to use acetaminophen as needed, at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible period. Trump officials cited that review and used similar language in advising how much Tylenol to take.
“It is clear that the Tylenol-autism link is not a new question — it has been looked at many times and in many different studies,” autism researcher Dr Diana Schendel of the A J Drexel Autism Institute said in a statement, noting that she would like to see what new evidence the administration comes up with.
“Without showing any evidence to back them up, the announcements become reckless and potentially harmful.” Researchers say leucovorin, used to treat some cancer patients on chemotherapy, has shown some promise in very small trials, but that large, randomised trials are still needed.
“There’s not good evidence that it works. There are some studies, but they’re small and they’re not the best studies. And so it’s certainly not something I’m actively recommending,” said Dr Audrey Brumback, an autism expert and researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><small>2025-09-23 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2312030805fe2ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944095/copenhagen-oslo-airports-reopen-after-drone-sightings' target='_blank'><strong>Copenhagen, Oslo airports reopen after drone sightings</strong></a><br><p>Airports in Copenhagen and Oslo reopened on Tuesday, police said, hours after unidentified drones in their airspace caused flight diversions and other travel disruption.
In the Danish capital Copenhagen, police said several large drones seen over the airport for several hours late on Monday eventually flew away on their own.
“The drones have disappeared and the airport is open again,” Deputy Police Inspector Jakob Hansen told reporters.
“We didn’t take the drones down,” he added.
Hansen said police were cooperating with the Danish military and intelligence service to find out where the drones had come from.
He said police were also working with colleagues in Oslo after drone sightings in the Norwegian capital also caused the airport to close for several hours.
“We had two different drone sightings,” Oslo airport spokeswoman Monica Fasting told AFP.
“We reopened the airport around 3:15 am (6:15 am PKT),” she said.
Flights were diverted to nearby destinations during the closures, and officials at both airports said they expected some delays and disruptions to continue on Tuesday.
The incidents came after the governments of Poland, Estonia and Romania accused Russia of violating their airspace this month, allegations that Moscow has brushed off.
Asked whether the drones above Copenhagen airport could have come from Russia, Hansen, the deputy police inspector, said: “We don’t know at this point.”
Danish police also said that drones that shut the country’s main airport appeared to have been flown by “a capable operator” seeking to demonstrate certain abilities, adding that no suspects had been identified.
“We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,” Danish police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the drones observed in Copenhagen.
“It’s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,” Jespersen said, adding that it was too early to say if the incidents in Denmark and Norway were linked.</p><small>2025-09-23 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23091536bfe411d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944028/tribal-elder-gets-bail-in-degari-honour-killing-case' target='_blank'><strong>Tribal elder gets bail in Degari ‘honour’ killing case</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Monday granted bail to tribal elder Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai, who was arrested in July this year after the murder of a man and woman in the name of ‘honour’ in the Degari mining area of Quetta district.
A single-judge bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kasi, after hearing arguments from both sides, granted bail to Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai against surety bonds of Rs500,000. He was released following the court’s approval of the bail application.
Earlier, police had arrested Sardar Satakzai on the allegation that, as a tribal chief, he had endorsed through a jirga the killing of the woman and the man. Acting on the jirga’s order, the woman’s brother opened fire on his 40-year-old sister, Bano Bibi, in the presence of a large number of people from the area. At the same time, the man, Ehsanullah, was also killed at the same place.
 
 

The incident came to light after a video of the firing went viral on social media more than a month after the killings had taken place. Police launched an investigation and arrested several people, including Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai.
So far, police have arrested 17 people in connection with the case, including Bano Bibi’s mother and another brother. The mother was later released on bail. However, the main accused, who shot and killed his own sister, has not yet been arrested.

Dembele, 28, edged out Barcelona sensation Lamine Yamal to succeed Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri, who took the trophy in 2024, as the winner of the most prestigious individual prize in football — an award that for many years had been dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
Former Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona forward Dembele, who was part of the France team that won the World Cup in 2018, scored 35 goals in all competitions as PSG claimed a French league and cup double as well as winning the Champions League.
With Dembele converted into a centre-forward following Kylian Mbappe’s departure for Real Madrid, PSG went on to hammer Inter Milan 5-0 in the final in Munich to win the European Cup for the first time in their history.
“I really don’t have the words. It was an incredible season with PSG,” an emotional Dembele said on the stage at the Theatre du Chatelet in central Paris.
He added that his boss Luis Enrique — who won the award for club coach of the year — had been “like a father” to him.
“It is an individual trophy but it was really the collective that won it,” insisted Dembele, who was one of nine members of the triumphant PSG team from last season to be nominated for the prize.
“The Ballon d’Or has not really been an objective for me in my career but I worked hard for the team to win the Champions League.”
The 18-year-old Yamal, who was a teammate of Dembele’s at Barcelona when he first broke through in 2023, did earlier win the Kopa Trophy for the best player aged under 21 — the second year running he has taken that award.
Dembele was at the ceremony to pick up his prize while his PSG teammates were losing 1-0 in a Ligue 1 game in Marseille at the same time — that match had been scheduled for Sunday but was put back 24 hours due to bad weather in the south of France.
Three in a row
Barcelona and Spain midfielder Bonmati won the women’s prize by edging out her international teammate Mariona Caldentey, with whom she played in the Spain side who were beaten on penalties by England in the Women’s Euro 2025 final.
Bonmati, 27, also lost the Women’s Champions League final with her club last season, at the hands of Caldentey’s Arsenal.
Bonmati was named player of the tournament at the Euros, despite not starting either of Spain’s first two matches as she recovered from a bout of viral meningitis.
“I am very proud,” said Bonmati, who credited her teammates for their role in her personal triumph.
“I think I am here for the third consecutive time because of the teams I play in, so all of this is because of them.”
Alessia Russo, one of the nominees from the triumphant England European Championship team and also of Arsenal, came third.
Bonmati’s run of three in a row follows back-to-back victories for her Barcelona and Spain teammate Alexia Putellas.
Norway’s Ada Hegerberg and USA star Megan Rapinoe are the only other players to have won the Women’s Ballon d’Or since it was introduced in 2018.
The Ballon d’Or is voted for by a panel of journalists, one from each of the top 100 countries in the FIFA world rankings for the men, and from the top 50 for the women.
Vicky Lopez, the 19-year-old forward who is a teammate of Bonmati’s with Barcelona and Spain, was named best young women’s player.
Gianluigi Donnarumma, who excelled in the PSG team that swept all aside last season before moving to Manchester City, claimed the Yashin trophy for best goalkeeper.
England’s Euro winner Hannah Hampton claimed the best women’s goalkeeper award, while her international manager Sarina Wiegman was named best women’s coach.</p><small>2025-09-23 05:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23092004bddd5e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944033/balochistan-opposition-terms-mines-and-minerals-law-illegal' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan opposition terms mines and minerals law ‘illegal’</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: A joint meeting of op­­position parties in the Balochistan Assembly has declared Mines and Minerals Act, 2025, unconstitutional, against provincial autonomy and ownership rights of the province under the 18th Constitution Amendment, and demanded its withdrawal.

Opposition leader in the Balochistan Assembly, Mir Younis Aziz Zehri, presided over the meeting. Leaders of opposition parties, members of civil society and leaders of the mine owners’ association attended the meeting.
 
 

Participants of the meeting reaffirmed that opposition parties are custodians of public interests and they will oppose any step that undermines public interests.

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Raffat Imtiaz had appeared in person before the Supreme Court last Friday to institute constitutional petitions challenging the exercise of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
According to the objections, the petitioners invoked the apex court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the grievances raised were of an individual nature and thus not maintainable in view of the 1998 Zulfiqar Mehdi case.
In that judgement, the SC had held that Article 184(3) could not be pressed into service for redress of personal grievances.
 
 

Incidentally, the same case law was cited by the SC registrar while returning Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar’s petition, seeking a hearing of challenges to the 26th Amendment, on the same day. The registrar office further observed that the petitioners had not demonstrated what questions of “public importance” were involved for the enforcement of fundamental rights — a condition precedent for invoking Article 184(3), sources said.
It added that the notices issued to the respondents — IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, the registrar of the high court, and the federal government through the law secretary — had not been properly drawn up, since they failed to specify the purpose of the petitions.
In their petitions, the judges sought a declaration that the administrative powers of the IHC chief justice could not be exercised in a manner that undermined judicial authority. They argued that once a bench was seized of a matter, the IHC CJ was not empowered to transfer cases or reconstitute the bench, nor to exclude available judges from the roster at will.
The pleas further contended that constitution of benches, transfer of cases and issuance of rosters could only be undertaken in terms of Articles 192(1) and 202 of the Constitution, and that the “Master of the Roster” doctrine had already been set aside by the SC in its 2024 judgement in the Practice and Procedure case.
They also challenged the formation of the IHC administrative committees through notifications issued on Feb 3 and July 15 this year, terming them mala fide, illegal and coram non judice, and requested the apex court to declare such notifications void.

• Dar attends, but doesn’t address high-level moot
• PM due to meet Trump alongside Muslim leaders
• Palestine flag unfurled at London mission
NEW YORK: France and Monaco extended formal recognition to the State of Palestine at a high-level conference on Monday.
“We must do everything within our power to preserve the very possibility of a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security,” French President Emmanuel Macron said before announcing the diplomatic move, drawing lengthy applause from the audience.
Macron outlined a framework for a “renewed Palestinian Authority” under which France would open an embassy subject to factors such as reforms, a ceasefire and the release of all remaining prisoners held in Gaza.
 






Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino were also expected to recognise a Palestinian state ahead of this week’s UN General Assembly, after Australia, Britain, Canada, Portugal and Malta did so over the weekend.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who represented Pakistan at the conference, was not among the speakers — which inc­luded heads of state and government from countries such as Turkiye, Australia, Brazil and Canada, among others.
PM Shehbaz Sharif, who reached New York on Monday, did not attend the meeting.
In a statement, the Foreign Office said that Pakistan actively participated in the conference. Taking to X, the foreign minister welcomed ann­ouncements regarding the recognition of Palestine by several countries.
 






Recalling that Pakistan was among the first countries to recognize the State of Palestine following its declaration of independence in 1988, he urged all countries that have not yet done so to take similar steps in line with their commitment to international law.
This call was echoed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who addressed the moot via video link after he was denied a visa by the United States.
“We call on those who have not yet done so to follow suit. We call for your support so that Palestine becomes a full-fledged member of the United Nations,” he said, promising reforms and elections within a year of a ceasefire.
The conference with a focus on the two-state solution comes at a time when the Western powers in a break from their decades-old policy have agreed to recognise the Palestinian state. The UK, responsible for the 1917 Balfour Declaration that led to the creation of the State of Israel, also opened the Palestine embassy in London on Monday.
The high-level moot has followed a similar summit in July this year, where the New York Declaration was first drafted, and later adopted by the UN General Assembly on Sept 12.
Earlier in the day, FM Ishaq Dar took part in the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting (CFAMM) at UN Head­quarters.
 






He also participated in consultations hosted by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Other participants included the deputy prime ministers of Jordan and UAE, and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye. He also met with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand.
Meeting with Trump

PM Shehbaz will represent Pakistan at a multilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, the White House and Pakistani diplomats said on Monday.
White House Spok­esperson Karoline Leavitt did not specify the meeting’s agenda, but sources indicated that the Israeli war in Gaza would be the dominant topic.
The meeting will include leaders of eight Muslim majority countries, including Pakistan, Turkiye, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE and Jordan.
But Trump is expected to address the UN General Assembly ahead of the multilateral meeting. According to Ms Leavitt, the president will also touch upon how globalist institutions have significantly decayed the world order, and he will articulate his straightforward and constructive vision for the world.
Trump himself opposed the moves by Britain, Canada and Australia to recognize the state of Palestine, which France is due to follow on Monday.
 
 

“The president has been very clear he disagrees with this decision,” Leavitt said, noting that he had publicly done so with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a UK state visit last week.
“Frankly, he believes it’s a reward to Hamas. So he believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies, and I think you’ll hear him talk about that tomorrow” at the UN, she added.
Flag-raising
Meanwhile, a day after it extended recognition to the state of Palestine, a flag-raising ceremony was held outside the Pale­stinian mission in London on Monday.
Head of Mission Husam Zomlot hailed the “long overdue” recognition as the flag was raised in front of a crowd outside the building in Hammersmith in west London.
Holding up a plaque reading ‘Embassy of the State of Palestine’, Mr Zomlot said it would be put up soon, “pending some legal work, some bureaucratic work”.
He called the recognition move an “acknowledgement of a historic injustice” at a time of “unimaginable suffering” for the Palestinian people in the war in Gaza.
He said the UK’s recognition had particular resonance as Britain was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, through the 1917 Balfour Declaration.
UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the Palestinian Authority could now “set up an embassy and an ambassador in the UK”.
Following Sunday’s announcement, Britain’s foreign ministry updated its travel advice page to remove the reference to “Occupied Palestinian territories”, replacing it with “Palestine”.

HYDERABAD: The water level in the Indus rises as a medium flood reaches Kotri.—PPI

• Locals in three southern districts complain their houses still under water due to govt failure to plug breaches
• Irrigation minister says 70 and 90pc area of Alipur and Jalalpur Pirwala, respectively, devastated
LAHORE: The residents in different localities of Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur districts remain homeless as the government has failed to plug the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River despite the passage of 12 days.
Communities in Noraja Bhutta, Bahadurpur, Basti Lang, Kanu, and Dipal in Jalalpur Pirwala; Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, and Belaywala in Lodhran; Dunyapur, Jhangra, and Muradpur Soiwala in Bahawalpur were forced to live on the banks of the embankment, as their homes remained inundated.
 
 

Basti Lang resident Muhammad Bakhsh said the water was rising again in his union council, adding it would continue to rise if the Noraja Bhutta embankment was not plugged completely. “We are also hearing about another medium level flood in the Sutlej approaching Jalalpur Pirwala in a day or two, which would further increase the water level around our homes,” he said.
“We are also hearing that the government is plugging the Noraja Bhutta embankment but the water has yet to recede from these areas…,” he rued. Ijaz Khan, from the Tarut Bashart union council, said that the water level was increasing due to the breaches. He said that the government was placing heavy stones around the M-5 Motorway bridge to save it, but the water was not receding.
 
 

Multan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa told Dawn that three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River were plugged to save Jalalpur Pirwala city. He said that they also saved the primary gas pipeline to Punjab.
Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Pirzada revealed that 70 and 90 per cent of the population in Alipur and Jalalpur Pirwala, respectively, was affected by the recent floods. He said that Jalalpur required evacuation and Alipur needed a massive relief operation, with teams working round the clock to deliver essential supplies to Sultanpur, Shahbazpur, Seetpur, and other affected towns.
Normal flow
Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water flow across major rivers in Punjab had returned to normal levels. He said a low- to medium-level flood situation continued in the Sutlej River.
According to PDMA data, the Sutlej River is flowing at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 81,000 cusecs at the Suleimanki point. The Chenab River shows a flow of 55,000 cusecs at Marala, which reduces to 24,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks and 29,000 cusecs at Qadirabad.
The flow at Head Trimmu was recorded at 35,000 cusecs. The Panjnad Headworks reported a flow of 118,000 cusecs. Meanwhile, the Ravi River presented lower readings, with 6,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 30,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai. The flow at Balloki Headworks was measured at 28,000 cusecs.

She made these remarks while talking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after the hearing of the Toshakhana-2 case.
“Imran has directed party leaders and workers not to contact the establishment, and if the establishment wants to talk, it should directly talk to him,” she said.
Commenting on the Toshakhana-2 case, Ms Khan said that last week, the main witness had been discredited, yet the judge did not close the matter.
“Moreover, Brig Ahmed and Col Rehan [Imran Khan’s former military secretaries] also confirmed that the documentation on gifts was complete. So logically, the case is concluded, but the judge is still recording statements of investigation officers. We strongly believe it will be closed in the next two to three hearings,” she said.
On the Al-Qadir case, Ms Khan noted that Justice Dogar had not taken it up for the past ten months. “However, finally, the case will be heard on the 25th of this month, and we hope that bail will be granted,” she added.
Saudi pact, cricket team
Regarding the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia agreement, Aleema said her brother was already aware of the deal and appreciated it, saying it was the duty of Pakistanis to protect the Haramain Sharifain.
She said Mr Khan had also expressed disappointment over press reports regarding the cricket team’s performance. She quoted him as saying that in October 2021, Pakistan defeated India by 10 wickets with the same team.
Drawing an analogy, Ms Khan said her brother compared Mohsin Naqvi’s management of the Pakistan Cricket Board with the way the country was being governed, saying that both faced the same challenges.
She said her brother had urged the nation to participate in the upcoming Sept 27 public meeting in Peshawar to make it a success. Ms Khan added that Imran had directed Junaid Akbar and Ali Amin Gandapur to make joint efforts to ensure the rally’s success.

• Civilians’ trials in military courts ‘long understood as valid and operative’, says Justice Mazhar
ISLAMABAD: Justice Aminuddin Khan has said that though the procedural framework under the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 includes due process protections, the absence of an independent right of appeal to a civilian court has rendered its application to civilians constitutionally incomplete.
He made these remarks in a 68-page judgement to justify the May 7 short order on a set of 38 intra-court appeals, which challenged the Oct 23, 2023, order on military trials of the civilians. Justice Khan explained that this deficiency required legislative intervention, urging parliament to do the needful in 45 days.
According to Justice Khan, the Constitutional Bench had referred the matter to parliament for the enactment of appropriate amendments, with the expectation that such institutional deference would be accorded due respect. He, however, again sought necessary amendments or suitable legislation within a period of 45 days to provide right of appeal in the high courts against convictions rendered by court martial or military courts under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (d) of subsection (1) of section 2, read with subsection (4) of Section 59.
Justice Khan observed that a fair trial demanded that the forum should be fair, impartial, and governed by transparent rules. The PAA, as currently framed and applied in the present context, meets this constitutional requirement, Justice Khan said, adding it was held that the conduct of trials under PAA, where exercised within the statutory limits and supported by procedural safeguards, did not violate fair trial standards.
On May 7, a seven-judge Constitutional Bench restored by a majority of 5-2 key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act under which civilians were convicted for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, arson attacks on military installations. The short order had also set aside the Oct 23 judgement, restoring Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) and Section 59 (4) of the PAA. These provisions were struck down by a majority of four to one by a five-judge bench in October 2023.
‘Reading down’ approach
The interpretive technique of reading down, as employed in the Oct 23 judgement, was inapposite, Justice Khan said, adding that the doctrine of reading down was a tool of judicial restraint designed to preserve the constitutionality of statutes by construing them narrowly in case of ambiguity. It cannot be deployed to insert qualifications or restrictions into clear constitutional provisions, he observed.
The Oct 23 order purported to use reading down to override the unambiguous text of Article 8(3)(a), effectively substituting judicial preference for constitutional command, Justice Khan emphasised, adding this approach crossed the threshold of legitimate interpretation and entered the domain of constitutional amendment. The judicial function is to interpret, not to legislate, he stressed.
Article 8(3)(a) is a self-contained constitutional provision. It categorically exempts laws enacted for the Armed Forces, for purposes of discipline and discharge of duties, from the operation of fundamental rights, Justice Khan said, calling it a deliberate legislative choice by the framers.
The introduction of Article 8(5) as a qualifying provision in this context is doctrinally and textually unsound. Article 8(5) deals with the suspension of rights under emergency powers and does not, and cannot, override the permanent structural exclusion under Article 8(3)(a), he added.
Article 8(3)(a) exempts laws relating to the armed forces from the purview of fundamental rights, explicitly recognising a parallel regime for military discipline.
Article 245 further empowers the armed forces to act in defence of Pakistan and in aid of civil authority, indicating that the Constitution contemplates a domain of operations and discipline governed by military command and distinct legal processes, Justice Khan said
Justice Khan said the adjudicatory authority exercised by military courts over civilians does not infringe the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Article 175(3) is not offended by the existence or operation of military courts within their legal remit.
Additional note
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, though concurring, said in his additional note that the trial of civilians only for specific offences as provided under Section 2 (d) (i) and (ii) was not a new phenomenon.
It is a ground reality that the provisions of PAA extending jurisdiction to certain civilians have stood connected appeals for several decades, receiving the tacit approval of successive legislatures and the silent acquiescence of the Supreme Court.
The fact that these provisions remained unchallenged or were not declared ultra vires at an earlier stage suggests that they were long understood as valid and operative within the constitutional scheme, Justice Mazhar explained.
It was only in the aftermath of the events of May 9, 2023, when prosecutions of civilians under PAA acquired public and political prominence that this question was brought into sharp focus. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to ask whether it is the law itself that is infirm, or whether the sudden urgency of the present moment has led to a judicial reappraisal that stands at odds with decades of settled acceptance, he argued.

According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), the international gold price rose by $34 to reach $3,719 per ounce. In the domestic market, the price of 10 grams (24kt) increased by Rs2,915 to Rs337,534, while one tola rose by Rs3,400 to Rs393,700.
Silver also followed the upward trend. The domestic rates for 10 grams and one tola (24kt) climbed to Rs3,939 and Rs4,595 respectively, reflecting increases of Rs54 and Rs63. The international silver price stood at $43.68 per ounce.
Gold dealers attributed the sharp rise to global developments, citing recent international media reports. The US Federal Reserve last week cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points — its first reduction since December — triggering speculation about further easing, which typically supports gold prices.
Traders said geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty continue to fuel investor interest in precious metals, pushing prices higher. While gold remains attractive to investors, they noted that rising prices have discouraged retail jewellery buyers in Pakistan.

“Genuine buyers, particularly families preparing for weddings, are finding gold increasingly unaffordable,” said one dealer. “Most buyers are either selling old jewellery or converting it into lighter, modern designs.”
He added that some customers are still purchasing small quantities, typically between 50 to 100 grams, to make new sets. However, the surge in prices, combined with the rising cost of living, has significantly reduced purchasing power and overall demand for new jewellery.
Dealers observed that investor activity in the local gold market is increasing, as many view gold as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. The speculative interest in gold, both globally and domestically, is expected to keep prices volatile in the near term.
