• Premier holds call with Iranian president; call US action ‘violation of international law’
• Iranian envoy hints at retaliatory strikes on American bases
ISLAMABAD: An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) will be held today (Monday) to discuss the regional situation after the US airstrike on three nuclear facilities in Iran.
The NSC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the top brass of both civil and military leadership, is the highest forum for security deliberations.
Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) told Dawn that the NSC meeting will be held on Monday evening. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir will also attend the meeting.
The field marshal, who recently returned from a trip to the US, will brief the committee on the details of his meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Pakistan condemns strikes
The US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after COAS Munir’s meeting with Trump, have been condemned by Pakistan.
In a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Prime Minister Shehbaz condemned the US attack and Israeli aggression.
“The prime minister conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the US attacks, which followed Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days,” said an official press release issued by the PMO.
The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Iran and expressed condolences on the loss of lives.
He expressed concerns that the US struck facilities that were under the protection of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
“These attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute,” he added.
While noting Iran’s right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for swift dialogues and called diplomacy “the only viable path forward”. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation, and said Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in this regard. According to the PMO, President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support of Iran.
He thanked the prime minister and people of Pakistan for standing in solidarity with Iran.
In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also condemned the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.
“We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the Foreign Office spokesman said on Sunday.
The attacks “violate all norms of international law,” the spokesperson said, adding Iran has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter.
“Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”
The FO urged all parties to “adhere to international law” and hold dialogues to resolve the crises.
‘Iran can hit US bases’
Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam has said his country could target US facilities and interests in the region.
While addressing a press conference here at the National Press Club on Sunday, Mr Moghadam said the US has a “presence in the region” and that Iran “will see that where we hit the US”.
Responding to a question about US bases in the region, the ambassador said it was shameful that the US has military facilities in Muslim states.
However, he added that Iran “do not want to bring any other Islamic state into this war”.
Asked about the damages during the US airstrike on Iran’s nuclear sites, he said Iran has the capability to make a nuclear arsenal but the country was using the technology for energy and medical purposes.
“Our nuclear technology is not a physical thing but it’s in the minds of our nuclear scientists, so therefore the US strikes have not made any significant harm to our nuclear programme,” he added.
He also appreciated Pakistan’s support for Iran during the conflict.
President worried
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East.
In a statement on Sunday, the president urged all parties involved in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and to choose the path of peace , dialogue and diplomacy to ensure enduring peace and stability in the region.
President Zardari also called upon the international community to play its part in de-escalating the crisis in the interest of regional stability as well as the well-being of its people.

Muharram is a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.
On Saturday, the Punjab government imposed Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.
Federal Power Minister Awais Leghari, in a letter addressed to the officials of Discos, said, “Since the holy month of Muharram is falling in the month of July and heat waves are expected.
“It is very much imperative that all necessary measures are taken to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to facilitate religious gatherings and avoid any inconvenience to the public. “
He instructed the Discos to take a series of measures to ensure uninterrupted supply.
This included conducting thorough inspections of all transmission and distribution networks, particularly in areas where majalis and processions are expected. The letter further instructed to ensure the repair of faulty equipment.
It also instructed regarding ensuring that emergency response teams on high alert throughout the month and in particular on Muharram 9 and 10 (Ashura).
Leghari also instructed to ensure the availability of standby generators and UPS systems at sensitive locations to provide backup power in case of any unforeseen grid issues.
“Ensure that a sufficient number of transformers and other materials are available in each subdivision, and inventory in this regard should be updated,” the letter read.
The letter further instructed Discos to ensure communication and coordination with local authorities and the public.
“The sanctity of Muharram demands our utmost commitment to serving the public with diligence and respect. Any negligence in this regard will be viewed seriously,” the letter concluded.
Separately, five companies of Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed in Rawalpindi to help the administration and police to maintain peace during Muharram.
Arrangements have been finalised for 4,374 majalis and 1,003 processions to be held in the Rawalpindi division.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said earlier in the week that ensuring a peaceful Muharram was a major challenge for his force due to the prevailing security situation in the region.</p><small>2025-06-23 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/222340591cb177d.jpg?r=234354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919135/suicide-bombing-at-damascus-church-kills-20' target='_blank'><strong>Suicide bombing at Damascus church kills 20</strong></a><br><p>At least 20 people were killed and dozens injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday, health authorities and security sources said.
It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was toppled by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.
Syria’s interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. “He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest,” a ministry statement added.
A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.
Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad’s fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source told Reuters.
Syria’s state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.
A livestream from the site by Syria’s civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities.
“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.
“We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”
Islamic State had previously targeted religious minorities, including a major attack on Shia pilgrims in Sayeda Zainab in 2016 — one of the most notorious bombings during Assad’s rule.
The latest assault underscores the group’s continued ability to exploit security gaps despite the collapse of its territorial control and years of counterterrorism efforts.</p><small>2025-06-22 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/222157307bbe0ec.jpg?r=222234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl, others urge govt to review decision to nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani politicians on Sunday raised their concerns over the government’s decision to recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Iran.
The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s Pak-India conflict, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with US mediation.
In a statement, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.
However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined Pakistani citizens in voicing their reservations.
Veteran politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), demanded that the government rescind its decision.
“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree today, according to a JUI-F statement.
 






He said that Trump’s recent meeting and lunch with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “pleased Pakistani rulers so much” that they recommended nominating the US president for the Nobel prize.
The JUI-F chief noted that Trump won the presidential election with the slogan of peace but was “proven false in his claim”.
Fazl said that when Pakistan “destroyed India’s defence force”, President Trump intervened and said he had declared a ceasefire.
“[But] Trump has supported the Israeli attacks on Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iran. How can this be a sign of peace?” Fazl questioned. “With the blood of Afghans and Palestinians on America’s hands, how can he claim to be a proponent of peace?”
Trump campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.
The US has several times vetoed resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council, the latest earlier this month.
 
 

Fazl said his party was in favour of friendship with the US but not of its “slavery”.
“National sovereignty, the right of the people to govern themselves, and economic freedom should be maintained in relations with America,” the JUI-F chief asserted.
Fazl further said that in the last three months, a US delegation has visited him three times, after which he attended their diplomatic ceremony in Islamabad.
He also expressed his view that the attacks on Iran were an attempt to stop China’s economic growth in the Middle East. China is the largest importer of Iranian oil.
“Pakistan’s economic strength in the region has been affected the most. The economic balance is shifting towards Asia instead of Europe, which is a good omen for Asia,” he said.
‘Trump no longer a potential peacemaker’
Calls to reconsider the government’s decision also came from other politicians.
Former senator Mushahid Hussain wrote on X: “Since Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!”
He said Trump had been “trapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency”.
“Trump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!”
 






Trump “engaged in deception and betrayed his own promise not to start new wars”, Mushahid said in another post, strongly condemning the US attacks on Iran.
Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, had previously said that if the nomination “panders to Trump’s ego, so be it”.
PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan wrote “reconsider” in all caps on his X account, highlighting the “US attack on Iran and continuous US support of Israeli killings in Gaza”.
 






In a separate post, the opposition PTI condemned the “unprovoked” US strikes and voiced “total support” for Iran’s sovereignty.
Raoof Hasan, head of PTI’s political think-tank, said the government’s decision was now a “cause of unmitigated shame and embarrassment for those who were instrumental in making the choice”.
“That’s why it is said that legitimacy can neither be bought nor gifted,” said Hasan, as he took a jibe at the government. He also denounced the US’s “total disregard for international covenants” through the attacks on Iran.
 






Former senator Afrasiab Khattak said, “The sycophancy adopted by [the] Pakistani ruling elite in nominating President Trump for Nobel Peace Prize is not part of normative conduct in international diplomacy.”
“It was most embarrassing to announce the nomination hours before Trump ordered to bomb Iranian nuclear sites,” the veteran politician noted.
 






Jamaat-i-Islami chief Naeemur Rehman has said the decision “undermines our national dignity and grace”.
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, has termed the move “unfortunate” and said it did not reflect the public’s views.
 






Among other notable individuals was senior journalist Mariana Baabar, who wrote on X that “today Pakistan does not look too good either”, sharing the government’s post announcing its intention to nominate Trump for the Nobel.
 






Author and activist Fatima Bhutto asked: “Will Pakistan withdraw its nomination for him to receive the Nobel Peace Prize?”
 






Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.
He has openly expressed his frustration over missing out on the prestigious award, most recently mentioning it during a February Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Former US president Barack Obama won the prize soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.</p><small>2025-06-22 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2218545478f41c4.jpg?r=202015' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919099/sarfraz-bugti-condemns-murder-of-ex-balochistan-cms-son-in-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>Sarfraz Bugti condemns murder of ex-Balochistan CM’s son in Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday condemned the murder of Mir Attaur Rehman Mengal, the son of former Balochistan chief minister Naseer Mengal, in an armed clash when gunmen opened fire in district Khuzdar’s Wadh.
Atta Mengal was the brother of Mir Shafiqur Rehman Mengal, a prominent tribal leader and head of the Jhalawan Awami Panel, a political party.
Dawn.com has reached out to the police for a comment on the alleged murder.
Bugti condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed his heartfelt grief and sorrow over the killing of the younger Mengal.
“He prayed for the bereaved family and expressed his best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured grandson,” a statement from his office read.
Bugti assured that the provincial government will conduct a thorough investigation into the incident and vowed that the terrorists will be brought to justice.
“The people and government of Balochistan stand in solidarity against terrorism,” he added.
Atta Mengal was killed while his son Mir Matiur Rehman Mengal was injured, after an ambush by terrorists allegedly belonging to the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), said a statement by Jhalawan Awami Panel spokesperson Nadeemur Rehman Baloch.
The spokesperson said Naseer Mengal’s family had “made countless sacrifices for the survival of Pakistan”.
In March, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district, according to officials.
The JUI-F leaders, Wa­­dera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah, were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.
Both died on the spot after being shot multiple times.</p><small>2025-06-22 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2221235405dc4e1.jpg?r=212417' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919117/gunmen-kill-bride-at-france-wedding-party' target='_blank'><strong>Gunmen kill bride at France wedding party</strong></a><br><p>Armed men opened fire at a wedding party in southeastern France early Sunday, killing the bride, said a source close to the investigation.

The Trump administration, which welcomed Field Marshal Munir with uncharacteristic warmth, appears to want Pakistan to act as a potential peacemaker in the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. President Trump hinted at this during a White House luncheon, saying Pakistanis “know Iran better than most” and noting they were “not bad with Israel” either.
The COAS’ next stop — Turkiye — added weight to this emerging role. He flew directly from Washington to attend an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference on the Iran-Israel crisis, underscoring Pakistan’s willingness to be seen as a regional stabiliser.
Diplomatic sources in Washington say that while Pakistan is expected to engage Iran, the Trump administration will deal with Israel as Islamabad does not recognise the Jewish state.

Army chief’s rare White House luncheon, meetings point to a thaw in bilateral ties

Field Marshal Munir’s tour marked the highest-level engagement between the Pakistani military and the Trump administration since Trump’s emphatic 2024 return to the White House.
 
 

His itinerary included strategic meetings at the Pentagon and Capitol Hill, culminating in a private luncheon in the White House Cabinet Room — hosted personally by President Trump. Such an honor is rarely extended to foreign military officials, typically being reserved for visiting heads of government.
After the White House lunch, Pakistani officials were content enough to drop certain items from the remaining schedule. “We were heard in Washington’s most powerful room,” one official said. “That was the message we wanted to carry home.”
The army chief’s discussions with senior US officials — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Iran negotiator Steve Witkoff — covered familiar terrain: regional security, counter-terrorism, and strategic cooperation. But it was the optics — especially the White House invitation — that signaled a dramatic thaw after years of diplomatic chill.
The visit followed a tense India-Pakistan standoff in May, which Trump claims he helped defuse — though New Delhi has denied any outside role. More broadly, it unfolded against a backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East, where Israel’s strikes against Iran have roiled the region. Pakistan’s concurrent ties with both Tehran and Riyadh position it uniquely to mediate.
Just hours after Field Marshal Munir’s departure, Islamabad confirmed it was nominating President Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize — citing his role in preventing a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan.
The announcement landed well in Washington, bolstering Trump’s foreign policy narrative. In New Delhi, however, it caused unease. Indian officials have consistently downplayed both the crisis and any external involvement in de-escalating it.
Trump, undeterred, repeated his claims both before and after the White House lunch, describing how he helped avert “a possible nuclear war” in one of the world’s most volatile regions. Pakistani diplomats welcomed these remarks, particularly his reiteration that the Kashmir conflict remains unresolved and dangerous — views aligned with Islamabad’s longstanding stance.
Most significantly for Pakistan, Trump once again offered to mediate on Kashmir — breaking with years of US policy restraint. While India firmly rejected the suggestion, the offer was music to Islamabad’s ears.
Confidence and long-term plans
While in Washington, Field Marshal Munir addressed two select groups — one comprising Pakistani American professionals and the other of US scholars and journalists. Participants in both sessions noted the general’s confidence and clarity. His expressions and body language, they said, reflected a man focused on a long-term plan.
On one occasion, the COAS even hinted that he hoped to bring political and diplomatic stability to Pakistan “before I leave” — adding, with a smile, that this could happen “by 2035.”
Whether this visit marks a deeper reset or merely a tactical recalibration remains to be seen. But some trends are evident: Pakistan’s military and civilian leadership appear more coordinated in their messaging, and Washington’s tone reflects a broader shift in how it views South Asia.

Altayli, who has more than 1.5 million YouTube subscribers, was detained on Saturday over comments in a video he posted on Friday in which he addressed a poll showing most Turks opposed Erdogan’s ruling for life.
Altayli referenced Ottoman rulers, saying Turks had “killed” or “drowned” some they no longer wanted in power.
Prosecutors in Istanbul later said the remarks “contained threats” against the president and launched an investigation.
NTV said that in his defence to the court, Altayli denied threatening Erdogan, quoting him as saying that his remarks were taken out of context and made to appear like threats, even though they were simply part of rhetorical historical discussions.
The development comes amid a series of detentions of opposition figures in recent months, including the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu —  Erdogan’s main political rival — in March.
The main opposition CHP and some Western countries have called the crackdown a politicised move to eliminate electoral challenges to Erdogan.

US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
The US operation, called Midnight Hammer, was described by Gen Caine as the “largest B-2 operational strike in US history”, which inflicted “extremely severe damage and destruction” to the targets, US outlet CBS News reported.
 
 

“This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,” Gen Caine said, adding that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flew east from their base in Missouri to participate in the mission in Iran.
“At midnight, Friday into Saturday, a large B-2 strike package, comprised of bombers, launched from the continental United States. As part of a plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy,” he stated.
“Throughout its 18-hour flight, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight refuellings. Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East in a complex, tightly timed manoeuvre requiring exact synchronisation across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace.” Caine explained, adding that this was done with minimal communication.

Speaking while displaying a map tracing the flight path and timelines of the US bombers, the chairman said: “At about 5pm Eastern Time (ET) [on] Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a US submarine in the Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan.
“As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the US deployed several deception tactics, including decoys, as fourth and fifth-generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats.”

Gen Caine outlined that US Strategic Command, Transportation Command, Cyber Command, Space Command and the Space Force and US European Command all provided support during the strikes.
“We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,” he said.
Outlining the bombing raid, Gen Caine said that at about 6:40pm ET (2:10am in Iran) the lead B-2 “dropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) weapons on the first of several aimpoints at Fordow”.
“As the president stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6:40pm and 7:05pm ET … with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Isfahan to ensure that we retained the element of surprise throughout the operation.
 


“Following weapons release, the Midnight Hammer strike package exited Iranian airspace and began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package on the way out,” he added. “Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears Iran’s surface-to-air missile systems did not see us.”
According to Gen Caine, the US employed 75 “precision-guided weapons” during Operation Midnight Hammer, including the MOPs, marking their first operational use by the US military.
“More than 125 US aircraft participated in this mission, including B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth-generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air refuelling tankers … and a full array of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational professionals,” Gen Caine said.
The chairman warned that the US is prepared for any retaliatory attack by Iran, stating that any such attack would be an “incredibly poor choice”.
“We will defend ourselves; the safety of our service members and civilians is the highest priority. Many assets are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed.”</p><small>2025-06-22 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/22195442cdf2942.jpg?r=195521' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919102/trailblazer-and-former-england-fast-bowler-david-lawrence-dies-at-61' target='_blank'><strong>‘Trailblazer’ and former England fast bowler David Lawrence dies at 61</strong></a><br><p>Former England fast bowler David “Syd” Lawrence has died at the age of 61 after a year-long battle with motor neurone disease (MND), his family said on Sunday.
Lawrence, the first British-born Black cricketer to represent England, was diagnosed last year with MND, a degenerative condition that causes muscle wastage and affects the brain and nerves.
“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Dave Lawrence MBE (King’s Birthday Honours) following his brave battle with Motor Neurone Disease,” Lawrence’s family said.
“Syd was an inspirational figure on and off the cricket field… A proud Gloucestershire man, Syd took on every challenge with everything he could and his final contest with MND was no different.
“His willingness to encourage and think of others right up to the end was typical of the man he was. As President of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, Syd took on the role with incredible pride and passion and loved every minute of it.”
Lawrence, who earned five test caps for England, made 280 appearances for Gloucestershire and took 625 wickets for the county.
His test debut came at Lord’s against Sri Lanka in 1988, with his career highlight being a five-wicket haul against the West Indies at the Oval in 1991.
In 2022, Lawrence became Gloucestershire County Cricket Club’s first Black president and he was named one of the inaugural Honorary Life Vice-Presidents of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) earlier this year.

Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.

US strikes Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites

Pakistan condemns attacks, voices support for Tehran’s right to defend
Democrats criticise decision ‘without Congress approval’


The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top commanders, scientists and hundreds others. Both countries have traded wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.
In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.
 


The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.
“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.
“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.
 






Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told AFP.
Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.
Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.
Iranian media confirmed that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, were attacked.
The US strikes push the Middle East to the brink of a major new conflagration in a region already aflame for more than 20 months with devastating conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as a toppled ruler in Syria.
Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.
‘US operation not aimed at regime change’
US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth hailed the strikes an “incredible and overwhelming success”, adding that the operation was intended at a regime change in Iran.
“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it is worth noting that the operation did not target the Iranian troops or people,” Hegseth told a press conference at the Pentagon.
The secretary reiterated Trump’s claims that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, stating that by employing the president’s policy of “peace through strength”, Iran’s nuclear ambitions were “obliterated”.
 


Nevertheless, Hegseth said the strikes were not a preamble to plans for regime change in Iran, adding that private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate.
“This mission was not and has not been about regime change,” Hegseth stated. “The president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme.”
“The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back,” Hegseth added. “When this president speaks, the world should listen.”
 






Hegseth also read a statement from Trump, warning that any retaliation by Iran “will be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight”.
“Iran would be smart to heed these words,” the defence secretary warned, adding that US forces were postured to defend themselves, and take action if needed.
Hegseth said that the operation took months of preparation and required “a great deal of precision […] misdirection and highest of operational security”.
Describing the complex operation, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said the “main strike package comprised” of seven B-2 stealth bombers flying 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran with multiple aerial refuellings.
The US strikes included 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft, the top general added.
 






Trump had earlier told Fox News’ Sean Hannity show that five to six “bunker-buster” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.
Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites sustained “extremely severe damage and destruction”, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.
“Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran’s surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,” Caine added.
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’; Pakistan condemns attacks
Denouncing the US attacks as “lawless and criminal”, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country has a right to defend its sovereignty.
“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences,” he posted on X.
“Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.”
 






In a statement issued by its foreign ministry, Iran strongly condemned the “United States’ brutal military aggression against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities”.
It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.
“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.
 






Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.
It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.
It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s Resolution 2231 from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.
“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.
Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.
“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a statement by the Foreign Office said.
 






“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.
It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.
“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.
Trump warns Iran against ‘any retaliation’
Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “within two weeks” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.
But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.
Flanked by JD Vance, Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.
“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.
Trump, however, made no mention of regime change, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “easy target”.
The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, CBS News reported.
Trump said earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors”.
 


“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.
In another post, the US president called it a “historic moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world”. “Iran must now agree to end this war,” he wrote.
 


Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.
However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a report from CNN released on Tuesday said.
Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.
Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.
 






After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.
However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that “suicide drones” had been launched against “strategic targets” across Israel.
Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.
Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.
MAGA split adds to Democrats’ criticism
The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.
Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune voiced their support for Trump’s decision.
 
 

However, the issue has opened a split in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.
Trump’s first 2016 election victory in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”
Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: “This is not our fight.”
“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said.
 






Democrats also assailed him, with several accusing him of bypassing Congress to launch a new war.
Jim Himes, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, highlighted that Trump’s decision “without Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution”.
“We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East,” he said in a statement.
 






Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also noted there was no authorisation from Congress and termed it a “disastrous decision”.
“He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,” she asserted.
 






Leading US Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said Trump risked US “entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East”. He added that the US president had “failed to deliver” on his promise of bringing peace to the Middle East.

Rescue 1122 North Region Spokesperson Shafiqa Gul told Dawn.com that the boat capsized yesterday evening due to strong winds and rain in the tourist attraction of Shahi Bagh lake.
“The bodies of the two women were retrieved from the lake and transported to the Kalam hospital,” the spokesperson said earlier today.
Later, Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the bodies of two children were recovered from the lake. “Efforts to locate a third missing child are still underway,” he said.
The bodies of the two children — aged three and five — were taken to Matta and onwards to Sakhakot, Faizi added.
Five others had been rescued earlier and were in “stable condition”, according to Gul. “They have been taken to Mata hospital and are undergoing treatment.”
Gul had said the rescue operation to retrieve the bodies involved rescue divers and was being monitored by the local administration of the Bahrain tehsil.

What authority does the president have to launch such a strike?
According to Article II of the US Constitution, the president has the authority to order the use of military force to defend the US and US persons against actual or anticipated attacks, as well as advance other important national interests.
Previous US presidents — both Democratic and Republican — have deployed US forces and ordered the use of military force without congressional authorisation on numerous occasions, according to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
In addition to the powers granted to the president in Article II, Article I of the US Constitution gives Congress the authority to “declare War.”
However, this authority has never been interpreted — either by Congress or the executive branch — to require congressional authorisation for every military action that the president could initiate.
Should Trump have obtained congressional authorisation to strike Iran?
The War Power Resolution of 1973 curbed the president’s war-making powers.
While the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and can order attacks, his decisions must be within the guidelines of what is authorised by Congress, according to Al Jazeera.
However, the president can order the military in the case of a “sudden attack” or to respond to emergencies.
With regard to whether or not congressional authorisation is required as a matter of law, both Republican and Democratic presidents have generally preferred, for political and legal reasons, to seek congressional authorisation— or say that they are acting under previous authorizations — for any substantial or prolonged use of military force, CFR states.
President George H. W. Bush sought and received congressional authorisation for the Gulf War in 1991, and President George W Bush sought and received authorisations in 2001 and 2002 to use force against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and against former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.
How did US lawmakers react to the strikes?
Key progressive Senator Bernie Sanders was speaking at a rally in Oklahoma when Trump announced the attack.
“It is so grossly unconstitutional,” he said. “All of you know that the only entity that can take this country to war is the US Congress; the president does not have that right.”
 






US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Trump has “impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,” adding that his decision was “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.”
She also emphasised that bombing Iran was a “grave violation” of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.
 






US Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib echoed the same sentiment, saying: “The American people do not want another forever war.”
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, applauded the operation but cautioned that the US now faced “very serious choices ahead”, according to Reuters.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, said: “This war is Israel’s war, not our war, but Israel is one of our strongest allies and is disarming Iran for the good of the world.”
Risch added: “This is not the start of a forever war. There will not be American boots on the ground in Iran.”
US House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said: “President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorisation for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East.”
“Donald Trump shoulders complete and total responsibility for any adverse consequences that flow from his unilateral military action,” Jeffries said.
 






Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia said the US public “is overwhelmingly opposed to the US waging war on Iran” and said Trump displayed “horrible judgment.”
US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican of Louisiana, said: “The president gave Iran’s leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement.”
“The president’s decisive action prevents the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, which chants ‘Death to America,’ from obtaining the most lethal weapon on the planet.”
Max Rose, a former Democratic member of Congress who now is a senior adviser to the progressive veterans’ group “VoteVets,” said: “Trump’s decision to launch direct strikes against Iran without congressional authorization is illegal.”
Rose added: “This conflict is his and the Republicans who have abrogated all their responsibilities.”
When was the last time the US formally declared war?
In 1942, during World War II.
Since then, the US has gone to war in Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq, while carrying out strikes and interventions in numerous countries — Serbia, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, to name a few, according to Al Jazeera.

India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) claimed the two suspects were from the Pahalgam area, where gunmen killed 26 people two months ago.
“The two men had provided food, shelter and logistical support to the terrorists, who had… selectively killed the tourists on the basis of their religious identity,” a statement by NIA said.
The agency identified the two men as Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, claiming the duo “have disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack”.
New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing the attack without making public any evidence — an allegation that Islamabad denies.
The April 22 killings triggered a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by the nuclear-armed countries and led to intense exchanges of missile, drone and artillery fire.

In Peshawar, the power consumers, including women on Saturday held protest meetings in different areas against the power outages and demanded smooth power supply to their areas.
The main Charsadda road remained blocked for some time, which also affected the traffic flow. The protesters said the situation was even worse in rural areas, where sixteen to twenty hours of power outages have become order of the day.
“It is very difficult to spend even an hour without electricity in such extreme heat,” one Mushtaq Khan of Bakhshipul said.
Criticising the Peshawar Electric Supply company (Pesco), he said whenever complaints were logged with the relevant authorities; they stated due to power theft, the area has been marked as a high-loss zone.
“But since we pay our bills regularly, why are we being deprived of electricity?” he questioned, urging Pesco to avoid power outages in their areas.
Likewise, residents of Pejagi, and other localities complained about prolonged power outages. A Pakistan People’s Party provincial office-bearer said that power outages had made their lives extremely miserable.
They said power outages on the pretext of high-loss feeders are injustice to those who are neither involved in electricity theft nor avoid paying their bills.
It may be mentioned that Pesco had disconnected the power supply to tube-wells in Shaheen Muslim Town, Gulbahar, and other city areas, resulting in a severe water shortage as well.
“If this issue isn’t resolved promptly, it may lead to confrontation between operators and the public, as the preparations are underway for protests on Phundoo Road. Despite paying bills, water supply closure is deemed an act of oppression,” they said.
Residents of Haji Camp, Sethi Town, and surrounding areas have been without electricity since morning. “We regularly pay monthly bills, even then Pesco resorts to prolonged power outages,” a consumer Hassan Ali commented.
Another consumer, Sahibzada said that those living in the main city areas were experiencing extreme heat and humidity, severely affecting the health, work and routine activity.
According to reports, the people in Mardan, Pabbi Nowshera and Charsadda are also facing severe problems due to heat wave. The prolonged power cuts, frequent tripping and low voltage have also caused shortage of water.
A Pesco spokesman, however, said that in some areas power suspension (power shutdown) from 6am to 12 noon was due to routine maintenance work while the heat wave was also multiplying the problems. He said the current demand of electricity was 4000 megawatt while supply was 2800 MW, a gap of 1200 MW.

“The United States, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has committed a grave violation of the UN Charter, international law and the (nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) by attacking Iran’s peaceful nuclear installations,” Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said in a post on X.
“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences. Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior.”
In accordance with the UN Charter and its provisions allowing a legitimate response in self-defense, Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,“ the statement read.
 






UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ‘gravely alarmed’
“I am gravely alarmed by the use of force by the United States against Iran today. This is a dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge — and a direct threat to international peace and security. There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control — with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region, and the world.
“I call on Member States to de-escalate and to uphold their obligations under the UN Charter and other rules of international law. At this perilous hour, it is critical to avoid a spiral of chaos. There is no military solution. The only path forward is diplomacy. The only hope is peace.”
‘Recourse to dialogue, diplomacy’ only viable path to resolve crises, says Pakistan
Reacting to the US attacks, Pakistan stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.

“We acknowledge developments in the last 24 hours, including President Trump’s announcement of US strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran, said  New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters.
“Ongoing military action in the Middle East is extremely worrying, and it is critical further escalation is avoided,” he said.
“New Zealand strongly supports efforts towards diplomacy. We urge all parties to return to talks. Diplomacy will deliver a more enduring resolution than further military action.”
Iran’s nuclear missile program is a threat to international security, says Australia
“We have been clear that Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program has been a threat to international peace and security. We note the US President’s statement that now is the time for peace. The security situation in the region is highly volatile. We continue to call for de-escalation, dialogue and diplomacy.”
Mexico calls for ‘diplomatic dialogue’
“The ministry urgently calls for diplomatic dialogue for peace between the parties involved in the Middle East conflict. In keeping with our constitutional principles of foreign policy and our country’s pacifist conviction, we reiterate our call to de-escalate tensions in the region. The restoration of peaceful coexistence among the states of the region is the highest priority.”
Venezuela ‘condemns US military aggression against Iran’
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement, said, “Venezuela condemns US military aggression against Iran and demands an immediate cessation of hostilities.”
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela firmly and categorically condemns the bombing carried out by the United States military, at the request of the State of Israel, against nuclear facilities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan complexes.“
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel
“We strongly condemn the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, which constitutes a dangerous escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The aggression seriously violates the UN Charter and international law and plunges humanity into a crisis with irreversible consequences.”

Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said on Saturday that large-scale tree plantation and environmental projects were being launched under the Punjab Green Programme.
She said around 1.375 million trees were being planted on 3,790 acres of forest wasteland under the Agroforestry Initiative.
She said the scope of the Green Pakistan Programme had been expanded to plant 466.4 million more trees on 251,000 acres. Plantation of 5m trees in rows on 10,223 avenue miles along canals of Punjab had been initiated, she added.
She said the provision of world-class facilities for promotion of eco-tourism at the Lal Suhanra National Park and Salt Range were being ensured.
 






She said wireless network, digital cameras, GPS devices and CCTV cameras were being provided for eco-tourism.
She said, “Construction of an eco-friendly LEED certified multi-storey building has been started to establish a protected nature area and modern facilities are being provided for the staff.”
She said the shielding summits programme for disaster prevention in the mountains of Murree and Kahuta, recruitment of 600 fire watchers, provision of fire vehicles and watchtowers were being ensured. She said that a modern GIS-based protection system had been introduced. She said immediate detection of fire and encroachment was possible with drone, satellite and LIDAR technology.
The CM said that digital tree enumeration in the form of rows and GIS-based survey had been started in Punjab.
She said. “Modern machinery has been purchased for forestry work, the process of plantation and forestry operations has been accelerated. Establishment of 104 Forest Command & Control Centers for 24-hour monitoring across the province is significantly increasing the capacity for forest protection.”
Meanwhile, the CM announced that poor widows living in villages would get buffaloes and cows.
“Some 11,000 rural women will be given buffaloes and cows with a budget of Rs2bn in 12 districts of southern Punjab. As many as 4,870 cattle will be given in the first phase of the programme,” she said. She said the Livestock Assets Programme aimed to increase milk production and provide employment to rural women at home.

According to the UN body, a strong pre-monsoon surge is expected in late June, with above-normal rainfall forecast along the Indo-Pakistan border.
The weather system is likely to continue into early July, followed by near-normal rainfall throughout the rest of the month.
Meanwhile, anomalous rainfall is predicted in the desert regions of both nations from July to September, according to a report released by the FAO on Friday.
The monsoon season is exp­e­cted to be strong and prolonged with precipitation falling to near-normal levels in October.
November will be dry before the wet weather returns in December.
The report said early and abundant summer rains are likely to create favourable conditions for small-scale breeding of locusts in eastern Pakistan and Rajasthan, India.
However, the breeding activity is expected to disappear when monsoon rains retreat in November.
PMD forecast
The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast normal to above normal rainfall from July to September 2025.
According to the PMD, the Indian Ocean Dipole is in a neutral phase but is expected to transition to negative during the season.
Meanwhile, the El Niño Southern Oscillation is projected to remain in a neutral phase throughout the season.
Given these conditions, the department forecast normal to slightly above normal rainfall across the central to southern parts of the country.
The most rainfall is expected in the northeastern parts of Punjab and Ka­­shmir. In contr­ast, the northern regions, inc­luding northern Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, are likely to experience normal to slightly below-normal rainfall during the forecast period.
There is also a likelihood of near-normal rainfall in southern Punjab, Sindh and southeastern Balochistan.
Northern Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and nor­thern and southwestern Baloch­istan may receive above-normal rainfall during the monsoon season.

Water supply for irrigation purposes to both KP and Punjab had already been suspended around a month ago.
According to Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the reservoir level stood at 1918 feet on Saturday which is significantly below the conservation level of 1980 feet and alarmingly close to the dead level of 1910 feet. The inflow into the dam has declined to just 29 cusecs while the outflow is being maintained at 106 cusecs.
 
 

With the plummeted water level, water sports activities in the dam have declined to the lowest level of the year. During high temperatures the dam becomes a favourite tourist destination. Wapda authorities said presently civic agencies of Islamabad and Rawalpindi were receiving only 50 cusecs of water, which was also at the risk of being halted.

Officials are hopeful that onset of monsoon rains will help replenish reservoir

Khanpur Dam reaches optimal levels during and after the monsoon season. However, changing weather patterns, prolonged dry spells and glacial melt mismanagement have resulted in erratic inflows. In June last year, the reservoir level stood around 1935 feet, with more than double the current inflow.
Officials were however hopeful that the onset of monsoon rains later this month will help replenish the dam’s reserves.
On the other hand, hydrologists blame climate variability, poor catchment management and increased urban demand for the current state of water stress. “This is not just a seasonal anomaly, it is a structural problem that needs long-term planning,” said an irrigation department official.
Khanpur Dam is a primary source of drinking water for Islamabad and Rawalpindi, in addition to irrigating agricultural lands in Haripur district and parts of Punjab. With water storage levels hitting a historic low for mid-June, residents may soon experience interrupted supply, reduced water pressure and increased dependence on tankers.
“Water shortages are already being felt in low-lying areas, where supply hours have been reduced,” said an official of the Capital Development Authority (CDA). “We may have no choice but to initiate emergency water conservation protocols if the situation doesn’t improve in the next two weeks.”
Authorities have appealed to the public to reduce water consumption and avoid unnecessary wastage. Water-intensive activities such as car washing, lawn watering and unnecessary pipeline flushing are being discouraged. At the same time, government agencies are under pressure to review water release protocols and launch public awareness campaigns.

He was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
During the meeting, the FM Dar underscored the profound importance that Pakistan accords to its enduring bilateral relations with Turkiye. Both the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen and diversify the longstanding brotherly cooperation between the two countries.
 






The leaders expressed strong condemnation of the continued Israeli attacks in blatant violation of fundamental principles of international law, reiterated support for Iran’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its right to self-defense under the UN Charter, agreed to continue diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation, and urged the international community to play its part in restoring peace and stability in the region.
Both sides emphasised the urgency of galvanising efforts to bring an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression in Gaza and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the besieged people.

The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, carried out a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025 — a departure from previous years when only one or two sessions were typically held. The committee also reviewed amendments to the Islamabad Capital Territory (Tax on Services) Ordinance 2001, and recommended their approval by the National Assembly.
A major proposal endorsed by the committee is the reduction of the income tax rate from 2.5pc to 1pc for salaried individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2m annually. Additionally, the committee supported a 0.5pc cut in the super tax on the corporate sector.
Cash withdrawal limit
In banking, the committee approved increasing the daily cash withdrawal limit for non-filers from Rs50,000 to Rs75,000, while raising the withholding tax on such withdrawals from 0.6pc to 0.8pc. It also supported withdrawing the tax exemption on deposits held for less than six months in Special Convertible Rupee Accounts. Similarly, foreign investors will lose exemptions if their funds remain in special accounts for less than a year, as per the State Bank.

Committee rejects income tax on teachers, imposes 5pc tax on pensions above Rs10m

In digital commerce, the committee approved a 2pc withholding tax on cash-on-delivery (COD) transactions and a 1pc tax on domestic online purchases made through bank transactions. It further recommended collecting data from banks on individuals whose banking activity exceeds their declared income in wealth statements. FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said a computerised algorithm would flag such cases, with banks required to share only CNIC numbers.
The committee also approved the deployment of FBR personnel in designated business zones but rejected a proposal to penalise unregistered online sellers. It instead recommended retaining tax exemptions for online sales up to Rs5m annually to support small-scale digital businesses.
Among other approved measures were increased sales tax on offshore digital payments — from 5pc to 15pc — and a 15pc tax on digital ads placed on platforms like Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
Rejects tax on teachers
The committee rejected a proposal to impose income tax on teachers and researchers, a measure reportedly pushed by the IMF. Chairman Langrial said the Fund repeatedly refused to yield, and exemptions for educators will end in the upcoming fiscal year. Similarly, the IMF also declined Pakistan’s request to remove sales tax on stationery items.
Further, the committee backed a 5pc income tax on annual pensions exceeding Rs10m and endorsed tax relief measures for the real estate sector. Non-profit organisations will retain tax-exempt status, but must now submit financial statements every three years.
Tax exemptions for Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Technology Zones were also approved to continue through 2035.
The committee also reviewed and recommended minor amendments to the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025, and endorsed most proposed revisions to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, with further technical corrections.
The changes mark a shift toward widening the tax net, promoting digital compliance, and providing targeted relief, while resisting some IMF-driven proposals considered detrimental to education and small businesses.

• Says taxes should be imposed reasonably and without discrimination
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Saturday barred the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from arresting or initiating criminal prosecution to recover tax due from defaulters without prior determination of their tax liability.
“We have no hesitation to conclude that without investigative audit or issuance of show-cause notice or providing opportunity to explain the matters, registration of FIR, initiation of criminal proceeding and arrest of registered person is without jurisdiction and lawful authority,” observed Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi in a judgement he authored.
Justice Abbasi was a member of a three-judge SC bench, which was seized with a number of appeals against judgements of Lahore, Sindh and Islamabad high courts.
The controversy at hand revolves around determining the legality of pre-trial steps including arrest and detention of individuals pursuant to registration of FIR on the charges of tax fraud as well as ascertaining the legal scope and application of Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
Since the LHC judgement was the first on the relevant legal issues, the SC decided to examine the facts giving rise to filing of a large number of petitions before the high court involving criminal prosecution for alleged offence of tax fraud against 134 persons along with other beneficiaries.
 
 

In its order the LHC had held that unless the sales tax liability of taxpayers was determined in accordance with Section 11 of the act, these penal provisions cannot be invoked, therefore, the criminal proceedings initiated by the sales tax department, the registration of FIRs and arrest made pursuant to FIRs, was illegal and without lawful authority. Accordingly, the same were quashed for being unconstitutional, violative of fundamental rights, and ultra vires to the act.
The facts involved in the LHC judgement suggested unearthing of a cartel by the additional director, Intelligence and Investigation (FBR), Regional Office, Lahore consisting of fraudsters involved in the issuance of fake sales tax invoices for the purposes of generating illegal/inadmissible input tax adjustments.
Accordingly, criminal prosecution was initiated against some persons, which further led to unearthing of a mega scam of sales tax evasion of Rs7.5 billion involving 144 dummy suppliers and fake sales tax invoices.
The March 26, 2011 FIR suggested that this gang of fraudsters issued fake invoices to various registered persons who claimed input tax on the basis of the same causing a huge loss to the exchequer.
The SC judgement explained that the act does not authorise tax officials to presume any tax liability in the absence of assessment proceedings and to proceed against a registered person or any person within the supply chain.
The judgement explained that under the democratic system of government, run by the elected representatives of the people, unbridled powers and authority to impose tax arbitrarily, without having any rationale or reason was now being regulated under constitutional restraints, whereby taxes were to be imposed reasonably, without discrimination and in such a manner that those may not encroach upon the fundamental rights of a person as guaranteed under the Constitution.
The art of taxation is regarded as the art of plucking a goose so as to gather the largest amount of feathers by causing least squealing, the judgement explained.
Before invoking or adopting coercive measures for the recovery of tax amount due, the judgement contended, determination of tax liability through process of assessment or adjudication has to precede before initiating criminal proceedings, which otherwise depend upon wilful default, mens rea and commission of an offence of tax fraud with an intent to cause loss of tax involved or due.
Without determination of sales tax liability and the amount of tax allegedly evaded or short paid, through process of assessment/adjudication, recourse to initiation of criminal proceedings on the allegation of tax fraud, including registration of FIR and arrest of a registered person or any person within the supply chain, amounted to pre-empting the assessment of tax liability.
Whereas, in the absence of lawful demand of sales tax pursuant to assessment of tax due, the penal provisions including Section 33 read with Sections 37A and 37B cannot be invoked.
Therefore, the penal provisions including registration of FIR and arrest of any person on the above allegations is without jurisdiction and lawful authority, the judgement said while allowing the petition.

Islamabad Judicial Mag­istrate Shahzad Ah­med anno­unced the verdict after reserving it earlier in the day, accepting the acquittal applications filed in case numbers 425 and 498 registered with the Karachi Company Police Station. The protest in question was organised on April 26, 2024, and moved from the office of PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen towards the Karachi Com­pany, reportedly in violation of Section 144 and other legal provisions.
During the proceedings, PTI leaders Shoaib Shaheen and Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared before the court, while exemption pleas on behalf of Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub were submitted and duly accepted.
The defence counsel argued that the case had no legal basis as the FIRs were filed by unrelated parties and that eight individuals arrested at the scene had already been discharged during the investigation.
The magistrate questioned the non-appearance of co-accused Amir Dogar and Amir Mughal.
The defence requested the court to decide their cases on merit, similar to the other accused. The court was also informed that Murad Saeed, who had previously faced related charges, had been acquitted in other cases despite his prolonged non-appearance.
After hearing all arguments, the court acquitted Barrister Gohar, Omar Ayub, Ali Bukhari, Shoaib Shaheen, Malik Rafique, Amir Dogar, Amir Mughal and others.
Bail for Qureshi
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore granted post-arrest bail to Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the Shadman Police Station attack case during the May 9 riots.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced a verdict reserved on the bail petition of Mr Qureshi and allowed the bail subject to surety bonds of Rs100,000.
The judge deferred till June 26 a decision on another bail petition of the PTI leader in a case relating to the burning of police vehicles near Lahore Corps Commander House.
Qureshi’s counsel had argued that the PTI leader was not even present in Lahore on May 9 — the day of the alleged attack — and was in Karachi with his wife for her medical treatment.
The counsel stated that the allegation of conspiracy against Mr Qureshi regarding the May 9 attacks was not proven. He said the petitioner should be granted bail, as many co-suspects in the same case had already been allowed bail.
Earlier, former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema also filed a bail petition in the same Shadman Police Station attack case.
The judge allowed the prosecution more time to present the record of the case and adjourned the hearing till June 24.

• Tax exemptions sought for individuals earning Rs1.2m annually
ISLAMABAD: As the government struggles to balance its revenue and expenses, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue has recommended a 50 per cent increase in government employees’ salaries, raise in pensions, removal of import duties on solar panels and a significant cut in levies on small vehicles.
The committee, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, has put forward more than 200 recommendations, including 48 general proposals, 133 changes to the Finance Bill 2025 and 21 related to the Public Sector Development Programmes.
The recommendations were presented in the upper house on Saturday and subsequently forwarded to the National Assembly for consideration. The recommendations only have an advisory value and the government is not bound to follow them.
Recommendations
The Senate committee has proposed a 50pc salary increase for government employees, instead of 10 pc, proposed in the budget.
The panel also recommended a 20pc inc­r­e­­ase in pensions for retired employees, aga­inst the government-proposed hike of 7pc.
Additionally, the minimum monthly wage has been proposed to be increased from the existing Rs37,000 to Rs50,000, and doubling the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution pension to Rs23,000 from its current of Rs11,500.
The committee also recommended the im­­­mediate regularisation of all daily wage workers, emphasising the need for job security.
The committee has further recommended income tax exemption to salaried individuals earning up to Rs1.2 million annually.
The government has proposed a 1pc tax rate on income from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m.
The Senate panel has recommended abolishing the 18pc sales tax on solar panels to promote renewable energy adoption and reduce costs for consumers.
Additionally, it rejected the government’s proposed carbon levy, suggesting that it instead be restructured as a tax.
The distinction would allow provinces to get a share of tax revenue. In contrast, the federal government gets to keep 100pc of the levies collected on goods.
Reduced duty on cars
According to the parliamentary committee’s recommendations, the sales tax on vehicles under 850cc should be reduced from 18 to 10pc.
Additionally, a 10pc tax has been proposed on agricultural income exceeding Rs5 million annually and imposing the tax on landholdings exceeding 12.5 acres.
The committee also suggested waiving the circular debt surcharge on monthly electricity consumption of up to 200 units, no tax on stationery items and cutting the sales tax on homoeopathic medicines from 18pc to 1pc.
It was recommended to eliminate the 3pc additional tax on grand chicken, introduce sales tax on dyes and chemicals under the Export Facilitation Scheme, reduce the excise duty on beverages and juices by 15pc and remove the 2pc income and sales tax on online purchases.
The committee proposed a wide array of fiscal and structural reforms, including a 15pc reduction in the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on the formal juice industry and equalising tax rates for both property buyers and sellers.
It recommended fixing the withholding tax between 1.2pc and 2pc for the construction sector and increasing the monthly conveyance allowance for disabled workers from Rs6,000 to Rs10,000.
A 50pc reduction was recommended across indirect taxes such as GST, customs duty and sales tax to alleviate the financial burden on consumers.
Additionally, the committee urged the withdrawal of tax exemptions for the elite class to ensure a fairer taxation structure.
The committee called for an end to the designation of construction contractors as withholding agents and proposed allowing up to 40pc of contract values to be transac­t­­ed in cash without additional requirements.
It was recommended that essential commodities, such as flour, pulses, and medicines, be exempted from GST entirely.
The committee also called for increasing the Higher Education Commission’s grant to Rs80 billion and reducing the sales tax on local and imported tractors to 5pc.
Another key recommendation called for placing surplus cash reserves of public entities under the administrative control of the Finance Division, ensuring their effective deployment for public welfare initiatives and improved macroeconomic management.
The committee also urged the government to extend concessional withholding tax rates to print media.

ISLAMABAD: Under fire from parliamentarians and business leaders over a clause allowing tax officers to detain suspected evaders, Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb told the Senate on Saturday that more safeguards have been added to the law to prevent misuse of authority.
Speaking during the Senate debate on the Finance Bill 2025, Mr Aurangzeb said that detailed consultations were held with Senators Saleem Mand­viwalla and Farooq H. Naek, resulting in clearer and more balanced provisions, which will be shared during his upcoming speech in the National Assembly.
The rollback follows strong push-back from business lobbies and both parliamentary committees, which argued that the original clause — allowing officers to detain suspects without external approval — would lead to harassment.
For instance, in a letter to the finance minister earlier this week, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) voiced serious concerns over proposed amendments in the Finance Bill 2025-26 related to Section 37AA of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
 
 

The chamber criticised the proposal for granting sweeping arrest and prosecution powers without proper checks and balances, warning that such measures could enable misuse of authority and lead to harassment of businesses.
Turning to relief measures, Mr Aurangzeb informed the Senate that income tax on individuals earning between Rs50,000 and Rs100,000 per month will be reduced to one per cent from the previously proposed 2.5pc.
“This symbolic and practical step shows the state does not want to overburden this segment,” he said, expressing hope that the measure would increase disposable income and rebuild trust in the taxation system.
The minister also confirmed that the proposed 18pc tax on imported solar panels, aimed at supporting local manufacturers, has been lowered to 10pc. The tax will apply only to the 46pc of solar panel parts that are imported, which he said would result in a modest 4.6pc increase in prices.
Mr Aurangzeb condemned reports of hoarding and profiteering ahead of the tax’s implementation, warning that legal action would be taken against those stockpiling imported panels to exploit consumers.
He insisted that the government had demonstrated “seriousness and flexibility” in light of the discussions in both houses of parliament and the suggestions by lawmakers. Relief and social protection measures in the budget reflected the government’s sense of responsibility, he said, highlighting an increase in the Benazir Income Support Programme’s budget from Rs592 billion to Rs716bn.
He expressed the government’s commitment to take the country towards inclusive and sustainable economic growth, where everyone gets equal opportunities to make progress.
Regarding overall federal expenditure, the minister noted it would rise by only 1.9pc in the next fiscal year, compared to increases of 10pc to 12pc in previous years.
He hoped that, like the previous year, over 50pc of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee of Finance would be included in the final budget.
‘Economy being run on loans’
However, at the start of the proceedings, Leader of the Opposition Syed Shibli Faraz criticised the government for failing to share the committee’s final report, questioning how members could claim ownership of recommendations they had not seen.
“We have no idea how many of the recommendations we gave were included in the report,” he said.
He argued that the committee’s chair should come from the opposition to ensure proper oversight and lamented that the budget had imposed a heavier tax burden without cutting government spending.
“The economy is being run on loans, which is unsustainable,” he said. “The budget lacks vision, relies entirely on borrowing, proposes no new revenue streams and has no clear plan to reduce poverty.”
PTI parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar called for adhering to Article 73 of the Constitution. He was of the view that under the spirit of the Constitution, the recommendations of the Finance Committee should be shared with members at least a day in advance, so that they could thoroughly examine them before the stage of adoption of the report by the House.
He pointed out that presently, this article was not followed and the members were not given a report of the committee before the sitting. “The responsibility under the article should be fulfilled as the Senate can only give recommendations for which its relevant committee does the exercise, but it can’t approve them. These are to be adopted by the House,” he said.

The Regional Refer­ence Laboratory for Polio Era­dication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) tested sewage samples from nine districts, of which seven were found positive for the presence of poliovirus.
A sewage sample from an area is the basic parameter used to identify the presence of the virus in an area.
It determines if polio vaccination campaigns were resulting in the desired immunity among children.
An NIH official said wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was detected in sewage samples collected from Gwadar, Quetta, South Waziristan Lower, South Waziristan Upper, Rawalpindi, Larkana and Mirpurkhas.
 
 

The two negative samples were collected from Pishin and Lahore.
The official explained that if the virus is found in sewage, it is called a positive sample and whenever a child is paralysed with the virus, it is called a positive case.
After the virus is detected in sewage samples, polio campaigns are held in the area to eradicate the virus, the official said.
