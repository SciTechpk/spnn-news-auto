The central bank said that the rate would come into effect from December 16 and added that a detailed statement would be released.







Yousuf M Farooq, the research director at Chase Securities, called the cut “a welcome move”, provided the current account stays contained and the exchange rate can act as a shock absorber if external pressures re-emerge.
“Lower rates should be supportive for equities by lifting valuation multiples and easing financing costs, particularly for leveraged sectors,” he told Dawn.
“It should also help stimulate domestic demand while reducing the government’s interest expense.”
Farooq noted that while a 50bps reduction is not material on its own, it clearly signals the direction of policy in the coming months.
Topline Securities wrote in an X post that the slashed policy rate was a “surprise”, as they expected the rates to remain unchanged.
“In last four monetary policy meetings, [the] SBP observed [the] status quo. [The] last cut of 100bps was announced in [a] May 5, 2025 meeting,” the post read.







The last reduction in the policy rate came in May. Since then, the benchmark rate has been held at 11 per cent, even as headline inflation dipped to 3pc earlier this year. November inflation was recorded at 6.1pc, compared to 6.2pc in October.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised maintaining tight liquidity to curb expected inflation, despite mounting industry pressure.
In a second review released on Thursday, the Fund said the monetary policy needed to remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep expectations anchored, while noting that the SBP had maintained positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis.
It said the tight stance had been pivotal in reducing inflation and should be maintained to ensure price stability and support the rebuilding of external buffers.
Industrial leaders had previously called for a reduction in interest rates to help them stay competitive globally.

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown was launched on migrant smuggling following the Greece boat tragedy in 2024, one which claimed several Pakistani lives.
In a statement issued today, the minister stated that PM Shehbaz had formed a “special committee” to look into the issue of offloading passengers at airports and to ensure safe migration.
“Recently, despite having complete documentation, some passengers have still been offloaded,” the minister said. “People who held valid visas were offloaded as well.”
The committee will prepare “recommendations regarding the safe migration of people,” the minister was quoted as saying.
He detailed that a meeting of the committee is expected this week.
“By the end of January, we will prepare proposals to address these issues, “ he shared, stressing that safe migration was a “fundamental right”.
The minister also lauded the International Organisation of Migration’s (IOM) work for ensuring safe migration.
Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a visit to the Islamabad airport, said that no passenger in possession of “genuine and complete documents” should be barred from travelling abroad.
On November 27, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.</p><small>2025-12-15 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1512595218ce8ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961257/justice-jahangiri-objects-to-ihc-cj-led-division-bench-hearing-fake-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Jahangiri objects to IHC CJ-led division bench hearing fake degree case</strong></a><br><p>Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri appeared before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday, presenting arguments in his defence against challenges to the legitimacy of his law degree and appointment as a judge while also raising objections over the division bench hearing the case.
The controversy surrounding the IHC judge’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
A two-member IHC bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and also comprising Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, took up the matter on Monday in a packed courtroom.
The same bench had declared Dawood’s plea maintainable at the last hearing on December 9, issuing a verdict that was reserved in July last year. It had also barred Justice Jahangiri from judicial work in September, but the order was later set aside by the Supreme Court (SC).
Arguing his case, Justice Jahangiri raised the preliminary objection that the division bench was “inappropriate” to hear the case as a separate petition concerning its members was pending.
This, apparently, was a reference to challenges to Justice Dogar’s appointment as the IHC CJ.
“We have filed a petition against you. You cannot hear this case,” Justice Jahangiri asserted.
Moving on to defending his qualification, he contended that the case was based on a 34-year-old educational record.
“I am ready to take an oath on the Holy Quran that my degree is genuine,” he contended. The judge also argued that the KU never declared his degree fake.
He also took an exception to the “haste” in which proceedings were being held, arguing against the issuance of a three-day notice to address a decades-old matter.
At the last hearing, the CJ Dogar-led bench had gra­nted Justice Jahangiri thr­ee days to respond to the facts unearthed in the case till date. The registrar’s office had served the notice at Justice Jahangiri’s chamber due to time constraints, and sources had told Dawn that court staff of the judge received the notice and submitted it to his chamber.
After raising objections in this regard on Monday, Justice Jahangiri also criticised the earlier IHC directive barring him from work.
“Never in the judicial history of Pakistan and India has such a thing happened […] Not even a patwari (revenue official) was stopped from work the way I was,” he remarked.
The judge sought an adjournment to be able to hire a lawyer for himself and acquire the complete case record, stating, “So little time has been given. I have to get a lawyer and prepare.”
On the other hand, petitioner Dawood requested the court to hear the case on a daily basis.
The court adjourned the hearing until December 18 (Thursday), summoning the KU registrar in person and seeking the record of Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
The IHC judge was also given time until then to engage a lawyer.
CJ Dogar assured Justice Jahangiri that he would receive justice.
Throughout the hearing, CJ Dogar also repeatedly instructed lawyers, who attended the hearing in large numbers, to return to their seats, emphasising, “Honourable Justice Jahangiri has come to me … I want to hear him.”
Protracted legal trajectory
The controversy around Justice Jahangiri’s law degree has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.</p><small>2025-12-15 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1511231503245c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961250/pakistan-origin-man-living-in-sydney-falsely-identified-as-bondi-beach-gunman-fears-his-life-is-in-danger' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney falsely identified as Bondi Beach gunman fears his life is in danger</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney has said he had received death threats and was “terrified” to leave his home after his photo was widely shared online as the gunman responsible for the Bondi Beach shooting, it emerged on Monday.
Two gunmen on Sunday had opened fire at a Hanukkah gathering in Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 15 in Australia’s worst incident of gun violence since 1996. Police have not yet disclosed the names of the suspects, who happen to be father and son, or their motives. However, various news outlets identified them as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively.
The father first came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told reporters on Monday. He was killed at the scene. His son — an Australian-born citizen according to the home affairs minister — is critically injured and being treated in a Sydney hospital bed under police guard.
Photos of a beaming man in a green Pakistan cricket jersey had subsequently pinged across social media. Some of the posts were shared thousands of times, drawing vitriolic comments.
But the photo was taken from the Facebook profile of a different Naveed Akram, who pleaded on Monday for people to stop the misinformation in a video published by the Pakistan Consulate of Sydney.
The video was also picked up by Australia’s SBS News, with Akram, who runs his own business and arrived in Australia in 2018, saying, “As per media reports, one of the shooters, his name is Naveed Akram. My name is also Naveed Akram. Unfortunately, our names are the same.”
“I just want you to know that that person is a different person,” he added.
“That is not me, and I have nothing to do with that incident or that person,” Akram said as he condemned the shooting. He further said that this “propaganda” was being spread through “Indian accounts”.
He appealed to people to report instances of his photos being linked to the shooting, adding that he was “stressed and scared”.
“I really need your help because this is a life-threatening event and there can be many issues that can arise from this,” he was quoted as saying.
“I can’t even go outside safely,” he added.
The 30-year-old, who lives in a northwestern suburb of Sydney, told AFP he first heard around 9:30pm on Sunday that he had been falsely identified as the shooter.
“I could not even sleep last night,” Akram told AFP by phone, adding he deleted all the “terrible” messages he got.
“I’m terrified. I could not go outside, like it’s a life-threatening issue, so I don’t want to risk anything … my family is worried as well, so it’s quite a hard time for me.”
He asked the Pakistan Consulate to put out the video because relatives in Punjab were getting phone calls as well.
“It was destroying my image, my family’s image,” he said.
“People started to call them. They were worried, and they have told the police over there.”
The Pakistan native moved to Australia in 2018 to attend Central Queensland University and later did a masters at Sydney’s Holmes Institute.
Today he runs a car rental business, and he said Australia is “the perfect country”.
“I love this country. I have never had any safety issues here, like everyone is so nice, the people are so nice here,” Akram said.
“It’s only this incident that has caused me this trauma.”</p><small>2025-12-15 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151344358959c27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960922/rethinking-pakistans-higher-defence' target='_blank'><strong>RETHINKING PAKISTAN’S HIGHER DEFENCE</strong></a><br><p>“From Plato to Nato, the history of command in war consists of an endless quest for certainty…historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty…to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man, allowed to do only that which could be controlled; the other, to design organisations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control. …the second of these methods has, by and large, proved more successful than the first…”
— Martin van Creveld quoted by William Lind in Manoeuvre Warfare Handbook
“He plunged past with his bayonet towards the green hedge, King, honour, human dignity, etcetera Dropped like luxuries in a yelling alarm To get out of that blue crackling air His terror’s touchy dynamite.”

SITUATING THE ISSUE
Among other changes brought in by the 27th Constitutional Amendment, one relates to the creation of the office of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). The position, which is to represent command of all three services, will not exist as an independent office but will be held concurrently by whoever is Chief of the Army Staff, beginning with the current incumbent. The amendment also extends the tenure of the current army chief/CDF as also those who would succeed him.
The issue of the probity of the amendment and the manner in which it was pushed through continues to be debated. The delay in the notification gave rise to much speculation about the grey areas in the draft, which seemed tailored for specific circumstances and person but will impact the Higher Defence Organisation (HDO) and civil-military relations beyond this moment and its politics. Expectedly and rightly, the debate on the political aspects of the amendment should continue.
My purpose here, however, is different and is related to analysing the argument, given by some former generals, that there’s nothing novel about the changes that have been made in the HDO because the issue was long being debated within the organisation and the system. They have argued that, in light of evolving warfare, the imperative for ‘jointness’ — seamless operational coordination among the services — has now been formalised through these changes.
On the face of it, these arguments cannot be faulted. For instance, the need for coordination at all three levels — tactical (where battles are fought), operational (where planning is done to achieve the desired outcomes), and politico-strategic (the highest level that informs the purpose of war as also the direction and intent of the other two levels) — should be obvious. War is not a clash of mobs. It requires disciplined forces that must operate to create synergies. That requires coordination.

The 27th Constitutional Amendment promises streamlined command across the military services by creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces. But neither is this a novel concept, nor is the current interpretation without its issues. History shows that organisational redesign alone cannot overcome the realities of conflict. Ejaz Haider urges revisiting the details of an important and necessary doctrine…

However, agreeing with the obvious or stating it without reference — in this case, to factors that do not fall within the operational domain — is not the same thing as agreeing with the details of how it is to be achieved and why in a particular way and not in another.
Further, while jointness is much talked about, like strategy, a term that has almost become meaningless, it must be problematised. It is neither a magic wand nor even desirable in many battle scenarios. We shall return to that.
At this point, a caveat is in order. What follows is my view. There can be many views. Debates over doctrines and the best courses of action have to continue. Wars usually settle them!
One example is the post-WWI debate in France over static and mobile defences. Critics of the idea of the Maginot Line — a vast French system of concrete fortifications, obstacles and weapon installations built along its eastern borders (Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland) in the 1930s — argued that it symbolised passivity, would be costly and a drain on resources and would not be effective against German manoeuvre warfare. The proponents argued that it would provide a strong defence, a base for counterattack and force the Germans into Belgium, drawing their main thrust into a pre-planned battleground.
As it happened, the real test came with the German offensive. The Germans didn’t attack the main line. They rapidly advanced through the supposedly impassable Ardennes Forest, getting around the line’s northern end. The French, who had committed their best mobile forces to Belgium, had left the Ardennes and the road to Paris vulnerable. The point is that debates over this and that can only be settled when the real test of battle comes.
The second issue is that wars are not linear. Nor do they follow a particular template, at least not for the winning side, which wins precisely because it does something different, unexpected. As the celebrated German Panzer commander Gen Hermann Balck once said, “There can be no fixed schemes. Every scheme, every pattern is wrong. No two situations are identical. That is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous.”
In other words, the official view remains untested.
Let me begin this discussion with some history related to HDO in this country, take a look at jointness and its attendant problems and square it off with how battles frustrate top-down planning and why it is important to keep things simple.

HAVE WE THOUGHT OF JOINTNESS ONLY NOW?
The short answer is no. We thought of it way back in the 1970s, after realising the organisational failures, both vertically and horizontally, in the 1965 and 1971 Wars. Gen Ehsanul Haq, former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably a most experienced officer, wrote an excellent paper (2013) for the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on higher defence organisation.
The paper briefly traces the history of why the government of the day established the Joint Staff Headquarters (JSHQ) in March 1976, how and why the centrality of that JSHQ was undermined and what needs to be done to return to what was started in the mid-’70s.
The paper is easily available for anyone interested in reading it, so I won’t go into the details of Gen Haq’s arguments. Two points are important, though. The first is a direct quote from the paper: “Given the political history of Pakistan, unless we build up credible security policy making mechanisms subordinated to Parliament and civilian control, ad hoc and parochial interests would continue to impact our policy formulation processes, undermining critical aspects of our national defence effort [Italics added].”
This, as should be obvious, establishes the principle of civilian control and the fact that, in war’s three levels, the highest is the domain of the civilian principals.
The second point is that jointness did not really require reinventing the wheel. JSHQ was meant precisely for that and, as Gen Haq suggested in 2013, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) could have been made Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff or, if we like CDF better for some reason, CJCSC could have been renamed CDF or CDS or whatever suits our fancy.
The only point where I disagreed with Gen Haq’s excellent analysis when I first read the paper 12 years ago was his suggestion that “while the Chairman may continue to be from the Army (due to the predominance of land strategy and asymmetry in the size of the services), the Vice Chairman [4-star] may be on rotation between the Navy and the Air Force.”
General Haq’s suggestion is/was in good faith. My disagreement then was based on two factors: JSHQ became dysfunctional precisely because of the army and the praetorian tendency of certain chiefs.
In fact, within 14 months of the reorganisation of high defence, Gen Ziaul Haq mounted his coup, essentially kicking the chessboard to play solitaire. To break that cycle and move away from the army’s primacy, the office was to rotate among the three services.
Second, jointness is not about service size. Just like an army CJCS or a CDF cannot make naval operational strategy and would need the navy’s input, a navy CJCS would need the army’s or air force’s inputs for land and air operations.
Now I have a third objection, given the type of war we have witnessed: non-contact, technical and high-intensity, no ground incursions. (This is not to say there can’t be ground incursions. Small-scale incursions can and would likely happen, but the thrust has generally changed.) If the idea of jointness has to have any meaning in the operational sense, the air force has emerged as the thin end of the wedge and, in any future round, the navy could likely get involved on its own and with dedicated air assets in support from the air force.
Within land forces, ground air defence (AD) and long-range artillery have emerged as the main fighting elements. This is unlikely to change and this is where ground AD will have to be fully integrated with PAF. Cyber is a new element but will be central to many operations.
Given these and other factors, we have to look anew at the traditional centrality of land forces as the backbone of military operations — ie the assertion that the army, given its sheer size, is not just primus inter pares [first among equals] but the dominant force. It is not, from an operational perspective, the politics of the issue notwithstanding.
Critics might point to the Russo-Ukraine War and say land forces are critical. That situation does not obtain between Pakistan and India. Neither has the sustainment capacity for long, meat-grinding wars and both are nuclear armed. The Russo-Ukraine scenario would mean — even if we discount the sustainment factor — that either one or the other will resort to nuclear weapons or else the weapons and the entire concept of deterrence through them has been bunkum.
LET’S TALK JOINTNESS AND COORDINATION
There’s a reason for this. The neatness of ‘jointness’ and coordination on the drawing board must get tested in the messy reality of the battlefield, as it often does.
The US military should know. Their Joint Publication 1, whose latest iteration came in 2023, promises to be “the capstone publication for all joint doctrine, presenting fundamental principles and overarching guidance for the employment of the Armed Forces of the United States.” Yet, we have seen the US military grapple with the contingencies of irregular wars and has often failed strategically, even when winning tactical battles.
A good example is the military presentation of plans. Maps, symbols, arrows, timelines. Units represented by icons. They assume perfect (or at least good) communication, shared situational awareness, adherence to timelines and probable enemy reactions.
But information is never perfect — radios don’t work well in nullah beds. The enemy can be wily and Boyd Cycle you, to quote Lind, which basically refers to US Air Force Col John Boyd’s ‘OODA’ loop — observe, orient, decide, act. Whoever can run the OODA loop faster is better placed. Exercises and simulations try to model friction but they cannot go beyond controlled variables. The reality, when the shooting begins, is about exhausted, scared humans with equipment malfunctioning and everything that can possibly go wrong going wrong.
A supposedly rapid advance on a map becomes a gruelling slog through mud, traffic jams on narrow bridges, or unexpected urban sprawl. If you think this is fiction or unlikely, just recall what happened to the Russian forces advancing on the north-south axis towards Kyiv from Belarus.
The conceptual Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) of the 1980s was thought to reduce and ultimately eliminate the fog of war. The First Gulf War further entrenched this idea. Since then, battlegrounds have made clear to both practitioners and theoreticians that the fog comes in many ways and no one can get rid of it. Cutting-edge technology can help defeat forces in conventional conflicts but the fog sets in when a military tries, as the US did, to grapple with populations.
Technology, however useful, can fail. GPS can be spoofed, software can crash, batteries can die. Ukrainian artillery with GPS-guided HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] rounds realised the Russians were jamming and spoofing their GPS signals. It was back to relying on non-GPS rounds and old-school artillery methods both for battery and counter-battery.
Take logistics. The perfectly synchronised attack can falter when one unit runs out of fuel, ammunition or food, because a supply convoy was ambushed, or the map was read wrong by a unit. Any military officer reading this would nod in agreement with a sad face.
One only has to read reports from the Russo-Ukraine front and even about the genocidal Zionist occupation force. Fear, fatigue, fog (in the case of Donbas, a real one!). Humans are not robots. They get exhausted. Exhaustion degrades decision-making among commanders and the fighting spirit among soldiers.
To top it all. The dastardly enemy has an independent will. He is the greatest source of disorder because, unsurprisingly, he actively seeks to disrupt coordination. He ambushes command posts, attacks supply lines and flanks, jams communications, feints and deceives. What he does can throw everything awry: planned timelines and sequences.
Does this mean planning and coordination are meaningless? No! If anything, they are even more important. As in most endeavours in life, the paradox is that planning is essential precisely because it will go wrong. In other words, coordination is crucial not because it is easy to achieve for the reasons cited above (and they aren’t exhaustive), but because its absence can be catastrophic.
Put another way, it provides a commonly-understood baseline and shared intent for all fighting echelons in that theatre of operations. When communication breaks down, which can often happen, leaders at the tactical level can make decisions based on the operational commander’s intent.
This is what Germans called Auftragstaktik [‘mission-tactics’ or as the US military translates it, ‘mission command’]. The term often misunderstood, like Clausewitz’s schwerpunkt (which is NOT centre of gravity), had its meaning in professionalism and an entire military culture (Prussian and German) as it evolved over a long period of time.
In his Instructions for Large Unit Commanders, Helmut Karl Bernhard von Moltke (the Elder) wrote in 1869: “In general, one does well to order no more than is absolutely necessary and to avoid planning beyond the situation one can foresee. These change very rapidly in war. Seldom will orders that anticipate far in advance and in detail succeed completely to execution. The higher the authority, the shorter and more general will the orders be. The next lower command adds what further precision appears necessary. The detail of execution is left to the verbal order, to the command. Each thereby retains freedom of action and decision within his authority.”
This passage was quoted in ‘How the Germans Defined Auftragstaktik’ by Donald E. Vandergriff, a former US Army major. Vandergriff writes, “The overall commander’s intent is for the member to strive for professionalism. In return, the individual will be given latitude in the accomplishment of their given missions.”
According to Lind, “During 19th-century war games, German junior officers routinely received problems that could only be solved by disobeying orders. Orders themselves specified the result to be achieved, but never the method (Auftragstaktik). Initiative was more important than obedience. Mistakes were tolerated as long as they came from too much initiative rather than too little.”
Today’s wars and their many battles are far more complex. No CDF can stand on high ground like Bonaparte, observe enemy movements and send directives to commanders in the field. Yes, we have satellites and other means to have eyes on the enemy, but command has to be delegated and field commanders have to think on their feet. Nothing has changed on that count and nothing is likely to.

A SYSTEM-LEVEL ANALYSIS
Critics would say: what are you talking about? Jointness is about the three services and making them fight like one unit, not in silos. A higher headquarters, in this case the CDF, will make the plans on the basis of threat assessment so the army, navy and air force can operate seamlessly, communicate with each other, be integrated.
Sounds good. The problem is, wars have different formats. A conventional war is not the same as an irregular war or low-intensity conflict. A conventional, non-contact war (May is an example) is not the same as a ground incursion. A ground incursion at a single point or even multiple points in one theatre is not the same as on a very broad front. The fight is different in the mountains from operations in the plains or the desert. Air operations are not the same as naval operations and vice versa, though air can support both ground troops and naval attack vessels. A short, sharp war is different from a long, attritive war in the trenches, which is what we are witnessing in Ukraine.
This brings into play the issues of training and doctrinal gaps. Different services (army, navy, air force) have different cultures, communication protocols, and priorities. This is a problem which has been analysed and written about a lot within the US military.
Despite the emphasis on jointness, the US military continues to grapple with challenges like integrating complex systems, overcoming bureaucratic silos among services — what’s referred to as stove-piping — adapting to new threats (cyber, grey zone operations) etc. The services also face funding problems where the requirement of modernisation often runs into the problem of readiness. This invariably leads to inter-services friction. True jointness, in addition to other impediments, requires overcoming deep-seated institutional biases.
Again, the point is not that jointness should be ditched. It’s a process. Joint planning forces different services to communicate, reveal their capabilities and limitations, and build (some) shared understanding before the battle. This relationship-building is as valuable as the plan itself. Equally, the plan cannot be taken as a rigid script. At best, it’s a foundation for adaptation whose goal, howsoever difficult, is to adapt together more effectively than the enemy.
Put another way, coordination in real-battle conditions is often a patchwork effort to manage chaos at the operational and tactical levels. The elegant flowchart can only provide design principles. To expect more of it is to assume that one side has perfect information and, therefore, can work out every little detail about the adversary’s moves. That is simply not possible.
Another downside of jointness and creating multiple headquarters that link up with a single office is bureaucratisation.
This problem has been dealt with by various writers in relation to the US military, albeit that’s just one example. Personally, I find Edward Luttwak’s The Pentagon and the Art of War: The Question of Military Reform to be an incisive account. Luttwak highlights how the Pentagon’s immense budget often funds technically impressive but strategically useless weapons systems and is driven by bureaucratic incentives rather than genuine military need.
Reason: large bureaucracies, in this case the Pentagon, prioritise internal processes, career advancement, and complex planning over effective outcomes, leading to waste and strategic blunders. Luttwak coined the “Luttwak Paradox”, which suggests that military efforts often become less effective as they become more complex and technically advanced.
Jointness demands inter-services interface. In reality it means (again the US military’s example) that an individual service’s bureaucracy is not replaced. Instead, a new layer on top of existing bureaucracies is added. As identified by various writers, this means that a commander must navigate not only their own service’s logistics, personnel and acquisition systems but also the protocols, politics and resource battles of the joint structure. What begins with creating agility and clarity ends up doing the opposite: slowing things down.
Complexity in systems is a subject long debated since American sociologist Charles Perrow’s analysis of the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown accident. What’s true of tightly coupled engineering systems and the cascading effect of failure in one spreading through the system is also true — in a different way — of complex human organisations.
A good example of how what begins as an elegant concept can end up badly in the heat of battle was the ‘Systemic Operational Design’ created and introduced into the Zionist Occupation Force by Brig Gen Shimon Naveh, who headed the defunct Israeli Operational Theory Research Institute. The language of the concept, given the complexity it introduced, was never understood by the fighting echelons and their commanders who went to battle Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006.
Success lies not in the most elaborate joint plan, but in creating the conditions where a simple directive, empowered subordinates, and shared awareness can produce coherent action in chaos. The system must be designed not for neatness on the drawing board, but for resilience under stress — and that almost always favours robust simplicity over fragile complexity, to use Lebanese-American writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s phrase.
The challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising, to the extent possible, the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it. The aim is, to use the title of US Gen Stanley McChrystal’s book, create a ‘team of teams’ culture that coordinates organically and is not a rigid, top-down machine that requires constant management. In essence, go back to Elder Moltke’s advice: keep it simple.
EPILOGUE
Let’s recap: if we can make three disparate services with their own roles, systems, training protocols etc to roll together, that’s great. But if such integration is not done intelligently, it can end up defeating the very purpose for which jointness was undertaken.
The other point, as discussed above, is that jointness was conceptualised and a system put in place in 1976. It was made to fail because allowing it to work would have undermined army chiefs and how they control(led) politics. Laying waste to that system, instead of strengthening it had nothing to do with military professionalism.
What 27th Amendment has done is to constitutionalise what was long debated and opposed by proponents of balanced civil-military relations. To cloak it in the shiny garbs of jointness and operational integration is to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes.
Jointness requires input from all services. Given the conduct of war, in most cases, the air force and navy will have a bigger role to play. If we are indeed looking for jointness from an operational, not political, angle then the office of CDF should be separate from the office of army chief, stand on its own and above the offices of service chiefs. And, yes, it should rotate among the three services.
Finally, no matter how sound the planning at the top, battles are fought on the ground. It’s ultimately the commander in the field — at any level — who needs to have the Odyssean metis or what Bonaparte, in a different context, called coup d’œil — the glance that takes in a comprehensive view.

The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has registered cases against several YouTubers on charges of promoting and encouraging a gambling application, including Butt and Mubarak.
Both social media influencers appeared in front of Additional District and Sessions Judge Mansoor Ahmed Qureshi on Monday.
Their lawyers contended that the two wanted to join the investigation against them to prove their innocence.
The judge granted pre-arrest bail to Butt and Mubarak, restraining the NCCIA from arresting them till January 6. The judge also directed both suspects to join the investigation before the next date of hearing.
The development comes days after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to the social media influencers in response to a petition filed by Butt and Mubarak’s relatives, who had arrived in Pakistan from London on Dec 10.
Subsequently, the two had approached the Lahore sessions court and filed separate bail petitions.
Cases against the two
According to official records, the two are nominated in several FIRs registered under various cybercrime provisions, including allegations related to operating or promoting gambling applications, misuse of digital platforms and online harassment. The FIA had earlier issued multiple notices, but their stay abroad meant no substantial progress could be made in the investigations.
In September this year, Butt was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for allegedly promoting online gambling apps on social media.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car.
On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, IK-804, which is said to be the prisoner number allotted to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, in March, Butt was also booked under blasphemy and cybercrime laws due to a “religious stir” caused by the launch of his perfume brand that allegedly mocked Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Butt launched his “295” perfume, which refers to the namesake blasphemy law in the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last December, the YouTuber found himself in legal trouble when he was arrested for illegally keeping a lion cub and weapons at his residence. He pleaded guilty in January this year to owning an undocumented wild animal after accepting the cub as a wedding gift.
He avoided jail by promising a judge to post animal rights videos for a year.</p><small>2025-12-15 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1513050606bffff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961259/years-last-nationwide-polio-campaign-to-immunise-45m-children-begins' target='_blank'><strong>Year’s last nationwide polio campaign to immunise 45m children begins</strong></a><br><p>The last nationwide polio campaign of 2025 began on Monday, with the aim of vaccinating 45.5 million children across the country, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The week-long polio drive is set to run until December 21.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
According to the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC), more than 400,000 frontline polio workers will take part in the campaign. More than 23m children will be immunised in Punjab, over 16m in Sindh, more than 7.2m in KP and over 2.6m in Balochistan. In Islamabad, the campaign aims to vaccinate over 400,000 children.
In Sindh, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah inaugurated the polio campaign in Karachi by administering polio drops to children.
“Over 10.6m children will be vaccinated across 30 districts and 1,345 union councils, with 80,000+ frontline workers & 21,000 cops deployed,” the Sindh CM House said on X.







Addressing the ceremony, CM Murad urged parents, influencers, and communities to cooperate with polio workers during the campaign.
He noted that there had been a “surge” in cases in the past two to three years, noting that Sindh had recorded nine cases in 2025.
The chief minister also recalled former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s efforts towards polio eradication. “She administered polio drops to her own daughter Aseefa,” Murad said.
He also remarked that it was “a cause for shame that Pakistan and Afghanistan were the only countries in the world where polio has not yet been eradicated”, calling on the media to “play their part”.
“In the past year, as well, I requested the media to play a public service message of 5-10 seconds before every hourly news headlines for polio awareness,” he said, lamenting that no channel had implemented this.
Meanwhile, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who is also a member of the National Assembly, urged parents and communities to ensure the vaccination of every child under the age of five.
“As Pakistan enters the final polio vaccination campaign of 2025 from December 15-21, I urge parents, communities and leaders to ensure every child under five is vaccinated. This mission, launched under Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, must be completed together,” she said on X.







Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-15 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15122604fd9d853.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959924/karachis-infrastructure-is-killing-us-literally' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s infrastructure is killing us, literally</strong></a><br><p>Earlier this month, Karachi awoke once again to a tragedy that should shake any functioning society to its core. A three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, was walking along a familiar street when he slipped into a gaping manhole and never made it out. His body was recovered the next day, after a 15-hour rescue operation.
The CCTV clip many of us have now seen lasts only a few seconds, yet it’s impossible to forget: one moment he’s there; the next, he’s swallowed whole by the very city meant to protect him.
That hole didn’t open by chance. It was left yawning on a busy Karachi artery, unbarricaded, unmarked, unlit. And yet, we reach for the word “accident.” It isn’t. It’s the predictable consequence of a city abandoned to rot, theft, and overlapping jurisdictions, where the most basic promise of safety collapses under the weight of indifference.
An act of negligence, not a tragedy of nature
Karachi’s infrastructure is not just failing us; it is killing us.
In the days after the incident, officials traded blame. An internal municipal report pointed to nearby construction and commercial entities for leaving the manhole uncovered. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab promised an “impartial inquiry”. The Sindh High Court (SHC) is now hearing a plea for a judicial probe. But for Ibrahim’s family, and for a city that has seen this pattern before, the real question is larger than one uncovered opening or one report.
Because this was not a freak event. Karachi is now a city where its drainage system can swallow a child whole. A city where the infrastructure meant to carry away sewage and storm water has become a standing threat to life.
Each exposed opening on the roadside represents a chain of failures: a missing or broken cover, a stolen iron lid sold as scrap, a repair job left unfinished, a complaint left unattended. Residents across Karachi know the sight all too well — a gaping hole marked by a half-broken stick, a stone, or nothing at all. But the finger-pointing only underscores a deeper truth: Karachi’s governance is fragmented to the point of paralysis.
Responsibilities for drains, roads, footpaths, sewerage, water supply and public safety are divided among the KMC, 25 town municipal corporations, around 250 union committees, the KDA, the water and sewerage corporation, cantonment boards, the Sindh government and private utilities. The city is run by a patchwork of authorities that rarely coordinate, and often contradict one another. When everyone is partially responsible, no one is responsible at all.
A city breaking at the seams
Karachi’s infrastructure is not failing in occasional bursts; it is failing constantly, everywhere, and all at once. The city’s physical systems have deteriorated to the point that no single malfunction can be understood in isolation. A collapsed sewer line, a flooded artery, a ruptured water main, a caved-in footpath — each is part of a larger story of slow, structural decay.
Roads do not simply crumble under traffic. They collapse because sewerage lines beneath them leak for months, softening the soil and hollowing out foundations. Drainage channels do not overflow only during the monsoon; they spend most of the year choked with silt, waste and debris, so that even modest rainfall pushes them past capacity. Flooded streets are not exceptional moments caused by extraordinary weather, they are predictable outcomes of systems that are clogged, fractured or altogether absent.
The sewerage network mirrors this dysfunction. Wastewater seeps into alleys not because of rare blockages but because lines rupture routinely, pumping stations falter without warning, and manholes remain damaged or partially open for weeks. In many neighbourhoods, residents have grown accustomed to laying narrow brick pathways to avoid permanent pools of sewage outside their doorsteps. Karachiites have become so practiced in navigating hazards that they can map the city’s potholes, broken manholes and flooded stretches more confidently than its public spaces and landmarks.
The water supply system suffers from the same long-term neglect. Vast volumes of water leak from corroded pipelines before they ever reach the tap. Illegal connections flourish in the absence of oversight, while legitimate consumers are forced to rely on private tankers whose costs steadily eat into household incomes. In some parts of the city, municipal water has become so irregular that entire communities no longer remember what a consistent supply feels like. Scarcity has replaced reliability as the norm.
These systems do not fail independently; they collapse together in a cycle of deterioration where each weakness accelerates the next. A leaking sewer line undermines a road; the damaged road blocks a nearby drain; the blocked drain floods a stretch of neighbourhoods; the stagnant water hides open manholes; the uncovered manholes exist because no agency has maintained them in years. Karachi’s infrastructure has become an interconnected web of fragility, where every unattended repair magnifies the pressure on the next vulnerable point.
In many cities, you move through infrastructure without a second thought. In Karachi, you move through it carefully, hoping it won’t give way beneath you.
The roads we drive on, the footpaths we step across, the drains we pass by, the water we hope to receive, each carries a hidden risk. What happened to a child at Nipa Chowrangi was not an isolated disaster or the result of a single missing cover. It was the clearest expression of a city whose built environment has been allowed to erode faster than it can be fixed, leaving its residents to carry the costs and the dangers of that neglect every day.
The cost of indifference
The danger now is not only that Karachi’s systems are failing, but that their failure has become normalised. The city continues to expand, its population continues to grow, and climate pressures intensify each year; yet the fundamental maintenance of civic infrastructure has not kept pace. Temporary fixes are stretched into permanent solutions, and permanent responsibilities are repeatedly deferred.
Karachi does not need another inquiry or another round of finger-pointing. It needs recognition, political, bureaucratic and public that the city is living through a slow-moving infrastructure crisis with profound human consequences. A crisis that will not be resolved by patchwork repairs, by reactive governance measures triggered only after tragedy, by inquiry commissions whose reports disappear, or by the press conferences and political point-scoring that substitute for action. But by sustained, coordinated and depoliticised investment in the systems that make a city safe.
Until such a shift occurs, each tragedy will expose the same vulnerabilities; each neighbourhood will continue to build its own makeshift defenses; each resident will learn to navigate hazards that should never exist.
Infrastructure is meant to protect people. In Karachi, it has become the reason people are dying.

At least six Bangladeshi peacekeepers were killed and eight wounded in a drone attack on a UN base on Saturday in the disputed Abyei region between Sudan and South Sudan, according to Bangladesh’s armed forces.
In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous attack against UN peacekeepers in Kadugli, Sudan, which has resulted in the tragic deaths of six peacekeepers from Bangladesh serving with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (Unisfa), and injuries to several others.”
It expressed Pakistan’s deepest condolences to the government and people of Bangladesh on the lives lost, adding that Pakistan stood in solidarity with the bereaved families.
“UN peacekeepers remain at the forefront of international efforts to prevent conflict, protect civilians, and support peace under the UN flag,” the FO statement said.
“We pay homage to the ultimate sacrifice made by these Blue Helmets in the line of duty for peace and stability in the region,” it added.
The FO also called for a swift investigation to identify the perpetrators of the “cowardly attack” and to hold the responsible parties accountable.
“We will also continue to work closely with members of the UN Security Council and the international community to ensure the safety and security of all UN peacekeepers,” it said.







Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions and its troops have long been deployed in the volatile region.
In a statement on Sunday, the Bangldesh armed forces’ public relations division said, “A drone attack was carried out by separatist armed groups on the Kadugali Logistics Base under the UN peacekeeping mission in Abyei, Sudan yesterday (Saturday) from approximately 3:40pm to 3:50pm local time.”
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing his condolences to the families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.
“Attacks against UN peacekeepers like this one are unjustifiable & may constitute war crimes. I remind everyone of their obligation to protect UN personnel and civilians,” he said.







South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 following a long civil war, but they failed to agree on the status of several regions that both sides claimed sovereignty over.</p><small>2025-12-15 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15112356c4ef337.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961251/witnesses-tell-of-courage-panic-in-wake-of-bondi-beach-shootings' target='_blank'><strong>Witnesses tell of courage, panic in wake of Bondi Beach shootings</strong></a><br><p>A brave few dashed towards Australia’s Bondi Beach as a mass shooting unfolded on Sunday night, wading through fleeing crowds to rescue children, treat the injured and confront the gunmen.
A father-and-son duo opened fire as crowds thronged Australia’s famous surf beach for a yearly Jewish celebration on a balmy summer evening, killing 15 people and wounding dozens more.
Confronting tales of heroism and terror trickled out in the hours following Australia’s deadliest mass shooting in almost 30 years.
A team of off-duty lifeguards sprinted across the sand to drag children to safety.
“The team ran out under fire to try and clear children from the playground while the gunmen were firing,” said Steven Pearce from Surf Life Saving New South Wales.
“They were able to get the children inside,” he told AFP.
“The other lifesavers went out and started trying to do CPR on the shot victims, and tried to drag as many inside as they could.”
Bleeding victims were carried across the beach atop surfboards turned into makeshift stretchers.
A pregnant woman went into labour after taking refuge in the surf club’s headquarters, Pearce said, and was later rushed to hospital.
“We have used every bandage in the surf clubs,” said Pearce. “Teams just ran out of everything.”
Fruit seller Ahmed Al Ahmed, 43, was lauded as the man who disarmed one of the attackers.
Footage showed a t-shirt clad man — later identified as Ahmed by local media — sneaking up on one of the gunmen.
He briefly tussles with the shooter before knocking him to the ground and wresting away the weapon.

“It’s been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,” US President Donald Trump said of Ahmed.
Churches, bars and restaurants threw open their doors to shelter the panicked crowds sprinting away from the beach.
Frenchman Alban Baton, 23, hid for several hours with other customers in the cool room of a Bondi Beach grocery store.
“It was very fast,” he told AFP.
“One girl said: ‘There is one guy with a gun’. And from this moment, everybody ran, and it was like survival instinct, so we all run in the cool room,” he said.
“Minute after minutes, we were starting to realise what was happening.”
Mass shootings have been rare in Australia since a lone gunman killed 35 people in the tourist town of Port Arthur in 1996.
The so-called Port Arthur massacre led to sweeping reforms that would come to be lauded around the world as a gold standard for gun safety.</p><small>2025-12-15 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15101358becc589.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961246/father-and-son-behind-bondi-jewish-festival-shooting-that-killed-15-australian-police-say' target='_blank'><strong>Father and son behind Bondi Jewish festival shooting that killed 15, Australian police say</strong></a><br><p>Two alleged gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach were a father and son, police said on Monday, as Australia began mourning victims of its worst gun violence in almost 30 years.
The father, a 50-year-old, was killed at the scene, taking the number of dead to 16, while his 24-year-old son was in a critical condition in hospital, police said at a press conference on Monday.
The father and son were identified as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively, by state broadcaster ABC and other local media outlets.
Officials have described Sunday’s shooting as a targeted anti-Semitic attack.
Forty people remain in hospital following the attack, including two police officers who are in a serious but stable condition, police said. The victims were aged between 10 and 87.
Witnesses said the attack at the famed beach, which was packed on a hot evening, lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets.
Police said around 1,000 people had attended the targeted Hanukkah event, which was held in a small park off the beach.
A bystander captured on video tackling and disarming an armed man during the attack has been hailed as a hero whose actions saved lives.
7News Australia named him as Ahmed al Ahmed, citing a relative, who said the 43-year-old fruit shop owner had been shot twice and had undergone surgery.

A fundraising page for the man had raised more than A$350,000 (£233,000) by Monday afternoon.
Amid speculations regarding the identity and ethnic background of the attackers, police did not release the shooters’ names but said the father had held a firearms licence since 2015 and had six licensed weapons.
Home Minister Tony Burke said the father arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, while his son is an Australian-born citizen.
Police did not provide details about the firearms, but videos from the scene showed the men firing what appeared to be a bolt-action rifle and a shotgun.
“We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters.
According to ABC, the two had possible links to the Islamic State group. Senior officials in the investigation told the ABC that two IS flags were found in the gunmen’s car at the beach, although New South Wales police said they could not confirm the report.
Bondi local Morgan Gabriel, 27, said she had been heading to a nearby cinema when she heard what she thought were fireworks, before people started running up her street.
“I sheltered about six or seven. Two of them were actually my close friends, and the rest were just people that were on the street. But people, their phones had been left down the beach, and everyone was just trying to get away,” she said.
“It’s a very sad time this morning … Normally, like on a Monday or any morning, it’s packed. People are swimming, surfing, running. So this is very, very quiet. And there’s definitely a solemn sort of vibe.”
A makeshift memorial with flowers and Israeli and Australian flags was set up at the Bondi pavilion and an online condolence book was established.
Police and private Jewish security guards wearing earpieces were positioned around as mourners paid respects and laid flowers.
World leaders condemn the attack
Authorities said they were confident only two attackers were involved in the incident, after previously saying they were checking whether a third offender was involved.
At the suspects’ home in Bonnyrigg, a suburb around 36 km west of the CBD, there was a heavy police presence on Monday, with a cordon wrapping around several neighbouring houses.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Bondi Beach on Monday morning to lay flowers near the scene of the attack.
“What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of anti-Semitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location,” Albanese told reporters.
“The Jewish community are hurting today. Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.”
Albanese later urged Australians to light a candle in solidarity with the Jewish community “to show that light will indeed defeat darkness — part of what Hanukkah celebrates”, he said.
Albanese said several world leaders including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had reached out and offered condolences and support.
Sunday’s shootings were the most serious in a string of anti-Semitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023.
‘Saw bodies on the ground ’
Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world’s safest countries. Sunday’s attack was the worst since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at the Port Arthur tourist site in the southern island state of Tasmania.
Rabbi Mendel Kastel, whose brother-in-law Eli Schlanger was killed in Sunday’s attack, said it had been a harrowing evening.
“You can very easily become very angry and try to blame people, turn on people but that’s not what this is about. It’s about a community,” he said.
“We need to step up at a time like this, be there for each other, and come together. And we will, and we will get through this, and we know that. The Australian community will help us do it,” he added.
Local woman Danielle, who declined to give her surname, was at the beach when the shooting occurred and raced to collect her daughter, who was attending a bar mitzvah at a function centre near where the alleged shooters were positioned.
“I heard there was a shooting so I bolted there to get my daughter, I could hear gunshots, I saw bodies on the ground. We are used to being scared, we have felt this way since October 7.”
Australia’s Jewish diaspora is small but deeply embedded in the wider community, with about 150,000 people who identify as Jewish in the country of 27 million.
About one-third of them are estimated to live in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, including Bondi. Major cities including Berlin, London and New York stepped up security around Hanukkah events on Sunday following the attack at Bondi.</p><small>2025-12-15 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15110415d5439e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961248/hong-kong-court-finds-tycoon-jimmy-lai-guilty-in-landmark-security-trial' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong court finds tycoon Jimmy Lai guilty in landmark security trial</strong></a><br><p>Hong Kong’s High Court on Monday found tycoon and pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai guilty of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces in the city’s highest-profile trial under a China-imposed national security law that could see him jailed for life.
The landmark case has drawn international scrutiny of Hong Kong’s judicial independence amid a years-long crackdown on rights and freedoms in the global financial hub after 2019 pro-democracy protests that Beijing saw as a challenge to its rule.
While 78-year-old Lai’s supporters see him as a freedom fighter, Beijing sees him as a mastermind of the protests and a conspirator advocating for US sanctions against Hong Kong and the mainland. Chinese authorities have rejected accusations of eroding the city’s rule of law.
“There is no doubt” that Lai “had harboured his resentment and hatred of” China for many of his adult years, Judge Esther Toh told a packed courtroom as the tycoon, wearing a pale green jumper and a grey jacket, sat with his arms folded.
The two other judges in his case were Alex Lee and Susana D’Almada Remedios.
Sentencing expected next year
Lai, the founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper and one of the most prominent critics of China’s Communist Party leadership, has already spent five years in jail, facing a slew of litigation under the sweeping security legislation that Beijing enacted in response to the 2019 protests.
A pre-sentencing hearing where Lai can plead for lenience is scheduled for January 12. His lawyer Steven Kwan said Lai will decide whether to appeal after the sentencing.
Hong Kong’s national security police chief Steve Li said on Monday he welcomed the verdict.
Lai, who suffers from health issues including diabetes and high blood pressure, was found guilty on two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and one of conspiracy to publish seditious material. He had pleaded not guilty on all counts.
The verdict bookends a year that marked the essential disappearance of Hong Kong’s democratic opposition under pressure from Beijing. The Democratic Party voted to disband on Sunday.
Outside the court, people overnight formed a queue more than a block long, some with camping gear, seeking to attend the verdict. Police were monitoring the area around the building.
Rights groups criticise verdict
Lai’s trial began in December 2023 in the former British colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with the verdict seen as a potential fresh diplomatic flashpoint.
Countries including the US and Britain, as well as rights groups, say the trial is politically motivated and have called for Lai’s immediate release.
US President Donald Trump raised Lai’s case with Xi in a meeting in October and has said he would do his utmost to “save” Lai.
Beh Lih Yi, Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, called the verdict a “sham conviction” and “a disgraceful act of persecution”.
“The ruling underscores Hong Kong’s utter contempt for press freedom,” she said. “Jimmy Lai’s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy.”
Media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders also described Lai’s trial as “a sham”.
The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have said the tycoon’s trial was fair and that the national security law treats all equally. They have said no freedoms are absolute when it comes to safeguarding national security.
Lai’s family say his health has worsened after more than 1,800 days in solitary confinement, and that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and heart palpitations.
His verdict comes at a delicate moment for Hong Kong, where residents have been mourning after a fire last month killed at least 160 people in one of the worst blazes in a residential complex globally in recent years.
Chinese national security authorities have warned they would crack down on any “anti-China” individuals who tried to use the fire to “plunge Hong Kong back into the chaos” of 2019, when massive pro-democracy protests triggered a political crisis.</p><small>2025-12-15 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151052536fe413e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961247/police-to-release-man-detained-over-brown-university-mass-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Police to release man detained over Brown University mass shooting</strong></a><br><p>The man held as a “person of interest” in the Brown University shooting that left two students dead and nine injured will be released from custody, authorities said on Sunday night.
Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said earlier at a midday news conference that a man in his 20s had been taken into custody in connection with Saturday’s gun violence but gave no further details.
But at a late-night news conference hours later, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and other state and local officials told reporters the man detained would be released from custody, saying the investigation was going into a “different direction”.
“We have not yet solved this case, but I am confident we are going to do that in the near future,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.
Officials declined to elaborate on why the man who was taken into custody was detained in the first place.
“There was a quantum of evidence which justified detaining this person as a person of interest,” Neronha said, adding that investigators later determined there was “no basis to believe that he’s a person of interest, so … he’s being released”.
Authorities said they believed an unidentified person pictured in surveillance footage to be the person they were still looking for.
FBI Director Kash Patel said earlier on Sunday in a post on X that the person of interest had been detained in a hotel room in the Rhode Island town of Coventry, a 30-minute drive from the Brown campus.
An FBI team specialising in cellular data analysis used geolocation information to track the suspect, Patel said.







While the killer was presumed to remain at large, authorities said on Sunday night they would not reimpose an initial shelter-in-place order for the campus and surrounding community that had been lifted.
The mass shooting — the latest of nearly 400 in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive — shook the community at the university, one of the oldest in the United States.
The school cancelled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said that authorities, as of midday on Sunday, had not yet contacted all of the victims’ family members because some were travelling.
He invited residents to a previously planned event on Sunday to light a Christmas tree and a menorah to mark the first night of Hanukkah.
“It is quite clear that if we can come together as a community and shine a little bit of light tonight, I think there’s nothing better that we could be doing,” Smiley said.
Authorities release video of suspect
Seven people injured at Brown University were in stable condition, Smiley said. One remained in critical but stable condition, while another had been discharged, he added.
Shelter-in-place orders at the university and nearby areas were lifted on Sunday. Smiley said earlier in the day that residents should expect a visible police presence across the city.
The gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, officials said on Saturday.
Authorities on Saturday released a short video clip of a person of interest dressed in black walking near the engineering building.
Providence Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said on Saturday the individual may have worn a mask, but officials were not certain.
Brown President Christina Paxson told reporters that all or nearly all of the victims were students, adding: “This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has.”
Students caught by surprise
Ref Bari, 22, a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire.
Bari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her and her friends, and she agreed. They returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom.
“She trusted me,” he said. “The only connection between us is we’re both students at Brown, but beyond that, we don’t know each other.”
Teaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.
“The first couple of gunshots went straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,” Oduro said. “Who knows, if I didn’t duck, maybe I’m not here today.”
A student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.
Jack DiPrimio, another graduate student at Brown, said he was initially not concerned when the university went on lockdown because he had experienced many active-shooter drills. The drills have become more common in the US as attacks targeting students have increased.
“I had faced so many lockdowns in high school and even a few at my undergrad, so I wasn’t that worried at first,” DiPrimio said in a TikTok video after coming out of a five-hour lockdown. “Maybe I was desensitised.”</p><small>2025-12-15 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/150951158e0f2e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961146/goods-transport-owners-strike-forces-development-projects-in-punjab-to-stop' target='_blank'><strong>Goods transport owners strike forces development projects in Punjab to stop</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The ongoing development projects — both public and private sectors — have come to a grinding halt in Lahore and other parts of Punjab after the suspension of delivery of supplies of construction material due to the ongoing wheel-jam strike by goods transporters.
The situation of dust pollution, smog and other environmental issues has also worsened due to the incomplete projects, Dawn has learnt.
“At present, the work on all the ongoing development projects in which construction material (mainly cement, crushed stones etc) is required is stopped for the last seven days or so due to the suspension of material delivery from Sargodha and other parts of Punjab,” commented an official of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA). “The situation persists not only in Lahore but also in other cities and towns of the province where a huge number of development works are underway at the moment,” he added.
According to another official source in the Metropolitan Corporation Lahore, the work on the ongoing development schemes under the Lahore Development Plan (LDP) has also slowed down due to the non-supply of construction material. “The concrete work is a vital part of construction that cannot be completed without crushed stones, cement and other items,” he explained.

Public and private sector development projects in Punjab have come to a grinding halt owing to the lack of construction material delivery

Talking to Dawn, a private builder said that all construction-related activities requiring core building material had stopped or slowed down not only in Lahore but also in other cities including Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur and Multan. “At present, no work is in progress at the under-construction building requiring brickwork, lenter, plaster, tilework etc, as there is no supply of cement, crushed stone and other material. Even those constructing their houses privately have no option but to stop work in such a terrible situation,” he explained. He requested the government to make efforts to resume business activities as the same was also causing unemployment.
On the other hand, the transporters have refused to surrender before the government till the acceptance of their demands, including suspension of the controversial clauses of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025, stopping registration of FIRs against drivers, imposition of heavy fines and impounding vehicles on various traffic laws violations.
“We will not call off the strike until the acceptance of our genuine demands,” said Khalid Arain of the Punjab Stone Transporters Association based in Sargodha. “We can call off the strike if, at least, someone responsible can give us an assurance to resolve our issues within the shortest possible time,” he said, requesting the government to cooperate for the sake of a huge number of people having no work due to the strike.
EXHIBITION: The annual Chrysanthemum Flower Show 2025, organised by the Parks & Horticulture Authority (PHA), is in full swing at the Jilani Park, captivating citizens with its vibrant colours, pleasant fragrance, and creative floral displays.
The event has emerged as a major attraction for families, with more than 100,000 people visiting the park over the weekend alone to enjoy the breathtaking exhibition.
According to PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad, the visitors had appreciated the excellent arrangements, artistic presentation, and innovative landscaping showcased at the exhibition. Featuring more than 200 varieties of flowers and thousands of beautifully arranged flowerpots, the show has transformed Jilani Park into a mesmerizing blend of colors and scents. The park has become a serene, family-friendly, and visually appealing recreational destination for children, women, and men alike.
“Chrysanthemum Flower Show will continue at Jilani Park until December 15,” said the MD. He said that the annual flower show had proven to be a special gift for the public. “So far, more than 1.5 million visitors have attended the exhibition, reflecting its immense popularity and public appreciation,” he added.

KARACHI: Residents of Defence View and adjacent localities, students of nearby educational institutions and thousands of commuters using Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway are forced to endure the stench of garbage collected by authorities from across district East and dumped along the Malir riverbank.
The area is also polluted with dust, harmful fumes and toxic gases emanating from the piles of garbage.
Known as GTS Imtiaz (Garbage Transfer Station-Imtiaz), because of its proximity with the Qayyumabad outlet of the chain of department stores, the garbage dump is managed by the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB).
Dawn visited the locality where the area residents said the pungent smell, dust, toxic gases and air pollution from the site have not only disrupted daily life, but have also given rise to various health problems.
The GTS Imtiaz is one of the centres where waste collected from district East is temporarily transferred before being moved to landfill sites. However, residents claim that a facility which should have been located on the outskirts of the city has instead been established near a residential area, severely affecting the entrance to the Defence Housing Authority.
Locals said that upon entering the district, the overwhelming stench of garbage greets the people, while hundreds of kites and other birds circle the area, creating an unsightly and unhygienic environment.
According to the World Health Organisation and UN-Habitat guidelines, waste should not be left in the open at transfer stations, as these facilities are meant only for temporary storage before transfer. Open-air storage produces foul odours, harmful gases, dust, attracts flies and birds, and increases disease risks, especially near residential areas.
The UN guidelines add that proper transfer stations should use sealed containers and covered halls to control odours; without this, the facility becomes a dumping site, threatening public health and urban living.
It also mentions that children, the elderly and patients with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Continuous odours also contribute to mental stress, sleep disruption and reduced quality of life, while improper management encourages pests and risks contaminating nearby rivers or streams.
A study by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a public health agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services, states that organic waste emits gases like hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and methane during decomposition, producing a rotten-egg smell. Prolonged exposure can cause breathing difficulties, worsen asthma and allergies, trigger headaches and nausea, irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and affect the nervous system.
Frustrations grow over health risks, daily discomfort In a visit to the area, Dawn talked to residents as well as students of a nearby private university.
Defence View Phase II resident and MBBS student Maria said she and her family were facing a variety of health problems.
She added that the continuous smell and air pollution, particularly affecting respiratory health, have had a severe impact on her mother.
A passer-by said that people chose to live in upscale areas expecting better facilities and a cleaner environment.
“But when one enters the district and is immediately hit by a stench and pollution, the whole idea of living here seems pointless. The difference between affluent and ordinary areas disappears,” he added.
A student from Iqra University, located opposite the GTS Imtiaz, said the city already struggles with pollution, and daily garbage transfers at this site make the situation worse. “This is totally unfair,” he added.
A group of three other students from the same university shared that in the morning, when garbage is moved, the dust is so thick that it becomes “difficult to see, significantly reducing visibility”.
They also highlighted that a month ago, smoke from burning garbage would fill the entire university campus and classrooms, causing health issues, though burning has ceased over the past month.
Student Amna said that while a large transfer station is located on the opposite side of the university, a smaller station has been set up in the university parking area, leaving students “surrounded by garbage on both sides”.
Defence View Phase III resident Shamim Iqbal said that when garbage is moved at nights, the stench makes it almost impossible to sleep. “Even with windows and doors closed, the smell is so strong it causes nausea,” he said.
Salim, a resident of Gulshan-i-Ibrahim, Junejo Town, said that he had previously lived near Defence View Phase III but was forced to relocate due to his father’s respiratory condition. “The odour is so overpowering that even breathing becomes difficult,” he added.
A local shopkeeper said that the smell and pollution attracted flies over food items, creating serious hygiene and health issues.
Residents expressed concerns that the GTS’s location near the Malir River could exacerbate environmental risks, particularly during rains, when garbage and contaminated water might flow into the river.
They demanded that transfer stations be relocated away from residential areas or properly covered in accordance with recognised environmental and health standards.
SSWMB response
The SSWMB Managing Director, Tariq Ali Nizamani, told Dawn that the GTS Imtiaz functions as an intermediary point, where waste is first brought before being transferred to landfill sites.
He added that four of the six GTS facilities in Karachi — GTS Imtiaz, Dinga Morr, Sharafi and Gutter Baghicha — are in the process of being modernised, including GTS Imtiaz.
Mr Nizamani added that the work on the GTS Imtiaz was expected to be completed by early next year.
“Once modernisation is complete, the facility will be upgraded into a covered centre to improve the collection and transfer of waste,” he added.
Regarding complaints about garbage burning, the MD said that previously some scavengers would remove usable items from the site and burn the remaining waste. However, eight guards have now been deployed by the board to prevent such incidents from recurring.
He explained that decomposing waste produces methane gas, which poses a fire risk, considering that water bowsers have also been stationed on site to respond immediately to any potential hazards.

According to officials, the decision was taken at the 20th meeting of Conference of the Parties (CoP), CITES, recently held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.
The development, sources said, followed effective lobbying efforts of the Pakistani delegation that put up a revised plea before the global forum to consider the plant for inclusion in the CITES.
The initial proposal put up by Germany and supported by EU countries couldn’t get the two-third majority.
Describing the development as a major success for Pakistan on the international forum, officials said that the status would help tackle the growing threat of the plant’s illegal trade.

Gughar, native to Karoonjar Hills, now listed on CITES; the status will help tackle growing threat to plant’s illegal trade

“This decision will help promote global traceability of the plant’s trade,” said Sindh Wildlife Conser­vator Javed Ahmed Mahar, adding that while the CITES Appendix 11 didn’t place a ban on the plant’s trade, it called upon on the member states to set up a mechanism to make the trade transparent and traceable.
“The CITES Appendix II creates a strict science-based control system that only allows international trade when specimens are legally acquired and sustainably sourced. Every shipment is required to carry standardised CITES permit, creating a fully traceable chain of custody that can be verified at any border,” Mr Mahar explained.
Sources said plant’s illegal trade from Pakistan had increased dramatically in recent years following complete ban by India on its extraction from the species’ native population growing in Rajasthan. The plant’s resin, they said, was in high demand across the world.
In 2024, the wildlife department in collaboration with anti-narcotics force had confiscated two major illegal shipments containing high-value plant materials, including that of gughar, which was declared protected the same year.
The decision came in light of Sindh High Court’s last year’s order placing a complete ban on mining and excavation activities at Nagarparkar’s Karoonjar hills, a key habitat of the plant.
Precious plant
A perennial shrub, gughar (Commiphora Wightii) is found in parts of Tharparkar, Sindh, and Balochistan in Pakistan, India and Oman. The plant is targeted for its dense oily resin known as guggulu or guggul.
This substance, expert say, is widely used in traditional medicines for the treatment of various disorders. Scientific evidences show the shrub to be profoundly effective against diverse chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, arthritis, pancreatitis, dermatitis, diabetes, infectious diseases, intestinal metaplasia, otitis media, respiratory diseases, asthma, psoriasis, and gingivitis.
Besides, according to experts, it also exerts hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, cardio-protective, hypolipidemia, and thyroid stimulatory effects by targeting multiple signalling pathways.
“C.wightii is vulnerable to overexploitation, both because of its life history characteristics as well as the higher yields produced when destructive methods are used to harvest its gum. The species is slow growing with a poor germination rate and harvest is focused on mature individuals that are at least five years old (and 8-10 years old in India). Unregulated commercial exploitation is therefore expected to impact the recruitment and regeneration capacity of C.wightii, which is already heavily depleted,” says the proposal read out by Dr David Harter of Germany at the conference.
It calls for urgent regulation to control its international trade and promote the recovery of the remaining population of the species.

“Resistance and its weapons are a legitimate right guaranteed by international law and are linked to the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Hayya said in a televised address on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV.
“We are open to studying any proposals that preserve this right while guaranteeing the establishment of a Palestinian state.”
The US-sponsored ceasefire, in effect since October 10, halted the conflict. But it remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of violations.
The agreement is composed of three phases. In the first phase of the deal, Palestinian committed to relea­sing the remaining 48 living and dead captives held in the territory.
So far they have released all of the prisoners except for one body.
Under the second phase Israeli troops would further withdraw from their positions in Gaza and be replaced by an international stabilisation force, while Hamas would lay down its weapons. Israel has repeatedly insisted Hamas “will be disarmed”. The third phase includes the reconstruction of the vast areas of Gaza levelled by Israel’s retaliatory military campaign.
Hayya also confirmed the head of the group’s weapons production was killed in an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip the day before.
“The Palestinian people are currently going through difficult times and suffering greatly… with the martyrdom of more than 70,000 people, the latest of whom was the mujahid commander Raed Saad and his companions.”
Raed Saed’s funeral
Israel announced on Saturday that it had killed Saad, describing him as “one of the architects” of the Oct 2023 raid.
Thousands of Hamas supporters rallied in central Gaza City at a funeral for senior commander Raed Saed and three associates killed alongside him on Saturday.
The mourners chanted “Martyrs are dear to God” and carried the bodies in coffins draped in green Hamas flags, in one of the group’s biggest displays of its presence since a US-backed ceasefire deal came into effect in Gaza in October.

Both LeT and JeM were declared proscribed organisations by Pakistan in 2002.
The proposed sanctions — a global asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo — signal closer US-India counterterrorism cooperation. Yet, strikingly, the joint statement does not mention Pakistan.
That omission has not gone unnoticed, especially given India’s frequent charge that such groups operate from Pakistani soil — a claim Islamabad denies.

Joint call makes no mention of Islamabad, despite India’s wishes

Observers interpret the omission as deliberate and revealing of Washington’s strategic balancing act in South Asia.
As Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz noted: “The US may have avoided naming Pakistan. It has named India as a partner in the Indo-Pacific theatre. I wonder how long this straddling policy will last.”
The US and Indian delegations, led respectively by Monica Jacobsen of the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and India’s Counterterrorism Joint Secretary Vinod Bahade, emphasised cooperation in training, cybersecurity, judicial coordination, mutual legal assistance and intelligence-sharing.
They condemned recent attacks notably the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the Nov 10 Red Fort incident in New Delhi — stressing that “those responsible for terrorism should be held accountable”.
They also welcomed the US designation of The Resistance Front (TRF), which India blames for being behind the Pahalgam attack, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially-Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).
But as observers noted, the silence on Pakistan reflects a US desire to continue counterterrorism cooperation with India, while keeping open diplomatic space with Pakistan, whose utility Washington appears to value anew.
The broader context helps explain this approach. According to a Dec 8 Foreign Policy article titled ‘Trump’s Pivot to Pakistan’, the warming of US-Pakistan relations since mid-2025 has been dramatic.
The piece noted that President Trump has “developed a close relationship with senior Pakistani leadership, including the country’s powerful military chief, Asim Munir, whom he hosted at the White House in June and again in September, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whom he met three times this year.”
As the article reports, “The Pakistanis have done a very good job of developing a positive relationship with President Trump,” according to a former US diplomat who requested anonymity.
The logic seems tactical: Islamabad has offered “things of value” from cooperation on counterterrorism (including high-profile arrests of militants), to access to critical minerals, to interest in emerging sectors such as energy, mining, and even cryptocurrency — aligning with some of Trump’s strategic and personal predilections.
According to one former Pakistani ambassador to the US, the outreach has been carefully crafted: “They gave him the praise that he wanted,” the diplomat said.
In this context, the joint US-India terror-designation statement can be read as tactical: the US still wants to maintain the appearance of cooperation with India on counterterrorism, but avoids confrontation with Pakistan, preserving for Islamabad a renewed space in US foreign policy.
That’s why observers argue the omission of Pakistan in the joint statement is not a mere oversight, but a reflection of evolving US strategy in South Asia, where alliances are becoming more transactional, fluid and hedged.
The next session of the India-US JWGCT and Designations Dialogue scheduled in the United States will offer an early test of whether this balancing act can hold. In the meantime, the strategic triangle between Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad appears more complex and fragile than ever before.

LAHORE: The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC), a broad coalition of clerics from various Sunni schools of thought, has urged the Taliban interim government to implement the resolution recently passed by more than 1,000 Afghan clerics against indulging in militancy abroad.
“It is now the responsibility of the Afghan interim government to ensure the implementation of the recent declaration issued by its scholars,” PUC Chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi said here on Sunday, terming the resolution a “positive step in the right direction”.
He said there was no difference between the stance of Afghan clerics and that of those belonging to Pakistan.
“There are two basic points in the declaration. First, they [Afghan clerics] say that aggression against Afghan soil is unacceptable, and we say that terrorism in Pakistan is unacceptable. Second, they say that Afghan soil should not be used against any other country, and we hold the same opinion. There should be no attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan and vice versa,” he added.
Stressing that peace and stability in the region are in the collective interest, he thanked Turkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for their attempts to negotiate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Mr Ashrafi warned that any attempt to raise voices against the armed forces would be strongly resisted.
He said that if the need arose, religious seminaries and mosques would stand ready to defend the country, its security and stability. He emphasised that safeguarding the homeland was a collective responsibility.
Calling for political maturity, Mr Ashrafi urged all political parties to sit together and engage in dialogue to strengthen the country’s defence, economy and internal stability.
He criticised the use of abusive language in politics, saying that those who resorted to hate speech did not want peace in the country. He said scholars from all schools of thought had unanimously declared that violent behaviour was unacceptable. “Our objective is to take the country towards the caliphate system through peaceful means,” he added.
He also strongly condemned attacks and criticism directed at the ISPR director general following his recent press conference.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Sunday urged the Afghan Taliban to rid their country of all militant groups, while Iran stressed the need for regional cooperation, rather than foreign intervention, at a multinational Afghanistan-foc­used mee­t­ing in Tehran.
The calls for action came during a meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, plus Russia.
The Taliban were invi­ted to participate, but declined to attend, according to statements from both Iranian and Taliban officials.
The high-level gathering in the Iranian capital brought together special representatives from Paki­stan, China, Russia, Tajiki­stan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to discuss shared security concerns and strategies for engaging with Afgha­nistan’s de facto authorities.
Pakistan’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Afgha­nistan Mohammad Sadiq made the country’s position clear, emphasising the persistent threat of terrorism originating from Afghan territory.
“The continued threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil is a big challenge for the region,” Mr Sadiq said, according to a statement.
He highlighted that a stable Afghanistan, free from terrorist elements, was essential for gaining the trust of its neighbours and unlocking its vast economic potential.
“It is, therefore, imperative that the current de-facto rulers take steps to ameliorate their suffering. And the foremost step in this regard would be to rid their soil indiscriminately of all types of terrorists,” he stated.
He later posted on X that “the people of Afghanistan have already suffered enough and they deserve better”.







Only an Afghanistan that does not harbour terrorists, he explained, will inspire confidence in neighbouring countries to meaningfully engage, which would in turn help realise the country’s immense potential for economic connectivity.
The regional forum was first initiated and hosted by Pakistan in September 2021, just weeks after the Taliban seized control of Kabul as US and Nato forces completed their withdrawal after a 20-year conflict. Iran hosted the second foreign ministers’ meeting of the group in late October 2021.
However, the forum has struggled to achieve its goals. According to Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Khan, the original intent was for the group to make collective decisions, including the possibility of a coordinated recognition of the Taliban government.
“The grouping could not become an effective forum as the Taliban did not positively respond,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Sunday.
He added that Pakistan had hoped the neighbouring countries would adopt a unified approach on critical issues such as counter-terrorism, political inclusivity, girls’ education, and human and women’s rights in Afghanistan.
Separately, Ambassador Sadiq held a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi. According to Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasir Tipu, Sadiq expressed hope that the meeting would play a useful role in promoting regional peace.
“Recalling closer interactions taking place between leaderships of both countries at the highest levels in the past two years, Mr Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to further deepen and widen its ties with Pakistan,” Mr Tipu wrote on X.







Regional solutions
Mr Araqchi, addressing the meeting, argued that Afghanistan’s stability hinges on its integration into regional political and economic structures, not on external involvement.
“Experience has shown that ‘imported prescriptions and trans-regional decisions’ have failed to bring stability to crisis-hit countries,” he said, according to Iran’s Press TV.
He highlighted the primary role of neighbouring states, describing them as the “most natural and reliable” actors capable of addressing Afghanistan’s complex challenges.
Mr Araghchi pointed to Afghanistan’s strategic geoeconomic position at the intersection of Central, West, and South Asia, highlighting its potential to serve as a vital corridor for trade, energy transit, and regional connectivity.
The Iranian foreign minister argued that the security and prosperity of Afghanistan are inseparable from the interests of the entire region. “Afghanistan’s stability and development are not only a humanitarian necessity but also a strategic imperative for the entire region,” he noted.
He called for collective responsibility and confidence-building measures among regional nations, warning against an over-reliance on security-centric approaches and the neglect of Afghanistan’s social and cultural realities.
Mr Araghchi attributed past failures to these factors, as well as the marginalisation of regional actors and the chaotic foreign military withdrawal in 2021 and said the integration of Afghanistan into regional political and economic processes would help establish long-term stability and reduce tensions.
Reaffirming Iran’s commitment, he said his country was ready to expand cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbours in transportation, trade, energy, and consular services, arguing that regional convergence could create a sustainable framework for cooperation centred on Afghanistan.
“At the heart of all these efforts are the people of Afghanistan, who deserve a secure and dignified future,” he said.
Taliban decline invitation
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, confirmed at a briefing that the Taliban had been formally invited, stating that Iran believed their participation would enhance mutual understanding and help resolve issues between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries.
“Afghanistan, however, chose not to attend the meeting, a decision that Iran respects,” Baqaei said, according to the IRNA news agency. He noted that the meeting allowed participating countries to discuss regional developments, including recent border tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Baqaei stressed Iran’s concerns over regional stability, saying, “Iran shares a total border of nearly 2,000 kilometres with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any tension that arises between the two countries will inevitably affect us as well.”
Kabul’s decision to stay away was criticised by Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran.
“The Taliban regime’s decision not to participate in tomorrow’s Tehran meeting of senior officials from Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours and Russia is further proof of the Taliban’s lack of political maturity,” Durrani wrote on X.
“This decision reinforces the argument that the Taliban cannot negotiate an issue; a mere ‘Na-manu (don’t accept)’ is a head-in-the-sand attitude and will not resolve the serious problems.”

“A tweet, circulated by certain anti-Pakistan quarters, claiming that [the] whole crew of a particular PIA flight is missing, is entirely baseless,” the flag carrier said in a post on X, adding that the purpose was to “malign PIA and Pakistan”.
“There has been no such incident, and the news is fake,” it added.







Meanwhile, a PIA spokesperson issued a separate statement also denying the news, claiming that the information had been circulated by an “Afghan and anti-Pakistan account”.
“The misleading tweet is part of a well-conceived plan based on hostility towards Pakistan and is aimed at damaging the reputation of the national airline and the country,” the spokesperson said, clarifying that the news held no truth.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
On November 21, a PIA flight attendant reportedly went missing in Canada, prompting the airline to launch an inquiry into his disappearance.
​According to PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan, the attendant did not report for flight PK-798 from Toronto to Lahore.
“When contacted, he cited ill health as an excuse,” the spokesperson said, adding that the matter is being investigated. “In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant.”
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-15 02:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15072015a524d3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961211/ctd-official-found-shot-dead-in-panjgur' target='_blank'><strong>CTD official found shot dead in Panjgur</strong></a><br><p>GWADAR: An official of the Counter-Terrorism Dep­­artment (CTD) was found shot dead in an aba­ndoned area of the Panjgur district, while two individuals were gunned down in separate attacks in Turbat, police said on Sunday. 
Authorities identified the CTD official as Khalil Ahmed, who was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Tusp area of Panjgur. His body, which showed signs of torture and gunshot wounds, was later found dumped in an abandoned site in Tusp. 
Locals informed the authorities about the presence of a body, prompting police to rush to the Chakul locality on the outskirts of Panjgur town. Police took custody of the body and shifted it to the district hospital. 
Later, family members protested in front of the district police officer in Panjgur to press the police for immediate arrest of the kidnappers and killers. The protesters alleged police had been informed about the abduction of the official, but they did not rescue him. However, after negotiations with police officials and the district administration, the demonstrators ended their protest and dispersed peacefully. Police said an investigation into the incident is underway. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of the official.
Meanwhile, two other people were killed in Turbat, police said. 
They said armed men riding motorcycles targeted Muhammad Naeem in the Kahirabad area, killing him on the spot before speeding away. 
In a similar shooting, armed men killed a man in the Absar area of Turbat before fleeing. The body was shifted to the Turbat hospital. “In both incidents attackers fired at their targets from close range, which caused their instant death,” police said.

Ten people were killed and around a dozen were wounded when gunmen opened fire during a Jewish holiday event at the beach, Australian officials said. New South Wales police said two people had been taken into custody, and the ABC said one of at least two gunmen was among those killed.
According to the law enforcement official, the suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, who lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg.
ABC gave no information on his nationality.
“The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr Akram’s home … was being raided by police on Sunday evening,” ABC reported.
Australian police said an “improvised explosive device” had been found in a car linked to a suspect in the deadly shooting.
“We have found an improvised explosive device in a car which is linked to the deceased offender,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the incident “shocking and distressing”, adding that “emergency responders are on the ground and working to save lives”.
“I saw at least 10 people on the ground and blood everywhere,” 30-year-old local Harry Wilson, who witnessed the shooting, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
According to The Sydney Morning Herald, 43-year-old fruit vendor Ahmed el Ahmed disarmed one of the attackers and wrestled his weapon away from him.
“Ahmed placed himself in the line of fire to take a rifle from the shooter, and was later hit by at least two bullets himself,” the newspaper reported, adding that Ahmed’s cousin told the media that he was shot in his hand and upper arm.
“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” the cousin, Mustafa was quoted as saying. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by “vile terrorists”.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting.
“These are the results of the anti-Semitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the anti-Semitic and inciting calls of ‘Globalise the Intifada’ that were realised today,” he alleged.
One of the world’s most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists, especially on warm weekend evenings.
“If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it’s something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It’s a horrific thing,” Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack.
Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard.
One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled his weapon off him. A different man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge.
Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff.
Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia’s opposition Liberal party, said the loss of life in the incident was “significant”.
“Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,” she said.
President, PM express solidarity with Australia
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and extended their condolences to the victims in separate statements.
In a statement from the Presidency, President Zardari expressed sorrow over the incident, praying for the victims’ families and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.
“Pakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, stands in solidarity with Australia and condemns violence against innocent civilians,” the statement read.







Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz extended his condolences and said Pakistan condemns terrorism in all of its forms.
“We stand in solidarity with the people and government of Australia in this difficult time,” he wrote.

“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that the second IBO was conducted in the province’s Bannu district, where security forces neutralised six more terrorists.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-14 16:45</small></div><hr>
