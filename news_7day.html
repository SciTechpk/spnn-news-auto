But they warn that any attack on the country’s nuclear power station at Bushehr could cause a nuclear disaster.
Israel says it is determined to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities in its military campaign, but that it also wants to avoid any nuclear disaster in a region that is home to tens of millions of people and produces much of the world’s oil.
 
 

Fears of catastrophe rippled through the Gulf on Thursday when the Israeli military said it had struck a site in Bushehr on the Gulf coast — home to Iran’s only nuclear power station — only to say later that the announcement was a mistake.
What has Israel hit so far?
Israel has announced attacks on nuclear sites in Natanz, Isfahan, Arak and Tehran itself. Israel says it aims to stop Iran from building an atomic bomb. Iran denies ever seeking one.
 
 

The international nuclear watchdog, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has reported damage to the uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, to the nuclear complex at Isfahan, including the Uranium Conversion Facility, and to centrifuge production facilities in Karaj and Tehran.
Israel has also attacked Arak, also known as Khondab.
The IAEA said Israeli military strikes hit the Khondab Heavy Water Research Reactor, which was under construction and had not begun operating, and damaged the nearby plant that makes heavy water. The IAEA said that it was not operational and contained no nuclear material, so there were no radiological effects.
In an update of its assessment on Friday, the IAEA said key buildings at the site were damaged. Heavy-water reactors can be used to produce plutonium, which, like enriched uranium, can be used to make an atomic bomb.
What risks do these strikes pose?
Peter Bryant, a professor at the University of Liverpool in England who specialises in radiation protection science and nuclear energy policy, said he is not too concerned about fallout risks from the strikes so far.
He noted that the Arak site was not operational while the Natanz facility was underground, and no release of radiation was reported. “The issue is controlling what has happened inside that facility, but nuclear facilities are designed for that,” he said. “Uranium is only dangerous if it gets physically inhaled or ingested or gets into the body at low enrichments,” he said.
Darya Dolzikova, a senior research fellow at London think tank RUSI, said attacks on facilities at the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle — the stages where uranium is prepared for use in a reactor — pose primarily chemical, not radiological risks.
At enrichment facilities, UF6, or uranium hexafluoride, is the concern. “When UF6 interacts with water vapour in the air, it produces harmful chemicals,” she said.
The extent to which any material is dispersed would depend on factors including the weather, she added. “In low winds, much of the material can be expected to settle in the vicinity of the facility; in high winds, the material will travel farther, but is also likely to disperse more widely.”
The risk of dispersal is lower for underground facilities.
 
 

Simon Bennett, who leads the civil safety and security unit at the University of Leicester in the UK, said risks to the environment were minimal if Israel hits subterranean facilities because you are “burying nuclear material in possibly thousands of tonnes of concrete, earth and rock”.
What about nuclear reactors?
The major concern would be a strike on Iran’s nuclear reactor at Bushehr.
Richard Wakeford, Honorary Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Manchester, said that while contamination from attacks on enrichment facilities would be “mainly a chemical problem” for the surrounding areas, extensive damage to large power reactors “is a different story”.
Radioactive elements would be released either through a plume of volatile materials or into the sea, he added.
James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said an attack on Bushehr “could cause an absolute radiological catastrophe”, but that attacks on enrichment facilities were “unlikely to cause significant off-site consequences”.
Before uranium goes into a nuclear reactor, it is barely radioactive, he said. “The chemical form of uranium hexafluoride is toxic … but it actually doesn’t tend to travel large distances, and it’s barely radioactive. So far, the radiological consequences of Israel’s attacks have been virtually nil,” he added, while stating his opposition to Israel’s campaign.
Bennett of the University of Leicester said it would be “foolhardy for the Israelis to attack” Bushehr because they could pierce the reactor, which would mean releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.
Why are Gulf states especially worried?
For Gulf states, the impact of any strike on Bushehr would be worsened by the potential contamination of Gulf waters, jeopardising a critical source of desalinated potable water.
In the UAE, desalinated water accounts for more than 80 per cent of drinking water, while Bahrain became fully reliant on desalinated water in 2016, with 100pc of groundwater reserved for contingency plans, according to authorities.
Qatar is 100pc dependent on desalinated water.
In Saudi Arabia, a much larger nation with a greater reserve of natural groundwater, about 50pc of the water supply came from desalinated water as of 2023, according to the General Authority for Statistics.
While some Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates have access to more than one sea to draw water from, countries like Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait are crowded along the shoreline of the Gulf with no other coastline.
“If a natural disaster, oil spill, or even a targeted attack were to disrupt a desalination plant, hundreds of thousands could lose access to freshwater almost instantly,” said Nidal Hilal, Professor of Engineering and Director of New York University Abu Dhabi’s Water Research Centre.
“Coastal desalination plants are especially vulnerable to regional hazards like oil spills and potential nuclear contamination,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-20 09:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20141100976dc82.jpg?r=142118' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918412/eu-bars-chinese-firms-from-major-state-medical-equipment-contracts' target='_blank'><strong>EU bars Chinese firms from major state medical equipment contracts</strong></a><br><p>The European Union on Friday banned Chinese firms from government medical device purchases worth more than five million euros ($5.8 million) in retaliation for limits Beijing places on access to its own market.
The latest salvo in trade tensions between the 27-nation bloc and China covers a wide range of healthcare supplies, from surgical masks to X-ray machines, that represent a market worth 150 billion euros in the EU.
“Our aim with these measures is to level the playing field for EU businesses,” the bloc’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said. “We remain committed to dialogue with China to resolve these issues.”
In response, China accused the EU of “double standards”.
“The EU has always boasted that it is the most open market in the world, but in reality, it has gradually moved towards protectionism”, foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a regular press briefing.
“Under the guise of fair competition (the EU) actually carries out unfair competition, which is a typical case of double standards.”
The European Commission said in a statement the move was in “response to China’s longstanding exclusion of EU-made medical devices from Chinese government contracts.”
Brussels said just under 90 per cent of public procurement contracts for medical devices in China “were subject to exclusionary and discriminatory measures” against EU firms.
In addition to barring Chinese firms from major state purchases, “inputs from China for successful bids” would also be limited to 50pc, it said.
Over the last three years, Brussels and Beijing have come into conflict in a number of economic sectors, including electric cars, the rail industry, solar panels and wind turbines.
The decision on medical devices comes at a time of heightened trade tensions with President Donald Trump’s United States, which has imposed customs surcharges on imports from all over the world, including Europe.
The EU has decided to take a tougher stance on trade in recent years, adopting a vast arsenal of legislation to better defend its businesses against unfair competition.
In April 2024, the commission opened an investigation into Chinese public contracts for medical devices, the first under a new mechanism introduced by the EU in 2022 to obtain better access to overseas state purchases.
China, on the other hand, accuses Europe of protectionism.
After a year of negotiations, the commission, which manages trade policy on behalf of the 27 member states, said it had failed to make any progress with China.
“The measure seeks to incentivise China to cease its discrimination against EU firms and EU-made medical devices and treat EU companies with the same openness as the EU does with Chinese companies and products,” Brussels said.</p><small>2025-06-20 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/201240286d6e4c4.jpg?r=125815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918395/suspect-arrested-as-another-case-of-child-pornography-comes-to-light-in-punjabs-muzaffargarh' target='_blank'><strong>Suspect arrested as another case of child pornography comes to light in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh</strong></a><br><p>A suspect was arrested in yet another case of child pornography in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, Police said on Friday.
Earlier in the month, the government claimed to have dismantled an international child exploitation network operating out of a so-called gaming club in Muzaffargarh, where children aged six to 10 were lured, abused and filmed for the sake of selling their videos on the dark web.
“Several children were sexually abused and filmed in Sardarabad village,” a police statement said today.
The matter came to light when one of the victims contacted the police. According to the statement, the suspect had been blackmailing the children using compromised videos.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was lodged at Saddar police station in Muzaffargarh district under section 292 (sale, distribution, and public exhibition of obscene material) and section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a boy was sexually abused and filmed by his older brother’s former employer when he went to collect his brother’s pending wages. The older brother had previously worked for the suspect as an animal caretaker.
The statement added that the Sadar police station has arrested the suspect, while the victims were being contacted for legal action.
In Pakistan, the punishment for sexually abusing a minor can range from seven years to life imprisonment, while rape of a child carries the death penalty or life term. Laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act, 2020 were enacted to address rising cases of abuse, strengthen penalties, and ensure timely action. Offences related to child pornography are punishable by up to 14 years in prison, along with hefty fines.
 
 

Despite existing laws, cases of child sexual abuse continue to surface across the country.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ’Cruel Numbers 2024’ by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.
In April, Punjab police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p><small>2025-06-20 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2011085788df287.png?r=110917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918254/punjab-assembly-session-marred-by-watch-theft-long-suspension-and-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly session marred by ‘watch theft’, long suspension and delay</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly descended into pandemonium as the general debate on the provincial budget commenced, leading to a nearly two-hour suspension of the proceedings amidst intense sloganeering by the government and opposition benches on Thursday.
The members reportedly damaged microphones. A Treasury MPA accused an opposition member of stealing his watch, fueling the chaos.
The session, presided over by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, began three hours and 35 minutes behind schedule and immediately plunged into disarray.
The uproar began when treasury MPA Bilal Yamin accused opposition member Ejaz Shafi of stealing his watch. This ignited a furious reaction from the opposition that countered with slogans of ‘Nawaz Sharif is a thief!’. As opposition members streamed into the House in protest, the accusation of the stolen watch echoed through the chamber, with government members waving their watches and chanting ‘watch thief’.
Speaker Khan struggled to restore order.
Bilal Yamin insisted that the opposition’s uproar was an attempt to distract from the watch theft.

Treasury MPA accuses Opp member of stealing his watch

The speaker was forced to adjourn the session and summoned parliamentary affairs minister Mujtaba Shuja, Samiullah Khan and Opposition Leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to his chamber for negotiations. After an hour and fifty minutes, the session resumed. However, as soon as opposition members reentered the house, sloganeering restarted from both sides.
Watch issue
The House, once again, erupted with noise with the speaker’s calls for “Order in the House!” going unheeded. Bilal Yamin, speaking on a point of order, clarified that the commotion was to avoid discussion on his watch, which, he alleged, Ejaz Shafi had snatched from his hand on June 16 during a scuffle in the session. He stated that the watch, though not expensive, held sentimental value due to its connection with his father.
In response, Shafi denied the ‘false and baseless’ accusation. Shafi went on to say that, “it’s not just the Sharif family, but this entire party is full of thieves”. He further demanded that the chief minister who, he claimed, had not attended the House for an entire year, should be searched before him. Following these accusations, the speaker announced the formation of a committee to investigate the matter.
After the commotion subsided, Bhachar began the general debate on the budget 2025-26. The speaker initially cautioned the opposition leader against reading his speech, citing rules that only allow the finance minister to do so. Bhachar agreed to abide by the restrictions.
‘Anti-people budget’
Commencing his speech, the opposition leader declared the proposed budget as ‘anti-people’, asserting that budgets should provide relief to the poor. He accused the current government of prioritising political actions against PTI, specifically ‘torturing’ PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. He questioned the sudden increase in the development budget from Rs842 billion to Rs1.24 trillion, arguing that the government lacked the capacity for such expenditure.
 
 

While acknowledging an increase in the education budget, he demanded a review of public schools to identify where the funds were actually needed. He noted the absence of new development projects despite the increased budget allocation.
Citing the ‘Rehri Programme’ (cart programme) in which a company estimated Rs98,000 per cart but the metropolitan officers deliberately awarded the contract to a company that estimated Rs149,000 per cart. Bhachar also criticised the Rs150 million ‘Bike Lane’ project, which he claimed, was washed away in the first rain despite the CM’s assurance of a one-year warranty.
Bhachar reiterated his earlier concerns about the Ramazan Nigehbaan Programme, alleging embezzlement by 93 government employees.
Agricultural distress
The opposition leader highlighted the plight of farmers due to the wheat crisis, stating that wheat cultivation was at its lowest this year, leaving the farmers struggling while the government favoured specific individuals. He claimed that the farmers faced a loss of Rs36,000 per acre due to the government’s policies.
Bhachar disputed the government’s claim of 1.5m farmers in Punjab, asserting the number was over 80m. He accused the government of exploiting farmers through the ‘Kisan Card’ and withholding over Rs20bn in farmer funds. He also pointed to a 30pc decline in cotton production and over Rs22bn loss for wheat farmers since 2023.
Regarding education, he said that out of 49,000 schools, 25,000 had been outsourced, and 33pc of children were out of school, with more schools being outsourced.

Australian lawmakers passed landmark rules to ban under 16s from social media in November 2024, approving one of the world’s toughest crackdowns on popular sites like Facebook, Instagram and X.
Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and X could face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32m) for failing to comply with the legislation.
They have described the law — which is due to come into effect by the end of this year — as vague, rushed and “problematic”.
 
 

There has been widespread concern over children’s use of online platforms as evidence shows that social media can have negative effects on children’s mental and physical health.
Digital age verification systems — which would be critical to the ban — can work, said the interim findings of an independent Age Assurance Technology Trial, conducted for the government.
“These preliminary findings indicate that age assurance can be done in Australia privately, robustly and effectively,” it said.
There are “no significant technological barriers” to deploying age checking systems in Australia, said the trial’s project director, Tony Allen.
“These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said in a statement.
In a separate interview with Australia’s Nine Network, Allen said preventing children circumventing age verification tools was a “big challenge”, however.
“I don’t think anything is completely foolproof,” he said.
There are a “plethora” of approaches to age verification but no single solution to suit all cases, said the trial report, in which 53 organisations took part.
Australia’s legislation is being closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.
Greece spearheaded a proposal this month for the European Union to limit children’s use of online platforms by setting an age of digital adulthood — barring children from social media without parental consent.</p><small>2025-06-20 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/201157053fa6e18.png?r=115831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382/coas-munir-stresses-potential-for-broader-multidimensional-ties-with-us-built-on-mutual-respect' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‘broader, multidimensional’ ties with US built on mutual respect</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with the United States, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
COAS Munir is on a five-day official visit to the US, where he met with President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — also the intelligence chief — has accompanied Gen Munir.
COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the “comprehensive and candid exchange”, ISPR added.
The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence”, the statement said.
 
 

Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Gen Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development”.
In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.
The army chief also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”, the statement added.
He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict with India and “elaborated on Pakistan’s perspective on terrorism”.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly noted that Pakistan lost 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.
During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.
He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.
The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.
 
 

He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the Israel-Iran war as the US weighs whether to intervene militarily or not.
Participants, the ISPR said, noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”. “The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.
The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, the military’s media wing noted. It reflected the country’s “commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue”.</p><small>2025-06-20 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20103654e9d961a.gif?r=103937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918290/supreme-court-rules-against-construction-in-karachi-dha-park-except-for-jogging-track' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court rules against construction in Karachi DHA park, except for jogging track</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Supreme Court (SC) has restrained the authorities concerned from raising any structure apart from a jogging track on the premises of an amenity plot / park located in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The apex court also said that the people must not be deprived of the park’s utility, subject to a nominal entrance fee meant for its maintenance.
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Salahuddin Panhwar was hearing a civil petition filed against an order of the Sindh High Court (SHC) at the SC’s Karachi Registry.
 
 

It also allowed a request by the counsel for the respondents to transfer the matter to the principal seat at Islamabad after seeking the approval of the chief justice of Pakistan, as the lawyer submitted that, since the injunctive order had been passed, the interests of the respondents were at stake.

Bench rules ordinary people should not be deprived of park’s utility

Citing DHA, Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC), M/s Optimum Sports (Private) Limited and others as respondents, the managing committee of Masjid-i-Saheem, located at Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase VI, DHA, along with some neighbouring residents, moved the apex court through their counsel Khawaja Shams-ul-Islam against an order of the SHC passed on March 11.
The bench in its order said that the lawyer for the petitioners had placed before it a case whereby it was claimed that a “public park” meant for the use of common persons was now being licensed to an entity for its commercial gain and that every individual entering the park would be charged exorbitantly.
The counsel also argued that the purpose of the amenity, i.e. public park, cannot be changed into any other amenity, depriving the public at large from utilising it solely as a park.
The lawyer for the petitioners also maintained that although a division bench of the SHC dealt with some of the issues, including the locus standi of the petitioners, nonetheless, a public interest litigation was involved.
Representing the respondents, Advocate Hussain Ali Almani asserted that public entry was not restricted, but it would be subject to an entrance fee for the jogging track.
He also submitted that presently, the respondents were raising a jogging track and had planned to construct padel courts and other allied structures.
The bench in its order said, “We are of the view that apart from the jogging track, no structure of the nature as licensed to them or otherwise, be raised till the next date of hearing and the common person shall not be deprived to park’s utility subject to nominal fee meant for its maintenance.”
At this juncture, the counsel for the respondents requested for the transfer of the case to the principal seat of the apex court, as he submitted that the interests of the respondents were at stake after issuance of the injunctive order.
Thereafter, the bench directed its office to transfer the case to the principal seat in Islamabad for further hearing, after seeking approval of the chief justice, and to fix it for hearing in the opening week after the summer vacations.
The petitioners contended that the amenity plot/parking lot in question was adjacent to the mosque, the entrance of which was connected with the masjid, and that it was a park admeasuring over two acres.
They also asserted that the present controversy arose when M/s Optimum Sports (Private) Limited had started demolishing/altering the main gate of the masjid and parking lot, and after a long discussion the petitioners were told that the parking lot had been given to the private firm by way of a licence agreement executed between the firm and DHA and CBC.
They further argued that the contract, without an open auction or any public tender and without following the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules, was seriously hampering the right of access to the mosque, as the namazis had been using the designated parking of the masjid for over 30 years.
The petitioners asserted that the impugned SHC order dismissing their petition suffered from legal infirmity, as it ought to have appreciated that state functionaries, in awarding contracts, must act fairly, reasonably, honestly and justly and that the high court has the power to judicially review administrative actions to check their fairness, reasonableness and transparency.

In a statement on X on Thursday, PTI Punjab spokesman Shayan Bashir said the luxury vehicles being procured by the Punjab government include 10 bulletproof Toyota Land Cruisers and V8s worth Rs500 million each for senior police officials, 48 protocol cars costing Rs900m, and 76 vehicles for ministers and senior bureaucrats totalling Rs710m.
Beyond that, he said, millions more would be spent on fuel and maintenance. “Luxuries are utterly out of touch with the realities faced by ordinary citizens,” he stated.
 






The spokesman said the budget documents reveal an alarming escalation in spending for elite offices. He said the Governor House budget had surged by 870 per cent, now set at Rs1.53bn, while provincial ministers’ budgets increased by 204pc to Rs1.07bn. He said the Chief Minister’s Office received a 19pc hike, reaching Rs1.46bn, while the Punjab Assembly’s budget jumped by 47pc to Rs7.38bn. He said the commissioners’ offices overspent some Rs319m last year, and the next fiscal year’s budget stood at Rs1.85bn. The Chief Minister’s Inspection Team’s budget rose by 26pc following ‘unauthorised’ spending of Rs182m.

Demands NAB probe into ‘unauthorised’ spending

The PTI said this ‘reckless’ increase in spending was a political indictment of the government’s priorities. The party alleged the basic sectors such as health, education, and agriculture remained severely underfunded.
 
 

The spokesman said the farmers had been abandoned with no procurement policies or crop-loss support, and low-income families bear the brunt of this government’s neglect.The PTI demands a thorough forensic audit by NAB into all luxury vehicle purchases and budget increases. It said the ‘unauthorised’ spending must be immediately reversed, and criminal action be taken against those responsible for diverting public funds.
The party leadership said it would fight this betrayal in the Assembly, in courts and across the province until Punjab’s resources serve the people, not an elite few. “This budget is a clear declaration that the Punjab government values its own luxury far above the survival and dignity of its citizens,” Mr Bashir asserted.

Some of Trump’s most prominent Republican allies, including top lieutenant Steve Bannon, have found themselves in the unusual position of being at odds with a president who largely shares their isolationist tendencies.
Bannon, one of many influential voices from Trump’s  “America First” coalition, on Wednesday urged caution about the US military joining Israel in trying to destroy Iran’s nuclear programme in the absence of a diplomatic deal.
“We can’t do this again,” Bannon told reporters at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington.  “We’ll tear the country apart. We can’t have another Iraq.”
Bannon continued to preach patience on his popular “War Room” podcast on Thursday, contending that Trump was being set up to be responsible for toppling the Iranian regime. He was joined by Jack Posobiec, another prominent MAGA (Make America Great Again) figure.
 
 

The goal, Posobiec said, is to  “suck the United States in, have the regime change go off and, unfortunately, have the United States finish something that was started not by us.”  Bannon replied,  “The way you have regime change is that it’s got to come from the street. It has to come from the people. If it comes from the top, from a foreign power, it never works.”

Steve Bannon warns US involvement will tear Iran apart

The anti-interventionist part of the Republican Party is watching with alarm as Trump has moved swiftly from seeking a peaceful diplomatic settlement with Iran to possibly having the United States support Israel’s military campaign, including the use of a 30,000-pound  “bunker buster” bomb.
The criticism shows the opposition Trump could face from his right-leaning  “Make America Great Again” flank should he join the fight, a step that Iran has warned would have big consequences for Americans without specifying what that might be.
A decision by Trump to enter the conflict would be a sharp departure from his usual caution about foreign entanglements. It could affect his campaign to foster good relations in the Gulf and could be a distraction from his efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine and make tariff deals with countries around the world.
The MAGA coalition propelled Trump into office in the 2016 and 2024 elections and remains critically important to him even though he is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term. Upsetting that base could erode Trump’s popularity and factor into whether Repu­blicans hang on to control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.
Iran’s nuclear weapon
Asked about the rift on Wednes­day, Trump appeared unconcerned that some in his base could be turning their backs on him, at least on this issue. “My supporters are more in love with me today, and I’m in love with them more than they were even at election time,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
“I only want one thing: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”  He said some of his supporters “are a little bit unhappy now” but that others agree with him that Iran cannot become a nuclear power.
“I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between them fighting or having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do,” Trump said.

By striking targets other than nuclear or ballistic facilities, such as Iran’s IRIB broadcaster, expectations have grown that Israel has goals beyond degrading Iranian atomic and missile capabilities and eyes removing supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
 
 

But while President Donald Trump has warned “we know” where Khamenei “is hiding”, what would follow his removal after over three-and-a-half decades in power is shrouded in uncertainty and risk.
European leaders are haunted by the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Nato-led intervention in Libya in 2011. They resulted in the removal of dictators Saddam Hussein and Moamer Qadhafi but also in years of bloody mayhem in both countries.
“The biggest mistake today is to seek regime change in Iran through military means because that would lead to chaos,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at the end of the G7 summit in Canada. “Does anyone think that what was done in Iraq in 2003… or what was done in Libya the previous decade was a good idea? No!” Macron said.
Analysts say ousting Khamenei and his fellow clerical leaders risks creating a vacuum that could be filled by hardline elements in the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) ideological force or the Iranian military.
“Israel’s strikes seem more focused on regime change than non-proliferation,” said Nicole Grajewski, fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.
“Of course Israel is targeting ballistic missile and military related facilities but they are also targeting leadership and symbols of the regime like the IRIB,” she said.
“If the regime were to fall, the hope would be for a liberal and democratic government. “However, there is a strong likelihood that other powerful entities like the IRGC could emerge as the replacement,” she said.
Among the highest-profile opposition figures is the US-based Reza Pahlavi, the son of ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He has declared that the Islamic republic is  “on the verge of collapse”, accusing Khamenei of  “hiding underground” like a  “frightened rat”.
Pahlavi has long called for the restoration of the warm relationship that existed between his late father and Israel.

Officials said that Pakistanis were returning from different cities of Iran, starting from the first batch that reached Taftan via passenger coaches on Monday night.
Over the past three days, around 1,400 Pakistani pilgrims and some 400 students have crossed back, of whom 481 people who crossed via Taftan, reached Quetta on Thursday night.
 
 

“We are providing all facilities to the Pakistanis coming back to the country on their arrival at Taftan and shifting them in Pakistan House,” Assistant Commissioner Taftan Naeem Qasim Shahwani said.
The official said that on Wednesday, a convoy of five coaches carrying around 200 people arrived in Quetta from Taftan. Among them were 80 pilgrims and 120 students who had earlier reached Taftan by bus from Iran.
In Gwadar, the return of Pakistani citizens also continued through the Gabad-Rimdan crossing.
According to the Foreign Office, nearly 3,000 Pakistani nationals have already been evacuated from Iran via multiple routes.

In a statement released on Thursday, the board announ­ced that it has completed the investigation into the alleged leaks and that they were making sure all students “receive fair results”.
The statement said Cambri­dge conducted over two million exams each year in thousands of schools and centres in 160 countries and it was “very rare for any of our exams to be compromised”.
On the allegations of paper leaks in June, the CIE statement said most reports of question pa­­per leaks “turned out to be fal­se”, calling them “malicious atte­mp­­ts to undermine the exams and to disturb and upset candidates”.
“It is also clear that there were attempts to scam money from candidates in exchange for fake papers.”

Board concludes probe into allegations of cheating; says students will get full marks for those questions

However, the investigation confirmed that some questions from three exam papers were leaked before the exam was taken.
These included one question from AS & A Level Mathematics Paper 12, two from AS & A Level Mathematics Paper 42 and one from AS & A Level Computer Science Paper 22.
However, in all three cases, Cambridge found no evidence that the whole paper had been circulated in advance.
Fair results
The statement said the three papers will be marked as usual, but in order to ensure fair results and neutralise any advantage gained by those who got the questions in advance, the leaked questions will be discounted.
“We will give full marks to all candidates for those questions. This approach will tend to push candidates’ total marks upwards and this will be acco­unted for when we announce results.”
This would ensure that any advantage gained by candida­tes who saw the leaked questi­ons is removed and ensure the final grades are “accurate and reliable,” the press release stated.
“This remedy also avoids the potential anxiety associated with candidates having to resit exams and waiting longer for results.”
The investigation has also “uncovered the source of the leak” and the board is taking action against those who stole the papers.
Uzma Yousuf, Cambridge country director for Pakistan, said the board “shares the anger, frustration and disappointment felt by many that these leaks have occurred”.
“Dishonest people have stolen our question papers, and the main victims of this theft are young people who suffered considerable anxiety and distress at an important time,” she said. 
Dr Anthony Dawson, the dir­ector of Assessment Standards, said the remedy provided by the board will ensure that students who didn’t get the paper in advance are treated fairly.

According to police, a man, identified as Adnan, was arrested on charges of killing his two brothers some time ago over a property dispute. The accused was the adopted son of the victims’ father.
Police said Adnan had murdered his two brothers around six months ago, buried their bodies in the backyard of the house, rented the house out, and informed his parents that they were missing. They said the accused’s former wife had informed the police about the murder of the two brothers.
During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime, admitting he killed his two brothers due to a property dispute, as he did not want to sha­re the inheritance with them.
 
 

In another incident in Dera Murad Jamali, armed men opened fire on a car, killing two people on the spot. Police said the assailants fled the scene after the attack.
Law enforcement officials rushed to the site after receiving information and shifted the bodies to a hospital.
In another firing incident, unidentified gunmen killed a man outside a sessions court in Sariab area. The victim was identified as Mushtaq Ahmed. According to police, he was allegedly murdered over a property dispute.

Chairing a high-level meeting on nat­ional health affairs, the prime  minister praised the Ministry of National Hea­lth Services for its  proactive approa­­ch under Federal Min­ister Syed Mustafa Kamal.  
“Providing the best possible healthcare facilities to the pe­­ople remains the governme­n­t’s top priority,” PM Shehbaz said, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.
The directives are part of a zero-tolerance policy on hea­l­­th sector violations, with the prime minister calling for stri­ngent oversight mechanisms.

Urges global solidarity and peaceful solutions for refugees on World Refugee Day

PM Shehbaz directed the creation of a collaborative roadmap with welfare organisations and the private sector to improve health services in Islamabad. 
“In order to meet internati­onal standards, Pakistani pha­­rmaceutical companies are se­­eking accreditation from the WHO. It would not only enh­ance the quality of local medicines but also open doors to export opportunities,” he said.
The prime minister stressed that there could be “no compromise on the quality of medical education” and ordered third-party validation of all medical colleges in Pakistan. 
He also called for a comprehensive review of the nursing sector to strengthen its capacity and service delivery. 
“No political interference would be tolerated in the implementation of health reforms,” PM Shehbaz said, promising a merit-based and transparent approach.
Officials briefed the premier that the entire process for registering medicines and medical devices is being digitised and will be completed by the end of next month, reducing the registration timeline from one year to just three months.
Efforts to operationalise new Health Units, Blood Centres, and the IHITC in Islamabad are underway with philanthropist support.
World Refugee Day
Separately, in his message on World Refugee Day, PM Shehbaz said conflicts are the primary driver of forced displacement and called for peaceful resolution through diplomacy.
“Conflict, being the primary driver of forcibly displaced and refugee situations, must be stopped, prevented and resolved with dialogue and diplomacy paving the way for international peace and security,” the prime minister said.
He highlighted Pakistan’s role in hosting millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, despite limited international support.
“By opening our home and hearts, the people of Pakistan have demonstrated exemplary hospitality towards their Afghan sisters and brothers,” he said, adding that Pakistan provided them access to education and healthcare.
“On the World Refugees Day let us recommit ourselves to the core values of humanity, compassion and international cooperation,” PM Shehbaz said. “The return of the refugees to their beloved homeland was the best and most durable solution that we must collectively strive to achieve.”

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation hit a new high in 2024 and averaged, over the last decade, a record 53.6 billion tonnes per year — that is 100,000 tonnes per minute — of CO2 or its equivalent in other gases, they reported in a peer-reviewed update.
Earth’s surface temperature last year breached 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels for the first time, and the additional CO2 humanity can emit with a two-thirds chance of staying under that threshold long-term — our 1.5C  “carbon budget” — will be exhausted in two years, they calculated.
 
 

Investment in clean energy outpaced investment in oil, gas and coal last year two-to-one, but fossil fuels account for more than 80 per cent of global energy consumption, and growth in renewables still lags behind new demand.
Included in the 2015 Paris climate treaty as an aspirational goal, the 1.5C limit has since been validated by science as necessary for avoiding a catastrophically climate-addled world. The hard cap on warming to which nearly 200 nations agreed was  “well below” two degrees, commonly interpreted to mean 1.7C to 1.8C.
With the 1.5C level now expected to be breached in the coming years,  “we are already in crunch time for these higher levels of warming,” co-author Joeri Rogelj, a professor of climate science and policy at Imperial College London, told journalists in a briefing. “The next three or four decades is pretty much the timeline over which we expect a peak in warming to happen.”
‘The wrong direction’
No less alarming than record heat and carbon emissions is the gathering pace at which these and other climate indicators are shifting, according to the study, published in Earth System Science Data.
Human-induced warming increased over the last decade at a rate  “unprecedented in the instrumental record”, and well above the 2010-2019 average registered in the UN’s most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, in 2021. The new findings — led by the same scientists using essentially the same methods — are intended as an authoritative albeit unofficial update of the benchmark IPCC reports underpinning global climate diplomacy.
They should be taken as a reality check by policymakers, the authors suggested.
“If you look at this year’s update, things are all moving in the wrong direction,” said lead author Piers Forster, head of the University of Leed’s Priestley Centre for Climate Futures.
The rate at which sea levels have shot up in recent years is also alarming, the scientists said. After creeping up, on average, well under two millimetres per year from 1901 to 2018, global oceans have risen 4.3 mm annually since 2019.
What happens next?
An increase in the ocean watermark of 23 centimetres (nine inches) over the last 125 years has been enough to imperil many small island states and hugely amplify the destructive power of storm surges worldwide.

Since the start of the current fiscal year in July 2024 to March 2025, education expenditure fell by 29 per cent. The percentage of GDP spent on education has fallen consisten­tly since 2018 when it was 2pc to 0.8pc, according to the latest Pakistan Economic Survey.
The UN-backed Incheon Declaration recommends that governments allocate 4pc to 6pc of their GDP to education.
The INGO says Pakistan needs urgent investment to get 26m children into school. In 2024, the government said it aimed to increase the education budget to 4pc of GDP by 2029. The government cannot break that promise to Pakistan’s children.“

Save the Children says more than one in three kids out of school

“Children in the poorest areas of Pakistan will be hit the hardest, and these are children who already face enormous hurdles to stay in schools. With these cuts, those hurdles have got even higher, the NGO said.
Children in Pakistan urgently need more funding from international donors to be able to rebuild their communities in a way that withstand future climate shocks. Save the Children is calling on all stakeholders, governments, donors, and civil society organisations to urgently invest in education in Pakistan, especially for marginalised and climate-impacted children.
 
 

Education in Pakistan is free and compulsory for all children aged five to 16 but a total of 38pc of school age children are out of school, with more girls than boys not attending classes. In Balochistan, 75pc of girls are missing out on education.
The organisation said that PM Shehbaz Sharif had declared an education emergency in May last year to increase school attendance, with only 60pc of people in the country able to read or write.
As well as missing vital education, being out of school increases the risk of children being forced into work and early marriage. Nearly one in 10 children aged 10 to 14 are working in Pakistan, according to government data from 2021, and an estimated 19m girls are married before their eighteenth birthday — the sixth highest number of child brides globally.
Schools in Pakistan have been affected repeatedly by closures, many driven by climate fueled emergencies such as heatwaves in 2024, which shuttered classrooms for about half of all school age children, and catastrophic flooding in 2022, which disrupted learning for about 2.9m children.
Country Director for Save the Children Pakistan, Khuram Gondal, said: “When a government spends less than one per cent of the GDP on education, it’s not just cutting spending, it is contradicting the prime minister’s commitment to tackling the education emergency in Pakistan and get children into school.
“Education is one of the most powerful tools to break generational poverty — investing in children is investing in Pakistan’s future,” he said.

The decision follows a report submitted by the Ministry of Law and Justice, which argued against judicial oversight of pending legislation.
According to the order by Justice Jawad Hassan, the eight-member committee, chaired by the Federal Secretary for Law and Justice, will include representatives from the provincial law secretariats, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), the National Commission on the Status of Women, the Pakistan Bar Council, the Federal Ombuds­per­son Secretariat, and Prof Muham­mad Mushtaq, chairman of the Law Department at Shifa Tameer-i-Millat University.
The Ministry of Law and Justice has opposed judicial intervention in legislative processes, asserting that existing constitutional bodies — including the CII, parliamentary committees and ministries — already ensure laws comply with Islamic principles (Articles 227-228) and constitutional safeguards. It warned that pre-legislative judicial review could “undermine the democratic process”.
However, the court directed that the panel would evaluate proposed amendments for constitutional co­­mpliance (Articles 2A, 20, 25, 227), alignment with Islamic injunctions (guided by the CII), gender justice in line with Pakistan’s Cedaw (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) obligations, and the practical enforceability of property rights clauses.
 
 

The committee must hold public consultations, analyse international models (e.g., Malaysia’s Islamic Family Law), draft court procedure reforms, and propose gender-sensitivity training for judges. Its first meeting is scheduled for June 24, with a report to be submitted under the “Doctrine of Continuing Mandamus”.
The case, Mst Saima Shafi vs. Additional District Judge, centres on amendments proposed by the amicus curiae (friend of the court) Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, seeking to introduce “husband’s asset”, “matrimonial asset” and “wife’s asset” clauses into the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance.
The court earlier expressed concerns about ensuring the amendments’ conformity with Islamic and constitutional principles.
The committee’s recommendations, including dissenting opinions, will be presented to the LHC for further directives.
Additional Attorney General Haseeb Shakoor Paracha will coordinate with amici curiae Barrister Faiza Asad, Huma Ejaz Zaman and Adil Chattha as special invitees.
Justice Jawad Hassan emphasised transparency and ordered the public release of meeting summaries (excluding sensitive debates).

• Approve new taxes on high-value pensions, athletes
• Govt asked to reveal terms of IMF’s resilience facility
ISLAMABAD: The parliamentary committees on Thursday rejected the government’s proposal to impose a carbon levy on petroleum products, terming it an undue burden on the public, whereas the finance minister stressed that “the era of tax exemptions and amnesty schemes is over”.
However, they approved new taxes on high-value pensions and the income of international athletes.
The carbon levy became a focal point as the Senate and National Assembly Standing Committees on Finance and Revenue held simultaneous sessions at Parliament House for a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025-26.
Chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla and MNA Naveed Qamar, respectively, both panels proposed several amendments and struck down a number of measures. The Senate concluded its deliberations on the proposed tax provisions on Thursday.
The debate revolved around whether the measure should be classified as a levy or a tax, its revenue potential and provincial share, and whether its purpose is genuinely another tool for the federal government to raise additional funds.
Senator Sherry Rehman firmly distinguished bet­w­een fiscal instruments, stating there is a significant diff­erence between a carbon levy and a carbon tax. Carbon levies are not stan­dard practice, she said, add­ing that it is carbon taxes that are typically imposed.
She argued that such a measure cannot be introduced through the Finance Bill, calling instead for dedicated legislation.
Senator Shibli Faraz criticised the move as contradictory. “On the one hand, the government highlights climate change; on the other, it introduces a levy. This is not a carbon levy — it is more like extortion,” he said.
Senator Mohsin Aziz cited the Supreme Court ruling in the Zafar Iqbal Jhagra case, stating that “under that decision, a carbon levy cannot be imposed. Doing so may constitute contempt of court.” He also raised concerns over unchecked fuel smuggling from Iran.
Sherry Rehman stressed that carbon taxes are usually applied to specific industries with targeted environmental goals, not levied directly on the general population. “You are burdening ordinary men and women while labelling it climate finance,” she said.
“Our party’s position is clear. Such a levy cannot be implemented through the Finance Bill,” Ms Rehman clarified. Senator Faisal Vawda also opposed the carbon levy, terming it an undue burden on the general public.
MNA Syed Naveed Qamar also sought clarity on the projected revenue from the proposed carbon levy. In response, finance ministry officials said the measure is expected to generate Rs45 billion in fiscal year 2025-26.
Mr Qamar further questioned how much of that amount would accrue to the federal government if the levy is redefined as a tax. State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani clarified, “If it is converted into a carbon tax, the federal government would receive Rs18bn”.
To this, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb asked, “Where did this carbon tax proposal come from?” Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial resp­onded, “The matter surfaced earlier in the Senate Standing Commi­ttee on Finance.”
MNA Dr Mirza Ikhtiar Baig offered a key clarification: “If it remains a levy, the entire amount will go to the federal government. But if it becomes a tax, then the provinces will also be entitled to a share.”
Senator Mandviwalla asked for details on the specific use of those funds, while Senator Sherry Rehman demanded that “the government disclose the full terms of the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) agreement”.
Surcharge cap removal
Meanwhile, the Senate parliamentary committee rejected the surcharge cap removal on the plea that it would escalate costs for energy consumers. The committee also rejected the proposed tiered levies on small vehicles.
However, the committee approved proposals to tax annual pensions exceeding Rs10 million, withdraw income tax exemptions for international athletes and extend tax holidays for economic and special technology zones.
The National Assembly’s committee also deliberated on the government’s proposal to impose a 10 per cent sales tax on solar products. Mr Qamar said that the government has agreed to lower the sales tax rate from the proposed 18pc to 10pc on solar panels.
The FBR chairman said that parliament must take the final decision; once it does, the tax authority will implement the required amendment.
MNA Mubeen Arif remarked that if the Senate has recommended a 10pc rate, the National Assem­bly committee should push for a further reduction. Mr Qamar clarified that the recommendation did not come from the Senate but originated within the NA committee itself.
Provisions relating to fraud were deferred for further deliberation, and the Finance Bill was held over for reconsideration at the next meeting.
The committee recommended reviewing the Ex­­port Finance Scheme for raw cotton and suggested aligning taxes on local cotton production with those on imported cotton.
New energy vehicle adoption
Members also discussed the New Energy Vehicle Adoption Levy Act, 2025, and noted the lack of a comprehensive plan for transitioning to electric vehicles, citing the scarcity of charging stations.
It was further noted that hybrid vehicles have not been included in the proposed measures. Given these concerns, the committee decided to defer consideration of the matter until the next meeting, with directions to the ministry to present a comprehensive and actionable plan for the implementation of the objectives outlined in the proposed Finance Bill.
The committee also considered the proposed amendments to the Stamp Act. During detailed deliberations, it was observed that the term non-filer is being used in the proposed amendment, even though this category has been removed from the applicable laws. In light of this inconsistency, the committee decided to defer consideration of the amendment until the next meeting.
Tax amnesty scheme
Finance Minister Aurangzeb said that there will be no more tax exemptions or tax amnesty schemes. He said the era of tax exemptions and amnesty schemes is over. “We are now focused on expanding the tax net, and that process is actively underway,” he added.
The committee’s debate underscored deep concerns over tax compliance, as the FBR proposed stringent enforcement measures — barring unregistered individuals from operating bank accounts and disconnecting utilities for non-compliant Tier-1 retailers — while acknowledging systemic gaps, with only 35,000 of 300,000 industrial units registered for sales tax.
 
 

Lawmakers weighed punitive amendments to Section 14AC against the practical risk of overreach. While MNA Javed Hanif endorsed the tougher stance, others like Shar­mila Faruqi urged a shift towards incentives rather than penalties.
Opposition leader Omar Ayub questioned how many connections had actually been cut for non-filers, warning that excessive powers for tax officers could be counterproductive.
The FBR chief acknowledged evasion tactics and stressed the need for enhanced powers, while assuring that deterrents such as bank account fre­ezes would be temporary.

She was speaking at a ceremony to mark a major milestone — Pakistan surpassing 200 million telecom subscribers, including 150m broadband users and over 2m fibre-to-home subscribers.
Organised by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the event highlighted the country’s accelerating digital growth. Senior executives from Jazz, Telenor, Ufone, Zong, and SCO were in attendance. To celebrate the achievement, all mobile users will receive 2GB of free data and 200 on-net minutes, valid for 24 hours on Friday (June 20). Subscribers can activate the offer by dialing *2200#.
To promote digital inclusion — particularly among female students — the PTA, in collaboration with PTCL, Transworld, Nayatel, Cybernet, and Wateen, is deploying free Wi-Fi hotspots for six months at selected HEC-recognised universities, including women-only institutions, to enhance access to online learning resources.

Free data and on-net minutes on offer only for today

As part of the celebrations, mobile phone manufacturers have donated 200 locally assembled smartphones, which will be distributed among female SIM owners through computerised balloting across Pakistan, including AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan.
 
 

While the total number of SIMs issued has reached 200 million, the teledensity has remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from 81.4 per cent in June 2023 to 81.21pc in June.
In contrast, broadband penetration has shown significant growth, increasing from 53.6pc in June 2023 to 60.8pc by June 2025.
PTA officials also reported progress in closing the mobile internet gender gap, with women now accounting for 38pc of mobile internet users, up from 25pc last year. Moreover, over 36 mobile device manufacturing companies are operating in the country, and approximately 136 million handsets have been locally manufactured or assembled since 2019, including 37pc smartphones.

One of the key targets under the policy is to ensure that electric vehicles account for 30 per cent of all new vehicles sold in the country by 2030.
This transition is projected to save 2.07 billion litres of fuel annually, resulting in nearly $1bn in foreign exchange savings. Additionally, the policy aims to reduce carbon emissions by 4.5 million tonnes and cut healthcare-related costs by $405m each year.
Addressing a news conference, Special Assistant to the Prime Mi­­nister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said the new EV policy is in line with the premier’s vision of promoting clean, sustainable and affordable transport while boosting local industry and protecting the environment.
He emphasised that the transport sector is a major source of carbon emissions in Pakistan and urgently needs reform.
Mr Akhtar announced that an initial subsidy of Rs9bn has been allocated for the fiscal year 2025-26, under which 116,053 electric bikes and 3,171 electric rickshaws will be facilitated. Besides, 25pc of this subsidy is reserved for women to provide them with safe, affordable and eco-friendly mobility.
He said a fully digital platform has also been introduced to ensure transparent online application, verification and disbursement of subsidies.
 
 

Furthermore, the policy outlines the installation of 40 new EV charging stations on motorways, with an average distance of 105 kilometres between them.
The policy also includes the introduction of battery swapping systems, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes and mandatory integration of EV charging points in new building codes to facilitate wider adoption in urban areas.
Currently, over 90pc of parts for two- and three-wheelers are already manufactured locally and to encourage local manufacturing, incentives are being provided to domestic producers.
The government will also introduce special support packages for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to further boost localisation.
He also highlighted that locally produced goods were 30-40pc cheaper than imported alternatives. In the two-wheeler segment alone, more than 90pc of parts are now produced locally.
The Auto Industry Development and Export Policy will remain in place until 2026 and will be phased out gradually by 2030, he added.
The PM’s special assistant noted that the policy was developed through consultations with over 60 experts, institutions and industry stakeholders, guided by a steering committee under the Ministry of Industries and Production since September 2024.
 
 

The committee will hold monthly and quarterly review meetings, while the auditor general of Pakistan will conduct a performance audit every six months.
He stressed that the NEV Policy 2025-30 is not only an environmental revolution but also a foundation for industrial growth, local employment, energy efficiency and technological self-reliance in the country.
The policy is expected to yield savings of around Rs800bn over the next 24-25 years through reduced fuel imports, the use of cheap electricity and revenue from carbon credits. Charging vehicles with electricity will also reduce capacity payments from Rs174bn to Rs105bn, and carbon credits could generate around Rs15bn in revenue.
The country’s total energy demand for EVs over the next five years is projected at 126 terawatt-hours, which can be met using the existing surplus in the national grid.
He added that an electric rickshaw or bike user is expected to recover their initial investment within a year and 10 months due to the low cost of charging compared to petrol.
For instance, if the additional cost of an electric bike is Rs150,000, this can be recouped within less than two years through fuel savings.
Mr Khan concluded by saying that the government has also provided exemptions on customs duties and sales tax on EV parts to support the local industry.

The bench’s term was due to expire this month.
Under the 26th Amendment, a seven-judge constitutional bench was constituted on Nov 5, 2024, for an initial period of 60 days. The bench comprised Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Moha­mmad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. In December, its tenure was extended by six months.
In February, the bench was expanded to 13 members with the inclusion of Justices Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.
The JCP held two meetings on Thursday. The agenda for the first session included considering the extension of the CB’s term and deciding on a policy for drafting rules to set up effective standards for the annual performance evaluation of high court judges under Article 175A(20) of the Constitution.
In the second session, the JCP reviewed the term and composition of the CB of the Sindh High Court.
During its first meeting on Thursday, the JCP approved, by majority vote, an extension of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench until the end of November this year.
The commission, by majority, extended the term for a further six months from July 23, nominating Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry and Justice Jaffar Raza, while replacing Justice Agha Faisal and Justice Sana Akram Minhas.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi also formed a broad-based committee to evaluate the judicial performance of judges across all high courts. The committee, which includes representatives from the judiciary, parliament, the executive and the legal fraternity, will prepare draft rules for the annual performance evaluation of high court judges.
Subsequently, the JCP issued a fresh agenda to hold another session next month to consider the appointment of chief justices for the high courts of Islamabad, Sindh, Peshawar and Balochistan.

GAZA: A massive cloud of smoke rises after an Israeli strike in the Jabalia area in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.—AFP

• 21 of them killed trying to reach aid distribution points
• Military resorts to gunfire, tank shelling and bombs
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 72 people on Thursday, including 21 who had gathered near aid distribution sites as famine looms after more than 20 months of war.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that six people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 15 others in a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, where thousands of Palestinians have gathered daily in the hope of receiving food rations.
The Israeli army told AFP that its troops in Netzarim corridor — a strip of land militarised by Israel that bisects the Palestinian territory — had fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them, but that it was “not aware of any injured individuals”.
The army did not comment on the incident reported in the south.
In northern Gaza, Bassal said that nine separate Israeli strikes killed another 51 people, updating earlier tolls provided by his agency.
Bassam Abu Shaar, who witnessed the shooting incident in the Netzarim area, said thousands of people had gathered there overnight in the hope of receiving aid at the US- and Israeli-backed distribution site when it opened in the morning.
“Around 1:00am (2200 GMT Wednesday), they started shooting at us,” he told AFP by phone, reporting gunfire, tank shelling and bombs dropped by drones.
Abu Shaar said that the size of the crowd had made it impossible for people to escape, with casualties left lying on the ground within walking distance of the distribution point, which is run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
“We couldn’t help them or even escape ourselves,” he said.
 
 

At least 300 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while trying to reach aid distribution points in Gaza, which is suffering from famine-like conditions, the territory’s health ministry has said.
Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by rescuers and authorities in the Palestinian territory.
In early March, Israel imposed an aid blockade on Gaza amid a deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May.
After Israel loosened its blockade, the privately run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began distributing aid, but its operations have been marred by chaotic scenes.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation — which has the support of Israel and its ally the United States — over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
On Wednesday, the head of a UN inquiry said that the use of GHF to distribute food in the Palestinian territory is “outrageous”. “In every war, the siege and starvation surely leads to death,” Navi Pillay, who chairs the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Israel and the Palestinian territories, told journalists.
“But this initiative of what’s called a foundation, a private foundation, to supply food, is what I see as outrageous, because it involves the United States itself, the government, and it turns out, as we watch daily, that people who go to those centres are being killed as they seek food.”
Pillay said the commission would “have to look into… the policy purpose and how it’s being effected.
“We have to spell out what is the motive of, right now, the killing of people who are coming for humanitarian aid from this so-called foundation — and that lives are being lost just in trying to secure food for their children.”
The UN humanitarian office OCHA said that its humanitarian partners, including the World Food Programme (WFP), pointed out fuel in Gaza was reaching “critically low levels”.
“Without immediate resupply, essential services — including the provision of clean water — will grind to a halt very soon,” it added.

Exercising the right of reply during the ‘Interactive Dialogue on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ Annual Report’ in Geneva on Wednesday, Pakistan’s representative, Muneeb Ahmed, rejected India’s allegations, stressing that New Delhi had blamed Pakistan without evidence. He said India had dismissed calls for an independent and impartial investigation and ignored international appeals for restraint.
The dialogue formed part of the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council.
“Even before its own investigation authorities put out a public call for evidence, India intensified its oppression against the people of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Even worse, India carried out deliberate and unjustifiable military strikes on civilians, residences, and places of worship in Pakistan,” Mr Ahmed said.
 
 


New Delhi following ‘beaten path’ of invoking terrorism for geopolitical motives, says envoy

He noted that India’s reservations to common Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) regarding the right to self-determination served as a pretext for denying this fundamental right.
It underlies the Indian occupation of Jammu and Kashmir as well as numerous other territories and is reflected in the large number of movements against New Delhi’s yoke, he said, adding, “But India is following a beaten path of invoking terrorism for geopolitical motives.”
Resolving the Jammu and Kashmir remains key to lasting peace and prosperity in South Asia and is the best safeguard against future human rights abuses, he said.
“The territory of Jammu and Kashmir is not, has never been and will never be a so-called integral part of India. It remains an internationally recognised disputed territory until the people of Jammu and Kashmir exercise their inalienable right to self-determination in accordance with numerous UN Security Council resolutions,” Mr Ahmed said.
Pakistan is ready to discuss Indian support for the menace of terrorism along Pakistan’s western borders, and unlike India, “we have the evidence to engage in a substantive conversation”, he added.
“Rather than blaming Pakistan or Muslims, we urge India to revisit its Hindutva supremacist pursuit of hegemony, uphold the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination, and, importantly, behave like a normal country at peace with itself and its neighbours,” he said.

In a written statement on fiscal risks placed before parliament, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal divided these risks into seven categories — macroeconomic, revenue, debt, SOEs, climate change, natural disasters, and other contingent liabilities — and quantified their possible impact on fiscal deficit.
They suggested mitigation measures in case one or more of these risks materialise during 2025-26.
According to the statement, the macroeconomic risks arise from slower-than-expected GDP growth, inflation shocks, and exchange rate volatility. “A one percentage point slowdown in GDP growth could reduce government revenues due to lower tax collection and increase exp­enditures on automatic stabilisers such as social safety net programmes,” it said.

Inflation, debt servicing, inefficient SOEs and climate disasters seen as major hurdles

The combined effect of slower than targeted economic growth, inflation sho­cks and exchange rate variation could widen the fiscal deficit by roughly 0.13pc of GDP in FY26. This is important given that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has been given a collection target of Rs14.13 trillion for next year and in view of a record Rs1.161tr shortfall during the current fiscal year on a budget target of Rs12.97tr.
“Inflation spikes and currency depreciation may further strain public finan­ces, though these effects are more challenging to quantify precisely,” it said.
Revenue collection faces hurdles
Talking about revenue risks, the statement said the revenue collection remained vulnerable to lower tax buoyancy, slower economic growth, and underperformance in key sources. 
“Should tax revenues grow at only half the anticipated rate, the fiscal deficit could increase by 0.4pc of GDP.” 
Additional revenue risks include a potential 30pc decline in State Bank profits transferred to the government, which alone could widen the deficit by 0.32pc of GDP, and a 20pc shortfall in petroleum levy collections, increasing the deficit by about 0.2pc.
The government has set a Rs2.4tr target from SBP profits for the next fiscal, slightly lower than Rs2.62tr for this year on the back of historically high interest rates.  Petroleum levy is projected at Rs1.47tr for the next fiscal, up from Rs1.28tr budget target for current year, missed by Rs121bn to Rs1.16tr. 
“These factors indicate the government’s reliance on volatile revenue streams and the importance of improving tax administration and compliance,” the statement said.
It also pointed out that debt servicing costs represented a significant fiscal vulnerability. A two-percentage point increase in domestic interest rates and a one percentage point rise in external interest rates could lead to higher interest payments, raising the fiscal deficit by an estimated 0.42pc of GDP. 
Loss-making SOEs
According to the statement, SOEs posed fiscal risks through potential shortfalls in dividend payments and increased government support. A decline in SOE dividends by 6.1pc relative to projections could add around 0.02pc of GDP to the deficit. 
Increased government financial support to SOEs, amounting to 1.5pc of GDP, could exacerbate the fiscal gap by a margin of 0.4pc.
In contrast, the more severe scenario anticipates lower short-term fiscal impact, but greater long-term costs due to increased frequency and severity of climate-related disasters. 
These projections highlight the growing fiscal burden of climate adaptation and mitigation policies.
Likewise, natural disasters represent the largest fiscal risk identified in the statement. “Without dedicated disaster risk financing mechanisms, an average disaster event could increase the fiscal deficit by as much as 1.03pc of GDP,” it said. 
However, with effective disaster risk financing tools such as catastrophe bonds or insurance funds, this impact could be reduced to about 0.44pc per cent of GDP.
