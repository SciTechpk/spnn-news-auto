<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/120059137bcd00a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948219/violent-clashes-erupt-along-pak-afghan-border-friendly-countries-urge-restraint' target='_blank'><strong>Violent clashes erupt along Pak-Afghan border; friendly countries urge restraint</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday night lauded the security forces after the Pakistan Army responded to unprovoked attacks by Afghan Taliban forces on border posts. Clashes between the two sides were reported in multiple areas along the Pak-Afghan border.
“Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” said the interior minister in a post on X.
“Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.”
 






Earlier, security sources confirmed that Pakistani forces deployed at the international border “targeted several Afghan border posts”.  There are reports of significant damage inflicted on multiple Afghan posts and militant formations, security officials added.
Artillery, tanks, light and heavy weapons were used in the retaliatory action, said security forces. Afghan forces targeted Pakistani posts at Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, and Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baramcha in Balochistan.
 






The clashes broke out after Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on the Afghan capital earlier this week, according to Taliban border forces.
“In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces“, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”, the Afghan military said in a statement earlier.
Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — confirmed the clashes.
Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul “to stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on its soil”.
Security sources said “several Afghan soldiers were killed” and militant formations were forced to retreat due to the “effective and intense retaliation by Pakistani forces”. It elaborated that Afghan posts failed to provide covering fire to the militants and there are reports of “heavy losses” among Afghan border posts and militants.
“Kharijites and Daesh hideouts inside Afghanistan, operating under the patronage of the interim Afghan government, are being effectively targeted. Pakistan is using artillery, tanks, light, and heavy weapons. In addition, air resources and drones are also being used to target Daesh and kharijite hideouts. The headquarters of Afghan forces, which have been sheltering Daesh and Fitna al-Khawarij, are also being targeted.”
 






In a series of posts on X, the state broadcaster issued the following statement quoting security sources: “Unprovoked firing from the Afghan side at Pak-Afghan border,a strong ,intense response from Pakistan Army. Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral, and Baramcha (Balochistan).”
    


It said Pakistan was currently “targeting terrorist camps and hideouts of khawarij, ISIS located near the Pak-Afghan border inside Afghanistan with great precision. Afghan forces have retreated from several areas”.
 


The Afghan Ministry of Defence confirmed earlier that Afghan forces launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight.
“The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement.
Infiltration attempts in Pishin, Zhob
Pakistani posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan force opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said.
He added that Afghan border posts were destroyed and casualties were taken by the other side. “Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours.”
Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate in Pishin and Zhob districts, however the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area.
 






Calls for restraint
Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes.
“Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal, expressed concern at the skirmishes.
“The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region.
“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.”
 






Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that help to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability.
The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries.
 






Deterioration in bilateral relations
The past week saw heightened tensions, with both sides exchanging sharp statements. Pakistan suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021.
Speaking about the Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it.
Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters.
The Foreign Office had avoided directly acknowledging strikes in Kabul, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-11 22:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1114332066cb40d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948134/tlp-protesters-set-up-overnight-camp-in-muridke-dozens-injured-during-clashes' target='_blank'><strong>TLP protesters set up overnight camp in Muridke; dozens injured during clashes</strong></a><br><p>Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) supporters have camped at Muridke for the night as they continued attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’.
Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road.
Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers.
TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted
them with rocks, AFP journalists saw.
Arrests in Karachi
Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC).
Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar.
A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police.
‘Cleared them from Lahore’
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property.
“We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer.
He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.”
Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.”
Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG.
Punjab Police question TLP’s motives
Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields.
“A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement.
“It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added.
 






The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza.
“Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.”
Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities.
Residents in twin cities face disruptions
Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions.
Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters.
Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate.
“With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.”
According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.”
“Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added.
Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions.
Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures.
“I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said.
Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day.
“The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that.
Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible.
“Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said.
He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said.
Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages.
Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures.
“All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said.
Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said.
Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification.
It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down.
Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions.
Friday clashes following protest call
As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP, while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently.
The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians.
“We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.
“We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad.
“There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?”
Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”.
“We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

“As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,” the spokesperson said.
In May, the 82-year-old ex-president’s office announced that Biden had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that spread to his bones after he experienced urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was found.
“Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places,” Biden, whose son Beau Biden died of cancer in 2015, said at the time in a post on X. “Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.“
 






Biden’s health had been in the spotlight due to a new book detailing his declining health as he campaigned last year for a second presidential term against Donald Trump.
In July 2024, Biden announced he was dropping out of the race after a disastrous debate performance against Trump and endorsed his vice president Kamala Harris for the presidency. She went on to lose to Trump, who began his second term in January.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, according to the American Cancer Society. It is particularly common in the elderly — around 80 per cent of men over 80 have some cancerous cells in their prostate gland, research has estimated.
While it is highly treatable if discovered early, it is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, the organisation said. Hormone therapy is a common treatment that can shrink tumours and slow cancer growth, but it is not a cure.
Trump, 79, the oldest person ever elected president, underwent his second medical checkup of the year on Friday and his doctor declared him to be in “excellent overall health“.</p><small>2025-10-11 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/112249561607995.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948209/deflecting-responsibility-cant-absolve-afghan-govt-of-obligations-towards-regional-peace-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Deflecting responsibility can’t absolve Afghan govt of obligations towards regional peace: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday night censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during his visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace.
Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about a Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it, saying: “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves.”
He said there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. “If other countries achieve peace themselves as we did in Afghanistan, then there will be peace in the entire region. Since the last eight months, there has not been even a small incident in Afghanistan. In four years, no one has been harmed from Afghanistan’s soil. So this is the best proof that we have presented.”
In a statement issued today, the FO said Pakistan’s strong reservations on the elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement were conveyed to Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan by the additional foreign secretary (West Asia & Afghanistan) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today.
“Pakistan also strongly rejected the Afghan acting foreign minister’s assertion that terrorism is Pakistan’s internal problem,” the FO said, adding that Pakistan had repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan terrorist elements “operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan”.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“It was emphasised that by deflecting the responsibility of controlling terrorism towards Pakistan cannot absolve the Interim Afghan Government of its obligations towards ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,” the FO said.
 






Elaborating on reservations regarding the joint statement, the FO said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The joint statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.”
The FO said that Pakistan had “generously” hosted nearly four million Afghans for over four decades “in the spirit of good neighbourliness and Islamic brotherhood”.
It said that with peace gradually returning to Afghanistan, it was time for unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan to return to their country.
“Like all other countries and in line with international norms and practices, Pakistan has the right to regulate the presence of foreign nationals residing inside its territory. At the same time, along with the repatriation of Afghan nationals, Pakistan has also been generously issuing medical and study visas to address the medical and educational needs of Afghan nationals. In the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good neighbourly relations, Pakistan will continue to extend humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan.”
“Pakistan is desirous of seeing a peaceful, stable, regionally connected and prosperous Afghanistan. Accordingly, Pakistan has extended all possible trade, economic and connectivity facilitation to Afghanistan. Such measures are aimed at promoting cooperation and socio-economic development of the two countries,” the FO added.
At the same time, it said the government had the responsibility to “take all possible measures for the safety and security of its people”.
The FO concluded by saying that Pakistan “expects the interim Afghan government to play its due role in supporting Pakistan to achieve this noble objective by taking concrete measures to prevent its territory from being used” by terrorist elements against Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said earlier that Afghanistan’s export of terrorism would vitiate the atmosphere and cause a fissure in bilateral relations that Pakistan did not desire.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.
Addressing the matter in an interview with Geo News, Asif said: “The terrorism they’re exporting to Pakistan, there will be a fissure created in relations in this environment, which is not our desire. We want our relations to continue respectfully.”
The defence minister also called on people to monitor and take notice of any suspicious activity in their midst and take action as a community against any terrorist facilitators. “If you remain silent due to fear or any other reason, then I think it is understood as agreement.’’
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan.

The moot was held at the Expo Centre in Lahore on Saturday as part of DawnMedia’s ‘Breathe Pakistan’ initiative.
The conference was held with the aim of shedding light on actionable solutions, fostering high-level dialogue, and driving collective action for cleaner air in Pakistan. Sessions covered a broad range of themes, including governance and policy frameworks, financing clean air, smog and industrial responsibility, judicial activism, public health impacts, nationwide air quality standards, and regional cooperation on transboundary pollution.
A press release issued said: “Concluding the event, participants agreed that Pakistan’s fight for clean air must now move from promise to policy and from data to delivery. DawnMedia reaffirmed its commitment to continue convening dialogue through Breathe Pakistan, keeping the spotlight on collective
action for cleaner skies and healthier futures.”
It said the day-long event brought together ministers, superior court judges, and international
experts to discuss solutions for air pollution with Punjab, the province hardest hit by smog,
remaining central to the conversation, “even in the chief minister’s absence”.

6:47pm — Session on the health crisis amid smog
World Health Organisation Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo said breathing clean air was a basic human right.
He said 256,000 people died in Pakistan every year due to air pollution, adding that they were not just numbers but ‘‘brothers, fathers, sisters, mothers, sons’’ who all had unique stories and dreams.
Luo said the impact of air pollution was very real.
‘‘What are we going to do about this? The good news is that it is in our hand.’’
He stressed that air pollution was a threat without borders and had severe impact on the most vulnerable with access to less resources.
‘‘Air pollution does not distinguish between social classes. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. Pakistan faces severe air pollution.’’
Dr. Saima Saeed, director of the Lung Health Programme at Indus Hospital and Health Network, said 60 per cent of patients referred to the hospital for respiratory symptoms had asthma. ’‘There’s a huge burden of respiratory disease due to air pollution,“ she said, adding that various other health-related issues were also caused.
Unicef Representative in Pakistan Pernille Ironside said air pollution was a “direct preventable killer” with children uniquely vulnerable to it. She said the issue had become the number two killer of children worldwide under the age of five.

6:20pm — Pakistan Air Quality Initiative founder Abid Omar
Abid Omar said there was a need to go beyond just the data and talk about what the policies should be.
‘‘Even today in Pakistan and the Punjab government, the policymaking is weak because … the evidence-based policymaking] in more advanced cases is not mature enough.’’

6:09pm — Urban Unit CEO Dr Omar Masud
Questioned whether research was driving interest in policy and if that could be replicated at the national level, Dr Omar Masud said local action was being increasingly driven by monitoring data at the city level.
‘‘We are about to come to a crossroads when it comes to sensor level monitoring. We need cooperation and integration and less competition. We will see more data streams in this season and in coming years that will be telling us of air quality. Now it is up to the government and non-government sector as to how they integrate this data.’’
He said the biggest challenge was in communicating the data to the public.
“Without behavioral change, you can’t tackle the problem of air quality and behavioral change can only come when necessary information is presented in a very cogent way.’’

6:04pm — Dr Naveed Arshad, director of LUMS Energy Institute
Questioned about how institutions were informing policy about major sectors, Dr Naveed Arshad said the LUMS Energy Institute looked at the whole energy ecosystem and mapped it to the challenges being faced in the country before going to the government for policy advocacy.
He said the goal’s institute was to help achieve implementation of policies and solutions.

6pm — Session on developing National Air Quality Management Framework
Climate and sustainability expert Dawar Butt said there were initiative from the federal and provincial governments that showed they understood the importance of pollution.
He said air pollution really started to become a problem again for Pakistan in 2012 when the country’s supply of natural gas ran out.

5:53pm — Shazia Rafi, president and convenor of AirQualityAsia
AirQualityAsia president Shazia Rafia said in a video message that air pollution was a silent killer and an accelerator of climate change.
‘‘All air pollution is transboundary as the air knows no borders, it is visible from space.’’

5:31pm — Nazifa Butt, director of climate action and sustainability at WWF-Pakistan
WWF-Pakistan director Nazifa Butt said Karachi, Dhaka, Lahore and New Delhi were all cities that were facing challenges of extreme weather conditions and climate impact.
She said populations were growing and that would need more energy and thus more burning of fossil fuels. ‘‘We are all sitting in a geographic zone that is very risky in terms of development, economic growth and climatic impacts.’’
Butt said among the main drivers of air pollution in South Asia were rapid urbanisation and industrial growth, vehicular emissions and crop residue burning.
She also pointed to a lack of political will, poor governance and lack of infrastructure to tackle air pollution.
“We are asking for a plan for the government to step forward and build their own capacity first.’’
Butt called for legally binding climate treaties and setting of targets to reduce and control emissions.

5:15pm — Aban Marker Kabraji, senior regional adviser for climate and environment to the regional director of UNEP Asia-Pacific
UN official Aban Marker Kabraji said the messaging that Dawn had brought forth in technical understanding of the issue, along with the convening power and influencing, was “remarkable’’ along with consistency and commitment to tackle the issue of air pollution again and again.
She said 99 per cent of the population breathes polluted air and air pollution caused over 100,000 premature deaths annually with Lahore, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Karachi among the top 10 most polluted cities in the world.
Kabraji said the Indus-Ganges Plain was one of the most polluted parts of the world in air quality with Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, all 3 countries, impacted.
She proposed UN facilitation promoting regional air quality dialogue on shared airshed management, joint residue management and farmers incentives in Punjab and Haryan and lastly, data sharing and harmonisation.
Kabraji said the way forward lay in scaling up low-cost air quality monitoring, integrating air quality targets in NDC revision (2025), mobilising climate and private finance, regional cooperation for emission alerts and citizen engagement through youth-led air monitoring apps.

5:05pm — Sri Lanka MP Harshana Rajakaruna suggests regional strategy to tackle pollution
Sri Lanka MP Harshana Rajakaruna thanked the conference organisers for holding the event to address a problem that “crosses borders as easily as the wind”.
He said Sri Lankans also had concerns about pollution. He added the country had witnessed spikes in poor air quality linked to poor local sources and longrange transport from neighbouring regions.
Rajakaruna mentioned the problems that his own country faced in encountering and tackling pollution.
‘‘The human consequences of inaction are grave. Poor air quality shortens life expectancy, increases hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disease, undermines children’s lung development and school attendance and reduces worker productivity.’’
He said the above issues were not confined to environmental briefs but emergencies related to public health, economics and social justice.
The lawmaker outlined a three-pronged approach for the region to tackle the issue: create a regional monitoring and data sharing network with transparent real-time data accessible to governments, scientists and the public; coordinated policy and enforceemnt across borders and thirdly, mobilising finance, technology and capacity through international partnerships.
He also underlined two matters of political importance. ’’Diplomacy matters. Environmental diplomacy is not a secondary concern, it is central to regional stability and shared prosperity,“ he said, adding that regional associations and global forums should be used to build an architecture of cooperation on air and marine quality.
‘‘Justice matters. Small islands and coastal communities should not be the unwilling recipients of other states’ pollution. Where possible, we should negotiate responsibility sharing mechanisms, including technical support, funding for mitigation and remediation assistance.’’
He commended Pakistan for taking decisive steps to place clear air on the national agenda and convening forums such as Breathe Pakistan to foster regional dialogue.
‘‘The leadership shown here in policy, public engagement and industrial innovation set an example and opens space for cooperation and action across South Asia. Sri Lanka extends its solidarity with Pakistan’s effort and stands ready to work in partnership.’’
He also proposed the formation of a regional task force with scientists, officials and civil society representatives to short a draft memorandum of understanding that outlines shared monitoring protocols, emergency notification procedures and a plan for joint capacity building.
’’Pollution that begins across borders can end lives here at home. The air we breathe and the seas that sustain our livelihoods are common goods. Protecting them demands compassion, solidarity and practical cooperation.
‘‘Let us seize this moment not for rhetoric but real measurable action for the health of our children, for the resillience of our economies and for dignity of our coastal communities. Sri Lanka stands with Pakistan and with all other nations of the Indian Ocean and South Asia in this work. Let us go forward.’’

Professor Dr Jian Gao, deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric Research at the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, said China had focused on pollution control for half a century.
He walked through various measures that China took to control air pollution.

4:41pm — Session 6 begins on tackling trans-boundary air pollution
UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan, Mohamed Yahya, began the session with saying that air pollution and climate change did not respect borders and there were no customs or immigration checks when pollutants were crossing from one border to the next.
‘‘If there is anything that really encourages cooperation and specifically international cooperation, it is the issue of climate change … and air pollution.’’
Recalling the smog last year in Lahore, he said the issue affected New Delhi as well. ‘‘The genius of Breathe Pakistan initiative was to realise early on … that Pakistan cannot deal with this issue alone and if there is anything that can encourage cooperation and coming together, it is the issue of air pollution and climate change.’’

3:46pm — Justice Hassan stresses need for climate finance
LHC’s Justice Hassan recalled Pakistan becoming a member of the Loss and Damage Fund in COP28 in November 2023, saying the country got “lucky”.
He underscored the need to work on climate financing. “We can’t depend on loans from the GFF (Global Financing Facility) and other countries,” he said.
“We need funding, and we need climate finance. We have a framework now; the finance minister is working on it. We will have a meeting very soon on it.”

3:42 — Justice Shah says judges also need to understand environmental science better
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said that judges needed to understand climate and environmental science better. He also noted that climate courts needed to be introduced in the future.
“So there are a number of things we need to be doing in the judiciary as far is building capacity to deal with environmental issues once we get done with some of our constitutional issues,” he said.
 
 

“More judges ought to get involved and mainstreamed into the process of dealing with the environment,” he said. However, he stated that the judiciary was not the problem in this case.
“The disconnect is the implementation part, where the executive does not follow what we say,” he said.
He also said that climate issues could not be addressed without financing, adding: “One of the major issues the government faces is finance. They don’t have the finances allocated for this purpose.”
The judge also expressed disappointment at the missing presence of the prime minister and chief minister at the event.

3:38pm — Justice Mansoor Ali Shah criticises a ‘dead’ civil society
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah also took aim at a “dead civil society”.
“Where are the public interest litigation? You want to sit at home and crib about air pollution? When have you come out to file petitions? When have you gone out protesting?
“Civil societies that are dead, this happens to them. So live with the air pollution you have because you haven’t done much. You should be more active … fight for your right! If you don’t want to fight for your right, nobody is gonna bother.”

3:27pm — Justice Ayesha calls on youth to focus on playing their role
Justice Ayesha called on the youth to focus on what their role in combatting air pollution is and if they wanted their rights, “whether it be writing, speaking out, protesting or bringing litigation to courts”.
She said, “We lack in the expertise as well. We don’t see the academic churning out information, reports and articles on it. We also dont see the youth paying attention to this.”
She also noted that the issue required a “lot of investment”. “It requires will and commitment.”

3:22pm — We fail to recognise that air pollution is actually a public health emergency: Justice Ayesha
Justice Ayesha Malik observed, “Today, we fail to recognise the fact that air pollution is actually a public health emergency.”
She underscored, “The impact it is having for the generations to come, we won’t be able to resolve the issue, we won’t be able to save the generations.”
Speaking on governance, the judge noted that government policies and laws existed, but “where is the monitoring under that policy, where is the reporting, where is the data on the basis of which the decisions were made?”
Justice Ayesha emphasised the need for reporting and monitoring: “You need the science. Without the science, you cannot solve the issue.”

3:13pm — Air pollution can be tackled through cooperative federalism rather than devolution to provinces: Justice Shah
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said that the first problem in addressing air pollution was the devolution of the issue to the provinces.
“The subject of pollution has now been devolved to the provinces. There is no national domain to oversee the whole problem at the national level. So I think there is a huge disconnect at a federal and provincial level.”
 
 

Justice Shah said that in his opinion, this could be resolved through cooperative federalism. “The federal government will have to play a role in laying down policy or standards … devolution of pollution is a problematic area which needs to be addressed,” he said.
The judge further went on to say, “I don’t think the government is interested in changing the life of an ordinary person. It is all elitist to satisfy or protect an industry or a pressure group, but an ordinary person is not in the picture.”
Justice Shah said he was not terming development “bad”, but there had to be intelligent ways of doing it. He said that Pakistan’s Environment Protection Agency (EPA) was a department that was subservient to the government. “How could it oppose the government’s will and wishes?”

3:03pm — ‘Many gaps’ in the regulatory set-up: Justice Ayesha
SC’s Justice Ayesha Malik noted that the right to clean air had been recognised as a basic right decades ago, adding that there were “many gaps” in the regulatory set-up.
Recalling her time at the LHC, she said there were a lot of cases related to brick kilns and poultry farms. Justice Ayesha detailed that a lot of emissions and odours come from the waste at poultry farms.
She also highlighted that the owners of these places also approached the courts, saying that the regulator was being unfair to them.
“When we were looking at cases in the Supreme Court — whether it’s related to floods, surface mining, deforestation — the issues are the same. It’s about the way the regulator is handling the matter. […] You don’t feel that urgency, that level of commitment where they realise that the air people are breathing is toxic.”

3:00pm — ‘Governance missing’: Justice Shah notes huge gap between jurispudence, reality
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah observed that the judiciary had been “very active” when it came to climate cases and that “governance” was missing.
“The courts have been very robustly directing and pushing the government to address the issue of air pollution and climate change because to the courts, people matter.”
He went on to say that the judiciary had worked in order to protect people and their fundamental rights.  “That’s the toolkit for us, that’s the prime consideration the judge has — to protect the fundamental rights of a person.”
However, he regretted that there was a huge gap between the jurisprudence and the reality on the ground.

“What’s going on? What’s missing? It’s governance, governance,
governance.”

2:56pm — Spotlight on climate cases withers away once they’re decided: Justice Shah
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that a case from 1997 was decided nine years later, which led to several interesting moves, including getting rid of the two-stroke rickshaws and moving on to CNG buses.
“For the first time, vehicular air pollution was considered and recognised as a source of air pollution,” he said.
“The point I am trying to make is that once the case is going on, the spotlight is on the government and they respond … but it withers away once the case is decided,” the judge added.

2:50pm — Justice Shah details Pakistan’s judicial history in climate cases
SC Senior Puisne Judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah highlighted that SC’s “iconic judge”, Justice Saleem Akhtar, took up a case about vehicular pollution in Karachi in 1993 and “got it all started”.
Directives were given about car inspections and maintenance. While “nothing much came about” in that, a major landmark decision of 1994 “set the tone for environmental pollution in Pakistan”, which was in the Shehla Zia case about a grid station being set up in Islamabad.
 
 

“That judgment for the first time says that right to life would mean the right to a healthier, better life,” Justice Shah pointed out.
The judge further recalled that in 1997, he was part of a group that went to the Lahore High Court with a plea seeking to address vehicular air pollution. “At that time, the judiciary didn’t understand. They thought it was a fancy litigation. We weren’t given that respect … the petition was kept pending for nine years.”

2:42pm — Panel on ‘Judicial Activism and Litigation for Clean Air in Pakistan’ begins
The session on judicial activism for clean air has begun, where Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ayesha Malik will give their insights.
Lahore High Court’s Jawad Hassan will also shed light on the judicial aspect of tackling climate change.
Moderating the session, Senior advocate Faisal Siddiqi said the three judges had “all the [four] Cs that every great judge must have — competence, creativity, courage and conscience”.

2:30pm — Farmers definitely not villains in this: Pakistan Agriculture Coalition CEO
 
 

Asked about a viable solution to the burning of crop residuals, Pakistan Agriculture Coalition CEO Kazim M. Saeed said: “Farmers are definitely not the villains in this, maybe they’re the anti-hero of the story”.
He stressed the need for the interests of individuals and the public interest to be aligned. Saeed noted that stubble burning only occurred during winters and pointed out that the problem did not exist 40-45 years ago, when only wheat was harvested on a large scale and rice crops were cut by hand.

2:19pm — We have to make electric vehicles more friendly for consumers: automaker general manager
Ali Zaidi, the general manager of Marketing and Brands at Nexgen Autos’ Omoda & Jaecoo, has stressed the need to make electric vehicles more “friendly” for consumers.
He pointed out that 33pc is the share of emissions from vehicles in Karachi and 35pc in Lahore. “This is a huge chunk so the question is not whether we will be able to make EVs viable in the next five years, it is more of a statement that we have to.”
He stressed the need for the step to be sustainable: “If it is not sustainable, it can not run on itself, so it has to make business sense.”

He highlighted that PSO has been reviewing how it can make things more sustainable and profitable, giving the example of reducing 760 processes of the company to 430 and digitising them.
“That’s the keyword. It has to be profitable.”

1:55pm — EBM CEO proposes national clear air forum
Zeelaf Munir said that the next step would be to embed collaboration into Pakistan’s environmental framework to move from isolated efforts to a shared strategy.
“That is why what I am proposing is the creation of a national clean air forum. A permanent platform where government, industries, academia and NGOs collaborate, share data and co-design practical solutions. A space where research meets regulation.”

1:50pm — EBM CEO says clean air an economic necessity
English Biscuit Manufacturers Managing Director & CEO Zeelaf Munir addressed the day’s fourth session, ‘The Smog Equation’. In her keynote speech, she said: “Each year the grey sky returns, it reminds us that leadership today must be measured not only by growth or profit but by the quality of air people breathe.”
She said that clean air “was a responsibility we all shared”. She noted that air pollution costs Pakistan’s nearly 6pc of its GDP every year, more than what is spent on health and education combined.
“It weakens our workforce, drives us healthcare costs and deters investment. Clean air is not just a social cause, it is an economic necessity.”

1:37pm: BoP chairman stresses federal, provincial integration
The Bank of Punjab chairman said that integration at a federal and provincial level was something that was the need of the hour.
“The projects rests in the provinces while the entire effort of fundraising is being done at a federal level. And that lack of disconnect is causing a lack of delivery as far as a project’s financing is concerned.”

1:34pm: BoP chairman highlights challenges to Pakistan’s climate financing
The Bank of Punjab chairman said that Pakistan’s climate financing gap was around $348 billion between now and 2030. He said that the impact of flooding in the country could be another $100bn between now and 2030.
“The dilemma is that we have enough capital available internationally. The challenge is that we do not have enough projects to tap into that funding,” he said.
“The world is not short of capital. The world is short in the confidence they have in Pakistan’s readiness.”

1:29pm: BoP chairman says 6pc of Pakistan’s GDP affected every year by climate crisis
Zafar Masud, the Bank of Punjab chairman, gave his closing remarks for the session, calling it a “transformational agenda”. He said that around six per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) was being affected due to the climate crisis every year.

He said that “dirty air” meant “lower repayments, weaker exports and high non-performing loans”.
Noting the recent floods in the country, he said that that was in addition to what he had said before. “So altogether it’s a substantial impact.”
He said that the conference was not just about awareness but also about making concrete the ideas of structured finance and the way forward.

1:24pm — Rafay Alam details how air pollution revolution began in European cities
Asked about other countries around the world facing climate change issues, Climate expert Rafay Alam acknowledged they were “rich, white countries” but stressed how they started on addressing those problems.
Alam noted that Stockholm had immense automobile-related pollution, the United Kingdom had major pollution after World War 2, and as well as in California in the 1970s.
“There have been laws made in each of these countries to address air pollution,” he said, stressing that even those laws were a result of some action.

1:20pm — Onus on consumers to create ‘demand’ for financing green projects: BoP official
Bank of Punjab’s (BoP) Arslan Muhammad Iqbal said it was on the consumer that a “demand” was created to finance green projects.
He asserted that the “funding is there”, mentioning the Green Sukuk bonds.
He noted that BoP was the only Pakistani bank to get a 50m euro lending facility from a France-based multilateral, which can be used to fund green energy.

01:05pm: Climate expert Rafay Alam says improvements in environment not overnight solutions
Rafay Alam, an environmental lawyer, said that while people liked to have a clean environment, they had cosmetic superficial ambitions in this regard.
“Look at it this way: you have to use the black and white of printed policy paper to manifest the change in the quality of the air outside. That requires an immense and very accurate amount of data. You can’t do it without that.”
He went on to say that most improvements in the environment were not overnight solutions and took time.

The planning minister further said that everyone had heard the “grand announcements at COP after COP”.
“We have seen the press releases and the photo ops. But where is the action? This inaction is feulling the storms that drown our children. Your emissions are the poison in our lungs … Now, we ask the developed world to do more.”
He went on to say: “The time for blame is over. The time for action is now. Let’s rollup our sleeves, let’s clear the air and let’s get to work.”

12:47pm — This year’s floods ‘not a natural disaster, but a man-made climate catastrophe’
Ahsan Iqbal said the poisoned air was not just one symptom of a deeper sickness but a “climate crisis that is pounding our nation with terrifying fury”.
He also mentioned this year’s monstrous monsoon floods, stating that they were not a natural disaster, but a “man-made climate catastrophe”.
“Over 1,200 lives lost, 4 million countrymen displaced and economic haemorrhage in billions of dollars. I have walked through those flood camps, and I have seen because my own district (Narowal) was one of the worst affected.
“This is the human face of climate injustice.”

The planning minister also highlighted that Pakistan was bearing a burden it did not contribute as much to.
“Every action is a bullet in this fight for clean air. And I say to our international partners and the global community, that Pakistan bears a burden it did not create. We are on the frontlines of a war we did not start. We are doing our part with limited resources,” Iqbal said.
“We call for the urgent delivery and scaling up of climate finance. The promises made in Glasgow and Sharm el-Sheikh but become a reality on the ground in Pakistan.
“We need access to cutting-edge green technology on preferential terms,” he said, calling for the “major emitters of the world” to increase their net-zero timelimes.
“Our survival should not be negotiable in their boardrooms.”

12:33pm — Polluted air ‘holding our nation back’: planning minister
Calling the issue a “battle for survival”, Ahsan Iqbal stressed the need to “confront a brutal, inescapable truth — the air we breathe is making us sick and it is holding our nation back”.
“As of yesterday, our air was not just poor, it was a toxic cocktail, a public health emergency. Lahore’s AQI at 400 is a red alert for our nation,” the planning minister pointed out.
“Let’s be clear; this is not just Lahore’s problem. Karachi, Faisalabad, Peshawar, almost all our urban engines are drowning in pollution.
“To put that in human terms, breathing this air is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.”
He cited a study as stating that pollution levels witness a spike during winters, but also underscored that the levels have a “very steady line through summers also”.

11:45am — ‘EPA to be expanded to entire Punjab next year’
Silwat Saeed also highlighted the various measures being taken by the Punjab government, including an environment protection force, which she said is being experimented with for the first time in the province.
“This is actually providing miraculous results,” the Punjab environment department official said, noting that the teams had specialised equipment with them.
Saeed said the force, currently in Lahore, will also be expanded to the rest of Punjab, with 10 industrial hotspots to be prioritised initially and the entire province next year.

11:42am — ‘Air quality monitors in Punjab increased from 2 to 41 in past year’
Silwat Saeed detailed Punjab’s three-pronged approach to tackle air pollution, which comprises first monitoring the quality of the air we breathe, then mitigating it, and then finally engaging with the citizenry to inform and empower them.
“Without localised data, there is nothing that can work. […] In earlier decades, we were sitting in the dark, we didn’t know what was wrong. Now that has changed.”
The Punjab official stated that the number of air quality monitors has increased from two to 41 in the past year. “Within the next 6-7 months, the number would be 100 for the entire Punjab.”
She further noted that a detailed study was currently being undertaken by the Punjab government to see why the air in the province had pollutants that “are affecting our health”.

11:38am — ‘First time that Punjab’s development programme has been climate-tagged’
The Punjab environment department official asserted that it was for the first time that the province’s development programme had been “climate-tagged”.
“You would be seeing that the transport sector has been given around Rs269bn that has been tagged for climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes,” she said, referring to the largest allocation.
Others were Rs95bn for raising awareness, Rs65bn for capacity building, Rs62bn for water resources, Rs47bn for forestry, and Rs16bn for agriculture and livestock.
Saeed noted that it was a cross-sectoral issue and the “real villain is not a single entity which you can point out and fix”.

11:30am — Pakistan located in a ‘geographical trap’, adding to its pollution woes: Silwat Saeed
Silwat Saeed noted that urbanisation has also resulted in the “huge menace of smog”, but it was also a manifestation of deteriorating air quality, which becomes palpable because of temperature inversions.
The Punjab official further highlighted that Pakistan was located in a “geographical trap” that added to its pollution woes.
“The northern area of this entire region is actually the foothill of the Himalayas, and the foothills would act as a lid when all the pollutants from the region get trapped and then they whirl around within the cities in the region, not only in Pakistan but also in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.”

Silwat Saeed, Punjab’s Environment Protection and Climate Change Department secretary, kicked off the day’s second session, ‘A Greener Punjab To Combat Air Pollution’.
She appreciated DawnMedia for “uniting” her department to speak about how environmental governance was being transformed at a sub-national level.
“This problem is not some distant abstract thing. It is right in front of us.”
She noted that it was not the first time the world was seeing the issue of air pollution, mentioning the advancement in industrialisation in Europe during the last century.

11:20am — ‘About 5pc of entire global GDP lost because of pollution’
Mohamed Yahya said that “about $6 trillion annually, about 5pc of the entire global GDP, is lost because of pollution”.
“There’s no better and more heartbreaking place to discuss this issue. I want to congratulate the Dawn group [for organising the conference].”
Recalling last year’s smog, the UN official said the stain was so profound here in Lahore that it was visible from space. “A glaring testament of what needs to be done.”

“The smog is our creation.”


11:18am — ‘Silent pandemic’ of air pollution a global emergency: UN resident coordinator
“The science is clear,” UN’s Yahya said, adding that the numbers should shake everyone. Citing WHO estimates, he pointed out that “99pc of us in this room and 99pc of humanity breathes air that is unsafe”.
“Let that number be something that galvanises us. This is not a distant threat. It’s a global siege.  About seven million people lose their lives every year because of the air they breathe.
“It’s the single greatest environmental risk of our lives and a silent pandemic.”

11:13am —  What happens when the air we breathe turns against us?: UN’s Yahya
UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan, Mohamed Yahya, termed the air we breathe as “our most intimate and non-negotiable relationship with our world”.
“It’s not an abstract concept but a fabric of life itself, the substance that fuels our cells, our lungs, our dreams. But what happens when that very substance turns against us? When the air we breathe becomes a slow-acting poison?” he asked.

The climate change minister noted that the South Asian cities of Lahore and New Delhi were not mentioned when the issue of the most polluted cities was highlighted 10-15 years ago.
“The names mentioned were Beijing and Shanghai, and now they are providing 60-75pc of the world’s solar technology. Not only did they fix their cities, but they also led the solar revolution throughout the world to counter the problem they were facing”.

11:04am — Policy in works to update old oil refineries: minister Malik
Hailing the “amazing initiatives” being carried out under CM Maryam Nawaz, the climate minister said 8,000 to 10,000 bikes have been distributed, 600 or 500 e-buses are on the roads or will be launched, and anti-smog guns have been installed.
“We will keep bringing higher standards for fuel. We’ve made a policy to update our old refineries … can be brought up to the best standards in the world,” the federal minister said, adding that incentives were to be given as well and some companies were working on the policy.

10:55am — Climate minister Musadik Malik calls air pollution a man-made phenomenon
Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik called air pollution a man-made phenomenon, adding that it was up to us to fix it. He noted that climate change and environmental issues were not major objectives in the past and hard work was being carried out to fix this.
He refrained from citing different laws and policies, but said that the federal government and Punjab were doing very good work with regard to climate change.
The minister said around 40pc of children’s lung functioning were affected due to polluted air.
He added: “This is not just smog. Also look at it through the lens of death. And it is not just death. Also look at it through the lens of love, and when you see the faces hidden behind the haze, maybe then we will solve the issues more quickly.”

10:45am — Musadik Malik mentions link between life expectancy and air pollution
Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik is addressing the event via a video link, apologising that he could not reach Lahore due to “some special circumstances, as you know”.
“Pollution and all these environmental hazards … they stand in the way of our success,” the minister said.
He recalled that his father had been in a coma during his last days and prayed for “just one more day” for his life. Stressing the importance of life, Malik said five to eight years of the lives of all Lahore residents, including elders, were wasted due to smog.
“We probably do not associate this with the grief and mortality that comes ahead of us because of smog or air pollution,” he said, adding that according to some estimates, 128,000 premature deaths occur in Pakistan every year, and a person’s five to eight years of life are cut short due to air pollution.

10:37am — Mandatory recycling bins in Punjab schools from Oct 30
The Punjab minister also reflected on her recent visits to Japan. “The entire waste management in Japan is for segregated waste, so that technology cannot be brought to Pakistan,” she said.
“So now we’re going to China for that technology and waste incinerators. We’ve started this in schools. We thought schools would be the right place to start this and embed it into our curriculum. After Oct 30, the schools have to keep five recycling bins at schools mandatory,” Aurangzeb said.

10:30am — ‘Transboundary arrangement’ may now be taken up with UN, WB after recent events: Punjab minister
Marriyum Aurangzeb also observed the lack of data regarding air pollution and highlighted the phenomenon of transboundary pollution.
“The major seasonal contributor to high AQI levels in Lahore and Multan … that easterly wind corridor from India plays a critical role and is a major contributor to seasonal AQI levels. We had started a transboundary arrangement but because of recent events, we may take this forward with the UN or World Bank.”
“Breathe Pakistan is a great initiative for spreading awareness … the responsibility is shared, and whatever we choose has consequences on the environment and climate change,” Aurangzeb stressed.

10:26 — ‘Climate Change Vision 2025 tells policy and action plan for next 10 years’
Aurangzeb pointed out that Punjab’s Climate Change Vision 2025 detailed the policy and action plan for the next 10 years.
She highlighted that the Punjab government introduced vehicle fitness certificates for the “first time ever”.
“We are using safe city cameras to identify smoke coming from cars. We have a Punjab Clean Air Programme, which also has a buy-back policy of old vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
’[…] For the first time ever, we have mobile fuel testing labs. EPA Punjab has started fuel testing to test petrol at petrol stations in Punjab. In the last eight months, 1,100 electric buses have arrived in Punjab.“

10:21 — Aurangzeb lists steps taken by Punjab govt to tackle smog
Aurangzeb emphasised that Punjab now had a state-of-the-art environmental force. Listing the steps taken by the provincial government, she said a subsidy programme with 80pc paid by the government was initiated and Lahore Division now had 5,000 superseeders.
Stubble burning zones were mapped, investment was done in the mechanisation of agriculture, and drone monitoring for industrial units is carried out. Around 11,000 brick kilns across the Punjab were also mapped and those without zigzag technology were sealed.

10:17 — Punjab minister details CM Maryam’s smog mitigation plan
The Punjab senior minister recalled the smog mitigation plan launched by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
“When I speak about Punjab interventions, we have completed the entire legal framework. We are now doing AI-predictable modelling for forecasting AQI levels,” Aurangzeb highlighted.
“Localisation of smog mitigation was critical to the intervention, so we took a multi-sectoral lens to smog mitigation,” she said, noting smog guns imported two months ago and deployed in Lahore.
“For predictable forecasting, we have 41 air monitors across Punjab, and will have 100 across Punjab by 2026.”

10:12am — Marriyum Aurangzeb says such initiatives key to tackling climate change issues
Beginning her address, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb noted the presence of “lots of experts, media people and policymakers and civil society”, adding that it reflected the shared responsibility toward climate resilience and climate adaptation.
Thanking DawnMedia for taking the initiative, the Punjab minister said she was a “bit sceptical” when she participated in the February conference. “I did not think it would be a sustainable initiative. So my heartfelt congrats to Naz, to you and the Dawn group for sustaining this initiative because that is the key to issues like climate change.”
“I want other media groups to be made part of this initiative. I will present a case study from our chief minister. Lahore, a heritage hotspot of Pakistan,  [and] the heartbeat of Pakistan, is confronted with seasonal smog. This is a year-long phenomenon. AQI levels of Lahore and other regions of Punjab were not satisfactory, so we started working on smog mitigation objectives,” Aurangzeb highlighted.
She said her government was “in shock that we are talking about it in March” when she called a meeting, as the air quality issue is a year-long phenomenon. “We started off with a multi-sectoral lens for climate change.”

10:07am — Dawn CEO Nazafreen stresses commitment to cleaner skies
Inaugurating the moot, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the CEO of Dawn, says: “On behalf of DawnMedia, it is an honour and my responsibility to welcome you all to Breathe Pakistan’s The Air We Breathe — a critical gathering focused on one of the most urgent challenges, air pollution.”
Recalling the initiative’s launch, she said: “Our aim was to start a national dialogue on climate change. At the first conference, experts came together to issue a charter for a climate-resilient Pakistan.
“Today, The Air We Breathe builds on that momentum. As we enter another smog season, this conference focuses on practical tangible measures to tackle air pollution,” Saigol-Lakhani added.
She further said, “We are helping to weave a living network of collaboration to ensure shared commitments … I hope today’s discussions will inspire collective action and send a strong message that the health of people and the future of Pakistan are not policy points but our priorities.
“Let us commit to cleaner skies and a healthier environment for generations to come.”

KPA Speaker Babar Saleem Swati posted the schedule for Monday’s session on his X account. It said the election for the next chief minister would be held on the date.
 






On Wednesday, Gandapur said that he resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role.
However, his resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s house denying having ever received it.
“Today at 2:30 pm, the handwritten resignation advice of the CM Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was duly received and acknowledged by Governor House,” Kundi posted on X earlier today.
“After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added.
 






‘PTI will eradicate terrorism under KP’s new leadership’
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said during a press conference today that under the leadership of incoming CM Sohail Afridi, the party will eradicate terrorism in KP.
“Any complaints that have arisen recently from the government will be resolved,” he said. “On Monday, Sohail Afridi will be sworn in as the new KP chief minister.”
“Afridi will be the first CM to hail from the tribal areas. He is young and determined,” Raja added. “This province will progress greatly under his leadership. We hope for an end to bloodshed through diplomacy, so we can eradicate terrorism in the region.”
The PTI secretary general also noted that under Article 130(8) (the chief minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the president, resign his office) of the Constitution, a chief minister can resign from office and does not require the acceptance or approval of the governor.
Responding to a question about why no notification was issued for CM Gandapur’s resignation, Raja said that notifications “are just for information” and serve no purpose.
Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in an interview on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan reiterated Raja’s point about the constitution granting the CM freedom to resign from their post.
“It’s written in the constitution that if the governor accepts the resignation, then the house will select its leader and CM,” he said. “It is shameful that a local rivalry with the governor is being played upon like this
“He (CM Gandapur) wants his resignation accepted immediately so that Sohail Afridi, [PTI founder] Imran Khan’s pick for CM, can sit in the seat. This cannot be left up in the air.”
When asked to confirm if there would be a session at the KP assembly on Monday, Akram replied in the affirmative.
“We have the numbers,” he said. “There is a clear majority if there is no misadventure.”
When asked if the PTI will consult with the federal government about an alternative candidate, the party spokesperson replied: “We do not have to consult with the government about who we nominate. It is the PTI’s and Imran Khan’s mandate. Did the government consult us on bringing Maryam and Bugti in as CMs?
“He (Afridi) has been a cabinet member for one and a half years. If he were a facilitator, then why did nobody say anything then?”
The PTI information secretary reiterated that the PTI stands against terrorists but believes that collateral damage in military operations could create an insurgency and make the population vengeful and vindictive.
“Khan sahib says we are against terrorism, but for the long-term benefit, you cannot mire the country in insurgencies,” he said.
Earlier, Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house.
In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.</p><small>2025-10-11 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/112040507990470.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948200/magnitude-5-earthquake-jolts-punjabs-layyah-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Magnitude 5 earthquake jolts Punjab’s Layyah: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A magnitude 5 earthquake struck close to Punjab’s Layyah on Saturday night, according to the Pakistan Meteoreological Department (PMD).
The PMD said the quake occurred 50 kilometres east of Layyah at 7:54pm at a depth of 20km.
Layyah Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Waseem Hayat told Dawn.com: “The earthquake was felt in the district but no emergency was reported.’’
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
The development comes just days after jolts from an earthquake of magnitude 5.2 were felt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral and Swat districts on Tuesday.
A 5.0-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Quetta on Sunday evening.

Police sources earlier stated that Teefi Butt had initially fled to Glasgow (UK) soon after the murder of Ameer Balaj Tipu. During the course of the investigation, police arrested Ameer Balaj’s close friend, Ahsan Shah, for giving information to Butt and his gangsters about the movement of his friend.
More recently, Teefi Butt travelled to Dubai for renewal of his London visa after it expired, which ultimately led to his capture.
The CCD had also formally requested the Lahore capital city police officer (CCPO) to transfer the investigation of the Ameer Balaj murder case to them. The case was originally registered at Chuhng Police Station.
Ameer Balaj was killed during a marriage ceremony in February 2024. Teefi Butt and Aqeel Butt alias Gogi Butt were nominated in the case. Gogi Butt is currently out on bail and Teefi Butt was declared an absconder.
A statement from the CCD today stated that Teefi Butt, who had been arrested in Dubai earlier with the aid of Interpol, had landed at Karachi Airport a day prior and was handed over to CCD custody, who were to transport him to Lahore by road.
“When the CCD team reached near Sanjarpur, District Rahim Yar Khan, in the wee hours of 11th October, a number of armed assailants intercepted the CCD vehicle and opened indiscriminate fire,” the statement claimed.
During the gun battle, a CCD officer sustained serious bullet injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital. The suspects allegedly freed Teefi Butt and fled the scene. Local police and CCD officers were immediately notified, according to the statement.
“At around [5am], the Rahim Yar Khan CCD team spotted two suspicious vehicles and tried to intercept them. A heavy exchange of gunfire ensued between the CCD team and the assailants, lasting for about 20 to 25 minutes,” the statement added.
“One person was found seriously injured at the scene [and] he succumbed to his injuries while being evacuated to a local hospital by the CCD team. Later on, he was identified as Khawaja Tareef Butt alias Teefi Butt.”
The statement added that another policeman sustained serious injuries during the gunfight and was transported to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
“Multiple teams from both the local police and Rahim Yar Khan CCD are actively pursuing those involved in the attack, injuring two police officials and the killing of Khawaja Tareef Butt alias Teefi Butt,” the statement read, adding that further investigation was underway.
Old rivalry
The families of Tipu and the Butts have a decades-old rivalry in alleged underworld circles of Lahore. They were at the top of 20 ‘gangsters’ of the city when the Lahore police launched a crackdown in 2021 under the command of the then CCPO Ghulam Mahmood Dogar.
Gogi Butt was earlier arrested under anti-terrorism charges.
Ameer Balaj’s grandfather Ameeruddin alias Billa Truckanwala was also engaged in the feud and he had fallen victim to the enmity in 1998. Ameer Balaj’s father Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala was shot dead by his rivals in 2010 and he was the third generation that fell victim to the gang rivalry.
According to the reports, Ameer Balaj had recently joined the PML-N after quitting the PTI.
Sharing the background to the gangsters of Lahore, a police official said the provincial capital had been in the spotlight for many decades when several underworld dons terrorised Lahoriites, particularly, in the second tenure of Shehbaz Sharif as the chief minister in 2008.
He alleged the prime suspects nominated in the murder case of Ameer Balaj, namely Gogi Butt and Teefi Butt, were also among the top underworld dons besides Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala and many others. Some of them were killed by their rivals, while others were shot dead in alleged ‘staged encounters’ during the tenure of Shehbaz.
Prominent among them were Saqib Langra, Mubeen Butt, Aslam Bassa and Naveed Lumbiwala.
About Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala, the officer said he had no particular criminal record but had enmities with many groups in Lahore.
With the passage of time, the police officer said, some underworld dons joined political parties to seek shelter under the ruling political figures to avoid criminal cases. He said Gogi Butt and Teefi Butt were also among those who resumed political activities. However, they kept on ruling the city’s crime world by expanding their networks.
Some gangsters of the city, like the Butts, feared that as Ameer Balaj would assume significance, he might pose challenges to them in the future.
The gruesome killing of young Ameer Balaj shocked the underworld community, his family, relatives and the close circles besides the traders as he was also the owner of a prominent goods transport network.
The people associated with the crime circles fear that the murder of Ameer Balaj may lead to a new era of ‘killings’ between these two groups/families.
Concerns over CCD ‘encounters’
Earlier in July, the Lahore High Court (LHC) directed Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar to review the encounters being carried out by CCD.
LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum, hearing a case in connection with a woman’s petition against the killing of her son in an alleged CCD encounter, noted that the high court was receiving 50 petitions daily regarding fake police encounters and observed that the current wave of CCD encounters must be assessed.
The chief justice also instructed the IGP to conduct a thorough review of the ongoing encounters and ensure that such fake encounters were not repeated in the future.
She observed that “Whenever there is firing, the bullet is so intelligent that it never hits a police official or vehicle“. The chief justice further stated that the FIRs of all alleged police encounters follow the same pattern.</p><small>2025-10-11 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/11183649cdddd5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948184/north-korea-holds-military-parade-shows-off-new-intercontinental-missile' target='_blank'><strong>North Korea holds military parade, shows off new intercontinental missile</strong></a><br><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a large military parade displaying its new intercontinental ballistic missile in front of visiting international dignitaries, state media KCNA said on Saturday.
The parade, which began late on Friday, marked the 80th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party and followed celebrations on Thursday.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, as well as Vietnam’s Communist Party chief To Lam, were seen at Kim’s side at the parade, while other foreign dignitaries looked on.

In the military parade, nuclear-armed North Korea displayed its most advanced Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, described by KCNA as the country’s “strongest nuclear strategic weapon system.”
The Hwasong series of ICBMs has given North Korea the capacity to target anywhere on the US mainland, but questions remain over the sophistication of its guidance system to reach a target, and the ability of a warhead it carries to withstand atmospheric re-entry.
“The Hwasong-20 represents, for the moment, the apotheosis of North Korea’s ambitions for long-range nuclear delivery capabilities. We should expect to see the system tested before the end of this year,” said Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
“The system is likely designed for the delivery of multiple warheads… Multiple warheads will increase stresses on existing US missile defence systems and augment what Kim sees as necessary to achieve meaningful deterrence effects against Washington.”

Other weapons on display included hypersonic ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, a new type of multiple rocket launcher and a launcher for suicide drones, said Hong Min, North Korea analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification.
At the military parade, Kim gave a speech in which he expressed “warm encouragement” for North Korean troops in overseas operations, adding its military’s heroism will not only be seen in the defence of North Korea but also in “outposts of socialist construction,” KCNA said.
“Our army should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats,” Kim said.

Kim held talks earlier on Friday with Medvedev, who said the sacrifice of North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia in its military campaign in Ukraine proved the trust in relations between the two countries.
Kim told Medvedev he hopes to continue strengthening cooperation with Russia and to closely engage in diverse exchanges to achieve common goals, KCNA said.
Vietnam and North Korea also signed agreements of cooperation in various fields, including between their defence, foreign and health ministries, KCNA said without elaborating.</p><small>2025-10-11 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/11150450ac7dad9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948130/info-minister-tarar-assails-pti-led-kp-govt-for-facilitating-terrorists-sowing-division' target='_blank'><strong>Info Minister Tarar assails PTI-led KP govt for ‘facilitating terrorists, sowing division’</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security,” stressing that the sacrifices of Pakistanis in the fight against terrorism will not be in vain.
The information minister’s remarks come a day after the spokesperson for the military’s media wing, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, without naming anyone, said the “state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of a single person deemed most responsible for bringing terrorism back to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
“In the past week alone, there have been several terrorist attacks which were bravely and courageously repelled by officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army,” Tarar said.
Referring to PTI, he said during this time, there remains only one party, “Tehreek-i-Inteshaar” (movement of chaos) which has no concern for the sacrifices of our martyrs, no concern for the integrity of the country, and whose only interest is in “further dividing KP, worsening the situation, and creating safe havens for terrorists within the province.”
“This is not a story of today,” the minister continued. “For decades, Imran Khan and his party have followed this pattern, showing sympathy for terrorists at the local, regional, and even international levels, and acting as their facilitators.”
“This nation has sacrificed so much. Pakistan is the only country whose children have also given their lives,” he said.
“How can we forget the students of the APS Peshawar attack, those children who wrote a legendary chapter of sacrifice in blood, a story that will live forever in history. [How] can we forget the children martyred recently in Khuzdar, those who were attacked on a bus. How can we forget their sacrifices?”
He said he had personally visited Khuzdar and Quetta.  “When we spoke to the parents of those children, they were such brave and remarkable people. One man, whose three sons were martyred, stood with complete courage and resolve and said, ‘My own life is also ready to be sacrificed for Pakistan.’”
He said the province had borne the brunt of militancy for decades, yet its citizens had remained steadfast. “You will find countless examples of how the brave people of KP have rendered immense sacrifices for this country, whether they are from the armed forces, civilians, tradesmen, doctors, engineers, or shopkeepers and children; every segment of society has sacrificed for Pakistan,” Tarar said.
“And when the entire country expressed its resolve to eradicate terrorism through the implementation of the National Action Plan, everyone saw how the armed forces, the federal government under Nawaz Sharif, and the provincial governments defeated terrorism through operations such as Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad.”
Recalling the years when terrorism gripped the country, Tarar said it was a time when fear overshadowed daily life. “This was the time when our cricket grounds had become deserted, every city would witness a terrorist incident every other day; this was the time when our ulema, our citizens, our children were sacrificing their lives,” he added.
He said the nation could not forget the Parade Lane mosque attack, in which retired officers, children, and citizens were martyred, adding that the terrorists have no caste, creed, or colour. “They only believe in violence and promoting terror. They have no god or prophet. They have nothing to do with any religion or Islam.”
The minister said the State of Pakistan exists in the name of the Kalima; the whole world views it as a strong Islamic country. To attack the mosques of that state, to attack its armed forces, to attack the law enforcers of that state, to carry out terrorist activities inside that state; this is not permissible in any way, not by any standard, and Islam also does not permit it.
He said the ulema have already issued fatwas (edicts) stating that no jihad can be waged against the state of Pakistan.
“These terrorists do not spare even mosques,” he said, adding that the sacrifices of those people [against terrorism] will never go in vain.
Criticising Imran, Tarar said there was one person in jail who believed the sacrifices of the nation held no value.
“If there is respect, it is for how politics can be polished, and in that sense those people who chant the slogan ‘Khan Nahi, To Pakistan Nahi’ [we] regard such politics as a curse in which, by favouring a personality, you push Pakistan backwards and bring the personality forward,” he said.
He added that no political party had ever resorted to such slogans before, recalling that when Benazir Bhutto was martyred, PPP workers chanted, ‘Pakistan khappay’ (long live Pakistan).
“The leadership of the PML-N has always spoken for this country even in the most difficult circumstances,” he said, questioning, “What slogan have you [Imran Khan] given to your Pakistan? Is your personality the greatest, and everyone else below it?”
Talking about Operation Zarb-i-Azb and Raddul Fasaad, he asserted that peace was established in 2017, but in 2018, when the KP government took over, it invited and resettled terrorists in the province.
He alleged there was a reason behind this — an illegal spectrum through which the KP government promotes smuggling, illegal trade, and an undocumented economy. “This includes non-custom-paid cars business, oil smuggling, food smuggling, tobacco and timber business, in which terrorists and the KP PTI government have a nexus. The KP govt, the PTI benefits through these,” he said, adding that these people also fund Imran.
He said they settled the militants in populated areas, helped them establish businesses, and entered formal trade partnerships with them. That “successful scheme,” he remarked, is now haunting the nation as “we pick up bodies every day.” He added that this would not be allowed to continue.
“The state of Pakistan will never permit any person or group to support these terrorists. The state of Pakistan has decided that it will defeat the terrorists.
“When history is written, on one side will be our brave people and on the other the Tehreek-i-Inteshaar (PTI), which believed there was an advantage in supporting terrorists.”
Talking about the newly appointed Chief Minister of KP, Sohail Afridi, he said that when it came to selecting a CM, they chose someone who has cases against him, “who is known to be involved in drug peddling and drug business”.
Tarar added that this was part of the same black economy through which PTI gains benefits.
The minister asserted that “there have been speculations that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was becoming the militant wing of PTI”.
“I hope this is not true, but this is being speculated”, he said.
‘We stand for the blood of martyrs’: PTI
Meanwhile, PTI leadership held a press conference in Islamabad today in response to DG ISPR’s presser, asserting that the party stands for the blood of the martyrs and warning that misrepresenting PTI would not erase the people’s love for Imran.
“Yesterday, a very emotional press conference was held. We will not respond to it word for word, but we know that we are loyal to Pakistan, and ninety per cent of the country’s people stand with Imran Khan,” said PTI’s Secretary General, Salman Akram Raja.
“Khan Sahib has always made us a nation; we were raised on Allama Iqbal’s ideals. We stand for the blood of the martyrs. Calling us traitors is a misunderstanding that will harm this country,” he said.
 






“For God’s sake, come to your senses. The nation stands with Imran Khan and PTI. You cannot remove the love for Imran Khan from the hearts of the people. The Pakistani nation knows who is truly loyal to this country and this nation.”</p><small>2025-10-11 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/111323449b7665b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948122/2-terrorists-killed-2-injured-in-kps-hasan-khel-police' target='_blank'><strong>2 terrorists killed, 2 injured in KP’s Hasan Khel: police</strong></a><br><p>Two terrorists were killed and two injured during an operation in the Hasan Khel tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Peshawar district, police said on Saturday.

“Hasan Khel police, displaying courage, bravery and professionalism, have repelled the terrorist attack after a 2-hour fight,” he said in a statement. “The police used modern weapons like sniper guns during the encounter.”
“There are fears that the terrorists may be killed during the exchange of fire, as the police thwarted their nefarious intentions through timely action,” the statement said, adding that heavy police force had been called in.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
A day ago, two terrorists, including one reported to be the mastermind behind the killing of four officials in April, were killed in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Bannu district, according to the Counter-Terrorism Department.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on the night of October 10–11, assailants attempted to breach the perimeter of the Police Training School, but “their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response of law enforcement personnel deployed on duty.”
In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the gate of the complex, the statement added.
“Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, police personnel engaged the intruders, eliminating three Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij, the ISPR said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“While cornering the remaining two intruding Khwarij in a building complex, they were later neutralised by security forces in a deliberate clearance operation with precision,” the statement read.
The military’s media wing said that during the intense exchange of fire, six brave policemen, including trainees, “embraced martyrdom after putting up a heroic fight”, while 12 policemen and one civilian were injured.
“During this heinous attack, Khwarij attacked the mosque inside the school complex and not only desecrated the holy place of worship but also barbarically killed the imam [of] the masjid, an innocent civilian who was performing the duties of Imam at the school,” the statement read.
ISPR said the sanitisation operation is continuing in the area, and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice.”
“The security forces, alongside law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) had also issued a statement, saying that the police had repulsed the attack. At the time, officials had said that at least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces.
A report issued by the CTD, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, showed that seven cops were martyred while another 13 were injured in the incident. Dera Ismail Khan Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamid Siddiqui also confirmed the casualties to Dawn.com.
According to the CTD report, the attack took place at 8:30pm on Friday within the limits of the Shorkot Police Station.
“A National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) office near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists,” Dera Ismail Khan AC told Dawn.com.
The initial attack left one police officer dead, the police statement said. It further said that militants then proceeded to enter the school and started firing with heavy weapons and hand grenades, adding that police forces “retaliated bravely” and the exchange of fire went on for about five hours.
“As soon as the news of the attack reached District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed, he rushed to the site with a heavy contingent of police,” the statement read.
Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar was present as well, it said, adding that police were then joined by security forces.
“The police and security forces jointly set an example of courage and bravery in the five-hour-long operation, killing five terrorists and recovering suicide jackets, explosives and ammunition from them,” as per the police statement.
The area has been cleared of the terrorists, and a search operation was underway, the statement said.
Lauding the efforts of the forces in thwarting the attack, KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed was quoted as saying, “The unparalleled bravery of the officers on the frontline has proven that the KP police is committed to eradicating terrorism.”
Announcing compensation for the martyred, he assured that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”. The KP IG also announced special rewards for all those who participated in the operation.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the DI Khan a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday.
Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-10-11 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/11161059f5c1cae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948149/taking-20-wickets-more-important-than-scoring-big-runs-says-shan-ahead-of-pakistan-south-africa-test-series' target='_blank'><strong>Taking 20 wickets more important than scoring big runs, says Shan ahead of Pakistan-South Africa Test series</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan captain Shan Masood believes taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the upcoming two-match Test series against South Africa, as the hosts prepare spin-friendly conditions for the opener at the Gaddafi Stadium from Sunday.
Speaking at the pre-series press conference at the venue on Saturday, Shan said Pakistan’s focus was on creating result-oriented pitches that suit their strengths.
“We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked.
“Sometimes you sacrifice runs to create situations where 20 wickets are possible.”
The Pakistan skipper said the approach reflected lessons from the previous World Test Championship (WTC) cycle, where his side struggled to convert opportunities at home. “The idea is to use our home advantage wisely,” he added.
The Gaddafi Stadium surface, hosting its first Test of the current WTC cycle from Sunday, is expected to offer assistance to spinners. Pakistan are likely to field up to three slow bowlers, with off-spinner Sajid Khan — now recovered from illness — likely to play a key role. Shan also pointed to the option of reverse swing from the pace attack, depending on conditions.
Concerns remain over the recent form of Babar Azam and Salman Ali Agha, but Shan said individual numbers mattered less in low-scoring contests.
“In such conditions, even a fifty can be a match-defining contribution,” he said.
Under scrutiny himself after a lean run, Shan noted that he finished among Pakistan’s top scorers in the last WTC cycle.
“Performance should be judged in context — it’s about winning moments, not averages,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-11 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/111303424831a3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948121/european-commission-reviews-child-safety-on-snapchat-youtube-app-stores' target='_blank'><strong>European Commission reviews child safety on Snapchat, YouTube, app stores</strong></a><br><p>The European Commission is scrutinising safeguards for minors on Snapchat, YouTube, the Apple App Store and Google Play under its Digital Services Act (DSA), it said on Friday.

The odds of Machado winning the prize jumped from 3.75 per cent to nearly 73pc overnight Thursday to Friday on the predictive betting platform Polymarket.
But no expert or media outlet had mentioned her being among the favourites for the prize, which was announced just a few hours later in Oslo.
“You don’t normally see this in the betting market. It’s very suspicious,” Robert Naess, a data specialist, was quoted as saying by Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“I don’t think there have ever been any leaks in the entire history of the prize. I can’t imagine that’s the case,” Norwegian Nobel Committee Chairman Jorgen Watne Frydnes told the NTB news agency.
The institute will nevertheless investigate whether there could have been any leaks, its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, said.
“It’s too early to be categorical about the existence of a leak. But it’s something we will now look into,” he told the Aftenposten newspaper.
The Nobel Institute did not respond to AFP’s requests for comment.
An extremely limited number of people know in advance the name of the laureate chosen by the five members of the Nobel Committee.
In the past, however, unexpected names of Nobel nominees have emerged in the Norwegian media, fuelling speculation about possible leaks, but this has not been the case in recent years.
Machado, an opposition leader barred from running in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election, was awarded “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”, the committee said.</p><small>2025-10-11 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1112452241906a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948114/philippines-begins-clean-up-after-powerful-twin-quakes' target='_blank'><strong>Philippines begins clean-up after powerful twin quakes</strong></a><br><p>Dazed survivors of a pair of major earthquakes in the southern Philippines awoke on Saturday to scenes of devastation, after hundreds of aftershocks rocked the region overnight.
Many coastal residents of Mindanao island had slept outdoors, fearful of being crushed to death by aftershocks of the 7.4 and 6.7 magnitude quakes that struck off the coast within hours of each other on Friday.
Philippine authorities said at least eight people were killed.
Office of Civil Defence Information Officer Ezzra James Fernandez said there were no reported missing.
“As to the initial assessment yesterday, the (infrastructure) damage is minimal,” Fernandez said, adding that road-clearing operations are ongoing and most roads are already passable.
In Manay, a Mindanao municipality of 40,000 residents, people were removing debris and sweeping up broken glass from homes and other buildings Saturday morning.
“Our small house and our small store were destroyed,” resident Ven Lupogan told AFP.
“We have nowhere to sleep. There’s no electricity. We have nothing to eat.”
The destruction came less than two weeks after a 6.9 magnitude quake struck the central Philippine island of Cebu, killing 75 people and wrecking about 72,000 houses.
President Ferdinand Marcos had instructed government agencies to continue relief operations, according to Presidential Communications Office secretary Dave Gomez.
“The President’s paramount concern is the safety and well-being of our people in the earthquake-struck areas,” Gomez told reporters.
800 aftershocks
Some people in Manay slept in tents, under improvised tarps and hammocks, inside vehicles, and on mats laid out in parks or the sides of streets as aftershocks rippled across the region of 1.8 million people.
At the heavily damaged Manay government hospital, patients lay on beds outside waiting for treatment.
Many had been wheeled out on Friday because government engineers said the building had been structurally compromised.
Nearby shopkeepers cleaned up broken glass and put merchandise back on shelves, AFP journalists saw.
Vilma Lagnayo scrambled to save her family’s clothes and belongings from their collapsed home in Manay, a town with poor coastal communities that rely on coconut farming and fishing.
“Reconstructing (our home) is difficult now… Money is a problem,” Lagnayo said.
The Philippine seismology office has recorded more than 800 aftershocks since the first quake struck Mindanao, which is riddled by major faults. It said these are expected to last for weeks.
In Mati, about two hours drive southwest along the coast, Margarita Mulle and her relatives held a wake for her older sister, who had earlier died from a disease, even as neighbours stayed away after tsunami warnings that have since been lifted.
“In case something happens, they (relatives) will carry the body using a ‘tora-tora’,” a tearful Mulle said, using a local term for a hand tractor-drawn cart that is a major mode of transport in rural areas of the south.
Earthquakes are a near-daily occurrence in the Philippines, which is situated on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity stretching from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
An 8.0-magnitude quake off Mindanao island’s southwest coast in 1976 unleashed a tsunami that left 8,000 people dead or missing, the Philippines’ deadliest natural disaster.</p><small>2025-10-11 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/11122311f8bedd7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948109/aurangzeb-heads-to-us-to-participate-in-imf-wb-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb heads to US to participate in IMF, WB meetings</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has left for the United States to participate in the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Saturday.
The visit comes after a IMF mission concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of two lending programmes totalling $8.4 billion without announcing a staff-level agreement (SLA).
A day earlier, the finance minister had expressed optimism that the SLA with the IMF would be finalised next week during his visit to Washington.
According to the Radio Pakistan report, the minister will participate in more than 65 events, forums, ceremonies, and meetings during his six-day visit to the US.
“During his visit, the finance minister will represent Pakistan at the plenary meetings of the IMF and the WB,” the report added.
It further said that Aurangzeb would meet with senior officials from the IMF, the WB, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
The minister is set to meet WB president Ajay Banga and attend a dinner with the Finance Ministers of selected countries at his special invitation, as per the report.
“The finance Minister will also meet IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the G24 and at Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan (MENAP) countries platform,” Radio Pakistan reported.
He will address MENAP forum as a keynote speaker, it added.
It said that he will also participate in a regional roundtable on the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) digital transformation organised by the WB, where tax authorities from other countries are set to discuss their tax reforms as well.
In addition, the minister is expected to attend two other events by the World Economic Forum as well as meet his counterparts from China, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and Azerbaijan, the report said.
Auragnzeb will also hold meetings with top White House officials, and senior officials from the US Departments of State and Treasury and the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), it said, adding that he was also expected to have a meeting with the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of Congress.
“During the visit, the finance minister will also meet with officials from global credit ratings agencies, commercial banks, especially the investment banks from the Middle East,” according to Radio Pakistan.
“The finance minister will visit leading US think tanks, including the Atlantic Council and the Peterson Institute of International Economics (PIIE),” it added.</p><small>2025-10-11 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/110236108e03426.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947924/air-pollution-is-an-administrative-failure-can-pakistan-see-through-the-haze' target='_blank'><strong>Air pollution is an administrative failure. Can Pakistan see through the haze?</strong></a><br><p>The fear of smog has already started lingering upon us. We are once again bracing ourselves to choke in our own neglect. Are we doomed to suffer every year, through climate change, mismanagement, broken promises, or is it just bad luck?
In truth, it seems less a matter of fate and more the outcome of willful ignorance — an ignorance far from blissful, especially given that under Article 9 of Pakistan’s Constitution, the right to life inherently includes the right to a clean and healthy environment.
Numbers tell the story
This contradiction defines our new normal. For the past several winters, Pakistan has ranked as the third most polluted country in the world. Nowhere is this crisis more visible than in Lahore, the country’s second-largest city, where nearly 14 million residents are forced to breathe poison. It’s the most polluted city in the world and in the last five years, its air has met the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) minimum safety standards on only seven days.
The World Bank (WB) and the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) estimates on Pakistan’s air pollution tell a story — one we’ve chosen to ignore for far too long.
The WB estimates that outdoor air pollution in Pakistan is responsible for 22,000 premature adult deaths and the loss of 163,432 disability-adjusted life years annually. Indoor air pollution, meanwhile, causes 28,000 deaths each year and leads to 40 million acute respiratory infections. Furthermore, the 2024 Air Quality Index (AQI) reported that poor air quality shortens average life expectancy by 3.9 years, rising to as much as seven years in heavily polluted cities such as Lahore, Peshawar, Gujranwala, and Rawalpindi.
The effects of air pollution extend far beyond human health, impacting the environment as well as the economy. According to the WB, environmental degradation costs the country around 7 per cent of its GDP, or about Rs365 billion per year, with the burden falling disproportionately on the poor. As an agrarian nation, Pakistan’s agricultural sector also suffers, with 2.6 billion people dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Tropospheric ozone alone causes annual losses of approximately 110 million tonnes of key staple crops such as rice and wheat.
An administrative problem
The challenge of air pollution is neither new nor cyclical; it is a sustained environmental and public health crisis that demands long-term solutions. Its roots lie in systemic causes, ranging from natural factors such as temperature inversions and stagnant winds to human-driven sources like vehicular and industrial emissions, crop burning in agricultural regions, construction dust, combustion of biomass, and transboundary pollution from neighbouring countries such as India.
If we look at international examples such as England and China, it becomes evident that both countries tackled air pollution through strong, well-organised policies built on three key pillars: effective administration, robust governance, and consistent on-ground implementation. Pakistan could take cues from Britain’s landmark Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968, which curbed pollution. These specific laws enforced the use of smokeless fuels in urban areas and mandated factories to transition away from black smoke emissions.
Similarly, Beijing launched a series of forward-looking initiatives, including low-emission zones, an expanded urban rail network, and an advanced integrated air quality monitoring system. Established in 2016, this system leveraged cutting-edge technologies such as high-resolution satellite remote sensing and laser radar to combat air pollution. It also featured a dense PM2.5 monitoring network with more than 1,000 sensors strategically distributed across the city, allowing authorities to precisely identify when and where emissions peaked.
What these examples reveal is that cleaner air is not achieved through isolated fixes, but through strong systems that ensure accountability and follow-through. A discussion of the primary sectors of smog, then, must begin with the understanding that air pollution is, above all, an administrative problem.
Culprits of air pollution in Pakistan
Among the major sources of air pollution, it’s no mystery that transportation stands as the chief culprit behind smog. In Lahore alone, over 4.2 million motorcycles manoeuvre through its congested streets every day, averaging nearly two per household. Across Pakistan, the continued reliance on outdated Euro-II diesel fuel has further eroded air quality. The country’s freight and passenger fleets are still dominated by pre-Euro and Euro II trucks and buses, many of which release dangerously high levels of pollutants.
Weak regulatory enforcement and ineffective vehicle inspection systems allow these aging, smoke-belching vehicles to remain on the roads, making Pakistan’s transport sector one of its most stubborn and toxic sources of pollution.
Transport
Pakistan’s transport system is in desperate need of a major overhaul, particularly in terms of infrastructure. Despite the existence of national environmental quality standards, regular emission testing remains largely unenforced. A clear timeline must be established to phase out vehicles beyond a certain age, especially heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks. The installation of catalytic converters and the nationwide adoption of Euro-5 and Euro-6 standard fuels should be made mandatory. Electric buses, too, must become an integral part of Pakistan’s public transport network.
Encouragingly, the provincial government has launched a vehicle emission testing system in Punjab and begun deploying electric buses in the province. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has pledged to have 1,115 electric buses operational across Punjab by December.
It is critical for Pakistan to accelerate the adoption of a sustainable transportation system including electric buses and vehicles. It is not only essential for meeting the country’s commitments under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but also for easing the pressure on foreign reserves caused by Pakistan’s heavy dependence on imported oil.
Industries
Industrial emissions add yet another layer to the problem. Punjab’s industrial landscape is vast and diverse, with nearly 18,000 factories spread across multiple sectors. These include 718 chemical and petroleum units, 6,324 engineering units, 3,750 food, beverage, and tobacco units, 1,808 leather, rubber, and plastic units, 934 paper units, and 387 non-metal and mineral units.

However, while 560 industries in the Lahore division are formally registered, a sprawling informal sector, including thousands of brick kilns and small manufacturing units, continues to operate outside the regulatory framework. Most industries fail to comply with environmental standards and are often located within cities, dangerously close to residential areas, due to weak state enforcement. As a result, citizens are routinely exposed to pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and PM2.5, both major contributors to smog formation.
The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act of 1997 requires every industrial unit to self-monitor and report under smart rules, yet the reality paints a different picture — only 10 to 20pc of units actually comply. To address this, designated industrial zones should be established to prevent factories from operating near residential communities. Regular third-party audits and strict compliance monitoring must also be mandated to ensure adherence to environmental standards.
Moreover, while Article 9A of the Constitution guarantees the right to a clean and sustainable environment, the implementation of related policies and frameworks, such as the National Clean Air Policy, remains woefully inadequate.
Agriculture
The agriculture sector, particularly crop burning, adds its own share to the haze. The primary source of this pollution is the post-harvest burning of crop residues by farmers in both Pakistan and India — a quick fix that clears the fields but poisons the air for the next cultivation cycle. Satellite imagery from Nasa Worldview, dated November 6, 2024, shows a thick blanket of smog engulfing Lahore, with clusters of fires scattered across the region between Delhi and Lahore.

Pakistan produces around 69 million tons of stubble annually, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), contributing nearly 20pc of the country’s air pollution. To address this, the Punjab Clean Air Action Plan introduced a three-step policy aimed at discouraging stubble burning. Yet, it has failed to eliminate smog.
The government has distributed happy seeders, planters that shred crop residue and mulch it back into the soil, which have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 78pc. However, the sheer volume of crop residue far exceeds the number of machines available, leaving a substantial gap between supply and demand. While these machines were made accessible to farmers in designated red zone districts, their cost remains prohibitive for small and marginal farmers. Making them more affordable would mark a major step toward sustainability, given the significant reduction in emissions they offer.
The government also attempted to impose fines of Rs50,000 per acre on offenders, but the policy fell short of its goals, hindered by inefficient enforcement mechanisms and the lack of affordable technological alternatives. This raises a critical policy question: should Pakistan rely more on carrots or sticks to promote climate-smart agricultural practices?
Construction sector
The construction sector, particularly brick kilns, is a major contributor to air pollution in Pakistan. Many brick kilns burn low-grade coal and waste materials, releasing large quantities of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Additionally, the incomplete combustion of biomass — commonly used as a cooking fuel in rural and low-income households — emits significant amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), soot, and other toxic substances. Together, these emissions have become major drivers of urban smog and deteriorating air quality across the country.
Pakistan should adopt modern, energy-efficient brick kiln technologies such as zigzag designs and expand the natural gas infrastructure nationwide to enable their widespread use. The government should also introduce incentives for the adoption of alternative clean fuels, particularly in areas without access to gas pipelines.
The analysis above suggests that if these sectors were modernised and effectively managed, Pakistan could potentially cut air pollution by as much as 50pc.
A holistic approach and climate diplomacy
Air pollution demands a holistic response, with a clear policy direction and multilateral solutions spanning all fronts including science, policy, and finance. Pakistan already sits on a pile of plans — the National Clean Air Policy, Punjab Clean Air Action Policy, SMOG Control Strategy 2024–25 — but policies without implementation are just paper promises.
Climate diplomacy should be pursued through a formal engagement with the government of India on air pollution, since it is a transboundary issue. Both countries can leverage joint air quality monitoring, data sharing and develop policies that can foster sustainable agricultural practices and reduce emissions.
Decentralised air plans should be adopted that engage stakeholders from all provinces. The private sector should engage in data generation and mapping emission hotspots, delivering research and carrying out advocacy campaigns.
We already know what must be done. The time to act is now because the smog won’t wait for our next committee meeting.

The announcement comes soon after President Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to defend the Gulf Arab state against attacks, following Israeli air strikes targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital Doha.
“We’re signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon, with Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani at his side.
 
 

“The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training” as well as “increase lethality, interoperability,” he said.
“It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.”
 






The Idaho base currently also hosts a fighter jet squadron from Singapore, according to its website.
Hegseth also thanked Qatar for its “substantial role” as a mediator in the talks that led to a truce and hostage-prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, and its assistance in securing the release of a US citizen from Afghanistan.
The Qatari minister hailed the “strong, enduring partnership” and “deep defense relationship” shared by the two countries.
The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is Washington’s largest military facility in the Middle East.
Trump’s close relationship with the leaders of Qatar has raised eyebrows, especially over its gift to the US president of a Boeing 747 to be used as Air Force One.
Though the Idaho facility for Qatar had apparently been in the works since the last administration of Democrat Joe Biden, the deal prompted some hand-wringing on social media, including from far-right activist Laura Loomer, usually a Trump ally.
“Never thought I’d see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,” Loomer wrote on X.
 






Hegseth, who never said it was a base, later wrote on the platform: “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.
We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.“

Authorities rushed to the site and transported the body and the injured boy to a district hospital. 
“Both brothers were passing through the area when a blast took place, which smashed the windowpanes of many shops and buildings,” SHO Javed Ahmed of Dera Allahyar police said.
SHO Ahmed said it was not known who the intended target of the attack was, adding that a further investigation was in progress.

• Okays elevated freight corridor to improve port connectivity
• Accepts proposal of private firm to bring and operate 500 e-buses in Karachi and Hyderabad
KARACHI: In what appears to be a decision that may adversely impact thousands of patients belonging to the lower strata of life, the Sindh government is planning to outsource radiology and diagnostic lab services at two major hospitals in the province, including the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and approved funds to hire “transaction advisers” for the purpose.
A decision to this effect was taken at the 48th meeting of the Public-Private Partnership Policy (PPP) Board, chaired by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, at the CM House on Friday.
According to a press release, the policy board approved “funding to hire transaction advisors for the feasibility study and transaction advisory services to outsource radiology and diagnostic lab services at the Chandka Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Larkana and JPMC, Karachi”.
 






“The health Department intends to implement the project under the public-private partnership (PPP) modality to address serious challenges in operation and maintenance (O&M) of advanced diagnostic equipment such as MRI, CT scan, digital X-ray, ultrasound, and echocardiography,” it said.
It claimed that after outsourcing, the private partner will invest in new equipment, ensure their operation and maintenance, upgrade outdated systems, deploy trained staff, and improve turnaround time for test results, ensuring quality and patient-centred diagnostic services.
Private firm to bring, operate 500 e-buses
The policy board also approved procurement of 500 electric buses for Karachi and Hyderabad, aiming to offer residents a cost-effective, safer, and eco-friendly transportation alternative.
The board endorsed the scope, structure and risk matrix of the Peoples Green Transport Project and also “accepted the amended unsolicited proposal submitted by a private firm, granting it the ‘Right of First Refusal’ and exemption from the prequalification process”.
Under the project, 500 electric buses will be deployed in phases along with depots, charging infrastructure, bus shelters and an automatic fare collection and intelligent transport system.
The project, to be executed on a design, build, finance, manage, operate and transfer (DBFMOT) model with a 12-year concession period, is expected to serve over 200,000 passengers daily and integrate with the Green Line bus rapid transit project (BRT).
Elevated expressway
The policy board approved the development of an elevated expressway to connect the Karachi port with Qayumabad at the Jam Sadiq Interchange.
The CM directed the board to expedite the paperwork so that he could lay the foundation stone of the project.
The board endorsed the project scope, transaction structure and risk matrix, and “approved the unsolicited proposal for competitive bidding”.
The project involves design, finance, construction, and 25-year O&M of a 16.5-km, four-lane elevated freight expressway.
The expressway will reduce travel distance by 26 kilometres, enabling 24/7 heavy traffic movement, easing congestion on urban roads, and improving port efficiency and connectivity with M-9 and Malir Expressway, also called Shahrah-i-Bhutto.
The Board also approved design changes to align with the project with the Yellow Line BRT, add mixed-traffic ramps, improve port connectivity, and avoid major land acquisition.
‘Carbon removal through forestation’
With the intention to restore forest in the riverine areas to minimise the climate impacts and contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gases in Pakistan, the board accorded its approval to a riverine forestation project on approximately 41,000 hectares in districts of Jamshoro and Matiari under the PPP mode.
The forest department was asked to issue the letter of award to the preferred bidders for three bidding packages.
“The project is expected to generate approximately 35 to 40 million carbon credits, which will be monetised through international carbon markets, resulting in significant foreign exchange earnings,” the press release said.
The board also approved engagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a feasibility study for a new riverine forestation project that will be spanned 88,000 hectares approximately.

Authored by Justice Athar Minallah, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, while extending the benefit of doubt, ordered the acquittal of all charges against petitioner Anwar Keneth after accepting his jail plea but with a direction to release him if not required in any other case.
 
 

In a nine-page judgement, the bench consisting of Justices Athar Minallah, Irfan Saadat Khan and Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan also expressed the expectation that the Pakistan Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) executive director, where the petitioner was being treated, will ensure continuation of his medical treatment.
The blasphemy case against Mr Keneth was registered on Sept 25, 2001, by the Gawalmandi police for alleged offences under Section 295C of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Bench says elderly suspect diagnosed with mental illness, prosecution failed to prove case beyond reasonable doubt

The complaint registered by Inspector Nasrullah Khan Niazi concerned the Aug 27, 2001, letter to a person named Haji Mehmood Zafar and following investigation, a report under Section 173 CrPC was filed before the competent court. The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge framed and admitted writing the letter.
 
 

The trial court convicted the appellant under Section 295C and sentenced him to death with a fine of Rs500,000. The high court later confirmed the death sentence.
Subsequently, a jail petition sent through the prison superintendent was received by the Supreme Court in 2014, whereas the letter was sent to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on March 12, 2024.
Later, the PIMH medical board diagnosed the petitioner as suffering from ‘Bipolar Affective Disorder’ (a disorder causing extreme mood swings, including emotional highs and lows) and that the mental disorder was in the ‘hypomanic’ stage. The medical board also advised admission of the appellant to the institute for treatment.
In its order, the Supreme Court regretted that the prosecution in the case produced only two witnesses, Maulana Naeem Akhtar Adnan (PW-1) and Haji Mahmood Zafar (PW-2). The investigating officer of this case did not enter the witness box. It appears that the prosecution, besides producing two witnesses, made no attempt to prove its case against the appellant, the order regretted.
The judgement said the appellant professes the religion of Christianity and that the letter was attempting to propagate and profess his faith with a claim that ‘he belonged to the Juda tribe and a descendant of King David’.
The appellant claimed to be the ‘King of Israel and rule the whole world,’ and asserted that the ‘great Lord of Heavens will establish the Kingdom in Israel’.
In his letter, he attempted to build an argument that his faith was the true religion, the judgement said, adding that the entire letter unambiguously showed its author was suffering from some mental disorder.
The conduct of the appellant during the investigation and the trial was not that of a sane person, the judgement said, adding the contents of the letter reflected signs of grandeur, hallucination, and delusional flight of ideas.
Though the abnormality was obvious from the conduct and contents of the letter, neither the prosecution nor the trial court had the appellant medically examined by specialists in the field of psychiatry.
According to the judgement, the offence under section 295C is penal and attracts the punishment of death. It added that it was a settled principle of criminal administration of justice that the prosecution has to prove its case against an accused beyond a reasonable doubt and it was not absolved of this duty if the accused has been unsuccessful in proving a plea in his/her defence.
The appellant was not aware that his actions were influenced by the mental disorder from which he was suffering, the judgement noted, adding that the culpability of the offence for which the appellant was charged required establishing the ‘actus rea’ and ‘mens rea’.
The opinion of the medical board has raised a serious doubt regarding the existence of criminal intent or ‘mens rea’.The CII, in its interim report, has rightly observed that the followers of all religions enjoy the right to profess, practice and propagate their respective beliefs but the exercise of such right is subject to law, the judgement said.

Mr Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house, despite his resignation not yet being formally accepted by the province’s governor.
In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Mr Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.
 
 

However, the resignation cannot be processed until the governor reviews it. An official on Governor Faisal Karim Kundi’s staff told Dawn the governor was in Islamabad and not expected to return to Peshawar until Saturday (today).

Withdrawal is pending as governor is out of town

“The resignation letter may have arri­ved in mail but I could not say anything in this regard right now,” the official said.
A spokesperson for Gandapur confirmed the chief minister’s departure in a statement, noting that a large number of employees from the chief minister’s house and secretariat were present to see him off. Mr Gandapur thanked the staff for their cooperation during his tenure.
Upon reaching Dera Ismail Khan later in the afternoon, Mr Gandapur was greeted by supporters at the Yarak Interchange who showered his convoy with rose petals. In a brief address, Mr Gandapur reiterated that his political career was focused on public service rather than power.
“My politics was never about power but about serving the people,” Mr Gandapur said, stressing that the trust of his constituents remained his “greatest strength despite his resignation”.
 
 

Meanwhile, a leader from Gandapur’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, said they were awaiting the governor’s approval.
“The moment Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi approves the resignation, the process for the election of the new chief minister would be started,” the PTI leader said.
He noted that any decisions about a future provincial cabinet would be made by the nominee for chief minister, Sohail Afridi, after meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan.
 
 

According to Article 130 (8) of the Constitution of Pakistan, “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor, resign his office.” The governor can, however, invoke Article 133 to ask the chief minister to continue his duties as an interim arrangement until a successor is in place.

Shortly after the shooting, two policemen depl­oyed on the opposite side of the road retaliated and killed him.
 
 

CCTV footage showed a suspect carrying a pistol approached the worship place, Baitul Mehdi, in Rab­wah and opened fire on the security guards, who were volunteers from the community. Six gu­a­­­rds were injured, but they managed to close the main gate of the worship place.
The injured guards were shifted to a nearby hospital where four were reported to be stable while two remained critical. Police shifted the body of the attacker to the morgue.
Attack condemned
Ahmadi community spo­k­e­sperson Aamir Mahm­ood condemned the attack, saying that continuous hate speeches were being made against the community. He urged the state to take notice of such hateful rhetoric and take strict action against those responsible. He demanded effective measures to ensure the safety of Ahmadi community members.
 
 

Chiniot DPO Abdullah Ahmad told Dawn that the worship place had been attacked by a gunman, resulting in injuries to six private security guards.
He said police and the guards returned fire, killing the attacker on the spot. One of the guards was in critical condition, while five were stable, he added. He said the attacker had arrived in a car along with another person. His identification card was recovered from the vehicle.

LAHORE: The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad after Friday prayers, with a large number of supporters reaching Shahdara and staging a sit-in after clashes with police, partially paralysing the provincial capital.
The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures.
In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad.
However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless.
Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road.
Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession.
Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road.
Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan.
Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara).
Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks.
Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd.
 
 

On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents.
A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured.
Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding.
Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released.
Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi.
Talal’s presser
State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said.
 
 

Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted.
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law.
Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest.
Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings.
Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road.
Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic.
However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers.
Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab.
For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march.
A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala.
Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir.
The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

The FO, moreover, also emphasised the need for continued dialogue and cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism.
At the weekly FO briefing, spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the security and well-being of its people.”
 






Pakistan “respects the sovereignty of Afghanistan, and remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering dialogue and cooperation with our neighbour to address the shared challenges of terrorism”, the spokesperson said, adding that the security operations were intelligence-driven and aimed at protecting its citizens from terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement came after twin explosions shook Kabul on Thursday night. Local Afghan media, quoting witnesses, reported fighter jet overflights and bursts of automatic gunfire. They described the blasts as precision air strikes that hit a vehicle and a compound linked to the TTP, suggesting that the intended target was TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud.
Meanwhile, reports on Noor Wali Mehsud’s fate were conflicting. Some Pakistan military-linked social media hailed the strike as a potential blow to the TTP leadership, while pro-TTP channels released an audio message purportedly from the TTP chief denying his death and calling the reports “enemy propaganda”. The incident marks one of the most serious escalations between the two neighbours since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.

Stresses continued dialogue, cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism, says Afghanistan’s sovereignty is respected

Analysts say that if confirmed a Pakistani strike inside Kabul would be the first such incident in the Afghan capital, although Pakistan has previously conducted operations against TTP targets in other parts of Afghanistan.
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces patience has worn out,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said a day earlier in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the Foreign Office briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
India-Afghanistan agreement
The Foreign Office refrained from commenting on the agreement between New Delhi and Kabul to reopen their long-shuttered embassies.
The agreement was reached during talks in New Delhi between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which marked India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021.
“Our position on Afghanistan’s bilateral relations with any other country remains that it is a matter between those two countries,” Mr Khan said, adding, “Afghanistan is a sovereign, independent country, and we do not have any particular comment to offer on it.”
He further noted that Pakistan’s consistent request to Afghanistan, while respecting its sovereign right to pursue an independent foreign policy, has been that Afghan territory should not be used against Pakistan.
