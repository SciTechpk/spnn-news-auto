The double-Olympic champion maintained his tradition of improving on his previous record by one centimetre, with his second attempt at the Istvan Gyulai Memorial overhauling the mark he set in Stockholm in June.
Duplantis had looked a little off his best form, missing his first attempt at 6.11 and, after Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis retired having failed twice at the same height, the Swede had the bar raised to make his usual world record attempt.
 






The 25-year-old twice world champion was unsuccessful on his first try and while he rattled the bar slightly on his second effort, Duplantis looked up almost in disbelief to see he had again reached a new height in the discipline he dominates.
“I love Hungary very much. The track is very good, I love the crowd, I would like to return, thank you,” Duplantis said.
Duplantis, who won his second world title in the same stadium in 2023, ran straight to the crowd to celebrate with his partner Desire Inglander and his family.
On Monday, Duplantis missed most of the press conference ahead of the Budapest meeting, apologising when he turned up late, saying he had a lot of work to do on his time management.
“I think I’ll have to make up for it tomorrow with a big leap,” Duplantis said.
He duly stayed true to his word to the delight of the Budapest crowd, and has now soared 15 centimetres higher than Sergey Bubka, who Duplantis once described as ‘mythological’.
The American-born Duplantis first broke the world record in 2020 in Poland, with his leap of 6.17 surpassing by one centimetre the previous record set by Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie six years earlier.
Lavillenie had beaten Bubka’s best jump of 6.14, which had stood for almost 20 years, but Duplantis has taken the sport to another level and on Saturday competes at the Silesia Diamond League, where he also broke the world record last year.</p><small>2025-08-13 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1312053427eb236.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930636/finance-minister-notes-room-for-lowering-interest-rate-by-end-of-year' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister notes ‘room for’ lowering interest rate by end of year</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that there was room for lowering the monetary policy rate by the end of this year.
After slashing the interest rate by 1,000bps from 22 per cent since June 2024 in seven intervals, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has maintained it at 11pc since May. However, the business community has expressed its intense disappointment over the decision.
Addressing an event in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said: “The monetary policy rate and the market-based exchange rate are very much the purview of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Monetary Policy Committee.
“Having said that, in my personal opinion, I do think there is room to do more in terms of policy rate, and I am very hopeful that during the course of this calendar year, we will see movement on the policy rate going south,” the minister added.
 


He noted that “whether it was average inflation or core inflation”, there was space for the SBP to lower the rate.
“National security and economic stability are correlated,” Aurangzeb further said.
“In the past 1.5 years, we have made strong progress on the economic front,”  he noted, listing: “Increase in the country’s economy and per capita income, stability in the economic sector, record decrease in financial deficit and inflation, improvement in current account surplus and external account, record increase in foreign exchange reserves and remittances.”
Aurangzeb also highlighted a “double-digit increase” in exports in the textile, IT and pharmaceutical sectors.
Observing an improved “local business environment”, he added: “SME (small and medium enterprises) loans have increased by 41pc. Should it be even higher? The answer is yes. But 41pc is not a small or insignificant number.”
“Loans in the agricultural sector have crossed the Rs2.5 trillion figure. Private sector loans have increased by 38pc,” he added.
The finance czar explained that once fiscal discipline is achieved, the government’s borrowing requirement will decrease, and bank and other economic institutions will reach out to the private sector.
He added that the government had reduced its debt servicing by Rs1tr in the past year. “God-willing, our debt servicing will go down by more than 1tr this year as well.”
Recalling his recent meetings with the SBP governor, Aurangzeb emphasised: “We are getting our house in order, which is the federal government. And therefore, it is important that you also take whatever efforts you are making towards the private sector.”
The finance minister also pointed out the record-setting spree at the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which crossed 147,000 points yesterday. He noted a 60pc growth in it, without specifying the timeline.
Aurangzeb then went on to highlight that there had been a “record increase” of 65,000 new investors who have come into the PSX over the last year. Company registrations’ annual levels had also gone above 250,000, the minister said, terming both developments as a “big structural change”.
Speaking about the structural reforms, the minister pointed out the ongoing tariff reforms, which he said were taking place for the first time in Pakistan’s history.
 
 

He highlighted that the reforms aim to explore how to reduce the costs of raw materials and intermediate products so that Pakistan could become an export-led economy.
On the rightsizing plan, the finance czar noted that the process for 43 ministries and over 400 departments was underway. He also reaffirmed that the privatisation of government institutions will speed up this year.

The letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council says the three European powers are “committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon” unless Tehran meets the deadline.
The foreign ministers from the so-called E3 group threaten to use a “snapback mechanism” that was part of a 2015 international deal with Iran that eased UN Security Council sanctions.
Under the deal, which terminates in October, any party to the accord can restore the sanctions.
All three have stepped up warnings to Iran about its suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
That came after Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, partly seeking to destroy its nuclear capability. The United States staged its own bombing raid during the war.
“We have made clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism,” foreign ministers Jean-Noel Barrot of France, David Lammy of Britain and Johann Wadephul of Germany said in the letter.
All three countries were signatories to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the United States, China and Russia that offered the carrot and stick deal for Iran to slow its enrichment of uranium needed for a nuclear weapon.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord in 2018 during his first term and ordered new sanctions.
The European countries said they would stick to the accord. But their letter sets out engagements that the ministers say Iran has breached, including building up a uranium stock more than 40 times the permitted level under the 2015 deal.
“The E3 remain fully committed to a diplomatic resolution to the crisis caused by Iran’s nuclear programme and will continue to engage with a view to reaching a negotiated solution.
“We are equally ready, and have unambiguous legal grounds, to notify the significant non-performance of JCPOA commitments by Iran … thereby triggering the snapback mechanism, should no satisfactory solution be reached by the end of August 2025,” the ministers wrote in the letter first reported by the Financial Times.
End of cooperation
The United States had already started contacts with Iran, which denies seeking a weapon, over its nuclear activities.
But these were halted by the Israeli strikes in June on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Even before the strikes, the international powers had raised concerns about the lack of access given to IAEA inspectors.
Iran halted all cooperation with the IAEA after the strikes, but it announced that the agency’s deputy chief was expected in Tehran for talks on a new cooperation deal.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent a letter to the UN last month saying that the European countries did not have the legal right to restore sanctions.
The European ministers called this allegation “unfounded”.
They insisted that as JCPOA signatories, they would be “clearly and unambiguously legally justified in using relevant provisions” of UN resolutions “to trigger UN snapback to reinstate UNSC resolutions against Iran, which would prohibit enrichment and re-impose UN sanctions.”</p><small>2025-08-13 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13114747518c857.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930633/indian-pm-modi-likely-to-meet-trump-in-us-next-month-newspaper-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Indian PM Modi likely to meet Trump in US next month, newspaper reports</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to meet President Donald Trump during a visit to the United States next month to attend the UN General Assembly meeting, the Indian Express newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.
India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian official familiar with the matter said a decision has not yet been taken, and that countries usually reserve slots for the General Debate at the assembly, which is why India’s “head of government” features in a provisional list of speakers on September 26.
“The list will go through revisions,” the official said, adding that it had not yet been decided if Modi would be going to the assembly. The General Assembly kicks off on September 9, but the debate, the annual meeting of heads of state and government, will be held from September 23-29.
Although the reason for the potential visit will be to attend the UN meeting in New York, a key objective will be to hold talks with Trump and iron out trade and tariff issues that have led to some souring of ties between the two countries, the newspaper reported.
News of a possible Modi trip to the US comes days after Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods to penalise New Delhi for continuing to buy Russian oil.
The penalty took the total levy on Indian goods exported to the US to 50pc, among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
Trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed after five rounds of negotiations over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.
On Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said several large trade agreements were still waiting to be completed, including with Switzerland and India, but New Delhi had been “a bit recalcitrant” in talks with Washington.
Bessent told Fox Business Network’s Kudlow he hoped the Trump administration could wrap up its trade negotiations by the end of October.
“That’s aspirational, but I think we are in a good position,” he said, adding, “I think we can be, we will have agreed on substantial terms with all the substantial countries.”</p><small>2025-08-13 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1311370827eb964.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930511/government-denies-rumours-of-more-mosques-being-razed-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Government denies rumours of more mosques being razed in capital</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Tuesday turned the tables on the protesting clerics, claiming that religious elements were spreading rumours about demolition of more mosques in the federal capital.
The state minister said land on which Madani Mosque and madressah were built had been cleared in the presence of their management.
The minister categorically refuted the reports circulating on social media that the government was planning to demolish another 50 mosques in the middle of the night.
Responding to the religious parties’ protest on Monday over the demolition of Madani Mosque, he said action was taken after seeking consent of the head of the madressah.

State minister says Madani Mosque demolished after seeking consent of seminary head

“We had filmed the entire operation because it was anticipated that such a situation can develop,” he told the National Assembly while responding to a point of order raised by Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) MNA Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri over the issue of demolition of Madani Mosque.
 


Maulana Haideri had maintained that the madressah was shifted but the concerned cleric was not willing to demolish the mosque.
“Once a mosque is built, it cannot be demolished until the day of judgement,” the JUI-F leader said, adding that “this should not happen in an Islamic state”.
He said the relevant minister had given 48 hours to resolve the issue with mutual understanding.
The Maulana referred to the Lal Masjid scenario and said the matter got disturbed due to negotiation delays.
Responding on the point of order, the state minister told the house that the entire operation was conducted in consultation and supervision of the management of the mosque and the seminary and the demolition took place in the presence of its head at the site.
Mr Chaudhry said the mosque and seminary were built illegally on a greenbelt, however, a modern building had been constructed for them at a cost of Rs40 million.
“Besides, reports of an operation against more than 50 mosques in Islamabad were not true,” he said.
The state minister responded by saying that he was grateful to the Maulana for playing role of a great scholar in this matter.
He said since January this year, negotiations had continued with the management of the mosque and the seminary, adding that “we have given a new madressah building in the style of modern schools at a place of their choice”.
He said the actual cost of the land and the building given to the madressah amounted to upto Rs150 million.
Mr Chaudhry denied the impression that an understanding with the government had been reached only over the demolition of the madressah, adding that he had the understanding that mosques were present in all madressahs.
He said the new building was completed in July, and the students had been shifted there and they were allowed to take all necessary items, including fans, with them. He said there were 185 students in the madressah.
The state minister also said if there was any construction on the greenbelt or on the way, decision would be made after consultation with the management of that mosque.
He expressed the hope that the issue would be resolved amicably after return of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi from a foreign visit.

Also, a senior administration officer was held hostage at gunpoint before being freed on the Bypass Road in Mirali tehsil of the district.
The police said unidentified men opened indiscriminate fire on a motorcycle on the Bypass Road, killing riders Mufti Fazlur Rehman and his son, Noor Rehman.
The attackers fled afterward. The police shifted the bodies to the district headquarters hospital in Miramshah.
In another incident, additional assistant commissioner of Razmak Mohammad Younis Yousafzai was held hostage by terrorists for around two hours on the Bypass Road in Mirali tehsil. He was later released.
The terrorists took the officer, along with his guard and driver, into custody and snatched his official vehicle, an AK-47 rifle, a pistol and a 9mm pistol. However, they later fled, leaving the officer and his subordinates behind.
No statement was issued by the district administration on the incident.
Residents resented both incidents, saying at a time when targeted killings and bomb blasts have made the area unsafe, the kidnapping of a government officer in broad daylight shows that the law and order situation has become really bad.
“When the government’s own officers are unsafe, who the people should trust for their safety,” wondered local elder Imran.
The residents demanded that the government take effective measures, arrest criminals and give them severe punishment, besides adopting a “practical strategy” to establish permanent peace in North Waziristan.
TENSE SITUATION: Tensions are running high in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South
Waziristan tribal district as armed groups have blocked key routes, planted improvised explosive devices and frequently exchanged fire with security forces over the last several days.
DSP of Birmal Circle Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn that armed men used a tractor to build an embankment Karmazi Stop, sealing off the Azam Warsak Road.
He said the road closure had forced residents to travel on rough tracks and mountainous terrain, making daily commutes difficult and dangerous.
Tribesmen said the blockade had also restricted access to fruit and vegetable markets, badly affecting traders and orchard owners.
Police officials said the area remained tense for six consecutive days, with reports of IEDs planted at multiple points along the road. In recent days, three culverts and a school were blown up.
According to DSP Shah, late-night gunfire by terrorists happens frequently, heightening fear among the residents.
In a separate incident, a 10-year-old girl was critically injured as terrorists and security forces traded fire in the Dazha Ghondai area. She was taken to the district headquarters hospital in Wana for treatment.
Residents have complained about the worsening law and order situation and said for the last 10 nights, intermittent gun battles had taken place, raising fears of civilian casualties.

An official statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday noted that the reduced tariff will create new opportunities for Pakistani exporters to expand their footprint in the US. The development was discussed during a high-level meeting on US reciprocal tariffs, chaired by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.
The meeting was attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal, Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul, senior officials from the Commerce and Industries Divisions, and more than 30 leading exporters and SMEs from key sectors including apparel, textiles, rice, salt, surgical instruments, sports goods, electronics, food and agriculture, and leather.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.

Islamabad secures the lowest tariffs among regional competitors

Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar highlighted Pakistan’s comparative advantage in the region and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting industry stakeholders in unlocking business potential under evolving global conditions.
 
 

Industry representatives called for consistent and industry-friendly policies to optimise manufacturing costs and secure access to critical inputs. They urged the government to adopt a predictable policy environment that facilitates long-term planning and growth.
Commerce Minister Jam reiterated the government’s focus on export-led growth, stressing both immediate and long-term strategic measures. He assured exporters that their recommendations would be compiled and presented to the Prime Minister for further action.
It was decided to actively pursue the expansion of Pakistan’s export footprint in the US, turning the current tariff reduction into a sustained national advantage for broader socio-economic development.
Separately, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal held a meeting with representatives of Octans Digital Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Interloop Holdings, to discuss sustainability and waste management in Pakistan’s textile industry.

Nine soldiers martyred
On the other hand, a convoy of security forces was ambushed in the southern Washuk district bord­e­ring Iran on Monday night, lead­ing to the martyrdom of nine pers­o­n­nel, including an officer. The ISPR did not issue a statement by the time this report went to print.
 
 

Six soldiers were also injured in the gun battle between the militants and the security forces in the Basima area of Washuk. Sour­ces said the militants ambu­shed the convoy, and three vehicles came under heavy fire. The secur­ity personnel returned fire, and the battle continued for an hour.
“An officer and eight other secu­rity personnel embraced martyrdom while fighting bravely, and six others sustained injuries,” a senior security official said on the condition of anonymity. He said the injured were shifted to the nearby health facility, adding that casualties also occurred on the other side.
The militants also attempted to attack a police station in Basima recently handed over to the police, but the policemen deployed there repulsed it sucessfully, the official said, adding that the fight continued for half an hour. Three policemen were inju­r­ed. “Blood marks on the ground and a motorbike confirm casualties on the other side,” he claimed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday commended the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in the Sambaza area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, APP reported.
The president and prime minister, in their separately issued statements, “appreciated the security forces for killing 50 Indian-sponsored terrorists in the last four days as a testament to their professionalism, bravery, and determination”.
BLA, Majeed Brigade designation
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office welcomed the United States’ decision to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations, also adding Majeed Brigade as an alias to BLA.
 
 

The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, besides being committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.
Also, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in an interaction with the media in Hyderabad termed the designation of Majeed Brigade and Balochistan Liberation Army by the US a success. He said it was the endorsement of Pakistan’s viewpoint by the US.
He said these separatist outfits openly supported India during May’s Pak-India conflict, adding the UN should make such a declaration as well so that international financing to these outfits could be curtailed.
Quetta and Sibi attacks
Furthermore, a police officer was injured in a grenade attack in Sibi, while a police vehicle on patrol escaped a bomb blast in the provincial capital.
Officials said that an unknown motorcyclist hurled a grenade at a police vehicle in Sibi on Monday night near the Government Girls College. The grenade exploded close to the police vehicle and injured a police officer, who was on snap-checking duty in the area.
In Quetta, a police vehicle escaped a roadside bomb attack that occurred on Link Badini Road near the Eastern Bypass. The explosion, however, destroyed a car which was passing through the area. The man driving remained unhurt. “The target was a police vehicle…but it passed the area a minute before the blast,” a senior police officer said. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks.

An interim charge sheet was filed in May against prime suspect Armaghan Qureshi and Sheraz alias Shavez Bukhari.
In the final document, the investigating officer (IO) Muhammad Ali said that the last known location of the victim and the two suspects was the house of Armaghan in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
 
 

He said the victim, Mustafa, had informed his friend Rafay over the phone before going to the house of the prime suspect. Rafay’s statement had been recorded, he added.
The IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from a car in the Hub area.
The report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.
According to him, pending forensic reports from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency had since been received, confirming that the CCTV footage was unedited and had not been tampered with.

The decision was announced during a meeting chaired by Muhammad Hayat Kakar, the provincial transport secretary, on Tuesday.
 
 

Representatives of transporters attended the meeting. The meeting resolved to enforce the Home Department’s directives restricting night travel.
Mr Kakar said all deputy commissioners across the province had been instructed to take measures to halt public transport operating during the night.
Transporters have been directed to install trackers in their vehicles, deploy security guards, and comply with the government’s anti-smuggling measures.

The warning comes as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasts heavy monsoon rains and increased risks of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions.
UNOCHA’s report highlights that Pakis­tan’s geographical location along tectonic fault lines and its exposure to extreme climate variability make it highly susceptible to earthquakes, floods, droughts and other hazards.
These challenges are compounded by political instability, regional conflicts and security issues.

PMD forecasts heavy rains, Glofs, landslides in several parts of country

The report stresses the urgent need for Pakistan to prioritise disaster risk reduction, strengthen early warning systems and invest in community resilience. It also calls for improvements in governance and resource management to effectively address future emergencies while safeguarding long-term development.
“Floods are among the most recurring and damaging disasters, affecting millions of people each year. The devastating 2022 floods alone impacted over 30 million people, causing economic losses equivalent to nearly six per cent of the national GDP,” it says.
In addition to natural disasters, the country is grappling with the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events and disrupted agricultural cycles. Droughts, especially in arid regions, exacerbate water shortages and severely impact agriculture and livestock.
Another monsoon spell
From Aug 14 to 22, Pakistan is expected to experience another spell of monsoon rains, as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned of urban flooding in the country’s upper regions. It has also raised con­­cerns about Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and KP.
Monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea will continue to penetrate the upper regions of Pakistan.

• House witnesses passage of five, introduction of 16 bills
• Fatyana moves Constitution amendment bill seeking creation of West Punjab province
ISLAMABAD: A day after causing a rumpus and boycotting the National Assembly over the conviction of party leaders in the May 9 riots, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers returned to the house on Tuesday for the private members’ day proceedings, allowing Speaker Ayaz Sadiq to complete the legislative agenda, as the assem­bly passed five bills and introduced 16 more.
On Monday, PTI members had lodged a strong, noisy protest and staged a walkout, protesting the convictions of party leaders in connection with the riots.
At the outset of Tuesday’s sitting, the opposition members, led by Asad Qaiser, again staged a walkout from the house when Mr Sadiq refused to give them the floor to move a privilege motion against the authorities denying them a meeting with incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan at Adiala Jail.
As the PTI members started leaving the hall, raising slogans, the speaker once again offered facilitation in the talks between the government and the opposition and went one step forward by nominating Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and veteran PPP MNA Syed Naveed Qamar to engage the opposition.
When Mr Sadiq asked the opposition to propose two names from their side to become a part of negotiations, the latter sought time to come back to him after holding an in-house consultation.
He stressed that dialogue was the only way to resolve political differences and offered to act as a bridge between the government and the opposition.
He also referred to the arrest of Indian Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, noting that even in that case, no “production orders” were issued. He emphasised that no forum was greater than the National Assembly and the Senate as a “grand jirga”, and urged all political forces to come forward to strengthen parliament.
Mr Sadiq said that in the past, he had facilitated the government-opposition talks, alleging that it was the opposition, not the government, that had withdrawn from the negotiation process.
The speaker asked the protesting PTI members to make their talks with the government conditional on the permission for them to meet Imran Khan in jail. “Put this before the government as your demand,” he said.
While refusing to grant PTI leaders the floor to move a privilege motion, the speaker said that such a motion could only be allowed if the members faced hurdles in fulfilling their parliamentary duties, whereas such a question did not arise if someone was not allowed to meet any person.
PTI’s Aamir Dogar argued that the five PTI lawmakers who had gone to meet Imran Khan in jail were denied entry, describing the denial as a breach of privilege.
Mr Qaiser also protested over the non-inclusion of his private member bill granting the right of appeal to the civilians convicted by military courts before a high court.
Law Minister Tarar acknowledged that the bill was being vetted by the law ministry, stating that the government could also bring a similar bill. The minister also reiterated the talks offer from the government, stating that “dialogue is the beauty of democracy”.
He said the confrontation would produce no result, and political issues must be settled by the politicians themselves.
PTI’s Iqbal Afridi also hit out at the speaker over his alleged failure to protect the lawmakers who were last year picked up by the law enforcement agencies personnel from the premises of the Parliament House.
As soon as the opposition members staged a walkout, the speaker started taking up the agenda, which included the introduction and passage of the bills, including those moved by the PTI members.
The speaker expressed his surprise to see Riaz Fatyana and other PTI members back in the house only to move their bills. They said that they had staged “a token walkout” and that they had come back with the permission of the party to introduce their bills.
The National Assembly passed five bills, including the Legal Prac­titioners and Bar Councils (Amend­ment) Bill, 2025; the National Institute of Health (Re-organisation) (Amendment) Bill, 2025; the Acid and Bum Crime Bill, 2024; the Reservation of Special Seats for Deserving Persons in Universities Bill, 2024; and the Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill, 2025. These bills, many of which had already passed through the Senate, were approved by the assembly.
The house also saw the introduction of 16 bills, including a Constitution amendment bill seeking the creation of “a separate province within Punjab, comprising two divisions, namely Faisalabad and Sahiwal, calling it “West Punjab”. This is the first time that such a bill has been introduced in the parliament, as the house has been discussing the formation of South Punjab and Hazara provinces for many years.
The other bills introduced in the assembly included the Public Interest Disclosures (Amendment) Bill, the Guardians and Wards (Amendment) Bill, the Prevention of Obscenity and Indecency in Digital Media Bill, and the Multi-Vendor Electricity Distribution Bill.
Later, speaking on points of order, several PPP lawmakers from Sindh, including Nabeel Gabol from Lyari, protested over long power outages in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi.
The National Assembly will meet again today (Wednesday) at 11am.

“Modi’s India has emerged as a rogue state. This is a strategic new abnormal attempted to be imposed on South Asia by a hegemonic power next door,” she said while speaking at the Institute of Regional Studies on “Pakistan’s Strategic Global Outreach”. 
“It is not business as usual — it is a deliberate attempt to normalise dangerous escalations. Pakistan is not dabbling in an imaginary narrative. Our diplomacy is rooted in ground realities and verifiable facts. Narrative alone cannot be the basis of statecraft,” Senator Rehman emphasised. 
“Modi has brought the Gujarat model to all of India, which is a classic case of Moditwa, a beleaguered India. This doctrine openly prioritises confrontation over dialogue. It openly embraces conflict. It wants to identify an enemy within the country and an enemy without. The enemies within are the Muslims and other minorities, and the enemy without is Islamabad. They have used narrative building as a tool for hostile unilateralism in a hyper-charged, nuclearised environment,” added. 

Says Islamabad’s diplomacy rooted in ground realities, verifiable facts

Sherry Rehman, who is also PPP vice president, said Modi has four ambitions to fulfil: “First, Modi’s India continues to seek to manipulate terrorism as a domestic and international dog whistle, fomenting and supporting instability inside Pakistan, which is totally unacceptable. Second, it negates all calls for bilateral or mediated diplomacy as a tool for engagement, which mature countries do, while targeting Pakistan with aggressive calls for isolation across multilateral forums. That is not happening either, which you can see from the US to China, or the region. 
“Third, it builds a motive for military action as a coercive tool — from cross-border strikes to air-based attacks. It is not a doctrine based on power, it is a doctrine based on fear. Fourth, it embraces unilateralism as the only path on key disputes, including Kashmir. It weaponises a settled Indus Water Treaty by attempting to create irreversible facts on the ground. Israel does the same.” 
The PPP leader said the May limited war redefined deterrence dynamics, yet India and the Modi government remain intent on attempting to cement this “new abnormal” as the region’s status quo. 
Highlighting Pakistan’s diplomatic mobilisation, she credited the coordinated leadership of the prime minister, army chief, Foreign Office and PPP chairman. “Our delegations went from capital to capital during a diplomatic deficit, speaking truths on the ground that others were not hearing. It was a pivotal moment to position Pakistan as a serious, emerging, moderate medium power.” 
Senator Rehmen accused India of creating a gap between reality and fiction even within its own country. “The Modi government has fallen into a commitment trap, driven by BJP-RSS culture and domestic political compulsion.” 
She said India’s institutional framework is in decline, with the government increasingly relying on crisis creation — both internal and regional — to maintain control. 
“From entertainment to mainstream media, India has blurred the line between truth and propaganda. The war showed the world what this abnormality looks like — from the weaponisation of water to fictionalised claims of military successes. India even claimed to have shot down Pakistani aircraft three months after the conflict, but provided no proof,” she added. 
The PPP leader warned against India’s repeated attempts to weaponise water. “This is a completely mala fide intention — turning a treaty into a dispute and breaching long-standing red lines. Once cross-border rivers become weapons, consequences will be dangerous. 
“Pakistan will never accept unilateralism, nor the weaponisation of water, sovereignty, or narrative. We have always sought dialogue, but we cannot repeatedly request engagement from a state that speaks the language of toxicity. The time has come to expose India’s rogue behaviour on all fronts,” she urged.

• Emphasises Pakistan needs modernised irrigation system instead of canals
HYDERABAD: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday demanded a new National Finance Commission (NFC) Award in light of the 18th Amendment introduced in 2010, which devolved several departments and ministries from the Centre to provinces.
Speaking to reporters at a media briefing held at the recently renovated Niaz Stadium after inaugurating Khan Bahadur Hassan Ali Effendi Peoples Park in Qasimabad, the PPP chief said the previous NFC Award preceded the 18th Amendment and since several departments were devolved to provinces with responsibilities, resources should also be allocated to them.
“A new NFC should be formed and the award should be announced forthwith as per constitutional provision,” he said. “It is the incompetence of the Federal Board of Revenue that they don’t collect revenue, and this burden cannot be shared by provinces. It is the fault of Islamabad’s babus (civil servants). Provinces should be given their right so that they can discharge their responsibilities,” the PPP leader added.
He said Balochistan was experiencing a ‘hybrid war’ and federal institutions’ personnel were deployed there to fight terrorism, adding there was a concept of winning hearts and minds in the world because some wars could not be fought with weapons alone. “The federal government should therefore talk to provinces and come up with a new NFC with consensus,” he added.
Speaking about the rumoured 27th Amendment, the PPP chairman said his party had not been approached by the government. “Neither the prime minister nor any federal minister has approached us with proposals of amendments,” he said when asked to comment on the speculations surrounding the supposed amendment.
“I am hearing things about the 27th Amendment, but neither the premier nor any federal minister discussed with me any amendments. The 26th Amendment (passed last year) was a product of political understanding among parliamentary parties; although one party had differed with it due to its personal grievances. PPP conceded ground in ensuring this amendment should get through parliament instead of going for the ‘brute majority option’,” he added.
IWT treaty
About the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), he said India was still reeling from its defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the May conflict and that’s why it reacted cowardly by announcing the ‘unilateral suspension’ of the IWT.
It may be noted that New Delhi held the IWT in abeyance after the April 22 Pahalgam attack and later doubled down on its action, saying it would ‘never restore’ the treaty.
He said that he raised his voice over the issue of the IWT and terrorism. He said India will have to release water for three rivers, failing which Pakistan, being the lower riparian, would demand its right for six rivers.
“The entire country should raise its voice against (India’s) Modi’s attack on IWT,” he said, while also stressing the need for a modern irrigation system. Pakistan needed a modernised irrigation system, as dams and canals were considered by states having surplus water. “Pakistan doesn’t have surplus flows and we need to use available flows efficiently,” he added.
The PPP leader also thanked the US president for slapping maximum tariffs in the US history against India in the wake of their own trade war. “Since the US is not pressing for ‘do more’, Pakistan should capitalise on it as much as possible,” he said. After Pakistan’s victory over India, the military leadership got an edge and this victory was guiding Pakistan’s present discourse, he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said democracy’s health in Pakistan was not encouraging due to repeated martial laws. “Even a weakened democracy is due to the sacrifices of the PPP leaders. We want institutions to remain in their limits and only then can we push back other institutions in their domain…” he said. But on May 9, certain forces crossed their own limits, he added.
He claimed the Higher Education Commission got most cuts in the budget, be it the incumbent or the PTI government, but Sindh released matching funds to keep the HEC alive, shouldering federal and provincial responsibilities. He added that the PPP wanted a university in every district.He agreed with a journalist that Hyderabad’s airport should be made functional, saying that he would discuss it with the prime minister because Air Sial was launched in Punjab and an airport was built. He said if the federal government didn’t agree to their proposal, then the Sindh government would consider launching Air Hyderabad. He regretted that even the Moenjo Daro airport remained dysfunctional.

“The war we fought in May was not a conventional war alone; it was a combination of cyber warfare and the war with weapons,” she said, adding that Pakistan emerged victorious in the hybrid war with India.
“We succeeded in making our infrastructure secure,” she said while highlighting that to ensure protection against cyberattacks the country was working on cybersecurity regulations.
“I suggest our youth to be aware of cybersecurity and we want to make cyberspace safe for children and women,” Ms Fatima said. She also said that as technology advances, the need for cyber security is increasing.
She expressed these views while speaking at ‘Next Gen Cyber Resilience Workshop and Telecom Cybersecurity Award 2024-25’. “We are moving towards a Digital Nation Pakistan,” she said, adding that the Pakistan Telecomm­unications Authority (PTA) is working for cyber security and internet connectivity will improve with the addition of two submarine cables.
 
 

As the ministry is working on a national fiberisation policy, Ms Fatima said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said relevant legislation should be made regarding right of way. “But we need Amendments in the Telecom Act regarding right of way,” she added while admitting that spectrum in Pakistan was limited.
PTA Chairman retired Maj Gen Hafeezur Rehman suggested that people would have to trust and adopt modern technology as it was moving very fast into all walks of life. “We are already behind the world. While we are striving for 5G in the country, China is now talking about 6G,” he said.
He also talked about the challenges of posed by Artificial Intelligence. “AI is being used for fake audio and video messages,” he remarked.
He said that the PSARB rules were almost ready, after the registration of relevant companies the low-orbit satellite-based internet would be launched in Pakistan in near future.
“But along with these, we have to look at the aspect of sovereignty and security of Pakistani data,” he said, adding, “We have to ensure safe use of the internet and social media and the safety of citizens.”

There was no immediate comment from India’s foreign ministry.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern flowing rivers. Pakistan fears its neighbour India could choke its main water supply, with 80 per cent of the country’s agriculture and hydro-power dependent on those three river flows.
In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
 
 

The court, in its ruling that was posted on its website on Monday, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said.

Hague court says India’s hydropower projects must strictly adhere to treaty

Pakistan’s Attorney General, Mansoor Usman, said in an interview on Tuesday that, by and large, the court had accepted Pakistan’s position, especially on the design issue of the new hydropower projects.
“I am sure it is clear now that India cannot construct any of these projects in violation of the court’s decision,” he told Reuters.
 
 

Pakistan’s foreign ministry said that the court ruling said that India had to “let flow” the waters of the three rivers for Pakistan’s unrestricted use. The court said its findings are final and binding on both countries, according to the Foreign Office statement.
However, an Indian official pointed to a June statement by India’s foreign ministry, which said India has never recognised the existence of the Court of Arbitration.
PM issues fresh warning
Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India against any designs on the Indus River, saying that it could not snatch “even one drop” of water belonging to Pakistan amid tensions over the share of hydel resources in the region.
“I want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop from Pakistan,” he said.

Referring to the mini­ster’s remarks, the PAC, chaired by Junaid Akbar, decided to summon the Mini­stry of Interior, State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and other relevant autho­rities in its next session to provide a detailed briefing on the matter. “We will obtain complete records to determine which bureau­crats have acquired plots,” said the PAC chairman.
The committee also discussed the imposition of sales tax in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and decided to seek a briefing on the closure of utility stores, when it meets next week.
During the meeting, audit objections relating to the Ministry of Religious Affa­irs were reviewed, including a case of embezzlement by one of its accounting officers, Muhammad Kaleem, involving Rs12 million in remittances, which allegedly caused significant losses to the ministry.
“If an assistant accountant can commit such acts, what is the Director General of Haj doing there?” questioned Junaid Akbar. The ministry’s secretary, Dr Syed Attaur Rehman, informed the committee that the system had been digitised to prevent such irregularities.
Senator Afnanullah Khan noted that despite the fraud, no red warrants had been issued for Muhammad Kaleem, nor had any property been confiscated. Officials revealed that the accused had secured a Canadian visa beforehand and was currently residing in Canada. The ministry claimed it had immediately written to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to lodge an FIR and had dismissed the individual from service.
The PAC chairman asked the Ministry of Interior whether Interpol had been contacted in the matter.
The meeting was informed that Kaleem and his spouse had both been declared absconders. According FIA, both were last reported to be in the US.
The committee expressed dismay that, despite four years having lapsed, the ministry had shown no interest in pursuing Kaleem to recover approximately Rs43m embezzled.
It also questioned the ministry about its staffing in Saudi Arabia. PAC members raised concerns over the number of officials posted there and their year-round duties. “We don’t need as much staff from Pakistan. We require more local staff,” officials responded, adding that 1, 700 staff engaged for Haj duties – to assist pilgrims - were provided return tickets annually.
Lawmakers suggested that Pakistani workers already based in Saudi Arabia should be employed for seasonal duties. “I never see these officials - I don’t know where they go,” remarked Senator Mohsin Aziz.
When asked whether government employees were sent for Haj free-of-cost each year, the Secretary of Religious Affairs clarified that only Haj assistants - all of whom were government employees - received such facilitation. He further proposed that, from next year, only assistants in Grade 11 and above would be appointed, adding, “No one performs a free Haj except these assistants.”

This strategy has been chall­enged by the Ministry of Plan­n­ing, which believes low disbu­r­sements in the first quarter negatively impacted project off-take. The minister has directed the Ministry of Fina­nce to increase first-quarter PSDP releases from 15pc to 20pc and reduce last-quarter rele­ases from 40pc to 30pc to ensure steady project execu­tion throug­hout the year, accor­ding to a written statement.

The Ministry of Planning has accordingly authorised the release of Rs141bn (about 14pc of the PSDP outlay) in the third week of July. “Releases to the Azad Jam­mu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are to be made biannually due to seas­onal constraints,” for which the Ministry of Planning has written to the Ministry of Finance.
On the occasion, Mr Iqbal said that Pakistan’s economy had entered a phase of susta­ined stability, with all major macroeconomic indicators showing positive trends during 2025. GDP growth is on an upward trajectory, inflatio­nary pressures have eased significantly, and both exter­nal and fiscal sectors have stabilised, the minister said.
 
 

In July alone, exports grew by 17pc, reaching $2.7bn compared to $2.3bn in the same month last year, which showed the gover­nment’s “priority to ensure continuous growth in exp­orts as a driver of economic progress”, he said.*
The minister said the country recorded a current account surplus of $2.1bn in FY25, compared to a $2.1bn deficit the previous year — marking a positive turnar­ound of $4.2bn, the highest surplus in 22 years. Remittances also increased by 7.4pc in July, reaching $3.2bn, indicating strong confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the government’s economic management, he said.
On the fiscal front, the minister said the deficit declined to 5.4pc of GDP, the lowest in eight years, while the primary balance posted a surplus of 2.4pc of GDP — its highest level in 24 years. “Improved fiscal discipline has enabled the government to spend over Rs1.068tr on development projects in FY2025, achieving a historic 98pc utilisation rate,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said global confidence in Pakistan’s economy had strengthened, with international financial institutions and rating agencies acknowledging the turnaround. Barron’s described Pakistan’s recovery as a “macroeconomic miracle”, while Fitch, Moody’s and S&P upgraded the country’s ratings and outlook.
The pace of price increases has fallen sharply, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate dropping to 4.1pc in July 2025 from 11.1pc in July 2024, and the annual inflation rate down from 38pc to just 4pc, he said, quoting the development outlook, adding that “this downward trend in inflation is expected to continue, providing relief to the people”.
The minister noted that the Pakistan Stock Exchange crossed the 141,000 mark on Aug 1, driven by a new trade agreement with the United States, which secured the lowest tariff rates in South Asia. “It is now up to our business community to take full advantage of this opportunity,” he added.
Talking about the agriculture sector, he said that for the first time, comprehensive national agricultural data had been collected through the 7th Agriculture Census 2024, which will support evidence-based policymaking for food security, climate resilience and rural development.
In July 2025, the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) approved eight major projects and recommended three to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), expected to create over 2,000 jobs. Cost rationalisation measures saved Rs40bn in development projects, reflecting a strategic and efficient approach to public sector planning.
On the technological front, Pakistan successfully launched its Remote Sensing Satellite from China on July 31, 2025, which will aid in agriculture monitoring, urban planning, disaster management and climate change analysis, Mr Iqbal said, adding that in 2026, Pakistan’s first astronaut will conduct scientific experiments in collaboration with China.
He said that under the Prime Minister’s Ba-Ikhtiyar Naujawan Internship Programme, the Uraan Overseas Summer Internship Scholar Programme received over 2,300 applications from 45 countries, with 31 top-performing students selected and placed in key divisions of the Planning Commission.
He reiterated the government’s commitment to accelerating export-led, technology-driven projects under the PSDP 2025-26, with a focus on youth and women empowerment, climate resilience and inclusive development.
“Pakistan’s macroeconomic stability, coupled with structural reforms and strong international partnerships, is driving private sector growth and innovation. The government is determined to sustain this momentum to secure a prosperous and resilient future for the nation,” he said.

All illegal Afghans living in Pakistan were asked by the government to return to their country by July 31st.
A large number of Afghan refugees went back to Afghanistan after the deadline fixed by the Pakistani authorities expired, but a large number of refugees did not go back to their country.
Due to this situation, the government decided to launch a legal action against them and joint teams of police, Frontier Corps, FIA and district administration were formed that took action against the Afghans who had ignored the Pakistan government’s deadline.
On Tuesday, a meeting, chaired by commissioner of Quetta division, Shahzeb Khan Kakar, reviewed ongoing crackdown launched against illegal Afghans living in the province.
The meeting was attended by deputy commissioner of Quetta retired Captain Meharullah Badini, assistant commissioner Kaleemullah and representatives of police, FIA, Nadra, special branch, PTA, home department and other relevant agencies. Deputy commissioners of Qila Abdullah and Pishin as well as the SP of Pishin joined the meeting online.
The officials concerned informed the meeting that coordination between all agencies and institutions had been strengthened to speed up the operation against illegal Afghans. 
The commissioner instructed participants of the meeting to carry out operation against undocumented Afghans daily, and record of all illegal residents’ bank accounts and mobile SIMs be collected. 
He stressed the need for involving local elders and community leaders to ensure that the process of sending illegal Afghans back to their country takes place in a peaceful manner.
The commissioner also directed that special care must be taken regarding women and children during the operation, and that all departments must work in close consultation and coordination to devise an effective strategy to ensure repatriation of all illegal Afghans to Afghanistan.

The fast bowler blew away the Pakistan top order en route to figures of 6-18 as the tourists were bundled out for just 92 in a chase of 295 to win.
The Windies had reached 294-6 in their 50 overs batting first, powered by captain Shai Hope’s brilliant unbeaten hundred.
The Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
Pakistan’s reply got off to a horrendous start as Seales removed Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique and Mohammad Rizwan inside the first three overs to reduce them to 8-3.
Seales then trapped Babar Azam lbw for just nine to leave Pakistan’s hopes of a 2-1 series win in tatters.
Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took two wickets through the middle overs, before Seales returned to remove tailenders Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah and complete a six-wicket haul.
Pakistan had started strongly with the ball after winning the toss and electing to field, as the West Indies struggled to find the boundary.
The home side were 68-3 when Keacy Carty was dismissed lbw by Abrar for a 45-ball 17.
The usually big-hitting Sherfane Rutherford also never got going and crawled to 15 from 40 deliveries.
But Chase helped revive the innings with a quickfire 36, before being bowled by Naseem. Motie was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz as the West Indies batting effort threatened to peter out.
But Hope and Justin Greaves plundered 110 runs from the final 8.1 overs in a blistering assault to get their team close to 300. Hope finished on 120 not out.
