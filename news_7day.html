The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
A day ago, the Times of India claimed that Pakistan “refused” to open the gates at the Wagah border, leaving dozens of Pakistanis “stranded in the no-man’s-land of diplomatic deadlock.”
Late on Thursday night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to media queries about the availability of the Wagah border crossing for Pakistani citizens returning from India.
It issued a statement saying: “The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges.
“Many patients with fragile health had to return to Pakistan without completing their treatment. Furthermore, there are reports of families being split and children being separated from one of their parents.”
 






The last date to cross over through the Wagah-Attari border was April 30, 2025, it said.
“In that context, we are aware of the media reports indicating that some Pakistani nationals are stranded at Attari.
“We are open to receiving our citizens in case the Indian authorities allow them to cross the border from their side.
“The Wagah border will remain open for Pakistani citizens in the future as well,” she said,
On April 24, India revoked the visas of Pakistani nationals and ordered them to leave the country.
“In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, the Government of India has decided to suspend visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect,” AFP reported.
“All Pakistani nationals currently in India must leave India before the expiry of visas, as now amended.”</p><small>2025-05-02 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0210505728f6905.jpg?r=105103' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907844/punjab-health-dept-to-hire-daily-wage-doctors-to-keep-hospitals-functional' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab health dept to hire daily-wage doctors to keep hospitals functional</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE/Rawalpindi: As the Young Doctors’ Association (YDA) Punjab chapter on Thursday threatened to shut down indoor services at all the public sector hospitals across the province from the coming Monday, the health department issued an order to hire doctors on daily wages to keep the healthcare facilities fully functional, besides terminating services of 12 more young doctors.
The health authorities have already cancelled leaves of all doctors and nurses in the province.
Holding a presser in Lahore, the YDA Punjab leaders announced expanding their agitation province wide in response to the terminations and suspensions of young medics and nurses by health authorities, saying they were not be afraid of the departmental punishments, victimisation and arrests by police.
Meanwhile, senior representatives of the Punjab Nurses Association (PNA) and the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) also came forward in the YDA’s support.
Earlier, the young medics shut down the OPD services at different public sector hospitals in the province for the last 10 days, while the government responded by terminating services of 17 doctors and nurses for denying treatment to patients.

YDA Punjab warns of closure of indoor services from Monday

YDA Punjab chairman Dr Salman Haseeb told journalists on Thursday that the Lahore police lodged two cases against more than 400 employees of the government hospitals who were protesting peacefully against the outsourcing of the health facilities.
He said the police allegedly tortured and arrested many employees, including the YDA leaders.
He also condemned the actions of the health department, saying the employees reserved the right to lodge a protest for their “legitimate demands” under the law of the land.
The YDA leaders and nurses urged three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to intervene and resolve the issue on the table.
They alleged that some elements in the health department were misleading the Punjab government by distorting facts regarding demands of the protesting employees.
They said that they were ready for negotiations with the government representatives only. To a question, the YDA Punjab chairman said that all the health sector employees, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, have decided to close down the indoor services at all the state-run hospitals from coming Monday, if their demands were not accepted.
There are reports that the Punjab health department has terminated services of more than 30 young doctors and nurses so far for closing down OPD services at the state-run hospitals and denying treatment to patients. A senior official of the Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) told Dawn that the RMU called a meeting of professors and the administrations of the Holy Family Hospital (HFH), Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) and Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital (RTH) to deal with the situation following the YDA announcement of shutting down indoor services at the hospitals across Punjab.
He says that doctors from tehsils have been brought to run the OPDs in the major hospitals and disciplinary action has been taken against the YDA’s local leadership for not performing duties.
On the other hand, YDA’s Rawalpindi chapter president Dr Aarif Aziz says that his services were terminated by BBH administration and of the association’s secretary general Dr Fakhar has been suspended from the service.
He says the YDA’s general meeting has been called on Friday (today) to chalk out a plan to deal with the new situation. However, he says, no strike was observed in emergency and other wards in any hospital in Rawalpindi.
He says that the doctors are protesting against the “wrong decision” of the government and instead of victimising them, the government should sit on the table and resolve the issue.
“We are not demanding salaries, but we are struggling to save the public sector hospitals from the contractors,” he says.
He says that outsourcing means patients will be deprived of affordable treatment. He added that medical education and training will also be negatively affected and employment and working conditions of doctors will deteriorate because of outsourcing health facilities.

Indian airlines are bracing for higher fuel costs and longer journey times after Pakistan shut its airspace to the neighbouring country’s carriers in a tit-for-tat retaliation following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir last week.
Air India on April 27 asked the Indian government for a “subsidy model” proportionate to the economic hit, estimating a loss of more than 50 billion Indian rupees ($591m) for each year the ban lasts, according to a letter sent by the airline to the Civil Aviation Ministry seen by Reuters.
“Subsidy for affected international flights is a good, verifiable and fair option … the subsidy can be removed when the situation improves,” the letter said.
“The impact on Air India is maximum due to airspace closure, due to additional fuel burn…additional crew.”
Air India declined to comment. India’s Civil Aviation Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Air India’s letter was sent after the government asked its executives to assess the impact of the airspace ban on Indian carriers, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
The Tata Group-owned airline is in the midst of a multi-billion dollar turnaround after a period of government ownership, and growth is already constrained by jet delivery delays from Boeing and Airbus. It reported a net loss of $520m in fiscal 2023-2024, on sales of $4.6bn.
Air India, which has a 26.5 per cent market share in India, flies to Europe, the United States and Canada, often crossing Pakistan’s airspace. It operates many more long-haul routes than bigger domestic rival IndiGo.
Data from Cirium Ascend shows IndiGo, Air India and its budget unit Air India Express had roughly 1,200 flights combined from New Delhi scheduled for Europe, the Middle East and North America in April.
The Indian government is considering options to reduce the hit to the airline industry from the closure of Pakistan’s airspace, three other people familiar with the matter said.
One of the sources said Indian carriers met with the Civil Aviation Ministry to work on possible solutions, including flying over difficult terrain closer to China, and some tax exemptions.
In its letter, Air India asked the government to liaise with Chinese authorities for certain overflight clearances, without elaborating.
It also asked the government to approve the carrying of extra pilots on flights on the United States and Canada to account for longer travel times.</p><small>2025-05-02 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02104416b710a25.jpg?r=104607' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907890/gender-apartheid-a-major-curb-on-afghan-economy-says-undp' target='_blank'><strong>‘Gender apartheid’ a major curb on Afghan economy, says UNDP</strong></a><br><p>KABUL: Restrictions on women and girls imposed since the Taliban authorities took power are projected to cost Afghanistan almost six percent of its GDP over two years, the UN development agency country director said on Thursday.
Taliban authorities have squeezed women out of education, jobs and public life since 2021, creating what the United Nations has called  “gender apartheid”.
The social and economic exclusion of women and girls is expected to amount to cumulative losses of $920 million — 5.8 percent of GDP — between 2024 and 2026, according to a new UN Development Programme (UNDP) report.
“It’s a major hit to the economy,” Stephen Rodr­iques, UNDP representative in Afghanistan, said.
Only seven per cent of women in Afghan households are employed, whe­reas women’s participation in the workforce was around 15pc before the Taliban takeover, Rodriques said.
Removing restrictions on women’s access to jobs and on their freedom to travel without a male guardian  “could see a dramatic increase in women’s employment”, he said, as well as likely encouraging donors to  “release more funding” to the country.
The report warned that Afghanistan, facing the world’s second-worst hum­a­­n­i­tarian crisis after Sudan, is  “sinking deeper into socioeconomic crisis”.
Modest economic gro­wth in 2023-2024 hinged on humanitarian and dev­elopment assistance flowing into the economy such as through cash-for-work projects that gave households spending power.
Aid to Afghanistan has decreased in recent years, with restrictions on women’s rights a major sticking point.

The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
“Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’ show.
“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance added.
Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it “terror” and “unconscionable,” while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.
India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington’s ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
In recent days, Washington urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.” India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.
The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“This government is in constant communication,” State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at her daily news briefing
“We are asking for a responsible resolution from both parties.”
“As the President articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the US stands strong with India against terrorism, and Prime Minister Modi has our full support,” she said.
Bruce said Secretary Rubio encouraged both countries to work toward a responsible solution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia.
“We continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries, as I mentioned, at multiple levels.”
Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.
After the attack, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries closed airspace to each other’s airlines. They also exchanged fire across their border.
Pakistani ambassador, UN chief discuss ‘evolving security situation’
Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.
“The discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,” a press release issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.
“The ambassador reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability,” it added.
 






Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.
Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.
“So I don’t think there would be any travel until there’s a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they’ve both accepted his good offices,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-02 05:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681403e98fd9f.gif?r=091508' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907870/resolving-kashmir-dispute-would-cement-trumps-legacy-as-peacemaker' target='_blank'><strong>‘Resolving Kashmir dispute would cement Trump’s legacy as peacemaker’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India, Dawn.com reported.
In a recent interview, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told Newsweek that for a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.
The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to top Pakistani and Indian leaders, urging a de-escalation of tensions in the Subcontinent.
“If we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker — or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes — I don’t think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,” Newsweek quoted him as saying.
“We are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,” he said.

Pakistan’s envoy to US says no issue ‘higher or flashier’ than Kashmir; says Pakistan focusing on geo-economics, doesn’t want to fight India

In his inaugural speech as the US president, Trump had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”
On his watch, a ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between Israel and Hamas, and the US has also been engaging with Ukraine and Russia to halt their war.
According to Newsweek, Mr Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.
 
 

“I think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,” the envoy said.
He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, “rather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side”.
If the long-standing Kashmir dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. “All the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,” he noted.
‘Geo-economics’ over geopolitics
Separately, speaking to the Washington Post, Mr Sheikh said that the country could not afford a distraction at a point when things were looking up, economically.
“The only thing we need right now is a peaceful neighborhood.”
“We do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,” Mr Sheikh told Newsweek.
“We want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity. We would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,” he asserted.
Reiterating Pakistan’s stance, the envoy rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan’s interests.
“Pakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geo-economics,” the envoy told Newsweek.
‘Outlandish’ Indian claims
Terming it “so outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan” for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.
Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a “false-flag operation” conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was “enough circumstantial evidence, history, […] immediate backdrop and setting […] to entertain that possibility.
Speaking about India’s unilateral suspension last week of the IWT, Sheikh warned that if there was “even an attempt or a semblance of an attempt” to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.
While contending that it was “physically impossible” to hold water, the envoy said “all bets are off if it’s about food security of 250 million people”.
“If you threaten me with this kind of a situation, which is existential, what is your expectation of response?” he asked.

The growing trade deficit raises concerns among decision-makers, mainly due to the rising influx of petroleum products. Meanwhile, export growth to select countries in the region remains minimal, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
Petroleum consumption has risen in the current fiscal year because the crude oil import rose 14.61pc in quantity in the first eight months of the FY25 from a year ago.
In FY24, the imbalance with the Middle East narrowed by 20.47pc to $13.014bn from $16.365bn over the preceding year, mainly due to lower petroleum imports amid falling consumption owing to rising local prices.
Exports to the Middle East rose 4.47pc to $2.381bn in July-March from $2.279bn over the same period last year. In FY24, the exports to the region grew 35.23pc to $3.155bn compared to $2.33bn in the preceding year.
At the same time, Pakistan’s imports from the Middle East grew 9.02pc to $12.883bn in 9MFY25 from $11.817bn over the same period last year. In FY24, the imports declined 13.53pc to $16.16bn compared to $18.69bn in the same period the preceding year.
Pakistan has recently signed a free trade agreement with the Gulf Coope­ration Council states to minimise its trade imbalance with the region. The demand for Pakistani products surged in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar during the period under review.
Exports to Saudi Arabia rose 6.95pc to $552.26m in July-March from $516.34m over the same period last year. In FY24, exports to Saudi Arabia rose 40.98pc to $710.335m from $503.851m in FY23. The imports from the kingdom saw a decline of 15.15pc to $2.828bn against $3.333bn in the same period last year.
In FY24, imports from Saudi Arabia declined by 0.01pc to $4.49bn against $4.50bn in the preceding year.
Exports to UAE increased 8.27pc to $1.610bn in July-March from $1.487bn over the last year. In FY24, exports to the UAE surged 41.15pc to $2.082bn from $1.475bn in FY23, primarily due to a significant rise in exports to Dubai.

The report titled Intimid­ation on All Fronts: Press Freedom and Media Safety in Pakistan, released on the occasion of the World Press Freedom Day 2025 falling on May 3 (Saturday), says the year began with the passage of the much-opposed Pakistan Electronic Crimes Amendment Act, 2025, in January which heightened concerns about legal consequences journalists may face for their reporting, particularly online.
In addition to these, punitive measures including restrictions on advertising to certain media outlets have also been documented. The suspension of advertisements to Dawn, the leading English newspaper of the country, who issued a public response defending its editorial policy, and the Ministry of Information’s stoppage of advertisements to Daily Sahafat, highlight the underhanded methods used to financially cripple media outlets.
In what has become the norm, the lack of accountability and the role of state bodies — in 2024-25, the FIA set a dangerous pattern of action against media professionals.
At the same time, forms of physical violence, including assault and manhandling as well as arrests, detentions, and the issuance of threats to journalists, continued to undermine the safety of media professionals and served as tools to intimidate the media alongside other punitive measures, including the suspension of advertising to media outlets.
In 2025, PPF documented at least 34 cases including seven instances of case registration, one defamation notice, three instances of call-up notices by the FIA, two arrests, four detentions, two abductions, at least six instances of assault and two of manhandling, two attacks on property including a raid, three instances of threats including a threat of legal action and threats to family, and two of online harassment.

Speaking at the Balochistan Bar Association, Mr Mengal criticised the authorities for their inaction following a suicide attack near the BNP-M sit-in camp in the Lakpass area. “It has been over three weeks, yet no investigation has been initiated, nor have the perpetrators been identified,” he regretted.
Mr Mengal, a former chief minister of Balochistan, expressed dismay at the silence of state institutions, lamenting that the authorities concerned had yet to launch an investigation.
“The judiciary and parliament were not working independently and not playing their true role,” he claimed, adding that those who simply read out decisions written by others were decorated with medals.
He also expressed doubts about the legitimacy of the electoral process, referring to what he described as “Form-47 manipulation” — a term often used to denote rigging through falsified results. “Rubber-stamp legislators cannot make decisions based on merit. A rubber-stamp parliament cannot lead the country towards progress,” he said.
He warned that the limited provincial autonomy granted under the 18th Amendment was under threat. He also condemned the state’s failure to address enforced disappearances across Balochistan. “My faith in the parliamentary system has eroded completely,” he said.
Mr Mengal also criticised Islamabad’s role in regional conflicts, stating: “We pushed Afghanistan into war for dollars and ran this country on the fuel of Afghan refugees for 40 years.
“Now, they should be repatriated with dignity.”

In a detailed research in the half-yearly report on the State of the Economy 2024-25, released on Monday, the central bank observed that one of the key underlying issues facing Pakistan’s economy was weak competitiveness.
“From a macroeconomic perspective, this is reflected in consistently declining exports (as a percentage of GDP), low FDI, and overall insufficient integration with global value chains (GVC),” said the report.
From a micro perspective, this is reflected in the low quality of products, the higher unit cost of production, inability to create brands in international markets, and other ancillary indicators, the report added.

Pakistan’s labour productivity is the lowest among peer economies

The country’s productivity growth has been declining, even though productivity has featured in the government’s broad economic policy frameworks since at least the late 1990s, according to the report.
Pakistan’s economy has been caught in boom-bust cycles for more than five decades, with recurring episodes of high inflation and external account pressures, said the report, adding that historically, these cycles comprised three to six years of relatively high growth followed by a crisis — particularly balance of payments crisis — that necessitated urgent stabilisation measures.
“In recent decades, however, the frequency of boom-bust cycles has increased with the boom periods getting shorter. Moreover, access to external support has become challenging, warranting implementation of deep-rooted and long-pending structural reforms to address the underlying issues,” said the report.
Labour productivity
Pakistan’s labour productivity (LP) growth, measured as a change in GDP per worker, is among the lowest compared to its peer economies.While average annual growth in GDP per worker in the last two decades increased by about 1.0 percentage points over the average growth in the preceding decade, it remains low compared to peer economies by income — lower-middle-income countries (LMIC).
Labour quality in Pakistan accounted for 21pc of the improvement in labour productivity during 2000-2022, compared to 61pc in ASEAN economies.
Several attempts have been made in Pakistan to increase exports and attract FDI to kick-start economic growth. With some exceptions, most such attempts have been based on the low road model (short-term approach) coupled with the protection of domestic industries on the premise of infant industry.
However, these approaches have not delivered desirable outcomes; nor have foreign aid, grants, loans, privatisation and other windfall or external endowments sustainably driven long-term growth prospects, said the report.
It is productivity growth, which is the biggest structural driver of competitiveness, that boosts the economy’s ability to continue to export competitively, attract FDI, and sustain economic growth, said the report.
An important dimension is that while the short-term offers quick gains, it is inherently unsustainable.
Similarly, solely relying on exchange rate undervaluation to compensate for the high cost of production, lack of innovation, low product quality, etc., could be counterproductive, said the report.

Speaking at the ‘Workers and Employers in 2025: Navigating Change with Harmony’ conference organised by the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Justice Mandokhail urged the government to recognise mining as a formal industry, highlighting the severe conditions faced by miners in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
He expressed deep concern over the lack of institutional safeguards for mine workers and called for comprehensive legal and administrative reforms to ensure their welfare and protection.
Justice Jawad Hassan of the Lahore High Court praised Pakistan’s progressive labour legislation, noting its longstanding tradition and international commitments.
In his opening remarks, retired Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, chairman of NIRC, reaffirmed the commission’s mandate to balance industrial progress with workers’ rights protection.
Prominent jurist Barrister Dr Zafarullah Khan stressed the Islamic foundations of labour justice, noting that “lawful and hard-earned income is an act of worship”.
Minister for Law and Justice reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the NIRC’s mandate, emphasising that fair dispute resolution and protection of workers’ rights were in line with international standards.
Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain highlighted skills development as central to providing decent employment opportunities. He acknowledged the ILO’s role in supporting vulnerable workers and called for an institutional framework for effective labour dispute resolution.
Speaking on the occasion, ILO Country Director Geir Tonstol said that “tripartite dialogue is not just beneficial, it is essential”.
He added, “In today’s evolving world of work, industrial harmony depends on inclusive, consensus-driven solutions that reflect the lived realities of our labour force. The ILO is proud to support Pakistan’s journey towards fairer, safer and more equitable workplaces.”
The national conference called on the government, employers and workers’ organisations to enhance institutional capacity, promote labour law compliance, invest in dispute prevention and resolution mechanisms and promote a culture of open dialogue and mutual respect at all levels.
The event proposed establishing a national tripartite forum to address emerging workplace challenges proactively. Participants underscored resolving labour disputes through social dialogue, conciliation and mutual understanding, reaffirming that labour rights must ensure decent working conditions and workplace safety.
The conference was attended by a large number of workers, legal experts and dignitaries, including retired Justice Mian Shakirullah Jan, former Supreme Court judge Syed Atique Shah, the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court, and Supreme Court Bar Association General Secretary Salman Mansoor Siddiqui.
Right to dignity
Meanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi emphasised on Thursday that Labour Day serves as a solemn occasion to pay tribute to the resilience, dedication and sacrifices of the working men and women, whose contributions are foundational to national development and economic growth.
In his Labour Day message, Justice Afridi highlighted the judiciary’s responsibility as the guardian of constitutional rights, reinforcing the importance of social justice, equity and labour rights protection.
“The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan embodies the right to dignity, fair remuneration and just and humane conditions of work as fundamental principles of policy,” he said.
“These rights are not merely aspirational — but are enforceable legal and moral obligations for the State. The judiciary, as guardian of the Constitution and arbiter of justice, bears a profound responsibility to ensure that these guarantees are realised in both letter and spirit,” he added.
The CJP stressed that historically, Pakistani courts have played a pivotal role in safeguarding labour rights, addressing exploitative practices and interpreting protective labour legislation. The judiciary “has strived to act as a bulwark against discrimination, coercion and inequality at the workplace”, he said
He urged judicial forums handling labour matters to remain vigilant about socio-economic realities faced by workers, emphasising the judiciary’s commitment to accessible, expeditious and fair adjudication of disputes.
He called for strengthened institutional mechanisms to promote decent work, eliminate forced and child labour, ensure workplace safety and uphold labour dignity, fulfilling the constitutional promise of a just society.

Jason Miller, a long-time adviser to President Donald Trump, signed a $150,000-a-month contract to represent the Indian government — his first formal lobbying role during Trump’s second term.
According to filings with the US Justice Department, seen by Dawn, Miller will provide strategic counsel, tactical planning, lobbying, and public relations services to New Delhi.
A communications strategist, Miller played a key role in both of Trump’s presidential campaigns, and served as a senior adviser in the White House.
He later launched the social media platform Gettr, which was promoted as a pro-free speech alternative to Twitter, and remained active in conservative political circles.
The same day, two other Trump aides — Keith Schiller, a former White House Deputy Assistant; and George Sorial, a former Trump Organisation executive — registered as foreign agents for Pakistan. Sorial is also the co-author of The Real Deal, a memoir chronicling his time with Trump
Their firm, Javelin Advisors LLC, signed on as a subcontractor to Seiden Law, which recently secured a $200,000-a-month agreement with the Pakistani government.
Javelin’s share of the contract is $50,000 per month, according to Politico, a US-based publication that covers politics and policy. While the foreign lobbying contracts are ostensibly focused on economic and diplomatic engagement, the timing of the two new contracts has drawn scrutiny.

The number of Afghans who left last month was the highest since September 2023, said a report released by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, on Thursday.
According to the report, 72 per cent of Afghans who left last month were undocumented, followed by 22pc with Afghan Citizenship Cards and 6pc with Proof of Registration cards.
The report ‘Core Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Returns Emergency Response’ said more than 144,500 Afghans returned to their country in April.
In April, around 24,400 Afghans were arrested by Pakistani authorities, representing over twice the 2024 rate.

Number of Afghans leaving Pakistan in April at 19-month high, say UNHCR, IOM; USCIRF says minorities at risk in Afghanistan

Most of the arrests and detentions took place in Punjab, followed by Balochistan.
Documentation trends
Separate data released by the Inter­national Organisation for Migration (IOM) also identified similar trends.
It said the number of undocumented individuals who left Pakistan between April 20 and 26 was higher compared to the previous week.
Around 65pc of Afghans, whom the IOM interviewed, said they had no documents.
The return of Afghans from Iran was also ongoing, IOM reported.
Around 14,909 male individuals entered Afghanistan using Abu Nasar Farahi and Milak border crossing points from Iran, accounting for 91pc of the total inflow, while female individuals were 1,487 or 9pc.
Need for support
UNHCR says Afghanistan has an estimated 3.22 million conflict-induced internally displaced persons (IDPs), 1.65 million IDP returnees and hosts around 20,900 refugees, requiring immediate protection and humanitarian assistance, as well as medium to long-term support.
In the first quarter of 2025, UNHCR has worked to scale up response capacities at border crossing points and encashment centers to provide protection assistance for the anticipated large-scale returns and deportations from Pakistan as part of the second phase of the Pakistan government’s Illegal Foreign Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
There are 2.8 million Afghans living in Pakistan, including refugees and those in refugee-like situations, with the implementation of IFRP Phase II likely to result in more than 1.4m Afghans (undocumented, refugees, and those in refugee-like situations) returning to Afghanistan.
Risk for minorities
The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a bipartisan federal body that monitors and reports on religious freedom abroad, has expressed grave concern over the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
The agency warned the policy was putting vulnerable religious minorities at serious risk under the Afghan Taliban rule.
Since March 2025, Pakistan expelled an estimated 80,000 Afghans as part of its repatriation campaign that began in October 2023.
“The situation in Afghanistan remains dire for those who do not share the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islam, including Christians, Shia Hazara, [Ahmadis] and Sikhs,” said USCIRF Chair Stephen Schneck.
“We are deeply concerned that religious minority communities will be in grave danger, especially women and girls, as Taliban officials seek retaliation against Afghans returned by the Pakistani government’s forced and accelerated repatriation efforts.”
USCIRF Vice Chair Meir Soloveichik warned the Taliban regime has created “terrible circumstances that put Afghan religious minorities at risk of severe persecution, including corporal punishment and arbitrary detention.”

Speaking at a gathering in Mirpurkhas, the PPP leader claimed that certain ‘conspiratorial’ elements and ‘political orphans’ saw it as an opportunity to target the PPP.
“They began celebrating, assuming that the PPP would compromise on public rights just as they have always done. Historically, whenever these parties had a chance, they sided with undemocratic forces and compromised on the people’s rights. But the PPP has never bowed before anyone. We have always stood by our principles and will continue to do so,” he said as per a statement issued by the PPP media cell after the event.
He pointed out that two major decisions were taken during the caretaker setup before the incumbent government was formed: one was the executive committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) decision to construct new canals, and the other was a “baseless certificate” issued by Indus River System Authority (Irsa), claiming that the country had surplus water.
“Both decisions were taken during the caretaker government when Arif Alvi was still occupying the presidency,” he noted, adding, “These decisions were made before President Asif Ali Zardari assumed office.”
He said that PPP did not have a majority in the National Assembly, nor in the relevant forum — the Council of Common Interests, but it still opposed the project.
“The PPP had only two representatives in the CCI, but President Zardari and the party still decided that these canals would not be built.”
The PPP leader recalled that on the death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto, he had publicly appealed to President Zardari to reject the project, and he, in his address, assured the nation that each province would receive its rightful share of water.
“President Zardari reiterated this in the joint session of parliament, where he said that he could not support any unilateral decision regarding this canals project as it posed a threat to the federation,” he added.
The PPP chief also condemned India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, stating that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched an attack on our Sindhu. “We are a peaceful nation, but we will resist anyone who threatens our (Indus) river,” he warned. Mr Bhutto-Zardari announced that the PPP would hold its next public gathering on May 9 in Shaheed Benazirabad.

• Govt orders religious seminaries to shut for 10 days

MUZAFFARABAD / RAWALPINDI: With the threat of an Indian escalation looming over Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), its prime minister indicated on Thursday that his government was considering imposing an emergency in the territory if something untoward happens.
Also on Thursday, authorities stopped tourists from entering Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the Line of Control (LoC) in view of the security situation.
 
 

The government has ordered all religious seminaries in the region to remain closed for 10 days, while the owners of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and marriage halls have pledged to place their establishments at the military’s disposal in case India launches an attack.
Meanwhile, Pakistan announced that certain sections of airspace over the two largest cities — Karachi and Lahore — will remain closed for eight hours a day throughout the month of May.
In addition, flights to and from destinations in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face disruptions due to the closure of airspace in that region.
Preparedness plans
Speaking during a session of the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said his administration was monitoring the situation on the Indian frontier.
He assured the House that his government had made arrangements to ensure the availability of food, medicines, and other basic necessities in the 13 constituencies located along the LoC.
“We have established an Emergency Response Fund and transferred Rs1bn into it… arrangements have been made to ensure food, medicines, and other essential supplies,” he said, adding that administrations and residents in the border areas had been directed to stock rations for two months.
In addition, official and private machinery was being deployed to keep roads open in the LoC constituencies of Neelum, Jhelum, Poonch, Haveli, Kotli and Bhimber.
Additionally, the State Disaster Management Authority, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defence had been directed to remain prepared for any emergency.
Stating that India had been exposed before the world as a terrorist state, Mr Haq urged the nation to remain vigilant, warning that the “vile adversary could resort to any ghastly act.”
“I assure you that if India commits any kind of aggression, the government, the people, and all political and religious parties and leaders are fully prepared to respond to its aggressive designs,” he said.
Mr Haq added that Indian occupation forces had resorted to unprovoked firing along the LoC on Thursday and had been given a strong and timely response by the army.
Later in the day, PM Haq hosted a multi-party meeting at his official residence, where participants, including leaders from outside the Legislative Assembly, ren­ewed the resolve to teach India a befitting lesson in the event of any aggression.
Restrictions
Also on Thursday, authorities began stopping tourists from entering the Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the LoC.
Many visitors who were unaware of the fresh restrictions were turned back from the Marbal checkpost, and even AJK residents who were not local to these areas were stopped from proceeding further.
In Leepa Valley, officials advised residents to avoid areas near the LoC and urged them to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure their safety.
Separately, the government ordered all religious seminaries to remain closed for 10 days, citing a heatwave.
However, official sources indicated that the decision was based on intelligence rep­orts suggesting India mi­ght target such institutions, under the pretext
of hitting militant training centres. “We are dealing with such a cunning, cruel, and conspiratorial enemy that no vile act can be ruled out,” said Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed.
In a related development, the Joint Action Committee of Hotels, Guesthouses, Restaurants, and Marriage Halls of AJK held an emergency meeting to express solidarity with the army.
Chaired by Raja Ilyas, the meeting included members from Kotli, Mirpur, Bagh, Rawalakot, and Neelum, some of whom joined via video link.
Participants pledged to hand over their establishments to the Pakistan Army through the AJK prime minister if India launched an attack.
Airspace closures
Pakistan has also decided to close certain sections of the airspace over Karachi and Lahore between 8am and 4pm (local time) for the month of May “due to operational reasons”.
The restrictions will not be applicable on Sundays.
New Delhi had earlier closed its airspace to Pakistani planes on Wed­nesday, a few days after Islamabad banned Indian planes from overflying.
“Affected routes are located between flight levels 9,000 and 25,000 feet,” according to the latest Notice to Airmen (Notam) issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).
The decision affects selected corridors within the FIRs rather than a complete shutdown, and is being implemented as a precautionary security measure, officials added.
Although authorities say the closure will not significantly disrupt commercial flight operations, as aircraft will be rerouted via alternative flight paths during the restricted hours, these hours are considered peak times for domestic flights.
The closure comes in addition to restrictions already in place in the skies over Gilgit-Baltistan, as PIA flights from Islamabad to Gilgit-Skardu were cancelled for a second day on Thursday. The airspace was unavailable between 1:30am and 10pm on Thursday.
Separately, rain and windstorms in northern parts of Pakistan disrupted the flight schedule, with as many as five international and domestic flights delayed and diverted to other cities due to bad weather in Islamabad.

• Tarar says situation on the border is ‘ever evolving’
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan-India tensions continue to simmer in light of the Pahalgam attack in the held Kashmir, Pakistan on Thursday engaged a host of friendly nations, including China, to seek their support for de-escalation measures between the nuclear states and to take them into confidence regarding the ‘weaponisation’ of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.
The hostilities, which led to the downgrading of ties between the neighbours, also came up during a contact between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as both dignitaries noted with concern the “belligerent attitude and provocative statements” by India, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability.
In his contacts with Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani on Thursday evening, PM Shehbaz discussed developments in South Asia and expressed concerns over India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin. The PM, according to a statement, deemed the action unacceptable, emphasising that the Indus water was the lifeline of the 240 million people in Pakistan.
 
 

In his meeting with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong, PM Shehbaz informed the Chinese envoy that the belligerent actions by India could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counter-terrorism efforts against militant outfits operating from Afghanistan. He informed the envoy that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue was the only way to ensure “lasting peace” in South Asia and also thanked him for China’s support to Pakistan in its demand for a transparent probe into the attack.
The premier said that India’s decision to weaponise water was extremely regrettable, as there was no provision for either party to unilaterally walk away from its commitments under the Indus Waters Treaty. During the meeting, the Chinese ambassador thanked the PM for sharing Pakistan’s perspective on the emerging situation due to India’s propaganda and unilateral actions, the Prime Minister’s Office said.
‘No compromise’
The breakdown in ties with India also featured prominently in a meeting between the president and the premier on Thursday. They affirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a “befitting manner”.
They said the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military, which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan’s response to India’s “belligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression”. They said that the international community should take note of India’s involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.

The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.
Separately, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also had a conversation with Slovenia Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and briefed her on the evolving situation. In his contact, FM Dar rejected India’s baseless allegations and denounced unilateral actions, including holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, as a clear violation of international law. FM Fajon called on both countries to exercise restraint and resolve issues through diplomacy.
‘Let there be no ambiguity’
As civilian leaders took world leaders into confidence, army chief General Asim Munir warned that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a quick and decisive response.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests are absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
According to the ISPR, COAS Munir visited the Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness ‘Exercise Hammer Strike’, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military’s Mangla Strike Corps. Speaking on the occasion, the army chief reaffirmed the military’s “unyielding resolve” to defend the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
The COAS lauded the “high morale, combat proficiency, and war-fighting spirit” of the officers and troops, terming them the “embodiment of Pakistan Army’s operational excellence”.
‘No proof’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said India failed to provide proof of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam incident. About allegations levelled by India, he said they kept blaming Pakistan, adding that New Delhi used such incidents as pretexts to attack Pakistan in the past. “They will have to tell the world who was involved. You cannot just say that Pakistan was behind this…” he said, adding that Pakistan demanded an impartial inquiry to prove that it had nothing to do with Pahalgam.
He said Islamabad also engaged the friendly nations to share with them its perspective regarding the recent tensions.
To another query, he said, “The situation is fluctuating and sometimes escalation is high and sometimes it is low; sometimes engagement with the diplomatic community, and this is an ever-evolving situation.”
 
 

“We keep receiving intelligence reports, and having said that, our armed forces are on alert…we are conducting exercises, and there is much at the operational level which I cannot share right now,” he said, adding that there was a possibility that India could attack Pakistan. “Yes, there is a possibility, that is why I said that Pakistan is always well prepared to defend that and our armed forces are ready for self-defence,” he added.
He said he had shared the information about the potential attack “very timely” with the world as a form of deterrence.
“There are three forms of deterrence: one is our capability, which is our very strong military… second is the resolve…of the nation…and third is the communication,” he added. “So, communication plays a big part in averting crises.”

Kharif season begins on April 1, and water availability criteria and distribution among provinces are usually settled for the entire season by the advisory committee in the last week of March.
 
 

But given peculiar sca­rce water conditions, it had allocated only drinking water shares to provinces for April — the first month of the season generally used for sowing crops. Provinces had delayed sowing because of the unprecedented water shor­tage, estimated at 43 per cent at the time.
Irsa’s advisory committee decided on March 26 to meet again in the first week of May to take stock of the latest situation and finalise “Anticipated Wat­er Availability Criteria” and set provincial water shares for the season.
The shortage has since dropped to about 25-27pc to be finally approved by the committee on May 5. The water storage in reservoirs, particularly Mangla and Tarbela, has further improved to 1.762 million acre-feet (MAF), up from 1.3 MAF on April 20 and almost zero on April 1.
Irsa has invited irrigation and agriculture secretaries from the four provinces, Wapda’s members for water and power, the chief engineering adviser and the chairman of the Federal Flood Commission, along with all Irsa members, to attend the crucial meeting.
The authority has already increased provincial water shares, raising hopes about better cotton sowing that was earlier feared to dent Kharif crops amid a 43pc water shortage for the season predicted on March 26 by the Irsa’s advisory committee.
The committee earlier resisted provincial pressures on March 26, particularly from Sindh, for lower allocations and gave monthly allocations to provinces from the maximum shortage scenario.
As a result, the provinces were given minimum shares, mostly sufficient only for drinking instead of irrigation.
The provinces generally delayed sowing crops where possible.

But where precisely does this reside in the brain? That is a question that has long confounded scientists and clinicians. A new study is offering fresh insight.
In a quest to identify the parts of the brain underpinning consciousness, neuroscientists measured electrical and magnetic activity as well as blood flow in the brains of 256 people in 12 laboratories across the United States, Europe and China, while the participants viewed various images. The measurements tracked activation in various parts of the brain.
The researchers found that consciousness may not arise in the  “smart” part of the brain — the frontal areas where thinking is housed, which progressively grew in the process of human evolution — but rather in the sensory zones at the back of the brain that process sight and sound.
“Why is any of this important?” asked neuroscientist Christof Koch of the Allen Institute in Seattle, one of the leaders of the study published this week in the journal Nature.
“If we want to understand the substrate of consciousness, who has it — adults, pre-linguistic children, a second trimester fetus, a dog, a mouse, a squid, a raven, a fly — we need to identify the underlying mechanisms in the brain, both for conceptual reasons as well as for clinical ones,” Koch said.
The subjects in the study were shown images of people’s faces and various objects.
“Consciousness is the way it feels like to see a drawing of a toaster or Jill’s face. Consciousness is not the same as the behavior associated with this feeling, for example pushing a button or saying, ‘I see Jill,’” Koch said. The researchers tested two leading scientific theories about consciousness.
Under the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, consciousness materialises in the front of the brain, with important pieces of information then broadcast widely throughout the brain. Under the Integrated Information Theory, consciousness emanates from the interaction and cooperation of various parts of the brain as they work collectively to integrate information that is consciously experienced. The findings did not square with either theory.
“Where are the neuronal footprints of consciousness in the brain? Very crudely put, are they in the front of the cortex — the outermost layer of the brain — such as the prefrontal cortex, as predicted by the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory?” Koch asked.
It is this prefrontal cortex that makes our species uniquely human, driving higher-order cognitive processes such as planning, decision-making, reasoning, personality expression, and moderating social behavior.
“Or are the footprints in the back regions of the cortex, the posterior cortex?” Koch asked. The posterior cortex houses the regions where hearing and vision processing occurs.
“Here, the evidence is decidedly in favor of the posterior cortex. Either information pertaining to the conscious experience couldn’t be found in the front or it was far weaker than in the back. This supports the idea that while the frontal lobes are critical to intelligence, judgment, reasoning, etc., they are not critically involved in seeing, in conscious visual perception,” Koch said.

“Reportedly, the cook served the food to the children after removing a dead snake from it,” the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said in a statement.
The meal was served last week in a government-run school in the city of Mokama in Bihar, one of India’s poorest states, it said.
The commission demanded local government officials and police investigate media reports that  “more than 100 children fell ill” after eating the school lunch. The incident sparked angry demonstrations from the children’s families.
“The news about the children falling ill, due to the consumption of the midday meal, led to the blocking of the road by the protesting villagers,” it said.
Free lunches are offered to millions of children in government schools throughout India, seen by authorities as a way to encourage children to continue their education.
The commission said it demanded a  “detailed report” from senior state officials and the police, to include  “the health status of the children”. It said the report, if confirmed, poses the  “serious issue of violation of the human rights of the students,” the statement added.
In 2013, 23 schoolchildren died after being served a meal laced with pesticides in Saran district of Bihar. 
The disaster prompted the government to improve food safety in schools.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said clashes  in the capital’s southern suburbs on Tuesday and Wednesday killed 10  civilians as well as 30 loyalists of the Islamist-led government and 21  Druze gunmen. 
In the Druze heartland in Sweida province, it said 40  Druze fighters were killed, 35 of them in an  “ambush” on Wednesday. Druze spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri on Thursday condemned what he called a  “genocidal campaign” against his community after two days of sectarian clashes left 101 people dead.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned his country would respond  “with significant force” if Syria’s new authorities fail to protect the Druze minority.
The violence poses a serious challenge to the Islamist authorities who ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December. It comes after a wave of massacres in March in Syria’s Alawite heartland on the Mediterranean coast in which security forces and allied groups killed more than 1,700 civilians, mostly Alawites, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
It was the worst bloodshed since the ouster of Assad, who is from the minority community.
Hijri in a statement denounced the latest violence in Jaramana and Sahnaya near Damascus as an  “unjustifiable genocidal campaign” against the Druze. He called for immediate intervention by  “international forces to maintain peace and prevent the continuation of these crimes”.
Israel has ramped up its support for Syria’s Druze, with Foreign Minister Gideon Saar on Thursday urging the international community to  “fulfil its role in protecting the minorities in Syria — especially the Druze — from the regime and its gangs of terror”.
In a later statement, Katz said:  “Should the attacks on the Druze resume and the Syrian regime fail to prevent them, Israel will respond with significant force.”
The violence was sparked by the circulation of an audio recording attributed to a Druze citizen and deemed blasphemous. 
Truces was reached in Jaramana on Tuesday and in Sahnaya on Wednesday. The government announced it was deploying forces in Sahnaya to ensure security, and accused  “outlaw groups” of instigating the clashes. 
However, Hijri said he no longer trusts  “an entity pretending to be a government... because the government does not kill its people through its extremist militias... and then claim they were unruly elements after the massacres”. “The government (should) protect its people,” he said.

“US sanctions on Iran during the nuclear talks are not helping the sides to resolve the nuclear dispute through diplomacy,” the official said.
“Depending on the US approach, the date of the next round of talks will be announced.”  Oman, which mediated earlier sessions of the US-Iran talks, said the next round of nuclear discussions provisionally planned for May 3 would be rescheduled for  “logistical reasons”.
However, a source familiar with the matter said that the United States had  never confirmed  its participation in the fourth round of talks in Rome.

Washington accused by Tehran of ‘contradictory behaviour and provocative statements’ 

The source said the timing and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be confirmed but are expected in the near future.
Earlier on Thursday, Iran accused the US of  “contradictory behaviour and provocative statements” after Washington warned Tehran of consequences for backing Yemen’s Houthis and imposed new oil-related sanctions on it in the midst of nuclear talks.
Separately, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran would continue to engage  “seriously and resolutely” in result-oriented negotiations with the US, state media reported.
US President  Donald Trump  , who has threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy fails, has signalled  confidence  in clinching a new pact with the Islamic Republic that would block Tehran’s path to a nuclear bomb.
Trump, who has restored a   “maximum pressure” campaign  on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
Iran has far exceeded the 2015 agreement’s curbs on its uranium enrichment since the US exited the pact and European countries share Washington’s concern that Tehran could seek an atomic bomb. Iran says its programme is peaceful.
Iran and three European powers — Britain, France and Germany — were scheduled to meet in Rome on Friday to improve strained ties over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme during this time of high-stakes talks between Tehran and Washington, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday.
However, the senior Iranian official said that it was now  “not certain” whether Friday’s meeting would go ahead.
On Wednesday, Washington imposed sanctions on entities it accused of involvement in the illicit trade of Iranian oil and petrochemicals.
Separately, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran that it would face consequences for supporting the Houthis, who control northern Yemen and have attacked ships in the Red Sea in what the group says is solidarity with the Palestinians.
Washington has been bombing the Houthis intensively since mid-March, hitting more than 1,000 targets. Tehran says the Houthis act independently.

The International Thermon­uclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, based in southern France and backed by the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the European Union, needs the magnetic system to create an  “invisible cage” to confine super-hot plasma particles that combine and fuse to release energy.
ITER said late on Wednesday that the final component of the system — the central solenoid — had been completed and tested by the United States, and assembly was now underway.
“It is like the bottle in a bottle of wine: of course the wine is maybe more important than the bottle, but you need the bottle in order to put the wine inside,” said Pietro Barabaschi, ITER’s director general. The magnet was originally scheduled for completion in 2021, but has been beset by delays.
“To be behind schedule by four years after 10 years of effort shows just how troubled this project is,” said Charles Seife, a professor at New York University who writes about nuclear fusion.
Barabaschi said the  “crisis” was now over and construction was proceeding at the fastest pace in ITER’s history. The start-up phase of the project will begin in 2033, when it is scheduled to start generating plasma. He said ITER proved that countries could still cooperate despite geopolitical tensions.
“They have a very, very strong cohesion of objectives and for the time being I see no sign of a withdrawal from anyone.”  Fusion investment has been growing, with dozens of initiatives currently underway. Several private start-ups have said they can build commercial fusion reactors within a decade.
Barabaschi said he was sceptical but supportive of the dozens of ventures in development across the world. “We already know that we can get fusion,” he said.  “The question is, are we going to get fusion in such a way that it would be cost-effective?   “I am quite scep­tical that we will be able to achieve this within, say, one or even two decades. Frankly speaking, it will take more time.”

The painting by Nikas Safronov depicts Trump clenching his fist in a gesture of defiance in the moments after a gunman tried to assassinate him at a rally in Pennsylvania last July.
Safronov said he was impressed by Trump’s courage.  “I went to a nearby church and prayed for him. And then I started to make sketches,” he said. But the portrait’s unlikely journey to the White House via the Kremlin came as a surprise, Safronov added. He said he was approached by former clients, whom he did not name, who requested that he give them the painting for a period of time.
Safronov said he agreed and gave it away for free. Later, he said, he heard media reports that Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff had said that Putin had gifted Trump a painting by a famous Russian artist.
“Somehow I couldn’t piece together that those people (who took away the portrait) work for the president of Russia,” he said. Witkoff, who has met Putin four times, said in March that he had brought back the painting, which he said Putin had commissioned from a leading Russian artist, and Trump had been  “clearly touched” by it.
But Safronov said he only realised that the portrait given to Trump was his when he received a call from Putin.
“The president called me. He thanked me and said he liked the work. It was a short conversation,” he said.

More than 50,000 police were deployed and key metro, bus and ferry services were shut down as part of the operation. May Day came with the government embroiled in a battle with the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), following the detention of its presidential candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, mayor of Istanbul.
Imamoglu is the biggest political rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. More than 400 people were arrested, a day after 100 people were detained for allegedly planning to protest in the central Taksim Square, where demonstrations have been banned since 2013.
“The number of arrests that have been reported to us exceeds 400,” the Istanbul branch of the CHD lawyers group wrote on X. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X that 407 protesters were arrested in Istanbul, while a statement by Istanbul authorities said 52,656 police officers had been deployed in the city.
Several thousand people assembled in sanctioned protests called by unions on the Asian side of the city. “They blocked all the streets, as if it’s a state of emergency,” a student named Murat, who did not want to give his last name, said.

Based on a review of existing project pipeline, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved the revised IGCEP 2025-34 for submission to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for formal approval. The revised plan meant an investment of $47.4bn over the next 10 years instead of $64.3bn previously planned by the power division.
The prime minister also directed the completion of Diamer-Bhasha Dam on a priority basis to ensure effective irrigation system and power generation.
Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari said that out of the previously planned 15,000MW capacity additions, about 7,000MW would have resulted in expensive power and are being scrapped.

Expects savings of Rs4.7tr by rescheduling 7,000MW of already committed plants

The prime minister was told that “around $10bn (about Rs2.790tr) was saved by adjusting the timelines of committed capacity under the IGCEP (submitted to Nepra). An additional $7bn (Rs1.96tr) in savings resulted from rationalising the committed capacity portfolio”.
Mr Leghari said the government had also decided that the government would not purchase generation capacity in future; instead, capacity addition would be based on a competitive market. He said the government was now pulling out of the single-buyer system and no capacity addition would be allowed on cost-plus tariff.
He said the future governments would be bound to follow the principle of competitive electricity market and would not be able to contract expensive electricity.
The government submitted IGCEP 2024-34 to Nepra in April 2024 for approval which came under significant scrutiny due to emerging sectoral dynamics like declining electricity demand, a rising share of net metering, and the presence of a large volume of committed capacity additions.
“These developments raised concerns over the potential burden on end consumers if the committed projects were approved without re-evaluation”, the power minister said.
The IGCEP-2024-34 involved a total of 25,973MW of new capacity additions, of which 25,573MW (98.5pc) was categorised as committed capacity, leaving only 400MW (1.5pc) as candidate capacity subject to optimisation.
The Net Present Value (NPV) of this proposed plan stood at $64.30bn, including $42.61bn in fixed costs and $21.69bn in generation costs.
Given the high reliance on committed projects and reduced demand projections, a detailed review of the committed project criteria was undertaken. Considering the assumptions and policy provisions, the IGCEP draft submitted to Nepra was thoroughly assessed, wherein 73 projects were initially classified as committed in the draft IGCEP-2021-31.
These projects were facilitated by various project executing agencies at the federal, provincial, AJK and Wapda levels with a collective capacity of 22,418MW. By the end of 2024, 7,434MW of this capacity had been commissioned.
The remaining capacity within the committed category stood at 14,984MW, which came under subsequent review based on the basic principle of financial closure achieved in the private sector or financial commitment in the public sector along with more than 10pc of construction and financial progress.
Based on revised criteria, only 7,017MW out of the initial 14,984MW qualified to remain in the committed category. The remaining projects were subsequently evaluated under the least-cost optimisation framework within the IGCEP.
“Based on the refined categorisation of committed projects, the system achieved savings of Rs1.015tr relative to the business-as-usual case with forced capacity additions,” the power minister said.

This early harvesting has also led to the initiation of forward trading of cotton, raising the possibility of the earliest cotton ginning season in Pakistan’s history, potentially starting in the first week of May.
Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq shared that advance deals for cotton produced from the new crop have begun. Initially, two ginning factories in Burewala and Mandi Bahauddin (Punjab) sold 600 bales of cotton for delivery between May 10 and 15, at Rs17,000 to Rs17,300 per maund.
These factories have procured raw cotton from the coastal regions of Sindh at a rate of Rs8,300 to Rs8,500 per maund.
He stated that limited cotton picking has started in some coastal areas of Sindh, with ginners from Punjab actively purchasing this early yield. Reports suggest more forward contracts will be finalised in the coming days.
The unexpected early start to cotton picking in Sindh’s coastal belt, attributed to a sudden rise in temperatures, has fuelled expectations that the new cotton ginning season could commence in the first week of May in two cities of Punjab — a first in the country’s history.
However, Mr Haq also highlighted concerns about overall cotton cultivation nationwide.
Reports suggest a decrease in cotton sowing in most cotton zones compared to the previous year, which could lead to lower national cotton production. 
This decline is primarily attributed to the disinterest of farmers due to significantly low domestic cotton prices, a consequence of record imports of sales tax-free cotton, cotton yarn, and grey cloth under the Export Facilitation Scheme.
There is also an unprecedented delay in the release of cotton cultivation and production estimates for the Cotton Year 2025-26 by the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA). Traditionally, these estimates are released in the first week of February.

Pakistan Goods Transporters Association (PGTA) Chairman Nisar Hussain Jafry said thousands of commercial vehicles were struck due to roadblocks by the protesters, including lawyers and the people of Sindh, against constructing canals on the Indus River.
As a result, the containers and cargo loaded on the vehicles were not delivered on time, resulting in demurrage and late delivery charges.
He said these charges were imposed on the transporters, who bear no responsibility or fault.
Mr Hussain claimed that over 50,000 goods carriers, which were stranded on various routes in Sindh, including vehicles going to the upcountry and coming from Punjab, have started moving, thus clearing the roads. 
The Motorway Police are also cooperating by avoiding any vehicle challans to ensure quick movement of goods. At the same time, the Excise Department has decided to defer imposing any kind of penalties for one week.
