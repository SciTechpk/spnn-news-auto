In a traffic advisory issued by Karachi Traffic Police at 8:11am, rain caused the traffic to slow down in multiple points across the city, including Sharea Faisal and the main National Highway.
 






The traffic police advised citizens to take precautionary measures in light of the situation, such as avoiding sudden braking, maintaining a slow speed and a safe distance from other vehicles on the road.
 






Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah has directed the district administration,  the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), the health department, and Rescue 1122 to remain on high alert amid the situation.
He ordered the immediate drainage of rainwater and instructed the relevant administrations to remain in contact with the  Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the PDMA.
“All Deputy Commissioners should be present in the field with their staff,” the chief secretary said.
Separately, PMD, in a weather advisory, forecasted intermittent rains to continue throughout the day.
The minimum temperature is expected to remain at 28 degrees Celsius, while the humidity will be 85 per cent.
According to the Met Office, as of 8am, Saadi Town recorded the highest level of rain at 35.8mm, followed closely by Gulshan-i-Maymar at 33.3mm, while Nazimabad recorded 26mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 3mm, University Road 4.4mm, PAF Base Faisal 1mm, Korangi 4.6mm, Surjani Town 7mm, and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase VII 3mm.
The Met Office further said that the following parts of Sindh have been forecasted to receive rain-wind/thundershower at isolated places: Tharparkar, Umarkot, Mithi, Thatta, Hyderabad, Badin, Dadu, Khairpur, Nausharo Feroze, Larkana, Jacobabad, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sanghar, Islamkot, Nagarparkar, and Mirpur Khas.
According to an earlier PMD forecast, widespread rain and thunderstorms with few moderate to isolated heavy or very heavy falls were expected in the province till August 22, with occasional gaps.
A day prior, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.
Rain emergency declared
According to a notification from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), the Mayor of Karachi, Murtaza Wahab, has declared a rain emergency in the city.
The notification added that he “cancelled all types of (leave) including weekly holidays”, for the essential services departments, directing them to remain available.
He also directed the municipal services, the fire brigade and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) departments of KMC to establish a Rain Emergency Cell, coordinating with all essential services departments.
On the instructions of the Karachi East Zone’s Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Dr Farrukh Ali, the East Zone police is on high alert to deal with the possible effects of rains, the DIG’s Media Cell said in a statement.
“Clear orders have been issued to all SDPOs (Sub-Divisional Police Officers) and SHOs (Station House Officers) to remain present in their respective areas, ensure drainage, traffic flow and take immediate steps to deal with any emergency,” the statement said.
It added that the DIG had instructed that the protection of life and property of citizens should be ensured at all costs, paying special attention to low-lying areas. Rescue teams and helplines should be kept active, and timely guidance and assistance should be provided to the public.
The DIG statement also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary movement during bad weather, advising them to contact 15 or the nearest police station immediately in case of any emergency.
“Police are with the public at all times in all weathers,” it added.
Meanwhile, the traffic police said in another statement that rainwater had accumulated inside the Nazimabad Underpass, causing traffic to be diverted above the underpass on Hakim Ibne Sina Road.
The spokesperson, Saeed Arain, noted that there is “no traffic problem”, saying, “Traffic police are present and managing traffic flow.”
It requested citizens to exercise caution while travelling, guiding them to the Traffic Police Help Line at 1915 for the Central District.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger urban flooding, deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p><small>2025-08-19 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191312589611a38.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931874/at-least-358-dead-as-kp-reels-from-devastating-floods-rehabilitation-efforts-underway' target='_blank'><strong>At least 358 dead as KP reels from devastating floods; rehabilitation efforts underway</strong></a><br><p>At least 358 people died as a result of heavy flooding and downpour in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the last three days, while rehabilitation efforts are still underway as the province recovers from the record deluge, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said on Tuesday.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc across the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
According to the latest data from the KP PDMA, 358 people have died in rain-related incidents since August 15, with Buner reporting the highest toll at 225. Another 181 people were injured, while the dead included 287 men, 41 women and 30 children.
Buner was the worst-hit district in the province, where flash flooding and building collapses left 225 people dead, including 193 men, 23 women and nine children, according to the report. Another 120 people sustained injuries.
Following Buner, Shangla district reported 36 deaths from flash floods, while 22 fatalities were recorded in Mansehra, another 22 in Bajaur, and 20 in Swat, where both flash flooding and infrastructure damage claimed lives.
Flash flooding in the KP’s Swabi district also left 17 dead, according to the PDMA.
Due to separate roof collapse incidents, five people died in Lower Dir, and another two people lost their lives in Noshewra.
Abbotabad, Torghar, and South Waziristan recorded one death each, the report noted.
According to the PDMA data, the total number of houses damaged throughout the province was 780, out of which 349 were completely destroyed and another 431 sustained partial damage. Buner suffered the most damage, leaving 162 houses destroyed.
The number of cattle that perished was 427.
“It has been forecasted that the current cycle of rains to continue intermittently until August 21,” KP PDMA Spokesperson Anwer Shahzad said in a statement.
He said the authority had directed district administrations to intensify relief activities and provide immediate assistance to the victims.
“The public is advised to contact PDMA’s helpline at 1700 in case of any emergency or weather update,” Shahzad added.
Relief efforts underway
KP’s Adviser to the Chief Minister, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, in a statement, detailed the relief efforts, saying rescue teams are fully engaged in flood-affected districts.
An amount of Rs3 billion has been released for the ongoing operations, he said, adding that around 6,000 personnel are currently deployed as part of the rescue efforts.
“A total of 5,210 people have been safely evacuated, he added.
Additionally, Barrister Saif said a mobile application has been launched to issue financial compensation to the affected families.
“One hundred and seventy-six (176) rescue centres have been established and at least 100 roads, previously severed due to floods, have now been cleared and restored,” he said.
According to Barrister Saif, five army helicopters and one provincial helicopter were involved in the rescue efforts.
He detailed that the provincial government has delivered 89 trucks of relief items to the flood-hit districts, and more trucks are scheduled to be dispatched today.
He added that 2800 tents, 6100 mattresses, 2700 hygiene kits and 4300 kitchen sets have been distributed in the impacted areas. Additionally, 3100 tarpaulins, 7400 mosquito nets, 6800 blankets, and 500 gas cylinders were distributed.
“289 medical camps have been set up as well,” he said.
Barrister Saif shared that around 822 cases of infectious diseases have been reported so far, for which people are getting treatments at the medical relief camps.
Separately, in a bid to support the flood victims, the Chief Minister has decided to donate his one-month salary, cabinet ministers have donated their 15-day salary, while assembly members will donate their 7-day salary, Barrister Saif said.
“Officers above grade 17 have donated their two-day salary, while government employees from grade 1 to 16 have donated one day’s salary to the flood victims, Barrister Saif added.
Baltistan Highway reopened for traffic
Separately, the flood-ravaged Baltistan Highway was reopened for all kinds of traffic, according to Shahzad Baig, officer of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA).
He said, “The Baltistan Highway, which was blocked six days ago due to the bridge being washed away following severe flooding in the Istak Nullah, was restored with the joint efforts of the Pakistan Army and GBDMA.”
A large number of mountaineers, tourists and passengers had been stranded due to the week-long closure of the highway, he added.
On Saturday, GB Home Minister Shams Lone [said][1] that the Baltistan Highway bridge had been swept away, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit.
“As soon as the highway was opened, oil tankers and trucks loaded with other necessities of life left for Skardu,” Baig added.
A resident of Skardu, Qasim Butt, said that the closure of the highway caused a shortage of petrol and food items in the four districts, which worried the locals.
“A day before the Istak Nullah, the Baltistan Highway was closed due to the Baghicha RCC bridge being washed away in the flood. However, traffic flow was maintained by creating an alternative route,” he said, adding that the highway was now fully reopened.
22 killed in Balochistan since June 28
Balochistan’s PDMA reported that 22 people have been killed and nine injured in the province as a result of monsoon rain and flooding since June 28, including two killed and one injured in Harnai yesterday due to a roof collapse.
Of the remaining casualties, four people were killed and two injured in Zhob, six killed and one injured in Khuzdar, four killed in Duki, one in Ziarat, two killed and four injured in Musakhail, one killed and one injured in Kohlu, and one each in Lasbela and Loralai.
During this period, 83 houses were reported damaged across the province, including 14 completely destroyed, along with four cases of damage to public property. The PDMA also reported that 357 solar panels were damaged in Dera Bugti.
The National Highway Authority said that work had started on the restoration of the bridge.</p><small>2025-08-19 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19133055845bae6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931871/chinas-foreign-minister-wang-to-visit-pakistan-on-aug-21-for-strategic-dialogue-fo' target='_blank'><strong>China’s Foreign Minister Wang to visit Pakistan on Aug 21 for strategic dialogue: FO</strong></a><br><p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is set to visit the country this week for the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with
ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
According to the FO’s statement today, “On the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar … Mr Wang Yi is visiting Islamabad for co-chairing the sixth Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on August 21, 2025.”
“The visit is part of the regular high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China to further deepen their ‘All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’, reaffirm support on the issues of respective core interests, enhance economic and trade cooperation, and reaffirm their joint commitment to regional peace, development and stability,” the statement added.
 






The development comes during Wang’s ongoing visit to India. During talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday, Wang said that China and India should “view each other as partners and opportunities, rather than adversaries or threats”.
He pointed to the resumption of “dialogue at all levels” and “maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas” as evidence that bilateral ties were on a “positive trend of returning to the main path of cooperation”.
Last month, Dar met with Wang on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation event, where the pair discussed and reaffirmed mutual support in core sectors, including agriculture, mining, industry and security.
“China is ready to work with Pakistan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push forward the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future,” Wang had said.
In February, President Asif Ali Zardari held a bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, with the two sides vowing to strengthen the Pakistan-China strategic cooperative partnership.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1913084458ae1df.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931872/indian-police-exhume-human-remains-in-mass-burial-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Indian police exhume human remains in mass-burial investigation</strong></a><br><p>Indian police have exhumed human remains in a temple town in Karnataka, officials said, as part of an investigation into allegations that hundreds of murder and rape victims were secretly buried there from around the mid-1990s.
The probe centres on Dharmasthala, home to an 800-year-old temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in the state of Karnataka and is drawing headlines in media nationwide.
A former cleaner at the temple told police last month that he had been forced by superiors to dispose of hundreds of bodies over two decades, many of them women and girls showing signs of sexual assault.
His allegations were made in a police complaint dated July 4 and seen by Reuters.
The man, whose identity authorities have withheld for safety reasons, fled Dharmasthala in 2014 but said he was compelled to speak out now because of lingering guilt.
“If the skeletons now exhumed receive respectful funeral rites, those tormented souls will find peace and my sense of guilt could also decrease,” he wrote in the complaint.
The police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the temple said it welcomed a thorough investigation and hoped police would “bring out true facts to light”.
In the complaint, the former cleaner accused temple officials of forcing him to dispose of the bodies and told police he would name the officials if they protected him and his family. Karnataka’s interior minister told the state assembly on Monday that the protection was now in place.
The former cleaner said he had secretly exhumed a skeleton from one of the burial sites to prove his claims.
A special investigation team formed by the Karnataka government has so far recovered human remains from two of 16 suspected burial sites, according to two senior police officials familiar with the probe. They declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Karnatakas interior minister, Gangadharaiah Parameshwara, said the police have collected bone fragments, soil samples, and other material for testing from two sites thanks to the information from the former cleaner.
“The analysis is ongoing. Only once that is complete can we say the investigation has truly begun,” Parameshwara said.
“My request is to not make this a religious matter.” Sachin Deshpande, a lawyer for the complainant, told Reuters “they have found human remains where our client pointed and we are sure that the truth will come out”.
He declined to make his client available for an interview.
The revelations have revived interest in older unsolved cases, including Padmalatha, a college student whose family alleged she was raped and murdered in Dharmasthala in 1986. Padmalatha, like many in India, went by one name.
Her sister, Indravathi, said the family buried Padmalathas body rather than cremating it according to Hindu custom, hoping that would help with any investigations later.
“We hope that we will get justice one day for her abduction, rape and murder,” said Indravathi, who uses only one name.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19105531fc4aa98.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931860/52-magnitude-quake-jolts-islamabad-rawalpindi-and-parts-of-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.2-magnitude quake jolts Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and parts of KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 5.2-magnitude earthquake on Tuesday jolted Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Seismic Network of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said in a statement.
According to the statement, the quake was felt in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, KP’s Peshawar, Swat, Chitral, and Abbottabad.
The PMD’s press release said that the earthquake originated at 10:20am PKT. Its epicentre was the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 190 kilometres.
 






Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority reported that the earthquake was also felt in the province’s divisions of Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lahore, Multan, Sahiwal and Sargodha.
No casualties have been reported so far, and according to KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi, an emergency has not yet been declared.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
The Hindu Kush region is recognised as one of the most active seismic zones in the world, lying at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates where their ongoing collision generates frequent earthquakes, including rare deep-focus events that can reach depths of over 200km, according to the US Geological Survey.
This seismicity is attributed to subduction-related processes and slab break-off beneath the Hindu Kush–Pamir region, making it part of the broader Himalayan seismic belt that has produced several destructive earthquakes across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.
A 5.1 magnitude earthquake shook Islamabad, Rawalpindi and surrounding regions earlier in the month, swaying buildings and causing panic, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1914031673b22d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931867/babar-rizwan-demoted-as-pcb-announces-central-contracts-for-2025-26-no-players-in-category-a' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Rizwan demoted as PCB announces central contracts for 2025-26; no players in Category A</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday announced central contracts for 30 male cricketers for the upcoming 2025–26 international season, with no players placed in the top-tier Category A.
Last month, the number of male and female players in the central contract lists rose, according to PCB’s 2025-26 budget documents.
According to a press release by PCB today, the contracts, effective from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, “reflect the board’s continued commitment to recognising and supporting national talent.”
This year’s roster sees ten players each placed in Categories B, C, and D, with the PCB acknowledging that “no player has been selected for Category A in this cycle.”
 






Pertinent to mention is that Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan were the only two players in Category A for the 2024-25 season.
The duo have seen their stock fall over the past year; the former batting mainstays having been sidelined from the T20 squad.
“Compared to last year’s list of 27 contracted players, the PCB has expanded the pool to 30, including 12 fresh additions, highlighting the emergence of promising new talent and the board’s strategic focus on squad depth and future development,” PCB said.
 
 

The new entrants are: Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Mirza and Sufyan Moqim.
Five players have been promoted owing to their last year’s performances, PCB said. They are: Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha and Shadab Khan — all promoted from C to B category.
Additionally, nine players have retained their positions in the same categories. They are: Abdullah Shafique (Category C), Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jnr — all in Category D, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Saud Shakeel — all in Category C and Shaheen Shah Afridi (Category B).
PCB noted that eight players have missed out on contracts this year, namely Aamir Jamal, Haseebullah, Kamran Ghulam, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Huraira, Muhammad Irfan Khan and Usman Khan — all in Category (D).
List of this year’s centrally contacted players:
Category B (10 players): Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi
Category C (10 players): Abdullah Shafique, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Sahibzada Farhan, Sajid Khan and Saud Shakeel

Heard anchors screech body counts as if they’re in a competition for the highest number. Hundreds of lives lost, thousands displaced, homes swept away and losses that won’t ever be compensated.
Pakistan is once again in the midst of a ruthless monsoon season, which began in late June, and on the radar is the country’s mountainous north — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Last week, unprecedented flash floods left behind a trail of wreckage in Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond. A week before that, Muzaffarabad bore the brunt of monsoon rains. Almost a month back, 37 villages across GB were declared calamity-hit.
Visuals coming out of the region are terrifying; monstrous rivers unleashing their wrath and sweeping along anything in their way, from main city bazaars to entire villages. According to a report by the National Disaster Management Authority, at least 392 people have died in KP from June 26 to August 18. The number of fatalities in GB stands at 34, while 15 people were killed in AJK during this period.
 






Each flash flood occurred in just a few hours. Each occurred at a time locals refer to as “flash flood month”. And each caused massive levels of deluge. In Pakistan, flash floods have almost become an annual recurrence, starting from June until September, according to the NDMA. This is primarily because of heavy monsoon rains and rapidly melting glaciers.
The ‘doomsday’
“We have seen floods before, but the level of destruction and the precipitancy of the disaster this time around are unprecedented; it was like a doomsday scenario,” said a Peshawar-based Dawn reporter who recently visited Buner to cover the on-ground situation. The main marketplace in the district, Pir Baba Bazaar, suffered the most damage.
“Houses were reduced to rubble, shops were filled with six- to seven-feet mud carried down by the fast-flowing water, and cars were floating,” he recounted. Acres and acres of millet crop fields were flooded.
 






The journalist said that the plains of Buner, once crowded with tiny abodes, had been completely washed away. From afar, wooden planks and concrete pieces could be seen floating in water — the remnants of a life that once was. “No one knows what happened to the residents of these houses,” he said.
Everywhere, locals had gathered to search for missing people and their bodies — a process that was significantly delayed due to the absence of excavators and other government machinery.
“They were digging through the stones, but it was all in vain … how can humans remove elephant-sized boulders?” the reporter observed. “There was also a sense of bewilderment among them … no one knew exactly what happened. Some said it was thunder rain, others said a part of the mountain had cracked open, yet others said it was a Glof event … but no one knew what exactly had caused these floods.”
Instead, all they knew was that a disaster had struck.
A similar story of destruction was also narrated to Dawn.com by Mohammad Hassan, a resident of Skardu. His village was among those hit hardest by the floods. For the past two weeks, he has been living at a distant relative’s house after the floods destroyed his home.
 






“This has happened for the first time in my life … I have seen many floods, but never did the water reach my town because we have a nullah right at the opening of our village,” he said. “Nearly 80 per cent of our crops are gone and the walls of our homes have caved.”
A confusion, similar to that among the people of Buner, persists in Skardu. While the government announced that the floods were caused by cloudbursts, Hassan said his elders blamed lightning that struck mountain peaks.
“It is common practice in our towns; as soon as the third round of lightning strikes, announcements are made from mosques to evacuate the houses. Women are in charge of taking the children and cattle to safer areas while men rush to the fields to take all protective measures,” he explained.
But this time around, even the crops could not be saved because these flash floods brought with them big stones, sand and mud. “Standing in their way means losing your life … I broke my leg this time,” Hassan added.
Controllables and uncontrollables
According to the national and provincial disaster management authorities, the flash floods that hit the north this year were induced by cloudbursts — sudden and heavy downpour of rain, typically localised and of short duration.
Cloudbursts occur due to a range of atmospheric conditions, primarily when warm and moist air or monsoon winds are forced upwards along mountain slopes, causing the air to expand, cool, and condense rapidly, leading to sudden and intense rainfall, explained WWF-Pakistan Director Haider Raza.
In simpler words, he continued, cloudbursts cause downpour that is not just heavy but also intense, and can range up to 200mm of rain.
 






Of late, Pakistan has witnessed a rise in cloudburst events, with environmentalists blaming it on climate change. Per Raza, summer temperatures have spiked in mountainous areas, reaching up to 45 to 46 degrees. This leads to more rainfall as warm air rises and causes condensation, precipitation and changes in snowmelt patterns.
“And the Himalayas, Hindukush and Karakoram mountain ranges are particularly susceptible to these weather patterns — the impact of which can be seen in towns and villages on or near these mountains,” he said.
For example, Gilgit saw one of its worst flooding events this year, with eight out of 10 villages in the region inundated with floods. Buner, which does not have any rivers flowing through, witnessed a similar situation, with the rains causing unprecedented damage this year.
“Floods are not uncommon, but their frequency and intensity have now increased … climate events that were to take place every 50-70 years are now occurring within just a decade or less,” Raza warned.
Similarly, rainfall patterns have also changed. Normally, monsoon rains in northern areas begin from mid-July and stay until mid-August. But these periods have changed now. Now winter rains extend into spring while the monsoon season continues till September.
“Normally, rainy days are distributed across the year … in some places they last for 50 days, in others they can go up to 100 days,” elaborated Dr Mohammad Rafiq, a climate finance and sustainable development expert who has worked with organisations such as UNDP and WWF.
“But now, we see more rainfall in shorter periods, which is difficult to manage.”
These factors, however, are ‘uncontrollable’ because of their unpredictability, Rafique said. You can’t really do anything about it besides prepare for the worst. But underneath these fatal climate events are also factors that are controllable and completely in human hands: deforestation and land use.
Where are the trees?
All environmentalists Dawn.com spoke to agreed that deforestation is one of the glaring reasons behind climate change-triggered calamities in the north. According to the Pakistan Forest Institute, we are a forest-poor country with only 5.2pc forest cover (4.72 million hectares) with the per capita forest area of 0.0333 hectares, considerably less than the global average of one hectare.
 

Forest cover in KP has declined from 3.78 million ha in 1992 to around 3.09 million ha in 2020–25. The annual loss peaked around 2001–2004 (40,000 ha/yr) but has slowed in recent years, around 11,000 ha/yr in 2020–25, WWF estimates. — Guidelines for Range and Pasture Management in KPK 2025

Tariq Ali Shah, a forest expert who works closely with the KP government, said the province has been losing forests at a rate of about 1.5pc annually, which is equivalent to 8,000 hectares per year — almost the size of Islamabad’s city area — between 2000 and 2023. Wildfires in 2022 alone destroyed 14,430 acres of forest and pasture in KP, much of it in the mountain districts.
A similar trend is also seen in GB, where studies show 1,707km2 of forest area was lost over 20 years, which equals a 0.38pc loss each year. Diamer is one of the districts where deforestation and loss of biodiversity are high.
“This rapid loss of trees uphill has set the stage for nature’s current anger,” Shah told Dawn.com.
Trees and forests are more important than they are given credit for, when in fact they are our frontline soldiers. Leaves are the first defence; they break the velocity of the raindrops and slow down the pace at which they fall. Trees also reduce the water runoff during heavy downpours and support the ground in its absorption of water.
However, when deforestation occurs, land is exposed to sunlight, and the influence of forests on runoff is dramatically reduced, resulting in floods both in rivers and on land. Moreover, hotter and lighter air over deforested slopes rises more rapidly when the monsoon surge arrives. The collision between the cool, moist air from the sea and superheated upslope air produces intense convective updrafts — the perfect recipe for cloudbursts.
This is exactly what happened at the Babusar Top in June, where cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc, Shah pointed out. Being a dry temperate area, it only experiences snowfall and not rain. But this year was an exception, after 40 years. Why? Because there has been a drastic reduction in grasslands on Babusar Top.
Forests also have a deeper link with the incidence of glacial lake outburst floods, as they are perpetually ensuring that the 26,000 glaciers in Pakistan stay cool. Without them, they would melt at a much faster rate, which they already are.
It is therefore extremely important that we not just let nature do its job but also do our part in managing forests well. But, as highlighted by Dr Rafiq, who has worked extensively on de- and afforestation, there are some primary issues here: while people consider forests to be a source of income, there is a dearth of sustainable forest management and incompetence.
And all of these issues are interconnected with one driving factor — money. “People who are in power corridors and even those who aren’t have long benefited from cutting forests, mostly for timber,” the expert said.
In KP, there are two types of timber mafia: one that is run by local contractors, village middlemen and transporters who use tactics such as bribing local forest guards, exploiting weak community forest rights and cutting for immediate cash. The other involves an organised mafia run by wealthier contractors with political influence who supply high-value timber to down-country markets, operate under the cover of permits and allowances, and exploit legal loopholes.
 






Dr Rafiq elaborated that the mafia usually thrives with the help of corrupt government officials who misuse the process of forest marking and allow illegally felled timber from protected areas to be laundered as legal through official permits and transit passes.

Forest marking is a practice where specific trees are selected and marked to be harvested or retained within a forest stand. The process is guided by a forest management plan, considering factors like tree health, growth potential, and habitat value. It’s a crucial step in sustainable forest management, ensuring both timber production and ecological integrity.

Shah concurred and gave an example. “In Bahrain [a town located in Swat district], 350 private woodlots — a designated area, often part of a larger property, where trees are grown primarily for the production of wood for fuel, building materials, or other forest products — were officially marked, each with an average of 1,200 cubic feet of timber, amounting to roughly 420,000 cubic feet in total.
“While on paper this marking appeared legitimate, most of the timber was in fact sourced from nearby designated reserved forests rather than the actual woodlots,” he revealed, adding that in 2024-2025 alone, 420,000 tree markings were done in the forests of Batagram, Hazara and Bahrain.
This is like cutting down an entire small forest daily.
“No one is taking the responsibility to look at trees and forests as a natural reserve,” Dr Rafiq lamented. “Nature has a way of reclaiming what was taken away from it, ways that have far-reaching consequences; to prevent this, we need to protect our forests, and we need to act now.”
Where’s the plan?
The videos and photos of destruction coming from GB, AJK, and KP are not something Pakistanis have not seen before. The visuals are starkly similar to the catastrophic floods of 2022: fast-flowing rivers gulping down multi-storey houses, hotels and roadside resorts.
This year is no different. And at the heart of the problem is unplanned construction up north. In the last decade, the region has witnessed a rampant rise in hotels and guesthouses built right on riverbanks to lure tourists. According to experts, this unchecked expansion is not just degrading fragile mountain ecosystems but also choking the waterways themselves.
“This construction around the river is a hindrance to its natural flow,” said WWF’s Raza. “During the construction, they have one aim: the views. But what they forget is that the river never forgets, and it comes back to take revenge.”
 






The warnings are not hypothetical. In 2022, nearly 30 illegally built hotels along the Swat River were swept away, and another 50 were damaged when floodwaters tore through Bahrain and Kalam. Yet, despite such destruction, the cycle has continued.
A recent provincial probe found encroachments spread over more than 1,800 kanals of riverine land in KP, with 127 illegal buildings sealed and hundreds of structures demolished to clear waterways. In Swat alone, authorities reported removing dozens of obstructions from the floodplain.
Officials and conservationists alike say the effect is the same: narrowing rivers and forcing water to swell with greater ferocity during heavy rains.
Research backs this up — studies on river morphology in northern Pakistan have shown that encroachments reduce the channel’s carrying capacity, block natural drainage paths, and increase the destructive force of floods. Instead of water spreading out safely across the floodplain, it gets funnelled through narrowed passages, eroding embankments and smashing into settlements.
Dr Rafiq, a climate expert, pointed to the power structures behind this. “A land mafia operates in these areas under the garb of development,” he said. “Pakistan lives in an illusion and is slowly sleepwalking into disaster. In KP, there is a lack of building laws, and even where they exist, enforcement remains lax. We need leaders who can think beyond elections and plan for real estate expansion without compromising the rivers.”
WWF’s Raza echoed this, adding that weak rules and regulations mean construction is not only obstructing rivers but also driving up carbon emissions, contributing to higher local temperatures and intensifying floods. He urged the government to map out the most vulnerable zones and prevent human settlement there altogether, stressing that waterways should never be encroached or closed.
The issue extends beyond KP. In Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK, too, settlements have crept dangerously close to river corridors and nullahs. Experts warn that without stronger river acts and strict zoning laws, each new flood will keep washing away the same unplanned structures — taking lives and livelihoods with them.
A never-ending cycle
Beyond the statistics and studies, it is the lived reality of locals that tells the truest story of these disasters. Nowhere is this cycle of devastation more evident than in Buner, where residents like Muhibur Rasheed are living through its worst consequences.
He described the disaster as “the biggest and worst calamity” in the history of the district. Muhib shared that more than half of the Pir Baba Bazaar — the district’s main marketplace — had been submerged, resulting in losses worth billions of rupees. Entire villages, he said, were “gulped down by the floods”, leaving devastation in their wake.
“In every household, four to five people were swept away in the flash floods,” Rasheed recounted on a phone call with Dawn.com, his voice heavy with grief. “There are some families that have been completely wiped out. In one village, a funeral for 40 members of a single family was offered collectively.”

Rasheed also lamented the lack of government support. “Officials are only visiting the area for pictures and photos, not to provide any real help to us,” he said. In the absence of external aid, locals have been forced to help themselves, but their resources are running thin.
“There is a shortage of medicines, food, and other essentials, but the roads are blocked, and there are no mobile phone signals,” he added.
The devastation in Buner has put residents of neighbouring districts, located in the south at a short distance and unscathed from the floods so far, in a perpetual state of anxiety.

Zubair Torawali, a resident of Bahrain in Swat, said that even though his area has not yet been directly hit this year, the fear is palpable. “If the floods reach us, it could mean huge losses,” he said, explaining how villagers anxiously watch the rains shift from north to south every monsoon season.
In the end, it is always the people who pay the price — losing homes, livelihoods, and loved ones — while the state fails to act on lessons learned. Year after year, the water returns. And with it, the losses.

“They were planning to carry out major terrorist attacks,” said Mr Marwat, flanked by senior CTD and police officers.
He said that the arrest of Siraj and Faridoon, both brothers, serving as constables in CTD and police, had facilitated the network of a terrorist organisation and their handlers operating from Afghanistan.
A senior CTD official told Dawn on background basis that initial investigation and interrogation of the accused had led them to unravel a plot to bomb the mosque inside the district police lines that would have caused massive casualties, a re-enactment of a similar bombing in Peshawar which had led to the death of more than a hundred policemen.

RPO says two constables were facilitating terrorists affiliated with banned Hafiz Gulbahadar Group

He said that the arrest of the accused was made possible due to meticulous work spanning over more than four months, piecing together evidence collected from the ground, watching hours of the CCTV footage, surveillance and collection of electronic data.
“Kohat region was relatively quiet but the killing of a DSP and subsequently the killing of two more policemen caught our attention,” he said.
What came as a big surprise was that while the network had affiliation with Hafiz Gulbahadar Group, an organisation that had confined itself to its native North Waziristan but had lately expanded its operation to Khyber and other districts as well, it also had taken oath of allegiance to IS-KP. “We have evidence that there is overlapping and crossovers of militants,” the official said.
He said that militants used encrypted messaging Apps and used aliases instead of their own names to avoid detection. The mobile data, he said, also revealed the amount of money transferred to them using money transfer Apps commonly used in normal transactions in the country.
“The interrogation that we have had reveals just the tip of the iceberg. The mobile data extraction has helped us a lot in exposing the entire network,” said the official.
He said that the accused had made an elaborate video of the police lines and the mosque and possible point of entrance of suicide bomber.
The group had also planned to bomb the district complex of CTD as well as a Muharram procession.
The group had shared its target with its handlers in Afghanistan which had given it to go-ahead after receiving proof of its ability to carry out such attacks. “We have a pretty good picture of their network,” the official said, adding that efforts were on to capture other members of the group.
The involvement of policemen as facilitators led investigators to wonder if militant groups were seeking to infiltrate law enforcement agencies. This was reminiscent of almost a similar case, where a police constable in Peshawar had helped a suicide bomber infiltrate police lines to bomb a mosque.
The constable, Mohammad Wali, was subsequently arrested, who confessed to his involvement besides admitting to killing a Christian priest to prove his usefulness to his handlers in Afghanistan. The case of Mohammad Wali is still pending before the court.
“This is the irony of our system. What we need is a whole of the system response,” a legal expert said. He said that many accused were granted bail, barely days after physical remand and they were back fighting the state and law enforcement agencies.
“This is what happens when you do not interpret the law as it is. The Anti-Terrorist Act is pretty much clear when it comes to granting physical remand of a suspect. Courts, however, in their own wisdom rely on Criminal Procedure Code. This has complicated the matter beyond words,” he said.

The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
India is also part of the Quad security alliance with the United States, Australia and Japan, which is seen as a counter to China.
But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war, the countries have moved to mend ties.
During talks on Monday with Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, Wang said the two countries should “view each other as partners and opportunities, rather than adversaries or threats”.
He pointed to the resumption of “dialogue at all levels” and “maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas” as evidence that bilateral ties were on a “positive trend of returning to the main path of cooperation”.
Wang is also expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his three-day visit.
According to Indian media, Modi might visit China this month, which would be his first trip since 2018.
Relations have improved since October, when Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years in Russia.
Chinese and Indian officials have said in recent weeks that the two countries were discussing the resumption of border trade, which has been halted since 2020.
Its resumption would be symbolically significant, and follows discussions to resume direct flights and issue tourist visas.</p><small>2025-08-19 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191028231004d44.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931786/banks-set-to-gain-from-stability-says-fitch' target='_blank'><strong>Banks set to gain from stability, says Fitch</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Fitch Ratings on Monday projected improved prospects for Pakistan’s banking sector, citing stabilising macroeconomic indicators, falling inflation, and a return to economic growth. The global credit agency expects Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 3.5pc in FY27, with inflation averaging 5pc — a significant shift from the turmoil and high inflation of recent years.
In a brief commentary, Fitch said banks are well-positioned to capitalise on improving operating conditions as macroeconomic headwinds ease. It noted that stronger business volumes, driven by economic recovery and better credit demand, would support banking performance in the near term.
The outlook follows Pakistan’s upgraded sovereign credit profile, with Fitch raising its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘B-’/Stable from ‘CCC+’ in April 2025. The upgrade reflects ongoing reforms, fiscal improvement, and greater economic resilience.
The agency pointed out that consumer price inflation, which had peaked at 38pc in May 2023, eased to 4.1pc in July 2025, aided by a halving of the policy rate since May 2024 to 11pc. Coupled with a more stable external position — marked by reduced currency volatility and current account surpluses — this has laid the groundwork for a sustained recovery.

Forecasts 3.5pc GDP growth for next fiscal year, stable inflation

Fitch projected that lower interest rates and improved macro fundamentals would spur private-sector credit demand and steady growth in loans and deposits. This is expected to reduce the banking sector’s reliance on public-sector lending, with private-sector credit currently at a cyclical low of 9.7pc of GDP (2024). Reforms will be critical to deepening credit penetration and enabling greater commercial lending activity.
However, the agency cautioned that despite impro­vements, Pakistan’s operating environment remains weak. Banks’ creditworthiness will continue to be closely tied to the sovereign, due to their large holdings of government securities and exposure to state-linked entities.
The report noted that Pakistani banks have remai­ned financially resilient. The sector’s impaired loan ratio improved to 7.1pc by March 2025, down from 7.6pc at end-2023, supported by strong loan growth of 26pc. Fitch expects this pace to moderate, but asset quality should remain stable, helped by improved repayment capacity amid lower interest rates.
Return on average equity fell to 20pc in Q1 2025 from 27pc in 2023, reflecting tighter net interest margins and higher operating costs due to inflation. These pressures were partially offset by stronger non-interest income. Fitch expects further margin pressure, but overall earnings should remain supported by loan expansion and treasury operations.
The system’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) rose to a decade-high of 21pc by March 2025, reflecting strong internal capital generation. While the CAR may ease slightly if higher-risk private-sector lending expands, it is expected to stay well above the 11.5pc regulatory minimum.

MUZAFFARABAD/GILGIT: At least five pe­ople were killed in Azad Jammu and Kash­mir on Monday in different rain-related incidents as monsoon-induced floods ravaged multiple areas in the Ghizer district of Gilgit-Bal­tis­­tan, blocking roads and destroying infrastructure.
In Neelum Valley, a vehicle with tourists on board skidded off the “slippery road” and plummeted almost 250 feet down the ravine. Three people were killed on the spot, while the fourth succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital.
Neelum Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua said a Karachi-based couple along with their two-year-old daughter — who survived the accident — and a helper were coming back from Taobutt when they met the accident near Shundaas.
As a result, Zeeshan Shahid, 38, his wife Anmol Haroon, 32, driver Farooq, 35, and helper Atif died. The couple had travelled to Kel in their car but had rented the jeep for their trip to Taobutt. District Disaster Management Officer Akhtar Ayoub told Dawn that the couple’s funerals had been held and their bodies as well as the child and the car were being sent to Islamabad to be handed over to the family members, arriving there from Karachi.
University teacher swept away
In another incident, a faculty member at the University of Poonch, Dr Gul-i-Lala, 32, was swept away after she tried to cross a swollen stream in her Suzuki Cultus.
According to Registrar Dr Abdul Rauf, Dr Lala had left the Shamsabad campus after delivering a one-hour lecture in the morning and was heading home via Hajira Road.
Eyewitnesses said she was advised to turn back because a torrent was flowing across the road, whereupon she opted for an alternative route on the outskirts of Rawalakot. However, while attempting to cross a culvert where water from an otherwise small stream was rushing over the road, the accident occurred.
Her vehicle, swept away by the water, was retrieved about a hundred feet down the stream, but she did not survive.
Meanwhile, Poonch DC Sardar Umar Farooq told Dawn that rescue teams also evacuated 18 female students from a hostel whose ground floor had been submerged. Five residents trapped in their homes along Hajira Road were also rescued.
In the same district, three men collecting firewood in Karmal village of Rajdhani were stranded on a dry patch in the middle of River Poonch. However, they were rescued.
A flash flood in a water channel in Dhaman Pakhonar village of Sudhnoti district washed away four houses, two suspension bridges, and one RCC bridge, said Deputy Com­­missioner Mumtaz Kazmi. There were no casualties as the residents had already vacated their homes, but they were unable to save their belongings, he added. The DC said the road le­­ading to the village had also been destroyed at several points, but machinery would be deployed to reopen it.
Flash floods in GB
As water shortages and electricity outages continued in Gilgit, Danyor, and other flood-hit areas, flash floods damaged infrastructure in Asumber, Hatoon, and Ishkoman valleys in Ghizer. According to the local administration, the Government Boys High School in Asumber was affected, while in Hatoon, the flood blocked the Ghizer River near the Hasis village. The flood damaged the Ishkoman Road at various places, while a house was affected in Dilnati Ponyal.
On the other hand, the increasing water level in the Ghizer River forced the residents living near its banks to move to safer areas.
The Ghizer-Chitral Road remained closed due to the flood in the Gulapur area. The residents and affected people in Daen village remained disconnected as the only bridge linking the area to the rest of the region was recently damaged. Similarly, the flood-affec­ted areas in Ghizer, Ghanche, Skardu, Astore, Hunza and Diamer remained marooned.
The Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Gulmit-Gojal in Hunza was opened to traffic, as was the Hoper Valley road in Nagar. The traffic on the Baltistan Highway and Naltar Highway remained suspended, but people managed to cross the blocked roads in cases of emergency.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Ghizer was the most-affected district as the mountainous region faced one of the worst floods that had killed 39 people, including tourists, since July. These disasters have caused damage to the tune of Rs30 billion, he added.
“At least two dozen people have been injured so far; 35 small and large bridges have been washed away; a dozen mosques and ‘Jamaat Khanas’ have been damaged, and more than half a dozen buildings of educational institutions have been damaged,” he said. About 350 houses were completely destroyed and at least 600 houses had sustained partial damage, he added.

Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi presides over a meeting of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee.—APP

• Sets strict timelines for resolution of different categories of land and family disputes
• Forms a commission to address delayed orders in commercial, revenue, and fiscal cases
• Urges a mechanism to produce detainees in disappearance cases within 24 hours
ISLAMABAD: The National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC) on Monday specified strict and swift timelines for disposing of different categories of court cases across the country, especially land disputes, family matters and juvenile punishment cases.
The committee in its 54th meeting, chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, categorised cases and approved certain timeframe for the disposal of each. “These timelines would be considered as one of the key performance indicators in judges’ performance evaluation and would be in-built at the Dashboard,” the committee said.
To decide declaratory suit (land disputes), a 24-month deadline has been fixed. Similarly, declaratory suit (inheritance disputes) and recovery suit (public revenue/money matters) will have to be decided in 12 months. For cases of specific performance (contract enforcement), an 18-month deadline has been set. A timeframe of six months has been fixed for injunction suit (land disputes), rent cases, family suit (dissolution/dower/maintenance/guardianship) and execution petitions of family court decree; while for succession cases (uncontested) a deadline of two months has been set.
Other cases along with their respective timeframe include: execution petitions on banking court decree, execution petitions on civil court decree and criminal trial (punishment up to seven years) in 12 months; execution petitions on rent matters in three months; criminal trial (juvenile offenders) and labour cases in six months; criminal trial (punishment above seven years) in 18 months; and criminal trial (murder) in 24 months.
The committee deliberated on key policy issues, reviewed implementation of decisions from its 53rd meeting, and unanimously reiterated its resolve to strengthen institutional capacity, accelerate access to justice and ensure efficient and effective justice delivery.
Committee constituted
On strengthening the commercial litigation framework (CLC), the committee appreciated substantial progress by the high courts, acknowledging the CLC initiative as a major step towards a robust and efficient commercial litigation framework.
To address protracted litigation and injunctive orders in commercial, revenue and fiscal cases, a committee under Justice Shafi Siddiqui was constituted to formulate recommendations. The committee will examine AGP’s suggestions regarding issues arising out of Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and place recommendations in the next meeting.
Also in the meeting, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan assured the committee that a comprehensive mechanism on enforced disappearances for ensuring production of detained persons before the magistrate concerned within 24 hours would be presented at the next sitting.
Judicial independence
The NJPMC commended high courts for formulating SOPs and emphasised adding stage-wise timelines from complaint filing to final action. It decided that all instances of extraneous influence should be reported within 24 hours and action finalised within 14 days.
SOPs should provide immediate redress measures to safeguard the dignity of the complainant judge. A reporting mechanism to the CJP was desired for information and intervention where necessary. High courts will notify SOPs and share them with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP).
On model criminal trial courts, the committee expressed appreciation for progress by SHC and PHC, noting the efforts would enhance access to justice and timely delivery.
Regarding institutionalisation of court-annexed mediation, the committee acknowledged progress by the high courts and underscored the importance of pre-trial mediation.
The AGP assured updates on legislative intervention at federal and provincial levels about mandatory pre-trial mediation in the next meeting.
Other reforms
Agenda items concerning performance evaluation, standardised recruitment, establishment of a District Judiciary Policy Forum (DJPF), parity in terms and conditions of service and access to international exposure opportunities were taken jointly.
The NJPMC unanimously decided to include the LHC chief justice in the committee formulating recommendations on these matters, to be finalised before the next meeting.
The committee expressed satisfaction with progress on the professional excellence index, recognising it as a vital instrument for promoting professional standards and strengthening justice system effectiveness.
It desired high courts to establish accessible, user-friendly public forums at both high court and district court levels for information provision and complaint redressal.
On model civil courts, while appreciating the LHC’s efforts, the forum decided high courts may pilot the initiative for the oldest civil cases in chronological order.
High courts may determine the number of model civil courts in each district, keeping in view the target caseload. District and sessions judges may assign such cases to model civil courts under a time-bound trial regime.
On jail reforms and a national prison policy, the committee resolved to share reports of provincial sub-committees and the prison reform action plan with high courts for input. A national prison policy will be formulated and placed before the next meeting.
The forum was further sensitised to key issues to foster awareness and coordinated efforts, including suspension of sentence pending appeal under Section 426 of CrPC and repatriation of judicial officers of special courts and tribunals.
The LHC CJ assured that biometric verification at the time of institution of cases would be implemented, with progress to be placed before the committee in the next meeting.
The next meeting has been set for Oct 17.
LJCP and AJDF meeting
Separately, the CJP also chaired the 45th meeting of the LJCP, reaffirming its commitment to an accessible and equitable justice system for all citizens and emphasising unwavering dedication to judicial excellence and a fair and just society in Pakistan.
The commission reviewed implementation of decisions from its 44th meeting, particularly progress by the advisory committee for law reforms comprising the law secretary and eminent lawyers. It acknowledged the need for reforms in family laws and the CrPC, 1898, and applauded the committee’s work, expressing hope that, in consultation with stakeholders, it will suggest viable recommendations to improve service delivery in family dispute and criminal matters.
The commission approved the annual accounts of the Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF) for FY 2024-25.
For institutional development and to enhance LJCP performance, it constituted a committee to review LJCP Employees Service Rules of 1992 and suggest reforms to enhance administrative efficiency and enable performance management.
Meanwhile, the AJDF governing body thanked the federal government for a grant of Rs2billion.
The contribution will be utilised for advancing women-centric facilities in courts, solarisation of judicial complexes, provision of clean drinking water and establishment of e-libraries in courts across the country, with a special focus on underdeveloped and remote districts.
The forum verified annual accounts of the fund for 2024-25 and approved significant projects and allocations aimed at strengthening the justice sector by focusing on litigant facilities.
The governing body approved projects of the High Court of Sindh and High Court of Balochistan amounting to over Rs631million, emphasising women-centric facilities within court premises to provide a safe, accessible and inclusive environment for female litigants.
Approval was also granted for projects of the Sindh, Lahore, Balochistan and Peshawar high courts under the Underdeveloped Regions Window amounting to Rs317m, including solarisation of courts to ensure uninterrupted power and the establishment of modern e-libraries in remote and underdeveloped districts.
The governing body sanctioned various training programs for the federal and provincial judicial academies.

The Spanish second seed snapped the world number one’s 26-match winning streak on hardcourts when his ailing rival signalled he could no longer continue while trailing 5-0 in the first set of the final.
“This is not the way that I want to win trophies, I just have to say sorry, I can understand how you must feel now,” Alcaraz told Sinner during the presentation ceremony after capturing his third Masters 1000 crown of the season following his success in Monte Carlo and Rome.
“As I said many times, you are a true champion and I am sure from these situations, you are going to come back even stronger, as you always do. That’s what true champions do.”

Sinner had been bidding to become the first man since Roger Federer in 2015 to win back-to-back Cincinnati titles but he looked uncomfortable early on in the sweltering conditions.
He called it quits after 23 minutes of play.
“I’m super, super sorry to disappoint you,” Sinner told the crowd. “Yesterday I didn’t feel great. I thought that I would improve during the night, but it came up worse.

“I tried to come out, tried to make it at least a small match, but I couldn’t handle more, so I’m very sorry.”

It was also unclear whether the Italian would be fit enough to partner Katerina Siniakova in the revamped mixed doubles event at Flushing Meadows which is due to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Singles action at the hardcourt major begins on Sunday.
Monday’s clash had been expected to be a dress-rehearsal ahead of a potential final showdown between the world’s two best players in New York, with the duo having faced off in the title match at the last two majors.
Alcaraz came from two sets down and saved three championship points to triumph at Roland Garros, while Sinner emerged victorious at Wimbledon.
Monday’s result extended Alcaraz’s head-to-head record over Sinner to 95, including a 62 edge on hardcourts.
Swiatek downs Paolini to claim first Cincinnati Open title
Later in the evening, Iga Swiatek captured her first Cincinnati Open title by beating Jasmine Paolini 7-5 6-4, with the Pole third seed sending a powerful message ahead of the US Open.
The six-times Grand Slam winner did not drop a set on her way to the title and was clinical in the final, converting all six of her break points to clinch her 11th WTA 1000 crown and first since last year’s Italian Open.
She is now the second all-time winner in the WTA 1000 format history, trailing only Serena Williams (23).
“I want to thank my team. I dont know why I won tournaments that were like the last ones in terms of where I thought I would be playing well,” Swiatek said.
“Thank you for forcing me to become a better player and learning how to play on these faster surfaces. I’m shocked and super happy.”

Paolini made the brighter start, surging to a 3-0 lead and pushing Swiatek to the brink of a double break. Yet the Pole responded with a five-game run and, after squandering her first chance to serve out the opening set, closed it on her second attempt.
Swiatek carried her momentum into the second set, saving two break points at 4-3 before holding firm to move within one game of the title. She sealed victory at the first opportunity with a big serve, extending her perfect record against the Italian to 60.
The win ensures Wimbledon champion Swiatek will climb back to world number two, securing the second seed for the final major of the year at Flushing Meadows, where singles action begins on Sunday.
Swiatek is also set to team up with Norway’s Casper Ruud in the new US Open mixed doubles event.</p><small>2025-08-19 04:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19085236880685f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931771/squash-star-ashab-downs-kueh-for-johns-creek-open-crown' target='_blank'><strong>Squash star Ashab downs Kueh for Johns Creek Open crown</strong></a><br><p>JOHNS CREEK (Georgia): Pakistan’s Mohammad Ashab Irfan solidified his standing within the country’s competitive squash scene by capturing the Johns Creek Open title on Monday, defeating Malaysia’s Nathan Kueh 3-1.
The 21-year-old Ashab, already a two-time title winner this year, recovered from losing the first game to secure victory 8-11, 11-2, 11-2, 11-6 in a 40-minute match.
As many as 20 players competed in the Professional Squash Association (PSA) Challenger Tour event, which offered a total prize purse of $12,000. Irfan entered the tournament as the second seed.

He was among seven Pakistani players participating, joining Mohammad Asim Khan, Mohammad Huzaifa Ibrahim, Fawad Khalil, Mohammad Samiullah, Ahsan Ayaz and Farhan Zaman.
Samiullah, Farhan, Fawad and Ahsan were all eliminated in the first round. Huzaifa progressed to the second round before losing to Brazil’s Diego Gobbi.
Top seed Asim Khan delivered strong performances throughout the tournament, advancing to the semi-finals. However, his run ended on Saturday with a 11-9, 4-11, 11-7, 11-9 defeat against Kueh.
Ashab, who won the South Australian Open and RC Pro Series titles earlier this year, reached the final by overcoming third-seeded Gobbi in a gripping 53-minute semi-final clash, winning 11-7, 14-12, 4-11, 11-5.
The competition featured players from Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia, America, Colombia, Mexico, South Africa and Bermuda.
This victory adds to the successful year for Pakistani squash as Noor Zaman claimed the Under-23 World Squash Championship title in April.
Furthermore, Pakistan secured multiple titles at the Australian Junior Open the same month, with Azan Ali claiming the Under-17 crown and Ahmad Ali Naz triumphing in the Under-11 category.
The girls were also successful, as sisters Mehwish and Mahnoor Ali bagged the Under-17 and Under-13 titles, respectively.
Sohail Adnan also clinched two titles this year as he won the British Junior Open Under-13 title in January. The 12-year-old Sohail followed it up with another triumph in the Asian Junior Squash Championship in the same category in July.

The deportees are part of a group previously offered refuge in Germany but now caught between Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s tougher immigration policy and a wave of expulsions from Pakistan.
Hinterseher told reporters that Pakistani police re­­cently arrested “around 450” Afghans who were pre­viously accepted under the German scheme for peo­ple at risk from the Taliban. Of those, “211 peo­ple, according to our current information, have been deported to Afgha­nistan,” he added.
Another “245 people were allowed to leave camps” in Pakistan where they had been gathered prior to their scheduled deportation, he said.
“We are continuing to talk to Pakistan to facilitate the return of those who have already been deported.”
 
 

Last week, two German rights groups launched legal proceedings against two German ministers, accusing them of “abandonment and failure to render assistance” to those hoping for German visas under the scheme.
Germany set up the programme under former chancellor Olaf Scholz in the wake of the Taliban’s 2021 takeover, to help Afghans who had worked with German institutions and their families.
It also included people deemed particularly threatened by the Taliban, including journalists and human rights activists.
However, the program­­me has been put on hold as part of a stricter immigration policy brought in un­­der Merz, who took office in May, leaving some 2,000 Afghans stranded in Pakistan waiting for German visas.
A German interior ministry spokesman said that an individual review, potentially followed by security screening, was underway for each person in the admission programme.

The two countries signed a joint communique at the end of the visit of a high-level ministerial delegation of Pakistan, led by Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, to Tehran.
The Pakistani minister succeeded in securing Iran’s agreement to import a major portion of its rice imports from Pakistan. Under the agreement, Iran’s government and private sector will now rely primarily on Pakistan for rice imports, opening a consistent and stable export market for Pakistani rice, a press release of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research said.
Mr Hussain also obtained firm assurances from Iran to resolve hurdles in mango exports, particularly delays in import permits and foreign exchange allocations.
 
 

Iran’s Minister for Agriculture, Gholamreza Nouri Ghezeljeh, said the current volume of agriculture goods’ trade between the two countries stand at around $1.4 billion, but the two countries have complementary strengths that can be used to secure each other’s needs across different seasons.
He said that Iran will expand exports of its dairy products, nuts, fruits and vegetables to Pakistan, while Pakistan will meet a portion of Tehran’s corn and rice imports and 60 per cent of its meat imports under the new plan.
Mr Nouri said the two sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in research on climate change and food security, and set up a joint agriculture committee that will meet every six months to monitor progress and resolve bottlenecks.
The Pakistani minister also secured consensus on a wide range of facilitation measures aimed at easing agriculture trade. These included faster customs clearance, establishment of warehouses and cold chain systems, and improvements in border infrastructure to ensure perishable commodities reach markets efficiently and in top quality.
 
 

The two countries also reaffirmed their commitment to move forward towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that will provide a long-term framework for expanding bilateral agriculture trade, he said.
The next session of the Iran–Pakistan Joint Economic Commission will be held in Tehran next month.

• PTI’s counsel rejects AGP’s view, says parliament is sovereign and not subordinate to courts
• Senators alarmed by rising cases of gender-based violence in 2024; conviction rates below 1pc
ISLAMABAD: Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan on Monday called for keeping the doors open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
Making a rare appearance before the Senate, some three weeks after being summoned for an explanation on the alleged interference of the judiciary in internal parliamentary processes, the AGP referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of any proceedings in parliament cannot be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure.
However, he insisted that the bar was not absolute. “There is a lot of sanctity attached to it, but it is not absolute,” he remarked.
He also referred to April 4, 2022, judgement of the Supreme Court, which declared unconstitutional the ruling of the then-deputy speaker on the no-confidence motion against the then-prime minister Imran Khan.
He said the PPP had filed the petition, and he himself and Barrister Ali Zafar appeared before the court as counsel.
 
 

“Now in those circumstances it becomes very important to leave that door open, because sometimes matters could bring everything not just to a standstill but also produce consequences which may not have any resolution within the House. In this particular case, when the ruling came out, the assembly was dissolved. Where would the members have gone? Obviously, they had to go to the court, and the court did interfere,” Mr Awan said.
The Attorney General while talking about stay orders against proceedings of parliamentary committees, said a solution could be worked out. He further said that certain amendments in rules of procedure and conduct of business might be required.
The Attorney General’s remarks followed his meeting with former Senate deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwala who had raised the issue of judicial interference in the House last month. Mr Mandviwala told the House that he briefed the AGP on how the high courts were interfering in the proceedings of the House, issuing stay orders against proceedings of standing committees even before a decision has been taken.
‘No room for granting a stay’
PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar also noted that standing committees were extensions of the parliament and that under the Constitution there was no room for granting a stay against their proceedings.
He noted that there should not be an institutional clash and that a solution should be found.
Mr Zafar, however, said that the Attorney General had wrongly interpreted the Constitution. He said courts can intervene where something is not being done in accordance with clear constitutional provisions. He added that the internal proceedings of the House and the committees cannot be touched. “We are sovereign and not subordinate to the courts,” he remarked.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar fully endorsed the remarks by the PTI leader. He noted that the principles of the trichotomy of powers must be followed by all. He added that how the country is to be run is ultimately for parliament to decide.
Gender-based violence
Senators from both sides of the aisle also expressed alarm over increasing violence against women and low conviction rate. They were speaking on a motion seeking the House to discuss the alarming increase in cases of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in the country and failure of administrative and judicial machinery to administer justice to women.
PPP Vice-President Sherry Rehman, who moved the motion, cited the latest report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation. She said that in 2024 alone, a staggering 32,617 cases were reported across Pakistan. These included 5,339 incidents of rape, 24,439 cases of kidnapping and abduction, 2,238 cases of domestic violence, and 547 so-called honour killings.
She pointed out that despite the shocking scale of violence, justice remains elusive: the conviction rate for honour killings is less than 0.5 per cent, rape less than 0.5pc, kidnapping/abduction 0.1pc, and domestic violence 1.3pc (SSDO, 2024).

Senators Maulana Abdul Wa­­say of JUI-F and Manzoor Kakar of BAP from Balochistan alleged the bill would deprive citizens of a livelihood as authorities plan crackdown on small petroleum related businesses with closures and heavy fines, open floodgates of corruption, thus further alienating the people of Balochistan while large tankers would keep flowing smuggled products across mainland.
PML-N Senator Sadia Abbasi also initially appeared unimpressed by the proposed bill and suggested a meeting with FBR and Customs authorities for the senators from Balochistan. She said there was no point in passing the bill while senators from Balochistan opposed it and recalled that a bill about federally administered tribal areas (Fata) was also passed in the past under US pressure. She said now everybody was saying it was pas­sed reluctantly under US pressure. She cautioned against rushing the legislation, urging wider consultation with the petroleum industry and provincial stakeholders. “This bill directly affe­cts common people in Baloch­is­tan. We must not pass it in haste,” she said.

Senators from Balochistan resist bill over ‘livelihood concerns’

Maulana Wasay said it was an open secret how large tankers of 65,000 litre petroleum products travelled from border to Punjab and who were their beneficiaries. He described the bill as economic devastation for poor families in Balochistan, where, he said, 5,000 to 6,000 small vehicles transporting fuel had already been impounded. “These vehicles are the livelihood of poor people. If this bill passes, what will they do?” he asked, warning that harsher enforcement would fuel resentment in an already volatile province.
Senator Kakar said the vehicles used in transportation of Iranian oil products were issued ‘tokens of movement’ and questioned secretary petroleum if he had the data about such tokens who expressed his ignorance. Mr Kakar said products coming from the border passed through 100 security posts and their carriers paid fixed amounts at every post. 
Power to seal filling stations
The petroleum division briefed the committee that the bill introduced six new clauses aimed at curbing rampant smuggling of petroleum products and empowered authorities to seal filling stations selling smuggled fuel, seize related equipment, and take action against vehicles involved in the trade and impose fines. 
The petroleum secretary requested the senators to pass the bill promising to address their concerns through the enabling rules. He said bill granted deputy commissioners magisterial powers to handle confiscated goods and penalise violators. He said the crackdown would primarily target large oil tankers carrying over 40,000 litres of smuggled fuel.
He said smuggling of petroleum products worth billions of rupees was draining the economy and undermining government revenues, especially after the increase in petroleum levy (about Rs81 per litre at present), which had increased the incentive for smuggling. “The real beneficiaries are not small vehicle owners but powerful smuggling networks.
He assured the senators that licenced vehicles would not be targeted and pledged to incorporate the committee’s recommendations within three days.

A statement issued on Monday by the central bank said Prism Plus is built on the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, which supports structured and data-rich financial communication, enabling enhanced transparency, interoperability, and automation across the payment and settlement ecosystem.
The system includes new features for liquidity management, transaction queuing and prioritisation, and scheduling of future-dated payments.
Prism Plus will make Pakistan’s financial system faster, safer and more modern, according to the SBP.
It said efficient money transfer, better liquidity management of securities transactions and minimal risks in the system would be achieved with the introduction of Prism Plus.
The statement added that the launch event will be chaired by State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmed and will be attended by senior SBP officials, representatives of financial institutions and key stakeholders from the financial sector.
“This development is a significant milestone in the ongoing development of Pakistan’s financial infrastructure,” the SBP said.
This new system is a significant step towards modernising the way funds and government securities transactions are handled in the country’s financial structure.
The central bank added that the new system had two main components:

A faster Real-time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) system for large-value payments between different participants
A brand-new Central Securities Depository (CSD) that manages government securities, such as T-bills, PIBs, and other government securities.

The system has been developed in alignment with SBP’s Vision 2028, which aims to establish a modern, inclusive, and robust financial ecosystem.
Last month, Ahmed had said that the institution planned to launch a pilot for a digital currency and was finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government ramped up efforts to modernise the country’s financial system.
In June, retail payment volumes rose by 12 per cent year-on-year to 2,408 million transactions in the third quarter of FY25, while the overall transaction value increased by 8pc to Rs164 trillion.
The SBP-operated payment systems — Raast and the Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) — played a critical role in enabling faster digital payments.
Raast processed 371m transactions worth Rs8.5tr during the quarter, bringing its cumulative total to over 1.5bn transactions valued at more than Rs34tr since launch. RTGS facilitated 1.5m large-value transactions amounting to Rs347tr during the period.</p><small>2025-08-18 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18231935c905691.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931709/son-of-norwegian-princess-charged-with-four-rapes' target='_blank'><strong>Son of Norwegian princess charged with four rapes</strong></a><br><p>The 28-year-old son of Norway’s crown princess has been charged with raping four women and several acts of violence, and risks up to 10 years in prison, a prosecutor said on Monday.
Marius Borg Hoiby, who was born out of a relationship before Crown Princess Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon, has been under investigation since his arrest on August 4 last year on suspicion of assaulting a girlfriend.
He is accused of raping four women while they were sleeping. In at least three of the cases, he met the women the same day and had consensual sex before the alleged rapes, public prosecutor Sturla Henriksbo told reporters.
Hoiby is also charged with filming their genitals without their knowledge.
 

State Attorney Sturla Henriksbo addresses the press to report on the decision on the indictment of Marius Borg Hoiby, son of Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, in Oslo, Norway, August 18. — AFP

Henriksbo said investigators had video clips and photographs as evidence.
The four rapes allegedly took place in 2018, 2023 and 2024, the last one after the police investigation began.
Other charges against Hoiby include domestic abuse against a former partner and several counts of violence, disturbing the peace, vandalism and violations of restraining orders against another former partner.
The only victim identified by the prosecution was Hoiby’s ex-girlfriend, Nora Haukland, whom he is accused of physically and psychologically abusing in 2022 and 2023.
‘Clenched fist’
“The violence consisted, among other things, of him repeatedly hitting her in the face, including with a clenched fist, choking her, kicking her and grabbing her hard,” the prosecutor said.
“The maximum penalty for the offences in the indictment is up to 10 years in jail.
“These are very serious acts that can leave lasting scars and destroy lives.”
The palace remained tight-lipped after the announcement.
“It is for the courts to consider this matter and reach a decision,” spokeswoman Sara Svanemyr said in a comment emailed to AFP.
The prosecutor said that Hoiby, as a member of the royal family, would not be treated “more lightly or more severely” than anyone else in similar circumstances. Hoiby already admitted to assault and vandalism in the August 2024 incident.
In a public statement 10 days after his arrest, he said he had acted “under the influence of alcohol and cocaine after an argument”, having suffered from “mental troubles” and struggling “for a long time with substance abuse”.
A tall blond who cultivates a “bad boy” look with slicked back hair, earrings, rings and tattoos, Hoiby has been in the eye of a media storm since his arrest.
When the rape allegations emerged in November, he spent a week in custody — unprecedented for a member of Norway’s royal family. After his release, he reportedly went to rehab in London.
‘Gilded cage’
Hoiby is the child of a brief romance between his mother and Morten Borg, who has also been convicted of abuse and drug-related crimes. They were together at a time when the future princess was part of Norway’s house music scene, known for its abundance of hash and ecstasy.
He was propelled into the spotlight at the age of four when his mother married Norway’s crown prince, with whom she went on to have two more children.
Hoiby was raised by the royal couple alongside his step-siblings Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus, now aged 21 and 19, respectively. Unlike them, however, he has no official public role.
“He has been put in a virtually impossible position: one foot in, one foot out. He is not technically part of the royal household, but he grew up in it,” said Sigrid Hvidsten, royal commentator at the newspaper Dagbladet.
“He has lived in a grey zone, a kind of gilded cage,” she told AFP in December 2024.
According to media reports, he hung out with gang members, Hells Angels bikers and members of Oslo’s Albanian mafia. In 2023, police contacted him to have a cautionary talk after he was seen moving in the same circles as “notorious criminals”.
It emerged last year that Hoiby had already been arrested in 2017 for using cocaine at a music festival.</p><small>2025-08-18 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1823022780f782c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931702/trump-says-to-meet-putin-zelensky-if-everything-works-out' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says to meet Putin, Zelensky if ‘everything works out’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that if his meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky went well, he expected to hold a trilateral meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin with the goal of ending the Ukraine-Russia war.
Trump is pushing Ukraine to make major concessions following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, saying Kyiv must give up Crimea and abandon its Nato ambitions. Those are two of Moscow’s top demands.
But Zelensky, who huddled with the Europeans before they all went to the White House to meet Trump, urged Trump to bring “peace through strength” against Russia and stressed the need for United States security guarantees.
“We’re going to have a meeting. I think if everything works out well today, we’ll have a trilat (trilateral summit) and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that,” said Trump, sitting alongside Zelensky at the White House.
“I just spoke to President Putin indirectly and we’re going to have a phone call right after these meetings today.”
 


Zelensky thanked Trump for hosting the talks, which will be expanded to include European leaders later in the day. “Thank you for [the] invitation and thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop killings and stop this war,” he said.
Fielding questions from reporters, Trump said that Washington will be involved in providing security guarantees as part of a peace agreement on ending Russia’s war.
European countries are “the first line of defence because they are there, they are Europe, we’re going to help them out also. We’ll be involved”, he stated.
However, the US president repeated his view that a ceasefire was not necessary to end the Russia-Ukraine war, echoing earlier comments that brought his position more in line with Putin.
“I don’t think you need a ceasefire,” Trump said. “I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically why one country or the other wouldn’t want it. You have a ceasefire and they rebuild and rebuild and rebuild and you know maybe they don’t want that.”

Trump welcomed Zelensky to the White House, saying, “We love them,” when asked what his message was to the people of Ukraine after shaking Zelensky’s hand.
He also complimented Zelensky on his smart black jacket, after the Ukrainian was criticised by right-wing media for failing to wear a suit during a visit in February that ended in a shouting match.
Earlier, European leaders began arriving at the White House ahead of the high-stakes talks, with Nato chief Mark Rutte, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer being among the first to arrive.

Trump, 79, said it was a “big day at the White House” and appeared to be in a combative mood, churning out a string of social media posts.
“I know exactly what I’m doing,” the Republican said on his Truth Social network. “And I don’t need the advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years, and were never able to do a thing to stop them.”
Trump will later meet separately with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Finland, as well as Rutte and von der Leyen.
‘Peace through strength’
The European leaders held a preparatory meeting with the Ukrainian president in Washington on Monday morning, while Zelensky also met Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg.
Zelensky described the talks at the White House as “very serious” — and sought to flatter Trump ahead of the meeting, by echoing his trademark “peace through strength” language.
“President Trump has that strength. We have to do everything right to make peace happen,” he said.
The Ukrainian leader added that they would have “time to speak about the architecture of security guarantees. This is, really, the most important”.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on the plane to Washington: “We’ve got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just.”
 






Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said before going to the White House that a “small window of dialogue is opening” and that she backed the security guarantees idea.
Reports had said Putin would be open to Western security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of any peace deal, but had ruled out Kyiv’s long-term ambition to join Nato.
 
 

Russia kept up its attacks on Ukraine ahead of the new talks, killing at least seven people, including two children, in dozens of drone and ballistic missile strikes overnight, Ukrainian officials said. Zelensky called the strikes an attempt to “humiliate diplomatic efforts”.
A Trump-Putin summit in Alaska last week failed to produce a ceasefire in the nearly three-and-a-half-year war that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Afterwards, Trump dropped his previous insistence on a ceasefire in favour of seeking a complete peace deal, meaning negotiations could proceed while the war goes on. He also alarmed Kyiv and European capitals by repeating a number of Russian talking points.
Trump said on Sunday that Zelensky could end the war “almost immediately, if he wants to”, but that, for Ukraine, there was “no getting back” Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and “No going into Nato”.
‘Some concessions’
US media reports have said Putin would consider freezing much of the current frontline in Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to completely give up the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.
 
 

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said Moscow had made “some concessions” on territory. But such a move is widely viewed as unacceptable for Ukraine, which still holds much of the resource-rich area.
Yevgeniy Sosnovsky, a photographer from the captured Ukrainian city of Mariupol, said he “cannot understand” how Ukraine would cede land already under its control.
“Ukraine cannot give up any territories, not even those occupied by Russia,” he told AFP.
Kyiv and European leaders have warned against making political and territorial concessions to Russia, whose assault on Ukraine has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.</p><small>2025-08-18 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/182218354ce582d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931704/hamas-accepts-new-gaza-truce-plan-group-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas accepts new Gaza truce plan, group official says</strong></a><br><p>Hamas has accepted a new ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior member of the group said on Monday, after a fresh diplomatic push to end more than 22 months of fighting.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
Mediators Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have struggled to secure a lasting truce in the conflict, which has triggered a dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. But after receiving a new proposal from mediators, Hamas said it was ready for talks.
“The movement has submitted its response, agreeing to the mediators’ new proposal. We pray to God to extinguish the fire of this war on our people,” senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said on Facebook.

Earlier, a Hamas source told AFP the group accepted the proposal “without requesting any amendments”.
Egypt said it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel, adding “the ball is now in its court”. Israel has yet to respond.
A Palestinian source familiar with the talks said mediators were “expected to announce that an agreement has been reached and set a date for the resumption of talks”, adding that guarantees were offered to ensure implementation and pursue a permanent solution.
According to a report in Egyptian state-linked media Al-Qahera, the deal proposed an initial 60-day truce, partial hostage release, release of some Palestinian detainees and provisions to allow for the entry of aid.
The proposal comes more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to expand operations into Gaza City and nearby refugee camps, which have sparked international outcry as well as domestic opposition.
‘Confronted and destroyed’
Out of 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s October 2023 attack that triggered the conflict, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.
Earlier, an Islamic Jihad source said “the remaining captives would be released in a second phase”, with negotiations for a broader settlement to follow. They added that “all factions are supportive” of the Egyptian and Qatari proposal.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be.”
 
 

Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will agree to an agreement in which all the hostages are released at once and according to our conditions for ending the war”.
Meanwhile, in a now familiar scene in Gaza, AFP footage from the southern city of Khan Younis showed crowds of mourners kneeling over the shrouded bodies of their loved ones who were killed seeking aid the day before.
‘Beyond imagination’
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was visiting “to consolidate our existing common efforts in order to apply maximum pressure on the two sides to reach a deal as soon as possible”.

Alluding to the dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip, where UN agencies and aid groups have warned of famine, Abdelatty stressed the urgency of reaching an agreement.
“The current situation on the ground is beyond imagination,” he said.
Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to Gaza, but only if backed by a UN Security Council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”.
‘Deliberate’ starvation
On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 11 people across the territory on Monday, including six killed by Israeli fire in the south.
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it was “not aware of any casualties as a result of IDF fire” in the southern areas reported by the civil defence.
Rights group Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza and “systematically destroying the health, well-being and social fabric of Palestinian life”.
Israel, while heavily restricting aid allowed into Gaza, has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate starvation.
 






Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel’s offensive has killed more than 62,004 Palestinians, most of them civilians.</p><small>2025-08-18 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18184908e12dece.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931689/countrys-running-well-no-need-for-27th-amendment-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s running well, no need for 27th Amendment: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for a 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy, the power corridors in Islamabad had been abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to insiders, would further ‘fine-tune’ the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
Speaking to reporters in London during a visit to the United Kingdom, the deputy PM said: “We are still digesting the 26th Constitutional Amendment, so there is no need for a 27th right now. The country is running well. There is stability and economic improvement.
“We are putting our full attention towards GDP growth and development. Under [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership, all efforts are being made.”
Dar added that under the leadership of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017, Pakistan was “the 24th-biggest economy” and added that the government was working to bring the economy back to that point.
“We are headed that way very quickly, and we are getting ready to become part of the G20,” Dar said.
In June, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association had endorsed a possible amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.
Sources had said certain contentious matters, such as a separate constitutional court, left unresolved in the 26th Amendment, would be taken up in the new amendment. Though speculations had been rife since then, there had been no official word regarding the 27th Amendment.
Dar meets British lawmakers of Pakistani origin
Separately, FM Dar had “productive meetings” with British lawmakers of Pakistani origin, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
The deputy PM arrived in the UK on Saturday ahead of diplomatic engagements with British and Commonwealth leadership from August 17-19. The FO said earlier this week that he would meet British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Pakistan Hamish Falconer.
In today’s statement, the FO said that Dar met with British members of parliament (MP) Mohammad Yasin, Tahir Ali, Imran Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Adnan Hussain.
“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister underscored the deep historical and cultural bonds between Pakistan and the United Kingdom, which are further strengthened by the vibrant Pakistani diaspora in the UK,” the statement read.
 






During the meetings, Dar highlighted the diaspora’s pivotal role as a bridge between Islamabad and London, fostering mutual understanding, cultural exchanges and robust people-to-people connections, the FO added.
Dar “emphasised Pakistan’s strong commitment to enhancing bilateral parliamentary exchanges with the United Kingdom”, the statement read.
“He noted that such engagements facilitate the sharing of democratic experiences, international best practices and core democratic values, which are vital for the growth and stability of democratic institutions in both countries.”
The FO said that the deputy PM appreciated the efforts of the MPs to bring greater attention to the issue of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and commended them for raising awareness on the situation in the UK.
The FO said FM Dar also met UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan Hamish Falconer at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in a “productive” meeting.
“During the meeting, both sides reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to deepening cooperation across political, economic, climate and people-to-people domains,” the FO stated.
 






Dar and Falconer also exchanged views on regional and global developments, while the deputy PM highlighted Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms and shared Pakistan’s perspective on peace and stability in South Asia.
“He (Dar) underscored the importance of the just and peaceful resolution of [the] Jammu and Kashmir Dispute, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions,” the statement read.
According to the FO, both sides appreciated the trajectory of UK-Pakistani relations and noted the importance of regular, high-level interactions to maintain ties and open up new avenues for cooperation.
The foreign minister also met Kashmiri community leaders.
 






The foreign minister also inaugurated two initiatives at the Pakistan High Commission in London: the Provision of Land Record Services and the One Window Passport Processing System.
 






The FO said the Land Record Services, developed through a collaboration between the Punjab Land Revenue Authority and itself, enabled British Pakistanis to remotely access and manage property records in Punjab without the need to travel to Pakistan with services such as online sale deeds, record of rights, mutation entries and document attestation, all secured by blockchain technology to ensure transparency and prevent fraud.
“A dedicated Land Services Desk at the Pakistan High Commission in London will support the pilot phase, with plans to expand to other Pakistani consulates in the United Kingdom.”
It added that the One Window Passport Processing System, implemented by the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports, streamlined passport application procedures by consolidating multiple steps into a single, efficient counter, reducing processing time to approximately 10 minutes per application and thus enhancing convenience, reducing congestion and ensuring greater transparency for British Pakistanis.
