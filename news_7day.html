PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a sharply-worded statement issued on Sunday, expressed alarm that the regional situation was fast changing and the government’s approach could prove disastrous.
He said the government’s current policy of burying heads in the sand, hoping the storm will pass is futile, as flames of war have already reached Pakistan’s doorstep.
Mr Akram underlined that Pakistan can undoubtedly weather the storm, just as it did against India, but the ruling elite must take the nation into confidence and forge a consensus-driven approach because Pakistan is currently caught between a rock and a hard place.

Flames of war have reached Pakistan’s doorstep, says PTI leader Sheikh Waqqas

In the light of the escalating crisis, the PTI leader demanded immediate release of PTI leader Imran Khan and his inclusion in the strategic decision-making regarding the situation arising from the Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran and the subsequent Washington strikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites.
Mr Akram praised the jailed PTI leader’s foresight, noting that a week earlier, he had sent a message through his sisters to postpone the protest for two weeks due to the Iran-Israel conflict.
He also criticised the US president’s deceptive policy towards Iran and said the US President Donald Trump recently claimed the US would not be involved in the Iran-Israel war for the next two weeks, but the US launched the attack within a couple of days later and the US president himself announced the attack.
Mr Akram said the jailed PTI leader Khan’s famous quote, “No one understands the West better than me” has proved to be true.
The PTI leader said that the US has not only violated Iran’s sovereignty, but it has also breached the UN Charter — an act that may have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences at both regional and international levels.
He said the excuse for the Israeli attack on Iran was even more absurd than India’s recent strike on Pakistan under the pretext of the Pahalgam attack. He said the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have adopted a blatantly contradictory and biased approach towards the Muslim world as far as the nuclear issue is concerned as they have been conspicuously silent about Israel’s widely acknowledged nuclear arsenal.
He said the UN and OIC must demand the IAEA to inspect Israel’s nuclear sites and it must work towards a nuclear-free Middle East. Mr Waqas said that Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear programme is intended solely for peaceful purposes.
Published in Dawn, June 23rd, 2025</p><small>2025-06-23 04:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6858c95f8fc35.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919274/a-tough-spot' target='_blank'><strong>A tough spot</strong></a><br><p>THERE are no good choices for Pakistan in the Iran-Israel conflict, particularly in the escalation due to US involvement. Do nothing, and the conflagration will spill over anyway, in the form of refugees or smuggled arms. Pakistan is also concerned about the influx from Iran of Baloch militants and the prospect of Israel establishing long-term air control over Iran or installing a puppet regime in Tehran, given close links between India and Israel.
Side with Iran and Pakistan risks international isolation, the expansion of Israeli or US strikes into Pakistani territory, the erosion of ties with the US and other Iran-sceptic allies such as the Gulf nations, and direct involvement in the Middle Eastern conflict.
Facilitate the US in its support of Israel, particularly if Washington plans additional strikes, and Pakistan risks a back-to-the-future misadventure. While enabling the US may strengthen ties with Washington and bring precious dollars, it will also unleash domestic sectarian tensions and exacerbate Baloch militancy (as Tehran may seek to undermine Pakistan through enabling cross-border insurgent groups). Other local resistance, potentially violent and extremist and grounded in anti-colonial sentiment, may also target our state in a rejection of complicity. The economic consequences of losing access to Iranian oil will also be significant.
Even after the US strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, the best choice remains a negotiated end to the conflict. For now, this options seems to be a non-starter as Iran will feel compelled to retaliate against the US incursion. Washington, for its part, is demanding that Iran arrive at the negotiating table ready to cease all nuclear enrichment.

The best choice remains a negotiated end to the conflict.

Tehran is unlikely to agree to a total suspension of its nuclear programme, particularly in light of Israeli and US actions against Iran and its proxies over the past two years. If anything, the Iranian regime is likely to be more focused now on rebuilding its nuclear programme to deter future attacks. The Israelis, meanwhile, are emboldened, having become accustomed over recent months to acting with impunity and now reassured by unconditional US support (despite the fact that political winds within America had started to blow away from it).
Pakistan could still play a productive role at this juncture by serving as a conduit and mediator between Tehran and Washington. Pakistan is well positioned for this given both its productive ties with the IAEA and its history as a ‘front-line’ state. Our establishment could urge US restraint through reminders of futile Western military interventions in the region. But even on this count, Pakistan may struggle to argue for talks over bunker-busters because any position on Iran’s nuclear trajectory could attract renewed international interest in our nuclear programme.
Pakistan’s lack of choices highlights the consequences of our securitised national calculus. There are no compelling narratives linked to human rights, trade, connectivity, resource sharing, technology transfer, etc, that can help clarify Pakistan’s approach to the crisis. Indeed, following US strikes, our main calculation will be how to ensure Pakistan’s nuclear programme is not subject to similar targeting, further prioritising the security paradigm in all our affairs.
We are not alone in this predicament. The privileging of securitised strategic imperatives is inevitable in this era of ‘the end of human rights’, when human toll and freedoms do not even feature in global decision-making as tangential footnotes.
Interestingly, in 2023, during celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a different story was emerging, one that reiterated the continued relevance of human rights, despite otherwise dire prognoses borne of the Global North’s hypocritical foreign policies and tendency to invoke human rights frameworks in a politicised and cynical way.
Research conducted by Geoff Dancy and Christopher Fairss based on the analysis of Google Trends data from 109 countries found no decline in interest in human rights, and in fact greater interest in human rights issues in the Global South than the Global North. Similarly, a 2023 survey by the Open Society Foundations found that 72 per cent of respondents worldwide, and particularly in the Global South, had a positive view of human rights.
This positivity will have undoubtedly mellowed over the past two years, particularly in light of the conflicts and war-induced near-famines in places like Gaza and Sudan. But there is clearly appetite for a non-securitised approach to proliferating global challenges. Perhaps Pakistan will find a clearer path out of the Iran quagmire by returning to the basics and putting human safety and dignity first.

By joining Israel in its military campaign against Iran, the US flouted international law and the UN Charter and plunged the region into uncharted territory, holding the danger of further escalation. It was unprecedented for two nuclear weapons states to have attacked a non-nuclear, NPT-member nation. Its lessons will not be lost on either Iran or other countries.
Days before the US bombing, speculation had intensified that while preparations were afoot for kinetic action with American military assets moved in the region, Trump was keeping the door open for a negotiated solution. He himself said he would take a decision within two weeks, implying there was time for diplomacy. But this turned out to be a ruse and another act of deception and duplicity. As US warplanes hit Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, it blew to smithereens Trump’s claim that he wanted to be a peacemaker. It also put to shame those who believed him. In a late-night address, Trump announced the strikes were a “spectacular success” and the Iranian facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated”. He also warned Tehran that any retaliation against the US would be met with even greater force.
 
 

Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, condemned the attack as an outrageous violation of international law, which will have “everlasting consequences.” He said his country “reserved all options to defend its sovereignty and its people”. Tehran vowed to continue its nuclear programme and there is likelihood it will discontinue cooperation with the IAEA. Iran has also called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. UN Secretary General António Guterres called the US attack a “dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge and a direct threat to international peace and security”. He also pointed to the risk that the conflict could “rapidly get out of control” with “catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region and the world”.
Although Iran had anticipated the US entering the war, the situation leaves its leaders with difficult options. Although Tehran warned in the past it would attack US bases and facilities and cause “irreparable damage” if Washington got directly involved in the conflict, it will not be in its interest to widen the war or risk another US attack. It will likely continue what it is already doing in response to persisting Israeli attacks. After the US bombing, Israel launched a new wave of missile assaults and Iran too doubled down on missile attacks on Israel.

One of the biggest casualties of the latest developments is loss of faith in diplomacy.

What may be a factor in determining Tehran’s response is the extent of damage inflicted by the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. So far Iranian officials have said there is limited damage and no danger to residents living in the vicinity of facilities attacked by US bombers. Tehran in any case had time to move some of the nuclear material elsewhere. If Iran is able to show the damage was limited and there were no casualties it can argue military retaliation against the US (for which it doesn’t have the military capacity) is unnecessary and focus instead on non-kinetic and diplomatic responses. Closing the Strait of Hormuz to disrupt shipments is an option that can send the oil price skyrocketing and spark an energy crisis. Although that has apparently been recommended by Iran’s parliament, it too entails costs which Tehran may not want to incur. So, for now, the Iranian priority might be to avoid provoking Trump into taking any more military actions.
If the US-Israeli escalation poses dilemmas for Iran it is also a high-risk gamble for Trump. Not only because of its unpredictable outcome but also because it could mire the US in classic ‘mission creep’ and eventually even in a quagmire with no easy way out. Although America’s disastrous Iraq experience should have served as a sobering lesson it has been willfully ignored by Washington. Trump has threatened to expand the military campaign against Iran, if necessary, that is if Tehran doesn’t accept US terms for a ‘settlement’. If ‘peace’ does not come quickly, he has said, the US will go after other targets in Iran. By this he means capitulation by Tehran and completely giving up its nuclear programme. But with Iran’s refusal to surrender the question is will the US get drawn in even more in a war of choice? If that happens it would lead to disastrous consequences both for the US and the Middle East.
One of the biggest casualties of the latest developments must surely be a collapse of faith in diplomacy. Who can trust Trump’s America when the administration has used subterfuge and deception right from the time it engaged Iran in Oman-mediated negotiations, ostensibly to reach a deal? From what Trump has now said it is obvious the US was all-in with Israel from the very start and was negotiating in bad faith with Iran. Referring to the Israeli prime minister, Trump said he was working with him “as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before”.
Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran on June 13 came just days before another round of talks in Oman between the US and Iran. By his own admission, Trump had advance knowledge of the Israeli assault. Not only did he do nothing to stop it but gave Netanyahu a green light to go ahead while pretending to pursue a diplomatic path. As Iran’s foreign minister put it: “Last week, we were in negotiations with the US when Israel decided to blow up that diplomacy. This week, we held talks with the E3/EU when the US decided to blow up that diplomacy.” Any return to negotiations was now meaningless, he said.
While it is too early to say how the crisis will play out with the situation in such flux it is more than likely that the US-Israeli joint military campaign will, over time, push Iran to do what it can to acquire nuclear weapons capability. It has been left with no choice but to pursue that path once it is able to ride out the current crisis. This would mark an epic failure for both the US and Israel.

Even earlier in April, when talks on the nuclear issue between the US and Iran, mediated by Oman, were underway, the Iranian supreme leader had expressed “distrust” towards the “opposing parties”. As it turned out, his pessimism was not without reason.
Using diplomacy as a smokescreen, Israel and the US started a reckless campaign of aggression against the Islamic Republic that may shake the international order to its core. While Israel launched surprise attacks on Iran on June 13, the much-anticipated US strikes materialised early on Sunday. Apparently, three Iranian nuclear facilities were hit, and President Donald Trump has issued more threats unless Iran makes peace on America’s terms. Mr Trump said after the strikes that “now is the time for peace”. Not exactly, it would appear.
Many argue that the US-Israeli campaign is not all about nuclear weapons, which Iran denies it is pursuing, or the other ‘destabilising activities’ the Western bloc accuses Tehran of indulging in. Muslim states, in fact much of the Global South, would not be wrong in assuming that the new war is designed to punish a Muslim country that refused to bow before Pax Americana, as enforced by Israel in the Middle East. Many credible sources argue that Iran was not pursuing the bomb, but this counts for little when the Empire decides that an errant nation must be ‘punished’. The double standards are glaring when Israel, armed to the teeth with nukes, accuses another power of pursuing atomic weapons.
If there is any state in the world that the international community must be concerned about harbouring weapons of mass destruction, it is Israel, which has unleashed a genocide in Gaza and committed aggression against nearly all its neighbours. But many in the Western camp conveniently overlook the hypocrisy of censuring Iran and embracing Israel. In fact, like the UK, they have applauded the US attacks on Iran from the sidelines.
This is a moment of grave danger for the entire international community. All eyes are on how and when Iran retaliates. The Iranian Majles has called for closing the Strait of Hormuz. Even if Iran were not to take immediate kinetic action against US forces, closing Hormuz would itself draw in America, in its self-assigned role as global policeman, to keep the strait open for international trade. In case US facilities or personnel are hit, matters would escalate rapidly. The only way to prevent a march into a conflagration of devastating proportions is for the US and Israel to immediately halt their aggression against Iran, and respect what remains of international law.

The speculations have gained traction after a video went viral online showing Mr Tareen seated alongside PPPP South Punjab president Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood.
Responding to a question regarding his potential return to politics, Mr Tareen remarked that if he were to resume politics, he would “stand with the PPP.”
While there has been no formal announcement of Mr Tareen’s affiliation with PPP, the comment has stoked a flurry of rumours.
Unconfirmed reports suggest President Asif Zardari, the co-chairman of PPP, may meet Mr Tareen on Wednesday to seal the deal.
However, senior PPPP leader Khawaja Rizwan Alam has dismissed the reports.
He said due to President Zardari’s parliamentary obligations, no such meeting was possible this month.
Mr Tareen has been away from the political scene since his defeats in last year’s general election from Multan and Lodhran.
A source in Mr Tareen’s close circle told Dawn the veteran politician has denied the rumours of him joining PPP. Commenting on the video, the source said Mr Tareen had met Mr Mahmood for business purposes.
Political maverick
Mr Tareen’s political career started during the reign of former dictator Pervez Musharraf.
He started out as a member of PML-Q but joined PTI in 2012.
He was considered a close confidant of PTI leader Imran Khan. Mr Tareen was disqualified before the 2018 election but was instrumental in ensuring that the PTI had enough numbers to form the federal government in 2018.
He brought independent candidates into PTI’s fold to achieve the requisite simple majority in the National Assembly.
Mr Tareen was given important positions in the PTI government but later developed differences with the PTI leadership and was sidelined.
He played a vital role in bringing the no-confidence motion against then prime minister Khan.
Later, he and other members of PTI who had defected from the party formed the IPP before the 2024 general election. After losing the election, Mr Tareen quit politics.

Ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) “condemn firmly the aggression of Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, stress the urgent need to stop Israeli attacks and their great concern regarding this dangerous escalation”, said a statement, issued after the end of a summit in Istanbul this weekend.
It made no direct reference to the US bombardment of Iran’s key nuclear facilities early on Sunday, after President Donald Trump decided to join Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear programme.
But the OIC did denounce the “destabilisation policies of Israel in the region and its recent attacks on Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, constituting a flagrant violation of sovereignty and security of these countries and international law”.

Omits mention of US strikes on nuclear facilities; Dar wants Israel held accountable, says it has become a threat to the region

Attending the OIC meeting, Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday morning that the United States and Israel had “breached a major red line”.
Tehran would hit back at the American attack “by all means necessary”, he added.
Founded in 1969, the 57-member OIC sees its role as protecting the interests of the Muslim world and increasing Muslim solidarity.
Syed Irfan Raza adds from Islamabad: Speaking at the OIC meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar urged the international community to hold Israel accountable for its reckless aggression against Iran, saying that Tel Aviv has become a threat to the entire region.
“I hope that our meeting today will not only express our unwavering solidarity with the brotherly country of Iran, but will also send a clear message that Israel must be held accountable, and that its reckless aggression cannot be allowed to jeopardise the peace of the entire region,” Mr Dar said.
 






Pakistan, he said, reiterated its condemnation, in the strongest possible terms, of the unjustified and illegitimate aggression committed by Israel against Iran.
“We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Iran, and offer our deepest condolences at the loss of numerous lives as a result of targeting of civilian areas by Israel,” Mr Dar said.
He said that Israeli aggression took place at a time when the IAEA was continuing its verification activities in Iran.
“Israel has thus violated the international law, IAEA Statute and several IAEA resolutions by attacking the IAEA safeguarded facilities,” he added.
These attacks, he said, had risked setting a dangerous precedent and posed a grave threat to the safety of populations in the region and around the globe.
He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, in response to the blatant and unprovoked Israeli aggression.
The deputy prime minister said that double standards were on full display when it comes to Israel.
“There is no talk of the rule of law, the rules-based international order or consequences for illegal actions. This impunity must end,” he added.
He said Israeli aggression against Iran was not an isolated event, adding that, it was part of a dangerous and consistent pattern of militarism that Israel has demonstrated across the Middle East.

• IAEA chief says such attacks may result in radioactive releases with great consequences
• Guterres calls US bombing ‘perilous turn’
UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan joined China and Russia in circulating a draft resolution at the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians and a return to diplomacy following US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
The strikes, which targeted Iran’s Fordow — where uranium is enriched to 60 per cent — and two other facilities have been described as a dangerous escalation with potential global ramifications.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency session of the Council: “Pakistan has condemned the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which come on the heels of a series of brazen attacks by Israel.”
He added that specific targeting of nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards constitutes a clear breach of international law and poses a “grave threat to the safety and security of populations across the region — and indeed, the world”.
 
 

He urged the Council to act “urgently and decisively” to reject and condemn the attacks, reaffirm protection of civilians and support a diplomatic settlement to the Iranian nuclear issue.
IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the Council that craters were visible at the site, indicating the use of ground-penetrating munitions in the early Sunday attacks.
“At this time, no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow,” Mr Grossi said, while warning: “Armed attacks on nuclear facilities should never take place and could result in radioactive releases with great consequences within and beyond the boundaries of the State which has been attacked.”
UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the bombing “a perilous turn” and called for “an immediate ceasefire and a return to serious, sustained negotiations.”
He cautioned, “The people of the region cannot endure another cycle of destruction. And yet, we now risk descending into a rathole of retaliation after retaliation. To avoid it, diplomacy must prevail. Civilians must be protected. Safe maritime navigation must be guaranteed.”
Mr Guterres emphasised that peace efforts must not be abandoned: “We cannot and must not give up on peace.” He urged member states to take “immediate, decisive action to end fighting” and to commit to meaningful dialogue.
The emergency session was convened at Iran’s request and backed by Pakistan, which described its initiative as “a principled stand to uphold international law and protect regional stability”.
Draft resolution
Against this backdrop, Pakistan, China and Russia have tabled a draft resolution calling for de-escalation and protection of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Although the draft was not scheduled for vote during Sunday’s emergency session, it lays the groundwork for a broader diplomatic push.
Reaffirming the UN Charter and the prohibition on the use of force, the draft “condemns in the strongest terms the attacks against peaceful nuclear sites and facilities under IAEA safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran” and warns such strikes “represent a grave threat to international peace and security”.
The resolution further calls for “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” and urges all parties to “refrain from further escalation”. It places particular emphasis on the “urgent protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure,” reminding all parties of their obligations under international law.
Significantly, the draft urges the resumption of diplomatic negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme, pushing for an agreement that ensures the programme remains “exclusively peaceful”. In exchange, it demands the “complete lifting of all sanctions — both multilateral and unilateral — a clause that aligns with Iran’s longstanding demands and is expected to face resistance from Western members of the Council.
Calls for urgent diplomacy
Briefing the Council, Miroslav Jena, UN’s Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, said: “The world will also not be spared from the ramifications of this dangerous conflict … This latest development must be viewed with the utmost seriousness. It marks a dangerous escalation in a conflict that has already devastated many lives in both countries, in a region on the edge.”

The reaction in Middle East stock markets, which trade on Sunday, suggested investors were assuming a benign outcome, even as Iran intensified its missile attacks on Israel in response to the sudden, deep US involvement in the conflict.
Investors said they expected US involvement would cause a stock market selloff and a possible bid for the dollar and other safe-haven assets when major markets reopen, but also said much uncertainty remained.
“I think the markets are going to be initially alarmed, and I think oil will open higher,” said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital.

Economists warn dramatic rise in oil prices may damage global economy

“We don’t have any damage assessment and that will take some time. Even though (Trump) has described this as ‘done’, we’re engaged,” Spindel said.
“I think the uncertainty is going to blanket the markets, as now Americans everywhere are going to be exposed. It’s going to raise uncertainty and volatility, particularly in oil,” he added.
One indicator of how markets will react in the coming week was the price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency and a gauge of retail investor sentiment. Ether was down 8.5 per cent on Sunday, taking losses since the first Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13 to 13pc.
Most Gulf stock markets, however, seemed unconcerned by the early morning attacks, with the main indexes in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait up slightly or flat. Israel’s Tel Aviv main index was at an all-time high.
Oil prices, inflation
A key concern for markets centres around the potential impact of Middle East developments on oil prices and thus on inflation. Rising inflation could dampen consumer confidence and lessen the chance of near-term interest rate cuts.
Saul Kavonic, a senior energy analyst at equity research firm MST Marquee in Sydney, said Iran could respond by targeting American interests in the Middle East, including Gulf oil infrastructure in places such as Iraq or harassing ship passages through the Strait of Hormuz.
The Strait of Hormuz lies between Oman and Iran and is the primary export route for oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait.
“Much depends on how Iran responds in the coming hours and days, but this could set us on a path towards $100 oil if Iran responds as they have previously threatened to,” Kavonic said.
While global benchmark Brent crude futures have risen as much as 18pc since June 10, hitting a near five-month high of $79.04 on Thursday, the S&P 500 has been little changed, following an initial drop when Israel launched its attacks on Iran on June 13.

TEHRAN: Iranians take part in a protest against the US attack on nuclear sites.—Reuters

DUBAI / TEHRAN: Should Iran escalate the conflict through retaliation against US interests, or, as President Donald Trump has called on them to do, negotiate, which in practice means giving up all nuclear enrichment inside Iran?
Iran has been exchanging fire with Israel for over 10 days now, but retaliating against the US brings a whole new level of risk, for the whole region.
Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King’s College London, called the US action a “high-risk operation that delivers unpredictable outcomes”, given the facility was deep underground.
According to Krieg, Iran will seek a “calibrated response — loud enough to resonate, but measured enough to contain”.
According to the BBC’s Frank Gardner, there are three different strategic courses of action now open to Iran.

Iran is confronted with three strategic courses of action: retaliate soon, retaliate later, or not at all

None of them are risk free, and uppermost in the minds of those taking the decisions will be the survival of the Iranian regime.
Retaliate hard and soon
Tehran is believed to retain about half of its original stock of around 3,000 missiles, having used up and lost the remainder in exchanges with Israel. It also has a target list of around 20 US bases to choose from in the broader Middle East.
One of the nearest and most obvious is the sprawling headquarters of the powerful US Navy’s Fifth Fleet at Mina Salman in Bahrain.
But Iran may be reluctant to strike at a neighbouring Gulf Arab state. More likely,
perhaps, would be to use its proxies in Iraq and Syria to attack any one of the relatively isolated US bases at At-Tanf, Ain Al-Asad or Erbil, Gardner wrote for BBC News.
Iran could also launch ‘swarm attacks’ on US Navy warships using drones and fast torpedo boats, something that the Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy has practiced exhaustively over the years.
There are also economic targets Iran could strike, but this would antagonise its Gulf Arab neighbours who have recently reached an uneasy modus vivendi with Tehran.
Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitics and security analyst, said its options included attacking US assets, closing the Strait of Hormuz — a vital conduit for the world oil trade — or even attacking energy facilities in the Gulf, which hosts several US military bases.
Retaliate later
This would mean waiting until the current tension has subsided and launching a surprise attack at a time of Iran’s choosing, when US bases were no longer on maximum alert.
Such an attack could also target US diplomatic, consular or trade missions, or extend to the assassination of individuals. The risk here for Iran, of course, is that it would likely invoke renewed US attacks just as ordinary Iranians are returning to normal life.
Hamidreza Ali, visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said Iran might even allow Trump a “symbolic win” and retaliate against Israeli targets instead.
“This keeps Washington out of the war while intensifying pressure on Tel Aviv. The risk of drawing the US further in would now rest on Trump’s next move,” he posted on X.
 






Don’t retaliate
In Gardner’s view, this would take enormous restraint on Iran’s part but it would spare it from further US attacks. It could even choose the diplomatic route and re-join negotiations with the US, although Iran’s foreign minister pointed out that Iran never left those negotiations, that it was, in his words, Israel and the US that blew them up.
But restarting the US-Iran negotiations in Muscat, Rome or wherever, would only be worth doing if Iran was prepared to accept the red line that both the US and Israel are insisting on. Namely that for Iran to keep its civil nuclear programme, it must send all uranium outside the country for enrichment.
Doing nothing after taking such a battering also makes the Iranian regime look weak, especially after all its warnings of dire repercussions if the US did attack. In the end it may decide that the risk of weakening its grip on its population outweighs the cost of any further US attacks.
“If Trump continues to strike Iran without new provocation, it looks more like going to war on Israel’s behalf. That’s politically costly, given domestic opposition to war with Iran. Trump may have scored a tactical win, but if Iran plays this smart, they hand him a political grenade,” Hamidreza Aliwrote.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari, also a former foreign minister, said that on the final day of last month’s deadly clashes, India deployed a dual-use cruise missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, forcing Pakistan to make a split-second decision on whether it was under nuclear attack.
“In that atmosphere you’ve got only a few seconds to decide looking at an image: is this missile going to be used within the nuclear connotation or not? And in those split seconds, decisions are made,” he told The Sunday Times during a visit to London.
“We’ve achieved a ceasefire, but we haven’t achieved peace. And that’s problematic because following this recent conflict, we have lowered the threshold for full-blown military conflict to the lowest it has ever been, to what I believe are dangerously low levels,” he added.
 






Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s warning came as the United States entered Israel’s war with Iran while managing another potential conflict in South Asia.
Last Wednesday, Mr Trump hosted Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for a closed-door lunch at the White House — the first time a US president has hosted a Pakistani military chief who was not also head of state.
“The reason I had him (COAS) here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India],” said Mr Trump. “And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago.”
Pakistan has said that although outright war between the two nuclear-armed rivals was narrowly averted by US intervention last month — after the deadliest fighting in decades — the conflict is far from resolved.
The PPP chairman arrived in London at the head of a nine-member parliamentary delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to “pitch for peace” and push for international talks to resolve the Kashmir dispute.
He said Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire because it was promised such a summit, which has yet to take place.
“At a time where the Pakistani army believes that we had a military upper hand in the conflict, we agreed to a ceasefire because we believed there was a commitment from the United States that we’d go on to have a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points,” he said.
“Now that isn’t happening. We don’t want the international community to get a false sense of ease as a result of the ceasefire. There’s still a very real threat,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also insisted Pakistan had no role in the Pahalgam attack, which was initially claimed — then retracted — by a little-known group, the Resistance Front, which India claims is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. “To this day, they [the Indian government] haven’t provided the Indian public, their allies, or us, or the media, with names of the individuals involved in this attack,” he said.
He admitted Pakistan has “a credibility problem” but argued things have changed. “This credibility and perception problem is rooted in deep biases, tainted by Islamophobia, and obfuscates our actual effort to combat terrorism,” he said.
He also accused the West of worsening Pakistan’s security situation by abandoning Afghanistan and “leaving a vacuum” there.
“The rest of the world may have moved on from Afghanistan and exited Kabul, but we’re fighting terrorism from there,” he said. “The single largest number of terrorist attacks anywhere in the world is in Pakistan.”

• Premier holds call with Iranian president; call US action ‘violation of international law’
• Iranian envoy hints at retaliatory strikes on American bases
ISLAMABAD: An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) will be held today (Monday) to discuss the regional situation after the US airstrike on three nuclear facilities in Iran.
The NSC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the top brass of both civil and military leadership, is the highest forum for security deliberations.
Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) told Dawn that the NSC meeting will be held on Monday evening. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir will also attend the meeting.
The field marshal, who recently returned from a trip to the US, will brief the committee on the details of his meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Pakistan condemns strikes
The US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after COAS Munir’s meeting with Trump, have been condemned by Pakistan.
In a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Prime Minister Shehbaz condemned the US attack and Israeli aggression.
“The prime minister conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the US attacks, which followed Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days,” said an official press release issued by the PMO.
 
 

The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Iran and expressed condolences on the loss of lives.
He expressed concerns that the US struck facilities that were under the protection of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
“These attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute,” he added.
While noting Iran’s right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for swift dialogues and called diplomacy “the only viable path forward”. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation, and said Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in this regard. According to the PMO, President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support of Iran.
He thanked the prime minister and people of Pakistan for standing in solidarity with Iran.
In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also condemned the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.
“We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the Foreign Office spokesman said on Sunday.
The attacks “violate all norms of international law,” the spokesperson said, adding Iran has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter.
“Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”
The FO urged all parties to “adhere to international law” and hold dialogues to resolve the crises.
‘Iran can hit US bases’
Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam has said his country could target US facilities and interests in the region.
While addressing a press conference here at the National Press Club on Sunday, Mr Moghadam said the US has a “presence in the region” and that Iran “will see that where we hit the US”.
Responding to a question about US bases in the region, the ambassador said it was shameful that the US has military facilities in Muslim states.
 
 

However, he added that Iran “does not want to bring any other Islamic state into this war”.
Asked about the damages during the US airstrike on Iran’s nuclear sites, he said Iran has the capability to make a nuclear arsenal but the country was using the technology for energy and medical purposes.
“Our nuclear technology is not a physical thing but it’s in the minds of our nuclear scientists, so therefore the US strikes have not made any significant harm to our nuclear programme,” he added.
He also appreciated Pakistan’s support for Iran during the conflict.
President worried
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East.
In a statement on Sunday, the president urged all parties involved in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and to choose the path of peace , dialogue and diplomacy to ensure enduring peace and stability in the region.
 
 

President Zardari also called upon the international community to play its part in de-escalating the crisis in the interest of regional stability as well as the well-being of its people.

Muharram is a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.
On Saturday, the Punjab government imposed Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.
Federal Power Minister Awais Leghari, in a letter addressed to the officials of Discos, said, “Since the holy month of Muharram is falling in the month of July and heat waves are expected.
“It is very much imperative that all necessary measures are taken to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to facilitate religious gatherings and avoid any inconvenience to the public. “
He instructed the Discos to take a series of measures to ensure uninterrupted supply.
This included conducting thorough inspections of all transmission and distribution networks, particularly in areas where majalis and processions are expected. The letter further instructed to ensure the repair of faulty equipment.
It also instructed regarding ensuring that emergency response teams on high alert throughout the month and in particular on Muharram 9 and 10 (Ashura).
Leghari also instructed to ensure the availability of standby generators and UPS systems at sensitive locations to provide backup power in case of any unforeseen grid issues.
“Ensure that a sufficient number of transformers and other materials are available in each subdivision, and inventory in this regard should be updated,” the letter read.
The letter further instructed Discos to ensure communication and coordination with local authorities and the public.
“The sanctity of Muharram demands our utmost commitment to serving the public with diligence and respect. Any negligence in this regard will be viewed seriously,” the letter concluded.
Separately, five companies of Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed in Rawalpindi to help the administration and police to maintain peace during Muharram.
Arrangements have been finalised for 4,374 majalis and 1,003 processions to be held in the Rawalpindi division.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said earlier in the week that ensuring a peaceful Muharram was a major challenge for his force due to the prevailing security situation in the region.</p><small>2025-06-23 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/230954315453e24.jpg?r=095434' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919223/govt-offices-torched-levies-post-attacked-in-mastung' target='_blank'><strong>Govt offices torched, Levies post attacked  in Mastung</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Unknown armed men torched several government offices, attacked a Levies post and blocked the Quetta-Karachi Highway in Khadkocha and Kirdgab areas of Mastung district.
Officials said that during the last 24 hours, armed men had attacked a Levies post and taken personnel hostage after a heavy exchange of fire in the Kirdgab area. They also took away official weapons from the post.
The attackers also set fire to the offices of Nadra, judicial magistrate and assistant commissioner.
Officials added that the armed men blocked the highway and conducted strict checking of passing vehicles.
“They checked the national identity cards of the people traveling in the vehicles in Khadkocha and Kirdgab areas,” an eyewitness said, adding that in Khadkocha they remained on the highway for around one-and-a-half hour and also burst the tyres of a truck.

The meeting was jointly organised by National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) Baloc­histan, the Social Welfare Department, Unicef and other partners. Advocate Abdul Hayee, NCRC member from Balochistan, along with representatives from Unicef, UNFPA and civil society attended the meeting. 
The bill, which seeks to set the minimum marriage age at 18 in line with national and international commitments, has remained stalled since 2013, despite cabinet approval. Participants of the meeting expressed frustration over the delay and urged provincial lawmakers to immediately table and pass the bill.
They acknowledged the PPP’s historic role in passing the Sindh’s Child Marriage Law in 2014 and praised President Asif Ali Zardari and Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for pushing child protection legislation at the federal level.
The participants urged Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti to fulfill his commitment made in 2018 to support the bill’s passage. They stressed that child marriage is not only a human rights violation but a serious public health concern, contributing to life-threatening conditions like obstetric fistula.
On the occasion, the civil society members vowed to intensify advocacy to ensure swift legislative action.

It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was toppled by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.
Syria’s interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. “He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest,” a ministry statement added.
A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.
Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad’s fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source told Reuters.
Syria’s state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.
A livestream from the site by Syria’s civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities.
“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.
“We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”
Islamic State had previously targeted religious minorities, including a major attack on Shia pilgrims in Sayeda Zainab in 2016 — one of the most notorious bombings during Assad’s rule.
The latest assault underscores the group’s continued ability to exploit security gaps despite the collapse of its territorial control and years of counterterrorism efforts.</p><small>2025-06-22 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/222157307bbe0ec.jpg?r=222234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl, others urge govt to review decision to nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani politicians on Sunday raised their concerns over the government’s decision to recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Iran.
The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s Pak-India conflict, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with US mediation.
In a statement, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.
However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined Pakistani citizens in voicing their reservations.
Veteran politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), demanded that the government rescind its decision.
“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree today, according to a JUI-F statement.
 






He said that Trump’s recent meeting and lunch with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “pleased Pakistani rulers so much” that they recommended nominating the US president for the Nobel prize.
The JUI-F chief noted that Trump won the presidential election with the slogan of peace but was “proven false in his claim”.
Fazl said that when Pakistan “destroyed India’s defence force”, President Trump intervened and said he had declared a ceasefire.
“[But] Trump has supported the Israeli attacks on Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iran. How can this be a sign of peace?” Fazl questioned. “With the blood of Afghans and Palestinians on America’s hands, how can he claim to be a proponent of peace?”
Trump campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.
The US has several times vetoed resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council, the latest earlier this month.
 
 

Fazl said his party was in favour of friendship with the US but not of its “slavery”.
“National sovereignty, the right of the people to govern themselves, and economic freedom should be maintained in relations with America,” the JUI-F chief asserted.
Fazl further said that in the last three months, a US delegation has visited him three times, after which he attended their diplomatic ceremony in Islamabad.
He also expressed his view that the attacks on Iran were an attempt to stop China’s economic growth in the Middle East. China is the largest importer of Iranian oil.
“Pakistan’s economic strength in the region has been affected the most. The economic balance is shifting towards Asia instead of Europe, which is a good omen for Asia,” he said.
‘Trump no longer a potential peacemaker’
Calls to reconsider the government’s decision also came from other politicians.
Former senator Mushahid Hussain wrote on X: “Since Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!”
He said Trump had been “trapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency”.
“Trump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!”
 






Trump “engaged in deception and betrayed his own promise not to start new wars”, Mushahid said in another post, strongly condemning the US attacks on Iran.
Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, had previously said that if the nomination “panders to Trump’s ego, so be it”.
PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan wrote “reconsider” in all caps on his X account, highlighting the “US attack on Iran and continuous US support of Israeli killings in Gaza”.
 






In a separate post, the opposition PTI condemned the “unprovoked” US strikes and voiced “total support” for Iran’s sovereignty.
Raoof Hasan, head of PTI’s political think-tank, said the government’s decision was now a “cause of unmitigated shame and embarrassment for those who were instrumental in making the choice”.
“That’s why it is said that legitimacy can neither be bought nor gifted,” said Hasan, as he took a jibe at the government. He also denounced the US’s “total disregard for international covenants” through the attacks on Iran.
 






Former senator Afrasiab Khattak said, “The sycophancy adopted by [the] Pakistani ruling elite in nominating President Trump for Nobel Peace Prize is not part of normative conduct in international diplomacy.”
“It was most embarrassing to announce the nomination hours before Trump ordered to bomb Iranian nuclear sites,” the veteran politician noted.
 






Jamaat-i-Islami chief Naeemur Rehman has said the decision “undermines our national dignity and grace”.
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, has termed the move “unfortunate” and said it did not reflect the public’s views.
 






Among other notable individuals was senior journalist Mariana Baabar, who wrote on X that “today Pakistan does not look too good either”, sharing the government’s post announcing its intention to nominate Trump for the Nobel.
 






Author and activist Fatima Bhutto asked: “Will Pakistan withdraw its nomination for him to receive the Nobel Peace Prize?”
 






Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.
He has openly expressed his frustration over missing out on the prestigious award, most recently mentioning it during a February Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Former US president Barack Obama won the prize soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.</p><small>2025-06-22 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2218545478f41c4.jpg?r=202015' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919099/sarfraz-bugti-condemns-murder-of-ex-balochistan-cms-son-in-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>Sarfraz Bugti condemns murder of ex-Balochistan CM’s son in Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday condemned the murder of Mir Attaur Rehman Mengal, the son of former Balochistan chief minister Naseer Mengal, in an armed clash when gunmen opened fire in district Khuzdar’s Wadh.
Atta Mengal was the brother of Mir Shafiqur Rehman Mengal, a prominent tribal leader and head of the Jhalawan Awami Panel, a political party.
Dawn.com has reached out to the police for a comment on the alleged murder.
Bugti condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed his heartfelt grief and sorrow over the killing of the younger Mengal.
“He prayed for the bereaved family and expressed his best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured grandson,” a statement from his office read.
Bugti assured that the provincial government will conduct a thorough investigation into the incident and vowed that the terrorists will be brought to justice.
“The people and government of Balochistan stand in solidarity against terrorism,” he added.
Atta Mengal was killed while his son Mir Matiur Rehman Mengal was injured, after an ambush by terrorists allegedly belonging to the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), said a statement by Jhalawan Awami Panel spokesperson Nadeemur Rehman Baloch.
The spokesperson said Naseer Mengal’s family had “made countless sacrifices for the survival of Pakistan”.
In March, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district, according to officials.
The JUI-F leaders, Wa­­dera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah, were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.

Altayli, who has more than 1.5 million YouTube subscribers, was detained on Saturday over comments in a video he posted on Friday in which he addressed a poll showing most Turks opposed Erdogan’s ruling for life.
Altayli referenced Ottoman rulers, saying Turks had “killed” or “drowned” some they no longer wanted in power.
Prosecutors in Istanbul later said the remarks “contained threats” against the president and launched an investigation.
NTV said that in his defence to the court, Altayli denied threatening Erdogan, quoting him as saying that his remarks were taken out of context and made to appear like threats, even though they were simply part of rhetorical historical discussions.
The development comes amid a series of detentions of opposition figures in recent months, including the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu —  Erdogan’s main political rival — in March.
The main opposition CHP and some Western countries have called the crackdown a politicised move to eliminate electoral challenges to Erdogan.

US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
The US operation, called Midnight Hammer, was described by Gen Caine as the “largest B-2 operational strike in US history”, which inflicted “extremely severe damage and destruction” to the targets, US outlet CBS News reported.
 
 

“This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,” Gen Caine said, adding that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flew east from their base in Missouri to participate in the mission in Iran.
“At midnight, Friday into Saturday, a large B-2 strike package, comprised of bombers, launched from the continental United States. As part of a plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy,” he stated.
“Throughout its 18-hour flight, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight refuellings. Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East in a complex, tightly timed manoeuvre requiring exact synchronisation across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace.” Caine explained, adding that this was done with minimal communication.

Speaking while displaying a map tracing the flight path and timelines of the US bombers, the chairman said: “At about 5pm Eastern Time (ET) [on] Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a US submarine in the Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan.
“As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the US deployed several deception tactics, including decoys, as fourth and fifth-generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats.”

Gen Caine outlined that US Strategic Command, Transportation Command, Cyber Command, Space Command and the Space Force and US European Command all provided support during the strikes.
“We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,” he said.
Outlining the bombing raid, Gen Caine said that at about 6:40pm ET (2:10am in Iran) the lead B-2 “dropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) weapons on the first of several aimpoints at Fordow”.
“As the president stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6:40pm and 7:05pm ET … with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Isfahan to ensure that we retained the element of surprise throughout the operation.
 


“Following weapons release, the Midnight Hammer strike package exited Iranian airspace and began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package on the way out,” he added. “Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears Iran’s surface-to-air missile systems did not see us.”
According to Gen Caine, the US employed 75 “precision-guided weapons” during Operation Midnight Hammer, including the MOPs, marking their first operational use by the US military.
“More than 125 US aircraft participated in this mission, including B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth-generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air refuelling tankers … and a full array of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational professionals,” Gen Caine said.
The chairman warned that the US is prepared for any retaliatory attack by Iran, stating that any such attack would be an “incredibly poor choice”.
“We will defend ourselves; the safety of our service members and civilians is the highest priority. Many assets are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed.”</p><small>2025-06-22 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/22195442cdf2942.jpg?r=195521' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919102/trailblazer-and-former-england-fast-bowler-david-lawrence-dies-at-61' target='_blank'><strong>‘Trailblazer’ and former England fast bowler David Lawrence dies at 61</strong></a><br><p>Former England fast bowler David “Syd” Lawrence has died at the age of 61 after a year-long battle with motor neurone disease (MND), his family said on Sunday.
Lawrence, the first British-born Black cricketer to represent England, was diagnosed last year with MND, a degenerative condition that causes muscle wastage and affects the brain and nerves.
“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Dave Lawrence MBE (King’s Birthday Honours) following his brave battle with Motor Neurone Disease,” Lawrence’s family said.
“Syd was an inspirational figure on and off the cricket field… A proud Gloucestershire man, Syd took on every challenge with everything he could and his final contest with MND was no different.
“His willingness to encourage and think of others right up to the end was typical of the man he was. As President of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, Syd took on the role with incredible pride and passion and loved every minute of it.”
Lawrence, who earned five test caps for England, made 280 appearances for Gloucestershire and took 625 wickets for the county.
His test debut came at Lord’s against Sri Lanka in 1988, with his career highlight being a five-wicket haul against the West Indies at the Oval in 1991.
In 2022, Lawrence became Gloucestershire County Cricket Club’s first Black president and he was named one of the inaugural Honorary Life Vice-Presidents of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) earlier this year.
ECB chairman Richard Thompson described Lawrence as “a true trailblazer of English cricket and a man of immense courage, character, and compassion”.
“His impact on the game extended far beyond the boundary ropes,” Thompson added in a statement. “As a fast bowler, he thrilled crowds with his pace and passion. As a leader and advocate, he broke barriers and inspired change, becoming a powerful voice for inclusion and representation in our sport.”</p><small>2025-06-22 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2213520985406c7.jpg?r=142516' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Iran’s key nuclear facilities ‘obliterated’ by US airstrikes</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.

US strikes Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites
Pentagon chief says US operation not aimed at regime change
Top US general details weapons used in “Operation Midnight Hammer”
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’, says US betrayed diplomacy
Pakistan condemns attacks, voices support for Tehran’s right to defend
Democrats criticise decision ‘without Congress approval’


The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top commanders, scientists and hundreds others. Both countries have traded wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.
In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.
 


The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.
“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.
“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.
 






Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told AFP.
Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.
Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.
Iranian media confirmed that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, were attacked.
The US strikes push the Middle East to the brink of a major new conflagration in a region already aflame for more than 20 months with devastating conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as a toppled ruler in Syria.
Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.
‘US operation not aimed at regime change’
US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth hailed the strikes an “incredible and overwhelming success”, adding that the operation was intended at a regime change in Iran.
“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it is worth noting that the operation did not target the Iranian troops or people,” Hegseth told a press conference at the Pentagon.
The secretary reiterated Trump’s claims that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, stating that by employing the president’s policy of “peace through strength”, Iran’s nuclear ambitions were “obliterated”.
 


Nevertheless, Hegseth said the strikes were not a preamble to plans for regime change in Iran, adding that private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate.
“This mission was not and has not been about regime change,” Hegseth stated. “The president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme.”
“The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back,” Hegseth added. “When this president speaks, the world should listen.”
 






Hegseth also read a statement from Trump, warning that any retaliation by Iran “will be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight”.
“Iran would be smart to heed these words,” the defence secretary warned, adding that US forces were postured to defend themselves, and take action if needed.
Hegseth said that the operation took months of preparation and required “a great deal of precision […] misdirection and highest of operational security”.
Describing the complex operation, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said the “main strike package comprised” of seven B-2 stealth bombers flying 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran with multiple aerial refuellings.
The US strikes included 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft, the top general added.
 






Trump had earlier told Fox News’ Sean Hannity show that five to six “bunker-buster” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.
Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites sustained “extremely severe damage and destruction”, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.
“Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran’s surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,” Caine added.
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’; Pakistan condemns attacks
Denouncing the US attacks as “lawless and criminal”, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country has a right to defend its sovereignty.
“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences,” he posted on X.
“Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.”
 






In a statement issued by its foreign ministry, Iran strongly condemned the “United States’ brutal military aggression against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities”.
It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.
“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.
 






Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.
It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.
It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s Resolution 2231 from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.
“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.
Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.
“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a statement by the Foreign Office said.
 






“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.
It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.
“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.
Trump warns Iran against ‘any retaliation’
Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “within two weeks” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.
But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.
Flanked by JD Vance, Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.
“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.
Trump, however, made no mention of regime change, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “easy target”.
The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, CBS News reported.
Trump said earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors”.
 


“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.
In another post, the US president called it a “historic moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world”. “Iran must now agree to end this war,” he wrote.
 


Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.
However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a report from CNN released on Tuesday said.
Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.
Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.
 






After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.
However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that “suicide drones” had been launched against “strategic targets” across Israel.
Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.
Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.
MAGA split adds to Democrats’ criticism
The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.
Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune voiced their support for Trump’s decision.
 
 

However, the issue has opened a split in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.
Trump’s first 2016 election victory in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”
Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: “This is not our fight.”
“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said.
 






Democrats also assailed him, with several accusing him of bypassing Congress to launch a new war.
Jim Himes, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, highlighted that Trump’s decision “without Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution”.
“We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East,” he said in a statement.
 






Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also noted there was no authorisation from Congress and termed it a “disastrous decision”.
“He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,” she asserted.
 






Leading US Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said Trump risked US “entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East”. He added that the US president had “failed to deliver” on his promise of bringing peace to the Middle East.

Rescue 1122 North Region Spokesperson Shafiqa Gul told Dawn.com that the boat capsized yesterday evening due to strong winds and rain in the tourist attraction of Shahi Bagh lake.
“The bodies of the two women were retrieved from the lake and transported to the Kalam hospital,” the spokesperson said earlier today.
Later, Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the bodies of two children were recovered from the lake. “Efforts to locate a third missing child are still underway,” he said.
The bodies of the two children — aged three and five — were taken to Matta and onwards to Sakhakot, Faizi added.
Five others had been rescued earlier and were in “stable condition”, according to Gul. “They have been taken to Mata hospital and are undergoing treatment.”
Gul had said the rescue operation to retrieve the bodies involved rescue divers and was being monitored by the local administration of the Bahrain tehsil.
Two girls drown in Hazara; 5 killed in Bannu firing
Meanwhile, two girls drowned and another went missing in the Indus River at tehsil Kindar Kotka in Hazara division’s Torghar division, rescue officials said.
Rescue 1122 Torghar teams, along with local volunteers, reached the scene on the instructions of District Emergency Officer Hayatullah.
The victims included 15-year-old Emaan and 20-year-old Amina. The body of Amina was found at Satana in the Haripur district, while a search operation was ongoing to locate the other missing girl.
In another incident, five people were killed and three others were injured when two groups opened fire in Hadri Mamand Khel of district Bannu, rescue officials said.
Muhammad Usama, Bannu Rescue 1122 spokesperson, said rescue teams took timely action and administered first aid to the injured after reaching the scene, and transported the bodies to the District Headquarters Hospital for legal formalities.

India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) claimed the two suspects were from the Pahalgam area, where gunmen killed 26 people two months ago.
“The two men had provided food, shelter and logistical support to the terrorists, who had… selectively killed the tourists on the basis of their religious identity,” a statement by NIA said.
The agency identified the two men as Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, claiming the duo “have disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack”.
New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing the attack without making public any evidence — an allegation that Islamabad denies.
The April 22 killings triggered a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by the nuclear-armed countries and led to intense exchanges of missile, drone and artillery fire. The four-day conflict left more than 70 people dead on both sides.</p><small>2025-06-22 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/221059494aea641.jpg?r=105957' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918823/protests-erupt-against-power-outages-in-kp-amid-heat-wave' target='_blank'><strong>Protests erupt against power outages in KP amid heat wave</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: As the heat wave persists, different localities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are experiencing prolonged power outages daily.
In Peshawar, the power consumers, including women on Saturday held protest meetings in different areas against the power outages and demanded smooth power supply to their areas.
The main Charsadda road remained blocked for some time, which also affected the traffic flow. The protesters said the situation was even worse in rural areas, where sixteen to twenty hours of power outages have become order of the day.
“It is very difficult to spend even an hour without electricity in such extreme heat,” one Mushtaq Khan of Bakhshipul said.
Criticising the Peshawar Electric Supply company (Pesco), he said whenever complaints were logged with the relevant authorities; they stated due to power theft, the area has been marked as a high-loss zone.
“But since we pay our bills regularly, why are we being deprived of electricity?” he questioned, urging Pesco to avoid power outages in their areas.
Likewise, residents of Pejagi, and other localities complained about prolonged power outages. A Pakistan People’s Party provincial office-bearer said that power outages had made their lives extremely miserable.
They said power outages on the pretext of high-loss feeders are injustice to those who are neither involved in electricity theft nor avoid paying their bills.
It may be mentioned that Pesco had disconnected the power supply to tube-wells in Shaheen Muslim Town, Gulbahar, and other city areas, resulting in a severe water shortage as well.
“If this issue isn’t resolved promptly, it may lead to confrontation between operators and the public, as the preparations are underway for protests on Phundoo Road. Despite paying bills, water supply closure is deemed an act of oppression,” they said.
Residents of Haji Camp, Sethi Town, and surrounding areas have been without electricity since morning. “We regularly pay monthly bills, even then Pesco resorts to prolonged power outages,” a consumer Hassan Ali commented.
Another consumer, Sahibzada said that those living in the main city areas were experiencing extreme heat and humidity, severely affecting the health, work and routine activity.
According to reports, the people in Mardan, Pabbi Nowshera and Charsadda are also facing severe problems due to heat wave. The prolonged power cuts, frequent tripping and low voltage have also caused shortage of water.
A Pesco spokesman, however, said that in some areas power suspension (power shutdown) from 6am to 12 noon was due to routine maintenance work while the heat wave was also multiplying the problems. He said the current demand of electricity was 4000 megawatt while supply was 2800 MW, a gap of 1200 MW.

Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said on Saturday that large-scale tree plantation and environmental projects were being launched under the Punjab Green Programme.
She said around 1.375 million trees were being planted on 3,790 acres of forest wasteland under the Agroforestry Initiative.
She said the scope of the Green Pakistan Programme had been expanded to plant 466.4 million more trees on 251,000 acres. Plantation of 5m trees in rows on 10,223 avenue miles along canals of Punjab had been initiated, she added.
She said the provision of world-class facilities for promotion of eco-tourism at the Lal Suhanra National Park and Salt Range were being ensured.
 






She said wireless network, digital cameras, GPS devices and CCTV cameras were being provided for eco-tourism.
She said, “Construction of an eco-friendly LEED certified multi-storey building has been started to establish a protected nature area and modern facilities are being provided for the staff.”
She said the shielding summits programme for disaster prevention in the mountains of Murree and Kahuta, recruitment of 600 fire watchers, provision of fire vehicles and watchtowers were being ensured. She said that a modern GIS-based protection system had been introduced. She said immediate detection of fire and encroachment was possible with drone, satellite and LIDAR technology.
The CM said that digital tree enumeration in the form of rows and GIS-based survey had been started in Punjab.
She said. “Modern machinery has been purchased for forestry work, the process of plantation and forestry operations has been accelerated. Establishment of 104 Forest Command & Control Centers for 24-hour monitoring across the province is significantly increasing the capacity for forest protection.”
Meanwhile, the CM announced that poor widows living in villages would get buffaloes and cows.
“Some 11,000 rural women will be given buffaloes and cows with a budget of Rs2bn in 12 districts of southern Punjab. As many as 4,870 cattle will be given in the first phase of the programme,” she said. She said the Livestock Assets Programme aimed to increase milk production and provide employment to rural women at home.

According to the UN body, a strong pre-monsoon surge is expected in late June, with above-normal rainfall forecast along the Indo-Pakistan border.
The weather system is likely to continue into early July, followed by near-normal rainfall throughout the rest of the month.
Meanwhile, anomalous rainfall is predicted in the desert regions of both nations from July to September, according to a report released by the FAO on Friday.
The monsoon season is exp­e­cted to be strong and prolonged with precipitation falling to near-normal levels in October.
November will be dry before the wet weather returns in December.
The report said early and abundant summer rains are likely to create favourable conditions for small-scale breeding of locusts in eastern Pakistan and Rajasthan, India.
However, the breeding activity is expected to disappear when monsoon rains retreat in November.
PMD forecast
The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast normal to above normal rainfall from July to September 2025.
According to the PMD, the Indian Ocean Dipole is in a neutral phase but is expected to transition to negative during the season.
Meanwhile, the El Niño Southern Oscillation is projected to remain in a neutral phase throughout the season.
Given these conditions, the department forecast normal to slightly above normal rainfall across the central to southern parts of the country.
The most rainfall is expected in the northeastern parts of Punjab and Ka­­shmir. In contr­ast, the northern regions, inc­luding northern Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, are likely to experience normal to slightly below-normal rainfall during the forecast period.
There is also a likelihood of near-normal rainfall in southern Punjab, Sindh and southeastern Balochistan.
Northern Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and nor­thern and southwestern Baloch­istan may receive above-normal rainfall during the monsoon season.
