According to an initial report issued by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122,  four bodies have been recovered so far, with search and rescue operations underway in several areas.
Three bodies have been recovered from Ingaro Dheri, and one body was recovered from Ghalegy.
Ten people have been confirmed to have drowned at the Bypass Relax Hotel, according to the report.
“More than 22 people were trapped in the water in Imam Dhirai, who were rescued safely by the team of Rescue Station 33,” the report stated.
KP Rescue 1122 Director General Shah Fahad earlier confirmed that the bodies of three people had been recovered.
“The rescue operation is being conducted at five different locations and 80 personnel of Rescue 1122 are participating in the search operation,” Fahad was quoted as having said in a press release.
Earlier, Swat Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Niaz Khan told Dawn.com that there are reports of several people drowning in the river Swat as massive flooding could be seen.
“Two bodies so far have been recovered, and the operation continues for others, but high-level flood is hampering the operation,” Khan had said.

At the time, American newspapers were warning that Israel was on the verge of bombing Iran, the IAEA was working hand in glove with the Americans to increase pressure on the Persians, and the country was being suffocated by sanctions that were only looking to get worse.
The Iranians, according to political analyst Trita Parsi, made a strategic calculation at the time — that the war would come and it would devastate them, but it would also destroy the Americans.
In this book, Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy, Parsi notes that Iranian officials thought the Iraq war had already turned the US into a ‘limping giant’, that another war in the region would end its superpower status, and that it would no longer be able to dominate the Middle East. Sure, they ventured, Iran would be ruined by the war, but they placed their hope on the longevity of Persia as a civilisation. Iran would endure, they thought. It would bounce back after a few decades and take its place in the sun after defeating the United States.
The Americans were bewildered when they first found out that this was a grim but genuine conclusion the Iranians had reached. In the face of subjugation, they would choose annihilation. The Obama administration became more acquainted with the way Iranians thought while negotiating the nuclear framework deal. A senior White House official noted: “The Iranians simply won’t capitulate [even if faced with war],”, adding “[be]cause they’re Iranians.”
The ceasefire
On June 22, seven American stealth bombers dropped twelve 30,000 pound bombs on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility and two on Natanz, while the research facility in Isfahan was targeted with twelve Tomahawk missiles.  In response, Iran targeted Al-Udeid air base in Qatar with 19 missiles, in what it says was like for like. Though really it was as unlike as you could get; advance notice was given of the strikes and they were easily intercepted. Shortly after, there was a ceasefire.
While the ‘Twelve Day’ war seems to have come to an end, Iran has come out of this round (for there will be future rounds) looking somewhat strong even at its weakest. As is often the case, the weaker country has the most to gain from a ceasefire. Iran, having lost Syria, unable to rely on a hollowed out Hezbollah, and suffering early blows from an audacious Mossad infiltration, is the weakest it’s been in decades. Still, it has shown that despite it being more isolated than ever, despite its immensely vulnerability from the air, and despite its lack of advanced weaponry, it can still fight.
Meanwhile, Israel comes out of this weakened. It has not been able to win a war against Hamas, a resistance group with enhanced fireworks as weapons, and it has not been able to win against Iran, which proved that the Iron Dome is more an Iron Sieve which can be countered by strategically saturating Israel’s air defence with missiles. Already running low on missile interceptors and fearing a lengthy war of attrition would be unpopular among its populace, Israel agreed to a ceasefire despite its military supremacy. Netanyahu has proven that while he may huff and he may puff, but he cannot blow your house down. The Israelis no longer look inviolable.
The right to enrich
At the heart of this war is the selective denial of the Iranians’ sovereign right to enrich. This is a right they are entitled to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty which allows states to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Iran’s enrichment rights were also endorsed in 2012 by 120 states (including Pakistan) in the Non-Aligned Movement, undermining the argument that the state’s quest is a rogue one.
Iran’s negotiations with Trump failed because while he initially said he was willing to discuss measures imposed on Iran’s right to weaponise — get nuclear weapons — but not its nuclear capability — which would include enrichment for peaceful purposes, he later fell back on the Bush-era and Israel-endorsed red line that Iran does not have the right to enrich at all, let alone weaponise.
 






The Obama administration had allowed the Iranians this right but imposed limits on its ability to weaponise in exchange for sanctions relief. It had also ensured that Iran’s nuclear programme would be subject to IAEA oversight and safeguards. While Iran has many stocks of 60 per cent uranium, it does not have stocks of uranium which is 90 per cent enriched — the amount required for nuclear warheads.
Nuclear ‘haves’ vs ‘have nots’
The Non-Proliferation Treaty has been criticised for creating nuclear apartheid; dividing the haves and the have nots. Those who already have nuclear weapons are to pursue good faith negotiations towards nuclear disarmament — with the provision drafted in fuzzy legalese which has never been acted upon — while no other state is allowed to acquire the bomb. The Iranians are party to the NPT, having signed it on the first day possible [they are now contemplating withdrawing from it], and seek the right to enrich, whereas Israel is not and possesses nuclear weapons.
This same pattern has also been observed with Saudi Arabia which also wants to enrich uranium. Journalist and New York Times bestselling author, Bob Woodward, in his latest book, War, quotes from a meeting between American Senator Lindsey Graham and Saudi crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman. During the meeting, which he says took place in Saudi Arabia and broached the topic of Muhammad Bin Salman’s desire to enrich, Graham reportedly said: “that’s going to be hard to do because people are afraid you’ll create a bomb”. The Saudi leader reportedly replied: “I don’t need uranium to make a bomb … I’ll just buy one from Pakistan.”
For Iran, the right to enrich is a sovereign issue they refuse to give up. In 2009, 96 per cent of Iranians believed that sanctions were worth the price of retaining the country’s enrichment right. In How Sanctions Work: Iran and the Impact of Economic Warfare, a university professor interviewed by the authors said that “If the nuclear sanctions get removed … then the West will sanction us for our ballistic missiles. Then it’ll be human rights sanctions. Then it’ll be another reason for sanctions. Just look at any country that has challenged Western power — whether political or economic — what do you see? They get sanctioned in order to break their will and make them succumb to Western power.”
While this is undoubtedly true, the right to enrich has come at a steep price. Sanctions dealt a serious blow to Iran’s economy, affecting its growth and resulting in sharply declining living standards. Its banks have been cut off from SWIFT, the global network that allows financial transactions and even during the Coronavirus pandemic, Iran could buy medicines and pharmaceutical goods but could not pay for them because of sanctions. Meanwhile, its nuclear scientists have been assassinated in droves, often by remote controlled bombs, and cyber attacks have been conducted on energy and electricity grids.
The IAEA’s hypocrisy
At the same time, Iran has had to deal with a heavily politicised IAEA. The Agency’s bent against Iran can be traced back to at least 2009 when a Japanese diplomat, Yukiya Amano, was appointed its head in 2009, who WikiLeaks later revealed had said in a meeting with the US ambassador that “he was solidly in the US court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons program”. In 2011, a new IAEA report was published, which was to further increase pressure on Iran, including to cut it off from other developing countries that had resisted American efforts to leave Iran out in the cold. It seems Amano was largely passing on much of the information provided by Israel without engaging in fact checking.
The report, for the first time, suggested Iran may have an ongoing nuclear weapons programme, going against earlier IAEA assessments, US intelligence reports, and to the censure of former IAEA officials themselves, including former director general, Hans Blix, who said it was irresponsible to base conclusions on information that had not been verified. Other officials decried that the report was reminiscent of intelligence provided to the IAEA to help Bush’s case for war against Iraq. This faulty intel (provided by the Italians) had stated that the Iraqis had bought uranium from Niger only for then IAEA head Mohammad ElBaradei to check them and demonstrate to the Security Council that the documents had been forged.
The Iranians are again alleging that the incumbent IAEA head, Rafael Grossi, is in cahoots with the West, having published a report stating that Iran had violated its safeguarding agreement with the Agency, and that it could not ignore that this raised ‘proliferation concerns’, only to later say, after Iran had been bombed, that there was no proof Iran wanted a nuclear weapon. What is clear, however, is that the American and Israeli attacks on nuclear sites were unlawful.
Unlawful attacks
The United States, in joining Israel’s attacks against Iran, has also violated the prohibition on the use of force in the UN Charter. Neither state has any evidence that Iran has decided to build a nuclear weapon. Indeed, US intelligence agencies continue to believe that Iran has yet to decide whether to build the bomb. Furthermore, there is also no indication that were the weapon to be built, Iran intends to use it against Israel.
Additionally, the laws of war also protect nuclear power plants during armed conflicts, obliging states to refrain from attacking them for such an attack could release dangerous forces. As Iran likely removed the nuclear material from the nuclear sites hit, this has not resulted in radioactive contamination. However, the IAEA had warned that any direct hit on Bushehr, Iran’s nuclear power plant, could result in a major radiation crisis. Al Jazeera reported that “on June 19, the Israeli military said that it had attacked Bushehr, but later said that the announcement was a mistake”.
Many commentators have pointed out that, as with Iraq after its Osirak nuclear reactor was hit by Israel in 1981, the strikes on nuclear sites will merely further Iran’s resolve to obtain the bomb. Iraq was prompted and emboldened by the strike to pursue a serious weapons programme, before it was dismantled in the First Gulf War. It is likely Iran will do the same.
A place in the haves
Former President Obama said in his inaugural address in 2009, “To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society’s ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. … We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.”
Now that Iran is through this round of conflict, regime unchanged, it will likely return to the negotiating table to haggle over its enrichment. While the West believes regime change will bring about a change in Tehran’s nuclear policy, it is wrong. Even if they had brought the Shah’s son into power to do their bidding, he would have eventually cut those ties to smile at the West and build the bomb. Instead, they have the Ayatollahs who scowl at the West and build the bomb.
Both know that the clenched fist is all the West understands; they must enrich away.

In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
 


An 11-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today.
Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as inadmissible and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.
Justice Ayesha had formally complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.
In her judgement, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.
The SIC, which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had requested the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had heard the original case.
However, the CB dismissed those pleas, with Justice Aminuddin observing that review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench after the 26th Amendment.
The hearing
Justice Panhwar noted that Hamid Khan, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had yesterday raised an objection to the bench.
“Hamid Khan raised an objection to the inclusion of judges in the bench who came to the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment in the bench,” Justice Panhwar said, noting that he is one of the judges included in the objection.
“Public trust in the judiciary is essential,” Panhwar stated.
“It is essential that no party has any objection to the bench,” he said. “It is because of these objections that I cannot sit on this bench.”
The judge told Khan that although he was hurt by his remarks — having worked together since 2010 — this was not a personal matter.
Khan said he appreciated Panhwar’s decision.
However, Justice Aminuddin Khan told him that this was not a matter to be appreciated. “This is a result of your conduct,” he said.
“We gave you respect, that’s why we are listening to you, otherwise we were not under any obligation to hear you,” Justice Khan said. “We gave you this opportunity, don’t misuse it.”
Following Justice Panhwar’s recusal, the SIC’s counsel also objected to a 10-memebr bench taking up the hearing.
To this, Justice Mandokhail questioned under which law the counsel was making this argument.
Justice Mandokhail added that the 10-member bench will continue hearing cases.
“Giving respect is what gets you respect,” he told Khan. “Whatever respect you have today is because of the Supreme Court.”
“Today we are here, tomorrow we will not be here, you will not be here,” Justice Mandokhail said.
The SIC counsel told Justice Mandokhail not to use the case if he was angry.
Justice Aminuddin interjected here, asking the SIC counsel what objection he had.
“My objection is that a twelve-member bench cannot hear the review of the decision of a thirteen-member bench,” Khan said.
Justice Aminuddin rejected this objection and asked him to proceed with his arguments.
Here, the debate between Khan and the judges became heated.
“The SIC lawyer had given his arguments, you had no right to speak,” Justice Mandokhail said. “We gave you respect.”
The SIC counsel responded saying: “you are not authorised to tell me not to speak.”
Justice Mandokhail told Khan that the SIC had appointed Faisal Siddiqui as its lawyer, not him. “You have 10 minutes to make your argument, otherwise sit down.”
Khan said: “You are angry, do not hear the case just now.”
The conversation continued in a confrontational manner, with Justice Mandokhail telling him to sit down if he does not want to present his arguments.
“I know how to do my job, you be careful with your words,” Justice Mandokhail said. “I have skipped my mother’s funeral to be here and you are joking.”
He noted that the bench would not hear anything irrelevant and had already heard enough.
“We consider you a good lawyer, but what you are doing right now is not the work of a good lawyer,” Justice Mandokhail said.
Khan told him he had no right to say such a thing, to which Mandokhail again reminded him he had 10 minutes to present his arguments.
“It’s not as if we don’t know how to be strict.”
The SIC counsel asserted that the Judicial Commission forms a bench, to which Justice Mandokhail asked him under which law he has made this assertion.
“According to Article 191A of the 26th Amendment,” Khan said.
“You are against the 26th Amendment, how are you now referencing it?” Justice Mandokhail quipped.
“This is why I had said to make a decision on the 26th Amendment first,” Khan said.
Khan asked if the SC made the amendment. Justice Mandokhail asked if he, as a senator, had voted against the amendment, which the SIC counsel affirmed.
“You all boycotted it,” Justice Mandokhail said.
“As long as it is like this, either you accept it, or say you don’t and leave the practice of law.”
Justice Aminuddin said the bench would take a break from the hearing till 2pm, with Justice Mandokhail adding that the bench was aiming to pronounce a verdict today.

In January, the World Bank pledged to provide $20bn to Pakistan under a 10-year country partnership framework (CPF) to support inclusive and sustainable development within the country.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had welcomed a $40 billion “investment” by the World Bank, stating that the inflow will open “a new chapter” in various sectors of the economy.
In a meeting with WB Operations Managing Director Anna Bjerde and South Asia Regional Vice President Martin Raiser, the federal minister welcomed the strengthened collaboration between Pakistan and the Bank over the past year, the statement read.
This enhanced engagement has culminated in the development of the new country partnership framework (CPF) 2026-2035, a transformative ten-year strategy backed by $40bn commitment from the World Bank, it added.
The minister appreciated World Bank’s support, particularly during critical challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic and devastating 2022 floods.
“As our largest development partner, the World Bank has played an indispensable role in Pakistan’s socio-economic progress and improving the lives of our citizens,” Cheema stated.
With the CPF now successfully launched, the minister emphasised the government is focused on finalising a comprehensive implementation framework in collaboration with the WB.
He welcomed Pakistan’s transition to the WB’s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region under Vice President Ousmane Dione, noting this move will “create valuable opportunities for knowledge exchange and regional synergy”.
In a separate meeting with WB Executive Director Abdelhak Bedjaoui, the minister acknowledged his effective representation of Pakistan’s economic interests.
Cheema suggested regular visits by the executive directors to constituent countries to better understand development needs and opportunities for the WB’s engagement. They discussed the Bank’s recent approvals, including the $700mn Reko Diq mining project and $400mn risk participation facility.
The minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with the WB country team to achieve the CPF’s development objectives and transformational impacts.
The WB leadership assured full support for the effective implementation of the CPF, underscoring the institution’s continued commitment to Pakistan’s sustainable economic development.</p><small>2025-06-27 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/27125643398908e.jpg?r=125710' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553/psx-rises-by-nearly-1600-points-a-day-after-federal-budget-is-passed' target='_blank'><strong>PSX rises by nearly 1,600 points a day after federal budget is passed</strong></a><br><p>Bulls regained control of the trading floor as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed nearly 1,600 points at the close of the first session on Friday, a day after the passage of the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year.
The KSE-100 index climbed 1581.77 points, or 1.3 per cent, to stand at 123,628.23 at the close of the first session, from the last close of 122,046.46 points.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “[The] passage of [the] federal budget with the absence of aggressive incremental revenue measures and slight relief for salaried and business is also well received by the investors.”
The National Assembly on Thursday passed the federal budget for the FY25-26, with an outlay of Rs17.57 trillion, despite opposition calls for the budgetary proposals to be made public and for the passage to be delayed until public input had been sought.
“The ceasefire between Iran and Israel has redirected investor focus toward improving macroeconomic fundamentals. Lower inflation and a record current account surplus are strengthening the case for a potential decline in interest rates to single digits,” Ashraf added.
He continued that stocks linked to the power sector and oil and gas exploration, along with those in their supply chains, are gaining momentum amid expectations of circular debt clearance before the fiscal year-end.
“We anticipate the market rally to sustain, supported by continued monetary easing, as inflation is projected to fall even below the FY25 estimate of 4.5pc in FY26,” he concluded.
Yesterday, the PSX had reversed its upward trajectory after two days of gains, as investors opted for profit-taking at elevated levels, dragging the benchmark index into the red.
Earlier in the week on Tuesday, shares climbed by 6,079.16 points in the wake of US President Donald Trump announcing a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day war.
The benchmark index experienced two days of gains, before reversing trends on Thursday.</p><small>2025-06-27 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/271244126ae99ba.png?r=124458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920561/india-accused-of-illegal-deportations-targeting-muslims' target='_blank'><strong>India accused of illegal deportations targeting Muslims</strong></a><br><p>India has deported without trial to Bangladesh hundreds of people, officials from both sides said, drawing condemnation from activists and lawyers who call the recent expulsions illegal and based on ethnic profiling.
New Delhi says the people deported are undocumented migrants.
The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long taken a hardline stance on immigration — particularly those from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh — with top officials referring to them as “termites” and “infiltrators”.
It has also sparked fear among India’s estimated 200 million Muslims, especially among speakers of Bengali, a widely spoken language in both eastern India and Bangladesh.
“Muslims, particularly from the eastern part of the country, are terrified,” said veteran Indian rights activist Harsh Mander. “You have thrown millions into this existential fear.”
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Dhaka’s government, a former friend of India.
But India also ramped up operations against migrants after a wider security crackdown in the wake of an attack in the west — the April 22 killing of 26 people, mainly Hindu tourists, in Indian-held Kashmir.
New Delhi blamed that attack on Pakistan, claims Islamabad rejected, with arguments culminating in a four-day conflict that left more than 70 dead.
Indian authorities launched an unprecedented countrywide security drive that has seen many thousands detained – and many of them eventually pushed across the border to Bangladesh at gunpoint.
‘Do not dare’
Rahima Begum, from India’s eastern Assam state, said police detained her for several days in late May before taking her to the Bangladesh frontier.
She said she and her family had spent their life in India.
 
 

“I have lived all my life here — my parents, my grandparents, they are all from here,” she said. “I don’t know why they would do this to me.”
Indian police took Begum, along with five other people, all Muslims, and forced them into swampland in the dark.
“They showed us a village in the distance and told us to crawl there,” she told AFP.
“They said: ‘Do not dare to stand and walk, or we will shoot you.’”
Bangladeshi locals who found the group then handed them to border police who “thrashed” them and ordered they return to India, Begum said.
“As we approached the border, there was firing from the other side,” said the 50-year-old. “We thought: ‘This is the end. We are all going to die.’”
She survived, and, a week after she was first picked up, she was dropped back home in Assam with a warning to keep quiet.
‘Ideological hate campaign’
Rights activists and lawyers criticised India’s drive as “lawless”.
“You cannot deport people unless there is a country to accept them,” said New Delhi-based civil rights lawyer Sanjay Hegde.
Indian law does not allow for people to be deported without due process, he added.
Bangladesh has said India has pushed more than 1,600 people across its border since May.
Indian media suggests the number could be as high as 2,500.
The Bangladesh Border Guards said it has sent back 100 of those pushed across — because they were Indian citizens.
India has been accused of forcibly deporting Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with navy ships dropping them off the coast of the war-torn nation.
Many of those targeted in the campaign are low-wage labourers in states governed by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, according to rights activists.
Indian authorities did not respond to questions about the number of people detained and deported.
But Assam state’s chief minister has said that more than 300 people have been deported to Bangladesh.
Separately, Gujarat’s police chief said more than 6,500 people have been rounded up in the western state, home to both Modi and interior minister Amit Shah.
Many of those were reported to be Bengali-speaking Indians and later released.
 
 

“People of Muslim identity who happen to be Bengali speaking are being targeted as part of an ideological hate campaign,” said Mander, the activist.
Nazimuddin Mondal, a 35-year-old mason, said he was picked up by police in the financial hub of Mumbai, flown on a military aircraft to the border state of Tripura and pushed into Bangladesh.
He managed to cross back, and is now back in India’s West Bengal state, where he said he was born.
“The Indian security forces beat us with batons when we insisted we were Indians,” said Mondal, adding he is now scared to even go out to seek work.
“I showed them my government-issued ID, but they just would not listen.”</p><small>2025-06-27 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/271206403dd02f7.jpg?r=120820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920554/field-marshal-asim-munir-lauds-role-of-civil-bureaucracy-calls-it-indispensable' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir lauds role of civil bureaucracy, calls it ‘indispensable’’</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed the “indispensable” role of the civil bureaucracy within governance to probationary civil officers — as part of an initiative aimed at strengthening understanding between Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, according to the military’s media wing.
In the wake of recent Indian aggression, Field Marshal Asim Munir has repeatedly appreciated the strategic foresight of the country’s political leadership, and vice versa. On June 18, Field Marshal Asim Munir met with US President Donald Trump in a high-level meeting — marking the first time a US president has hosted top Pakistani military leadership. Today’s engagement is part of a broader initiative to strengthen “institutional synergy and mutual understanding” between Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, according to a statement by Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).
Field Marshal Asim Munir, while speaking to probationary officers of the 52nd common training program (CTP) of the Civil Services Academy (CSA), stressed the imperativeness of “inter-institutional cohesion, mutual respect, and unified national purpose” in advancing Pakistan’s strategic and developmental objectives.
 
 

Emphasising the need for a capable, transparent and service-driven civil bureaucracy, he urged officers to “embody the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and patriotic commitment in the fulfilment of their responsibilities to the nation.”
Addressing the civil officers, Field Marshal talked about “national security imperatives, prevailing internal and external challenges, and the pivotal role of the Pakistan Armed Forces in preserving regional peace and national stability.”
The statement added: “The probationary officers of the Civil Services Academy remained attached with the formations of Pakistan Army at peace time locations and operational areas of Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
“These officers gained rich experience of the three services during various interactions and visits.”
“The CTP participants expressed deep appreciation for the opportunity to engage with the senior military leadership and gain first-hand insight into the Pakistan Army Leadership’s strategic vision, operational readiness, and its multifaceted contributions to national resilience and development,” the ISPR stated.
The session ended with a question-and-answer session aimed at “constructive dialogue, shared responsibility, and collective dedication to Pakistan’s enduring progress”.</p><small>2025-06-27 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2709032511a1ee9.jpg?r=091240' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920495/rubio-pm-shehbaz-stress-importance-of-promoting-durable-israel-iran-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Rubio, PM Shehbaz stress importance of promoting durable Israel-Iran peace</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Thursday with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif about recent developments in the Middle East, underlining a shared commitment to regional stability and non-proliferation amid renewed efforts to engage Iran.
“Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke today with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif regarding events in the Middle East. Secretary Rubio emphasised that Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
“The two leaders acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and to maintain regional stability,” she added.
 






The call highlights Washington’s growing engagement with Islamabad at a time when the Trump administration is reportedly exploring a new diplomatic initiative with Tehran, possibly “as early as next week”.
Rubio’s statement that “Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon” will be interpreted in various ways in both Pakistan and the United States. Some may see it as an indication of alignment between the two countries, while others may view it as an affirmation of Pakistan’s position as a potential stabilising partner in a region fraught with uncertainty.
The latest contact builds on a series of high-level engagements, including a phone call last Friday in which PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction over what he described as a “cordial and productive discussion” between US President Donald Trump and Pakistan’s military chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir.
That meeting, held earlier this month at the White House, was notable for both its optics and timing. Munir became the first serving Pakistani army chief to be formally received by a sitting US president — a gesture widely interpreted as an acknowledgment of the military’s central role in Pakistan’s foreign and security policy.
The Pakistani military’s media wing later reported that the White House luncheon focused on joint counterterrorism efforts and the potential for expanded bilateral trade.
Trump, in remarks at a Nato summit in The Hague following the meeting, credited General Munir with helping to avert a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, referring to him — though not by name — as a quiet but decisive actor during last month’s standoff.

“The most important of these conflicts,” Trump said, “was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan. And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East… This is — they have nuclear weapons.”

Trump described how he intervened through a series of calls that linked trade to peace.

“If you are going to be fighting each other… we are not going to do any trade,” he recalled telling both sides. “They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal.’… And we stopped the nuclear war.”

Although Trump avoided naming General Munir directly, he has in the past referred to the Pakistani general as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality”.
These remarks, which closely mirror Pakistan’s version of events, stand in contrast to India’s official stance. New Delhi maintains it acted independently during the May crisis and rejects any suggestion of third-party mediation. Trump’s candid remarks suggest otherwise, indicating a more active White House role than previously acknowledged.
In his broader comments following last week’s White House meeting, Trump also noted: “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.”
Though brief, this comment hints at Washington’s evolving perception of Pakistan — not merely as a South Asian actor but as a player with insight into regional dynamics. It also reinforces the relevance of Rubio’s phone call with Sharif, suggesting that the US is keen to draw on Islamabad’s experience as it revisits the idea of talks with Tehran.
Rubio’s statement on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon re-emphasises US strategic priorities. Pakistan’s apparent position — implicit in the call’s emphasis on peace and stability — may help strengthen its image in Washington as a constructive and responsible actor in a volatile neighborhood.
Observers say the back-to-back engagements — and Pakistan’s active role in both South Asian and Middle Eastern dialogues — signal a diplomatic moment of consequence, one in which Islamabad has the opportunity to shape outcomes far beyond its immediate borders.</p><small>2025-06-27 06:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/27110150353f7b3.png?r=110315' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920547/india-seeks-permanent-solution-to-border-dispute-with-china' target='_blank'><strong>India seeks ‘permanent solution’ to border dispute with China</strong></a><br><p>Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart that the two countries should seek a “permanent solution” to their decades-old border dispute, India’s defence ministry said on Friday.
Singh met China’s Dong Jun on the sidelines of the meeting of the defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Qingdao on Thursday and stressed on solving issues between the two countries through a structured roadmap, the ministry said in a statement.
 
 

The world’s two most populous nations — both nuclear powers — share a 3,800-km, largely undemarcated and disputed border in the Himalayas and have gone to war over it.
Although the frontier has been mostly peaceful in recent decades, a deadly clash between their troops in 2020 resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.
The clash led to a four-year military standoff with both armies deploying tens of thousands of troops in the mountains until they reached a pact in October to step back, leading to a thaw in ties.
During his meeting with Dong, Singh also called for bridging the trust deficit created after the 2020 standoff, New Delhi said.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and Iran.

• SIC wasn’t a parliamentary party when PTI members joined it, remarks Justice Hilali
ISLAMABAD: Parliament would be more representative and reflective of people’s will if reserved seats were allocated to the PTI, Salman Akram Raja argued before the Supreme Court on Thursday.
The senior counsel, representing the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), made these arguments before the Constitutional Bench, which resumed the hearing of review petitions filed against the July 2024 reserved seats verdict.
Mr Raja argued the eight judges — who had ruled in favour of awarding reserved seats to PTI — and two judges — who declared the PTI a parliamentary party — realised a “political reality” that’d make the parliament more representative.
The intent of the Constitution, Mr Raja argued, was to make the legislature more democratic and not “just fill the reserved seats by doling out women or non-Muslim candidates to political parties”.
“I will humbly and forcibly say that both judgments — by eight judges and two judges — have moved towards a direction for democratic justice,” the counsel emphasised.
He claimed the parliament would become unrepresentative if some parties were given more reserved seats than the party that actually won the elections.
The counsel argued that the parties that challenged the eight-judge majority verdict have “not presented” a single ground to suggest why the judgement was wrong.
He said the petitioners “were not seeking justice, but rather injustice”, and therefore the Supreme Court should ensure justice.
The counsel described the majority judgment as a “well-considered verdict”, the crux of which suggested that under Article 187 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court exercises both plenary and inherent jurisdiction.
 
 

“Thus, nothing stops this court from doing complete justice if it considers that the conduct of the Feb 8 elections was not something that fulfils the requirement of law,” argued Mr Raja.
The counsel emphasised that the bench was sitting to ensure the democratic rights of people are granted and not to punish a political party for their mistakes.
Political vs parliamentary party
During the hearing, Justice Musarrat Hilali asked the counsel about the legal provisions for a political party that lost its common election symbol over failure to conduct timely intra-party elections, despite being given the opportunity to hold such polls.
The counsel retorted that the political party will still remain a “party” and after elections, it will have the right to publish a list of candidates for reserved seats and issue tickets to its candidates.
“The only difference will be that it will not be given a common election symbol.”
Justice Hilali again highlighted the difference between a political party and a parliamentary party, stating the elected members should have joined a parliamentary party.
But the independents — who won with the backing of PTI — joined SIC when it was not a parliamentary party.
“Therefore, their joining or not joining the SIC will be of no benefit,” Justice Hilali emphasised.
The counsel reminded the judge that the Supreme Court had already held that the joining or non-joining of SIC would have no impact, since these independent members belonged to PTI and were therefore entitled to reserved seats.
According to Mr Raja, the July 12, 2024 judgment had declared these lawmakers as PTI-backed candidates.
“It is the duty of the court to take judicial note of all the surrounding facts,” the counsel said, adding this was done by the eight-judge majority judgment.
Later, Mr Raja concluded by stating he “will rest his case for the people of this country”.
‘Persecution’
Arguing next, senior counsel Hamid Khan, also representing SIC, reminded the bench that he had already applied for a general adjournment till Aug 5 since he was on vacation.
But Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was heading the 11-judge bench, declined the request, stating no adjournment had been granted in the present case.
Mr Khan then commenced his arguments, describing the reserved seats case as one of the few cases in which the “entire jurisprudence was wrapped up and changed”.
The counsel also described the Jan 13, 2024, Supreme Court judgment — to deny the PTI its bat symbol — as “unprecedented”.
The verdict left the most popular party high and dry, Mr Khan argued.
Subsequently, PTI candidates were asked to contest the elections since the party had not boycotted the polls.
“I want to establish how a political party was persecuted from different sides,” Mr Khan emphasised, adding the eight judges who authored the majority judgment were “forced” out of the Constitutional Bench.

Moved through senior counsel Sardar Latif Khan Khosa, the review petition has urged that any proceedings in the matter be heard by a full court (consisting of all serving Supreme Court judges), given the gravity of potential violations of fundamental rights and the importance of the constitutional questions.
This is the third such review plea, following earlier petitions submitted by former chief justice of Pakistan Jawwad S. Khawaja, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and the Lahore Bar Association.
All petitions call on the apex court to revisit its judgement, warning that allowing military trials of civilians would set a dangerous precedent of ceding judicial authority to the executive by accepting that it can act as judge to try civilians in criminal cases.
 
 

In his petition, Mr Ahsan argued that the issue raises overarching questions of public importance that directly affect the fundamental rights of citizens and their access to an independent judicial forum. He maintained that since the matter spans multiple provinces, relying on high court jurisdiction would cause delays that cannot be justified given the severity of the issues at stake.

In two essays, published on Thursday in The New York Times and Time Magazine, offer a sobering analysis of the recent Iran-Israel conflict and its aftermath.
Writing in NYT, Dr Nasr notes that the current crisis is “one of the biggest challenges to the Islamic Republic since its founding in 1979” and a moment of reckoning for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
“Khamenei has maintained Iran’s hostility to the West during his 36 years in power,” he observes, arguing that this latest conflict — triggered by Israeli strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure — will likely reinforce rather than soften that stance.

In essays for Time and NYT, Dr Vali Nasr argues that without sustained US-Iran diplomacy, the latter may seek to revive its N-ambitions

“Iran’s rulers are no strangers to war,” Nasr writes.
“As Ayatollah Khamenei sees it, Iran is locked in a struggle for survival with the United States and its allies, including Israel.”
The NYT article suggests that rather than seeking escalation for its own sake, Tehran’s response has been calibrated to signal strength without crossing thresholds that would provoke full-scale war. “Iran is unlikely to back down,” Nasr writes, “but it may still look for ways to avoid a war with the United States and Israel.”
In Time Magazine, Nasr offers a parallel analysis, noting that Iran and Israel “were ready to stop fighting” after President Donald Trump declared a ceasefire following what he calls Tehran’s “choreographed response” to the Israeli and U.S. attacks. Still, he warns that this ceasefire “does not lay the foundations of peace.”
 
 

According to Nasr, “Israel’s military success was undisputed,” but the attack failed to fully eliminate Iran’s nuclear capacity. “Unless there is a new comprehensive nuclear deal between Iran and the United States, Tehran is likely to seek to reassemble its nuclear program,” he writes.
Iran still has “its stockpile of 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium that, according to some estimates, could be used to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs.”
He argues that a lasting resolution would require not just military deterrence but meaningful diplomacy. “Even after this war, diplomacy is still possible, and remains the best option for both Iran and the United States,” he writes.
However, the prospects for diplomacy are complicated by a deep lack of trust. Nasr recalls that the 2015 nuclear deal was abandoned by the US in 2018, a decision that badly damaged Iranian faith in American commitments.
“The Iranians do not trust the US leader,” he writes. To bring them back to the table, Washington may need to offer “greater economic relief, security guarantees, and assurances that it will not support future Israeli attacks.”
Public sentiment inside Iran also plays a critical role. In Time Magazine, Nasr notes that “Iranians are patriotic but they also crave peace, security, and economic prosperity.” While some US officials hoped civilian hardship might turn the population against the regime, Nasr concludes that “Iranians did no such thing,” despite significant losses and fuel shortages.
If anything, he suggests, the conflict has reaffirmed Iranian nationalism and hardened the leadership’s resolve. Still, cracks remain: “There will be serious questioning of the Islamic Republic’s policies,” he predicts, especially if economic hardship persists.
Ultimately, Nasr presents a choice for both sides. For Iran, that means considering whether the pursuit of nuclear deterrence is worth further isolation. For the US, it means deciding whether to engage or risk another round of conflict. “Diplomacy will be hard,” Nasr concludes, “but it is still possible.”
And in his view, it remains “the only way to avoid a repeat of this war—and perhaps something much worse.”

Yet, the global immigration discourse indicates that the issue is being seen mainly from a law-enforcement perspective, instead of a human rights one.
The Trump administration’s mass deportation drive against illegal immigrants in the US and Pakistan’s Afghan expatriation policy reflect this shifting attitude.
Recently, Los Angeles erupted in protest against the arrests of illegal immigrants by officials of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE is known for its heavy-handedness.
Raids were conducted in restaurants, warehouses, stores, and similar establishments where illegal immigrants were thought to be working. In a militarised response to the protests, the Trump administration deployed the National Guard and the US Marines, exacerbating matters.
The mass deportation drive is the latest in a series of anti-immigration executive orders issued by Donald Trump since his return to the presidency. The orders include the use of the Alien Enemies Act, 1798, to expel suspected gang members, a blanket ban on asylum access, and revocation of the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants on parole.
 
 

Tightening border control and removing criminals is the sovereign right of every country. But this right is not unqualified. Immigration enforcement must be carried out in a humane manner that does not strip an individual of his or her dignity.
Most critically, due process must be followed. Indiscriminately rounding up and deporting millions of law-abiding immigrants who have only known the US as their home is inhumane; expelling ‘suspected’ gang members without court convictions is inhumane; blocking asylum access for refugees overcoming dangerous journeys to flee political instability, conflict, poverty, gang violence and natural disasters is inhumane; and haphazardly revoking a parole programme, thus separating families, is inhumane. It is particularly unbecoming of a country that claims to be at the forefront of defending civil liberties and human rights.
 
 

Pakistan, too, has been cracking down on Afghan refugees since late 2023. At the time, it was estimated that Pakistan was hosting 1.3 million POR card holders (documentation issued by the UNHCR conferring refugee status), 800,000 Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders (issued by the government granting temporary residence but not formal refugee status), and 1.3m undocumented Afghan immigrants. The total figure included the 600,000 Afghans who fled to Pakistan after the Afghan Taliban retook Kabul in 2021.

Deportation is being conducted callously.

The first phase of the deportation plan, launched in November 2023, targeted the 1.3m undocumented immigrants. By February 2025, it was estimated that 800,000 had voluntarily left the country, fearing forced removal. They included POR and ACC cardholders, as a single household has individuals with varying documentation.
The second phase was launched in March 2025 against the ACC cardholders whose documentation had been cancelled and who were told to leave by end March. For now, no definite plan has been announced against the POR card holders. However, their documentation will expire on June 30 unless extended.
The manner in which the expatriation plan is being implemented shows a heavy-handed approach to the immigrants, two-thirds of whom have never lived in Afghanistan. More troubling, the plan is not driven by national security concerns but by political considerations.
There was an uptick in cross-border attacks and violence by the TTP and its affiliates after the Afghan Tali­ban retook power. Pakistan believes the Afghan Taliban are providing sanctuary to the TTP and demanded action against it. Kabul denies harbouring the terrorists, and the violence continues. In retaliation, Pakistan has carried out military strikes on suspected TTP hideouts, closed the border, and started expelling Afghan refugees.
Both the US and Pakistan cases present a critical lesson: an approach to immigration that prioritises law enforcement and undermines human rights is neither acceptable nor a solution. It was encouraging to see the US Supreme Court stepping in to order the US administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had been deported to El Salvador on suspicions of gang involvement.
In Pakistan, the government cannot hide behind the non-ratification of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol to shun its obligations under international humanitarian laws. The expatriation plan must be suspended until a more humane solution can be found. At the very least, at-risk individuals must be identified and saved from deportation. Due process is non-negotiable. Human rights are inalienable.

The SHC also directed that a compensation amount and an apology letter must not be handed over to a former female lecturer of IBA until the petition is decided.
Citing the ombudsman and former lecturer Zahra Sabri as respondents, the IBA and its executive director submitted that Ms Sabri had filed a complaint in January 2023 against the university’s registrar for allegedly making inappropriate and unprofessional remarks. Following an inquiry, the anti-harassment committee had recommended that IBA pay her Rs300,000 in compensation and issue a written apology.
The petitioners argued that the executive director/competent authority of IBA had declined to implement the committee’s recommendations, after which the complainant filed an appeal with the ombudsman.
On June 13, the ombudsman accepted the appeal and directed IBA to appoint a new competent authority and implement the committee’s recommendations within a week.
Representing the petitioner, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui informed a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro that former judge of apex court Justice (retd) Arif Khilji has been appointed as competent authority for this case.
He further stated that IBA was ready to implement the recommendations and had submitted a cheque of Rs300,000 along with an apology letter. However, he contended that since the petition raised questions about the interpretation of certain provisions of the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2021, the competent authority should be restrained from disbursing the amount or handing over the apology letter until the case is decided.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh for August 21.
“Meanwhile the cheque of Rs300,000 and written apology submitted by the petitioners shall not be disbursed and written apology letter shall not be handed over to respondent No.2 till decision of this petition,” the bench in its order concluded.
The petitioners further submitted that, according to the ombudsman’s impugned order, the executive director could not serve as a witness in the inquiry proceedings. Since the executive director had testified as a witness, they argued, he lost his legal standing as the competent authority in the matter.
They also submitted that the ombudsman had not made any observations or findings on the merits of the competent authority’s decision or on the legality of the inquiry committee’s recommendations.
The petitioners maintained that the inquiry committee’s findings were subject to review by the competent authority, who was mandated under the law to independently evaluate the recommendations.
They further argued that the ombudsman failed to note that the committee had exceeded its mandate. Ms Sabri’s complaint, they said, concerned alleged inappropriate remarks by the registrar, yet the committee also made recommendations regarding alleged gender-based discrimination, which was not part of the original complaint.

The Sindh government has proposed raising the minimum monthly wage to Rs42,000 from the existing Rs37,000 — higher than the Rs37,000-40,000 range currently applicable in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) came down hard on the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), accusing it of an authoritarian attitude and ignoring the Business Anomalies Committee, which includes presidents of chambers and trade bodies from across the country.
KCCI President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani warned that the protests would escalate if the government remained unresponsive. “This is just the beginning,” he said. “If our demands are ignored, citywide or even nationwide strikes may follow.” He called on the entire business community, especially small traders, to stand united with KCCI if such a call is made.

Slam sweeping powers to FBR and Sindh’s Rs42,000 minimum wage

Bilwani criticised the finance minister’s repeated assurances that the budget is “public-friendly” and “business-friendly”, arguing there is no tangible relief for the business community. “The environment is already grim due to soaring energy costs, poor electricity supply, gas shortages, water unavailability, and delayed tax refunds that have paralysed liquidity,” he said.
He added that many foreign buyers were now urging Pakistani exporters to shift operations to more stable and business-friendly countries.
Sweeping FBR powers
Particularly contentious is Section 37AA of the proposed Finance Bill, which grants the FBR sweeping powers to freeze bank accounts, seize funds, and arrest taxpayers merely on suspicion—even long-time compliant ones. “How can anyone run a business in such a hostile climate?” Bilwani asked.
He revealed that numerous businessmen had approached KCCI to form a committee guiding them on how to relocate their businesses abroad to safer jurisdictions. He noted that similar concerns were being echoed in Faisalabad, Lahore, and Sialkot — major industrial and export hubs.
Minimum wage disparity
On the provincial wage disparity, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Junaid Naqi said the proposed Rs42,000 minimum wage would be detrimental to Sindh’s economy, industry, and job creation.
Naqi argued that economic policymaking must reflect ground realities. With national inflation now at a historic low of 6pc, he questioned the rationale behind such a significant wage increase.
If Sindh enforces a wage higher than other provinces, businesses may be compelled to shift operations elsewhere to remain competitive, he warned, undermining employment and investment in the province.

Takahiro Shiraishi had been sentenced to death for his 2017 strangling and dismembering of eight women and one man in his apartment in Zama city in Kanagawa near Tokyo. He was dubbed the “Twitter killer” as he contacted victims via the social media platform.
Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki, who authorised Shiraishi’s hanging, said he made the decision after careful examination, taking into account the convict’s “extremely selfish” motive for crimes that “caused great shock andunrest to society.”
It followed the execution in July 2022 of a man who went on a stabbing rampage in Tokyo’s shopping district Akihabara in 2008.
It was also the first time a death penalty was carried out since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s government was inaugurated last October.
In September last year, a Japanese court acquitted Iwao Hakamada, who had spent the world’s longest time on death row after a wrongful conviction for crimes committed nearly 60 years ago.
 
 

Capital punishment is carried out by hanging in Japan and prisoners are notified of their execution hours before it is carried out, which has long been decried by human rights groups for the stress it puts on death-row prisoners.
“It is not appropriate to abolish the death penalty while these violent crimes are still being committed,” Suzuki told a press conference.

• Bill to set up autism centre tabled, among others
• Treasury MPA slams ‘illegal raid’ by police
LAHORE: The Punjab Asse­mbly on Thursday passed a tax-free budget worth  Rs5.33tr for the fiscal year 2025-26 with a majority vote. It also passed the Finance Bill 2025-26.
No new taxes have been imposed in the budget, and the existing tax structure also remains unchanged. There are no changes to provincial revenues, property tax, or transport tax. No additional taxes have been levied on any sector, including industry, agriculture, health, or education.
The focus of the budget, in the words of Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman, was on development, with 18 new projects allocated funds across various sectors as the government aimed to stay the course by encouraging economic activity without further tightening the tax net.
Prior to this, 41 demands for grants totaling over Rs4,31bn for various departments were approved, while all the eight cut motions presented by the opposition PTI were rejected by the house with a majority vote.
According to the budgetary allocation, over Rs120bn will be spent on the construction of roads and bridges in the upcoming fiscal year. Over Rs462bn have been set aside for pensioners. Around Rs258bn will be spent on health facilities, while a sum of over Rs137bn will go to the education system.
The police department has been given Rs200bn to maintain law and order, whereas more than Rs27bn will be spent on jail administration, and Rs1bn on civil defence services.
For the welfare of farmers, at least Rs26bn have been apportioned, while over Rs66bn have been earmarked for agricultural loans.
An amount of Rs37.96bn has been allocated for irrigation projects and Rs18.22bn for industrial development.
Likewise, Rs161bn will go to government buildings, Rs19bn to veterinary services, Rs1.6 bn to fisheries.
Funds allocated for museums and provision of justice were also approved by the assembly, alongwith grants for registration, stamps, motor vehicle acts, and excise were also approved.
Four bills tabled
Minister Rehman also tabled four important bills in the house: the Punjab Autism School and Resource Centre Bill 2025, the Urban Immovable Property Tax Amendment Bill 2025, the Essential Commo­dities Price Control Amendment Bill 2025 and the Punjab Labour Courts Bill 2025. These bills were referred to the relevant standing committees, and the speaker requested a report within two months.
During the session, treasury member Saeed Akbar Niwani raised objections about serial numbers 35 and 41 in the dem­a­nds for grants being identical.
He suggested that it would be better to combine them instead of having separate demands.
 
 

In response, Mr Rehman sta­ted that this has always been the practice and that their PC-1 (Project Concept-1) are different.
He added that if the honourable member is suggesting combining them, he would inquire whether it is technically possible.
Earlier, the house proceedings started over four hours later than the scheduled time. Spea­ker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan chaired the session.
At the outset of the session, treasury MPA Munawar Ghous erupted on a point of order, condemning the alleged illegal actions of the CCD. He stated that their former councillor was arrested by a CCD DSP, handcuffed, paraded through the market, humiliated, slapped, and had videos made of him. “People’s doors were knocked at and they were told to watch him and make his videos,” he asserted, calling it a violation of the Constitution.
The speaker said if a video clip had been made, it’s illegal and a violation of the high court’s orders and asked the minister for parliamentary affairs to look into this matter, terming it a bad precedent. Mr Rehman assured the chair that he would look into this matter at the earliest.
The speaker also called for disarming the people, saying one person’s enmity is terrifying entire villages. “My request to the minister for parliamentary affairs is to take this matter to the cabinet. Weapons in people’s hands are a cause of fear and terror. Murders are happening in the courts.”
The minister responded that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was already working on disarming the people and eliminating the culture of arms from society.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei

• In first appearance since truce with Israel, supreme leader hails ‘slap’ on the face of America
• Hegseth insists strikes on N-facilities were successful
• Iran’s legislature clears bill to suspend cooperation with IAEA
TEHRAN / WASHIN­GTON: Even after Iran’s supreme leader accused President Donald Trump of exaggerating the impact of US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Washington continued to insist on the success of its actions, claiming that there was no evidence Tehran had been able to move any of its highly enriched uranium.
In his first public appearance since a ceasefire in the war with Israel took hold, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed what he termed a “victory” over Israel, vowing never to yield to US pressure and insisting that the US had been dealt a humiliating “slap”.
“The American president exaggerated events in unusual ways, and it turned out that he needed this exaggeration,” Khamenei said, rejecting US claims Iran’s nuclear programme had been set back by decades.
The strikes, he insisted, had done “nothing significant” to the country’s nuclear infrastructure.
Trump, however, maintained that the attacks were devastating.
Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump dismissed speculation Iran might have removed enriched uranium prior to the raid, saying: “Nothing was taken out… too dangerous, and very heavy and hard to move!”
 


“The cars and small trucks at the site were those of concrete workers trying to cover up the top of the shafts. Nothing was taken out of (the) facility,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, without providing evidence.
But Khamenei dismissed such claims, saying “the Islamic republic won, and in retaliation dealt a severe slap to the face of America”.
True impact?
In Washington, the true impact of the strikes has sparked sharp political and intelligence debates.
A leaked classified assessment suggested the damage to Iran’s nuclear programme may be less severe than initially claimed — possibly delaying progress by only a few months.
This assessment contrasts with statements from senior US officials.
CIA Director John Ratcliffe said several facilities would need to be “rebuilt over the course of years”.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also said he was unaware of any intelligence suggesting Iran had moved any of its highly enriched uranium to shield it from US strikes.
“President Trump created the conditions to end the war, decimating — choose your word — obliterating, destroying Iran’s nuclear capabilities,” he said at a press conference.
 
 

Trump, who watched the exchange with reporters, echoed his defence secretary, saying it would have taken too long to remove anything.
But doubts remain about whether Iran quietly removed some 400 kilograms of enriched uranium from its most sensitive sites before the strikes — potentially hiding nuclear material elsewhere in the country.
Several experts cautioned this week that Iran likely moved a stockpile of near weapons-grade highly enriched uranium out of the deeply buried Fordow site before the strikes, and could be hiding it and other nuclear components in locations unknown to Israel, the US and UN nuclear inspectors.
They noted satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showing “unusual activity” at Fordow on Thursday and Friday, with a long line of vehicles waiting outside an entrance to the facility. A senior Iranian source told Reuters on Sunday that most of the 60pc highly enriched uranium had been moved to an undisclosed location before the US attack.
The Financial Times, citing European capitals, reported that Iran’s highly enriched uranium stockpile remains largely intact since it was not concentrated at Fordow.
IAEA cooperation ended
Meanwhile, Iran’s Guardian Council has approved a bill to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Lawmakers had voted in favour of the bill a day after a ceasefire ended a 12-day war with Israel.
Iranian officials have sharply criticised the International Atomic Energy Agency for failing to condemn the strikes, while Tehran criticised the watchdog for passing a resolution on June 12 accusing it of non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.
Iranian officials say the censure motion was “one of the main excuses” for the Israeli and US attacks.
“The government is required to suspend all cooperation with the IAEA to ensure full respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Guardian Council spokesman Hadi Tahan Nazif told the official IRNA news agency.
The bill, which will now be submitted to President Masoud Pezeshkian for final ratification, would allow Iran “to benefit from all the entitlements specified under… the Non-Proliferation Treaty especially with regard to uranium enrichment,” Nazif said.
Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said in a post on X that cooperation with the watchdog was “not possible” at this time until security at Iran’s nuclear facilities “is ensured.”

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif greets PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the National Assembly during the final budget session.—APP

• Bilawal supports budget, highlights increased funding for BISP, tax relief
• Opposition objects to FBR’s arrest powers, says ‘most corrupt’ body turned into police force
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Thursday passed the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year, with an outlay of Rs17.57 trillion, despite opposition calls for the budgetary proposals to be made public and for the passage to be delayed until public input had been sought.
The House passed the Finance Bill for 2025 with certain amendments, incorporating around half of the suggestions put forward by the finance committees of both houses of parliament. All amendments proposed by the opposition were rejected.
 






Speaking to lawmakers, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari explained why his party was supporting the federal budget. He highlighted an increase of 20 per cent in the allocation for the Benazir Income Support Pro­gra­mme (BISP), a flagship initiative originally envisioned by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
He criticised the previous PTI government for attempting to undermine BISP in every budget and praised Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif for consistently increasing its funding since assuming office. Mr Bhutto-Zardari also noted that the government had raised the income threshold for tax exemption from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2 million annually.
The PPP chairman also pointed out that the tax on solar panels had been reduced from 18pc to 10pc following objections from PPP members.
He also welcomed the decision to curtail the arrest powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), noting that arrests in tax cases could now only be made in instances of proven fraud, not during the inquiry stage, and that such offences had been declared bailable. “These are the reasons why the PPP is supporting this budget,” he said.
However, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan criticised the federal budget as a “disastrous” 64pc deficit, which he argued would severely harm the country.
He expressed concerns that Pakistan’s economy could face a crisis similar to Sri Lanka’s, with the agricultural sector and large-scale industry failing, potentially leading the country to bankruptcy.
 
 

“Contrary to its claims, the government has failed to bring about economic reforms or complete the privatisation of any major entity,” he said. “That is why I will not say it is a visionary budget in the absence of any reforms”, he said.
Barrister Gohar also raised concerns about the allocation for BISP, which had been increased from Rs313 billion to over Rs700 billion, arguing that there had not been a fair distribution of funds across the country.
He criticised the new powers granted to the FBR to appoint auditors for evaluation and audit, calling it unconstitutional and in violation of Article 242 of the Constitution and relevant rules.
Malik Aamir Dogar of PTI argued that the government did not have a mandate from the public to present or approve the budget. He accused the government of consulting the IMF while preparing the federal budget but not consulting the public before its approval.
PTI’s Muhammad Atif Khan also questioned how a party that was not voted into power could impose new taxes on the people. He held the previous PML-N government (2013-18) responsible for causing a significant rise in capacity payments due to “dubious” power purchase agreements with independent power producers (IPPs).
Aliya Kamran of JUI-F moved a cut motion, criticising tax evasion and lack of transparency and accountability within the FBR system. Shandana Gulzar of PTI also criticised the government, accusing it of misleading the public about economic figures and implementing anti-people policies.
Ali Muhammad Khan, addressing Mr Bhutto-Zardari, asked him to become the voice of the poor masses and oppose measures like the imposition of new taxes on vehicles starting from 850cc.
Mobeen Arif of PTI proposed deferring the passage of the bill until the public had been consulted.
Latif Khosa, alluding to the country’s growing debt, questioned the government’s handling of loans, asking, “Have­n’t you mortgaged three generations?” He added that nearly half of the population had fallen below the poverty line.
Opposition members strongly objected to granting arrest powers to FBR officials, arguing that the government had turned the “most corrupt” institution into a police force, potentially leading to harassment of citizens under the pretext of tax collection.
PM Shehbaz also attended the proceedings and met leaders from both sides of the aisle, including Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
Budget 2025-26
The federal budget for the next fiscal year projects an economic growth rate of 4.2pc and an inflation rate of 7.5pc. The net revenue receipts have been estimated at Rs11.07tr, with FBR collections projected to rise by 18.7pc to Rs14.13tr. Non-tax revenues are estimated at Rs5.15tr.
Key allocations include Rs2.55tr for defence, Rs1.06tr for pension expenditures, and Rs1.19tr for subsidies on electricity and other sectors. Relief measures in the budget include a 10pc increase in salaries, 7pc in pensions and tax relief for the salaried class across all income brackets.
The budget also includes Rs716bn for BISP and Rs1tr for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), in which the largest allocation of Rs328bn is earmarked for transport infrastructure projects.
The PSDP for the next fiscal year has been aligned with the objectives of URAAN Pakistan, prioritising high-impact, near-completion foreign-funded projects and new initiatives of national importance.
Key infrastructure projects like Diamer Bhasha, Mohmand Dam and K-IV have been allocated Rs32.7bn, Rs35.7bn and Rs3.2bn, respectively. Besides, Rs10bn has been allocated for the lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder and Rs4.4bn for installing a telemetry system on the Indus Basin System.
The Higher Education Commission has been allocated Rs39.5bn for 170 projects. Additionally, Rs18.5bn has been earmarked in the PSDP for various education initiatives.
The agriculture sector will receive Rs4bn for 10 ongoing and five new schemes. The budget also includes incentives for the construction industry, such as a reduction in withholding tax on property purchases.

Urban flooding
The heavy downpour resulted in urban flooding which crippled life in cities like Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad.
The water submerged underpasses and low-lying neighbourhoods.
In Lahore’s Nishtar Town, continuous rainfall caused flooded roads, leading to traffic jams and power outages.
 
 

PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia has said families of the deceased will be compensated and assisted under the government policy.
He further said that this spell of monsoon rains will continue till July 1. Citizens have been requested to take precautionary measures.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman has directed all relevant government departments to be on high alert to deal with potential urban flooding.
In a meeting at the Civil Secretariat, the chief secretary reviewed precautionary measures being taken to address urban flooding.
All deputy commissioners virtually attended the meeting.
Mr Zaman emphasised the importance of putting safety arrangements in place and asked the officers to ensure regular cleaning of drains and sewerage lines.
He said rainwater should be immediately drained from low-lying areas. All dewatering pumps and other machinery must be kept operational to enable swift emergency responses.

• Calls registrars’ role vital in safeguarding interests of men, women
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has ordered the government to simplify Nikahnamas and ensure that nikah registrars are qualified, knowledgeable and persons of integrity to preserve the rights of the bride and groom in a marriage.
The directions were issued in a verdict released on Thursday.
The verdict was authored by Justice Athar Minallah, who was part of a three-judge bench that heard appeals filed by a man and woman who disagreed over the provisions of dower mentioned in the Nikahnama.
Fakhra Jabeen, the woman, filed an appeal against the Dec 13, 2021, verdict of the Lahore High Court, which held that entries in the Nikahnama must always be interpreted in favour of the groom because he has to bear the burden of the liabilities recorded in the contract.
In the 22-page judgement, Justice Minallah regretted the large number of disputes reaching the Supreme Court over the interpretation of entries recorded in Nikahnamas.
The judgement stated that the Nikahnama annexed in the Family Rules needed to be reviewed and made more user-friendly so that “even a literate person of ordinary prudence does not have difficulty in understanding its requirements and the columns”.
The expressions used in the prescribed form are ambiguous and, therefore, open to being misconstrued.
The federal and the provincial governments may, therefore, consider reviewing the Nikahnama to make it more user-friendly and remove the ambiguities likely to arise from the vague and ambiguous expressions used in the headings of the columns, the judgement said.
“This would not only protect the rights of the parties in general, and the women in particular, but would also reduce litigation since a more user-friendly prescribed form of the Nikahnama will give rise to lesser disputes,” the judgement said.
 
 

Qualified registrars
In many cases, the judge noted, such disputes may not have arisen if the headings of the columns were not open to be misconstrued or if the nikah registrar had fulfilled their duties under the law.
He observed the integrity, competence, knowledge and understanding of nikah registrars were crucial for effectively safeguarding the rights of the parties, particularly the women.
These officials were licensed under Section 5(2) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance to ensure that both parties exercise their rights and that the entries recorded in the Nikahnama correctly reflect their intention, the judgement said.
The government has a statutory duty to guide union councils in setting out adequate qualifications and criteria for granting licences to nikah registrars.
Moreover, the training and evaluation of these officials would further ensure that social or cultural norms and influences do not prevail over the absolute rights bestowed upon women under the law.
In Punjab, the provincial assembly has made it mandatory for the registrars to accurately fill all columns of the Nikahnama with specific answers of the bride and groom.
Breaching this duty exposes the registrar to penal consequences, i.e. imprisonment for up to one month and Rs25,000 fine, the judgement said, adding the purpose of this legislation was to “protect women from exploitation and provide them with expeditious resolution of family disputes and ancillary matters”.
 
 

The court also directed that the judgement’s copies be sent to the cabinet secretary and provincial chief secretaries to consider the suggestions and observations regarding Nikahnamas and registrars.
“We expect that effective steps would be taken to ensure safeguarding the rights of the parties to a marriage contract, particularly the bride who may be more vulnerable on account of multiple factors, including the cultural and social norms and beliefs,” the judgement observed.

He also thanked the federal cabinet and allied political parties for their support in finalising the budget.

Chairs cabinet meeting; discusses strengthening of Pakistan-US ties with Marco Rubio

Addressing the recent regional developments, PM Shehbaz welcomed the Israel-Iran ceasefire, calling it “crucial to avoid further escalation and loss”.
He expressed gratitude to God for the peaceful resolution and acknowledged the role played by various countries, including Saudi Arabia, in brokering the ceasefire.
“Iran openly thanked the people of Pakistan, its political parties, military, and political leadership for their role in ensuring the ceasefire between the two countries,” PM Shehbaz said.
Regarding the recent attack by Iran on Qatar, he said Pakistan had issued a condemnation statement, reiterating the country’s strong ties with the “brotherly nation”.
Regarding Muharram, PM Shehbaz ordered authorities to enforce strict law and order during processions and gatherings.
He instructed the interior minister to coordinate with provincial governments, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to maintain peace and security during the month.
Earlier, the cabinet offered Fateha for Major Moeez Abbas Shah, killed in an operation against terrorists in South Waziristan.
The meeting decided to form a committee on gas production and supply, which will submit its suggestions to the Supreme Court.
PM Shehbaz also briefed the cabinet on recent decisions made by the National Security Committee.
The meeting paid tribute to PM Shehbaz, Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar for their “effective role in de-escalating tension between Iran and Israel”.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb later briefed the cabinet on proposed amendments and suggestions included in the finance bill.
PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction with the fiscal measures taken to stabilise the economy. Later, the federal cabinet approved determining the petroleum levy to the Ministry of Petroleum.
Talks with Rubio
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the PM Office said in a statement.
Mr Sharif praised US President Donald Trump’s “bold and decisive leadership” that led to the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, according to the statement. The prime minister also thanked Rubio for the key US role in a separate Pakistan-India ceasefire.
The two officials agreed to continue working to strengthen bilateral relations, particularly through trade, the statement added.
Exchanging views on the current situation in the Middle East, the premier said Pakistan will maintain its constructive role in Middle East peace efforts.
Mr Rubio responded with desire to collaborate with Pakistan for regional peace and stability.

• US president’s support for PM draws criticism from Israeli politicians
JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked a court on Thursday to postpone his testimony in his long-running corruption trial, after US President Donald Trump called for the case to be cancelled altogether.
Trump’s move in support of Netanyahu over the case drew criticism from some Israeli politicians, including a member of the Israeli leader’s own coalition and the leader of the opposition.
It came days after Trump and Netanyahu declared victory over Iran in a 12-day conflict that saw Israel bombard the Islamic republic and US planes also drop powerful missiles on its nuclear installations.
In a filing to the tribunal, Netanyahu’s lawyer Amit Hadad said the premier’s testimony should be delayed in light of “regional and global developments”.
“The court is respectfully requested to order the cancellation of the hearings in which the prime minister was scheduled to testify in the coming two weeks,” the filing said.
It said Netanyahu was “compelled to devote all his time and energy to managing national, diplomatic and security issues of the utmost importance” following the conflict with Iran and during ongoing fighting in Gaza.
Trump on Wednesday described the case against Netanyahu as a “witch hunt”.
In a message on his Truth Social platform, Trump said the Netanyahu trial “should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero”, after the end of the war with Iran.
Netanyahu on Thursday thanked Trump for his “heartfelt support for me and your incredible support for Israel and the Jewish people”.
“I look forward to continue working with you to defeat our common enemies, liberate our hostages and quickly expand the circle of peace,” Netanyahu wrote on X, sharing a copy of Trump’s Truth Social post.
 






Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said in an interview with news website Ynet: “We are thankful to President Trump, but… the president should not interfere in a judicial trial in an independent country.”
Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the trial, which has been delayed many times since it began in May 2020.
In a first case, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours.
In two other cases, Netanyahu is accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage in two Israeli media outlets.
One of Netanyahu’s coalition allies, Simcha Rothman of the far-right Religious Zionism party, also called for Trump to stay out of the court case.
“It is not the role of the president of the United States to interfere in legal proceedings in the State of Israel,” said Rothman, who chairs the Israeli parliament’s judicial affairs committee.

The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their defence ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders set for the autumn.
Addressing the session, Asif condemned Israel’s recent 12-day war against Iran and stressed the importance of collective efforts to address evolving global and regional security challenges, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
“Terrorism is a common threat. Pakistan calls on all states to desist from politicising the joint effort of the International Community to fight the means of terrorism to deflect attention from their internal failures,” the defence minister stated.
Noting that Pakistan denounced terrorism in all of its forms, Asif, according to PTV, said that the country condemned the April terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead.
“We call upon all states to hold these states and their state actions to account who planned, financed and sponsored the terrorist attack as Jaffar Express in Balochistan,” Asif added, not naming the country that aided the attack.
“We have in our custody … a serving Naval Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav [who] confessed to financing, planning and perpetrating multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”
 






The defence minister highlighted Pakistan’s continuing role in counter-terrorism, using ongoing operations against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Islamic State as an example.
The minister “welcomed SCO’s efforts against the ‘three evils’ — terrorism, separatism, and extremism — and emphasised the need to strengthen cooperation in cyber security, anti-narcotics, and counter-extremist ideologies”, PTV’s report read.
During his address, Asif also called for a ceasefire in Gaza and emphasised the need for a stable Afghanistan “for regional connectivity and long-term stability”.
However, a joint communique could not be signed by all members due to what the Indian foreign ministry deemed “a lack of consensus on referring to ‘terrorism’”.
“Certain members, member countries, could not reach [a] consensus on certain issues and hence the document could not be finalised on our side,” Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at a weekly media briefing, according to The Times of India.
“India wanted concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country, and therefore, the statement was not adopted,” he said, without naming the country.
According to The Times of India, New Delhi refused to sign the document after it omitted a reference to the Pahalgam attack.
A Pakistani official at the moot, who requested anonymity, told Dawn.com that, “India faced diplomatic isolation at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, where Pakistan achieved significant success.
“India failed to link the Pahalgam incident to Pakistan in the joint communique, declined to sign the communique to cover its embarrassment, received no support from any member state on the Pahalgam issue and also stood alone in its differing stance on Israeli aggression against Iran,” he stated.
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the foreign ministries of China and Pakistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on India’s statement.
Earlier on Thursday, when asked about the joint statement, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said the meeting had “achieved successful results”, without elaborating.
The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Following the allegations, India launched a series of missile strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, 24 impacts were recorded across six locations, leaving 33 Pakistani civilians dead and 76 injured. In response, Pakistan’s military shot down five Indian jets and destroyed brigade headquarters and multiple checkposts along the Line of Control.
On the morning of May 10, India targeted several Pakistani airbases, prompting a swift military response from Pakistan under the retaliatory campaign codenamed Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos. It took US intervention for the two countries to declare a ceasefire the same day.
Thursday’s summit was the first time that senior ministers from India and Pakistan had shared a stage since the clash.</p><small>2025-06-26 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26183252ea14ca3.jpg?r=184233' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303/finance-bill-sails-through-parliament-to-greenlight-rs1757tr-budget' target='_blank'><strong>Finance Bill sails through parliament to greenlight Rs17.57tr budget</strong></a><br><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.
The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend “contentious” clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a Dawn.com correspondent.
The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.
 






Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would “happily support the budget,” since the government had accepted the party’s proposals.
“We appreciate the government’s efforts as BISP’s (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,” he said. “Moreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.”
Bilawal added that after the PPP’s initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.
“We are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,” Bilawal said.
Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.
The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.
“The FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,” the amendment added.
All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.
Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.
The amendment was approved by a majority vote.
107 institutions granted tax-exempt status
During the session, 107 entities— including lawyers’ bodies, hospitals and government projects — were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
The finance minister’s amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.
According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:

Provincial bar councils
Pakistan Bar Council
The Military Foundation
Army Welfare Trust
Foundation University
Forman Christian College
LUMS
Ghulam Ishaq Khan University
FBR Foundation
Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital
The Edhi Foundation
Al-Shifa Trust and Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital
The Poverty Alleviation Fund
National Rural Support Programme
National Endowment Scholarship
Pakistan Agricultural Research Council
Audit Oversight Board

Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.
Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.
The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.
The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.
