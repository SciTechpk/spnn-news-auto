The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m.
The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated.
Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions.
Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time.

Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended.
The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.”
It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”.
Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
PTI slams verdict
The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”.
“A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further.
“They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped.







Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script.
“Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision.
Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts.
“What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said.
“Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned.

According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement.
Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.
He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case.
PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”.
“There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added.







A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”.
The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said.
“This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said.
The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”.
The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”.
It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced.







Minister says sentence to run consecutively
Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use.
He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”.

“During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use.
“They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”.
“The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”.
He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”.
“The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said.
“The gift was not even submitted,” he added.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference.
“The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said.
“Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah also addressed the sentence while speaking to the media in Chiniot, saying that state gifts did not belong to an individual but to the state.
He said the entire case against Imran was documented.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2020392152f3f2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962272/yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-other-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-years-by-lahore-atc-in-additional-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, other PTI leaders sentenced to 10 years by Lahore ATC in additional May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday sentenced PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed to 10 years in prison terms in two more May 9 cases.
The latest court verdict comes a day after a Lahore ATC acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing four other leaders, including Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, and Ejaz Chaudhry, to 10 years in prison in another case related to the May 9 riots.
Rana Mudassar, the counsel for the PTI leaders, confirmed the development to Dawn, saying the cases are related to the burning of police vehicles in Lahore’s Gulberg and the burning of a container near Kalma Chowk during the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan.
On that day, supporters and workers of the party, reacting to founder Imran Khan’s arrest, vandalised and torched military installations and government properties. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against Imran and his party, booking the party founder and its leadership in multiple cases.
ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed presided over the hearings for both cases today in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. A total of 22 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while five were acquitted in the Kalma Chowk case. In the Gulberg case, the judge handed down sentences to five, including the PTI leaders, while acquitting 22 others.
The judge noted that former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not yet been indicted in either case and his trial would proceed separately once a supplementary challan was submitted by the prosecution.
According to the prosecution, a total of 78 witnesses were presented in both cases. In the Gulberg case, a challan was filed against 33 individuals, while four others were declared proclaimed offenders during the trial.
In the Kalma Chowk case, the prosecution filed a challan against 36 people, while 12 others, including Hammad Azhar, Murad Saeed, Zubair Niazi, and Mian Aslam Iqbal, were declared absconders.
The prosecutor argued that PTI leaders had instigated party workers to revolt and create public disorder.
Talking to the media later, PTI’s counsel said the cases were scheduled for routine proceedings, but “sentences have been handed down once again in the darkness of night”.
He added that the defence was not given the chance to fully present its case.
“The morale of the prisoners in Kot Lakhpat Jail is high. So far, the leaders have been sentenced to a total of more than 200 years,” the counsel said, adding that the sentences would be challenged in the high court.
With these verdicts, decisions have now been announced in seven of the 14 cases related to the May 9 riots registered in Lahore. Verdicts had previously been announced in trials concerning an attack on Shadman Police Station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House, and an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2019390113cf4af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962271/elders-of-kps-tirah-agree-to-vacate-homes-ahead-of-military-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Elders of KP’s Tirah agree to vacate homes ahead of military operation</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: After weeks of protracted deliberations with security and administration officials, tribal elders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s restive Tirah valley finally agreed to start vacating their homes from January 10, ahead of an operation against militants, after reaching a written agreement with the district administration.
The deadlock had persisted between the valley’s tribal elders and government officials over the launch of a military operation in the valley as well as the relocation of families to prevent collateral damage.
Sources among the 24-member jirga, who negotiated the written agreement on the displacement process with the district administration, said that the entire Tirah valley would be vacated by January 25, 2026, thus paving the way for the long-anticipated military operation against all proscribed militant groups currently holed up in the valley.
Spelling out the terms and conditions of the written agreement, the jirga said that the district administration agreed to pay Rs3 million to those whose houses were completely damaged and Rs1 million to those whose houses were partially damaged, respectively, during the military operation, which will be launched once the evacuation is completed.
They said that the jirga was also assured that every family would receive Rs250,000 through JazzCash or Easypaisa upon biometric verification at the time of registration at the Bagh Markaz and Paindi Cheena registration centers.
Each family would further be provided with a monthly stipend of Rs50,000 until April 5, 2026, when the return process would begin following the completion of the military operation, the sources added.
The district administration also agreed to arrange free transportation for the departing families, along with the provision of free health services during their journey to their next destination.
It was further decided during the deliberations held at Khyber House that families who had already left their homes would be included in the survey of newly displaced families, with the head of each family required to report to either the Bagh Markaz or Paindi Cheena registration center for biometric verification before January 25, 2026.
A representative jirga of Tirah elders had earlier presented a list of demands to security and administrative officials, which included Rs8 million and Rs4 million as compensation for fully and partially damaged houses, respectively, along with Rs500,000 for every departing family.
The demands were, however, toned down to a limit mutually agreed upon by the security and administrative officials and the jirga members, with the Tirah elders left with no option but to accept a written agreement as time was running out for the launch of a decisive military operation.
Sources among the jirga members insisted that collateral damage from indiscriminate artillery shelling of suspected militants’ hideouts and quadcopter attacks was a major concern for most residents of the Tirah valley, while security officials argued that the presence of militants in congested residential areas was a major obstacle to executing intelligence-based military operations (IBOs).
They said that the forceful occupation of private houses by militant groups and their frequent changes of location were also a source of continuous trouble and inconvenience, with security officials constantly insisting on the complete relocation of Tirah residents to pave the way for a decisive push against all outlawed militant groups.
Security officials, in consultation with local elders, had earlier agreed on limited internal displacement during the IBOs, with families from a suspected locality relocated to a nearby safer area for a limited period and returning home upon the completion of the IBOs.
However, this failed to alleviate the suffering of local residents, while security forces were forced to launch frequent IBOs whenever militant groups re-entered areas previously declared safe.
“It’s imperative that we leave the entire valley at the disposal of the security forces after our complete relocation to safer locations, far from the heat of the military operations in Tirah,” a jirga member told Dawn.
The jirga member, however, firmly insisted on the demand that there be no further displacement once the anticipated military operation is completed, with a strong assurance of no future IBOs in areas cleared after the major operation.
Dawn has also learned that MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with members of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, who had vehemently opposed forced displacement and the subsequent military operations in Tirah, were left out of the intense deliberations between the 24-member Tirah jirga and district administration officials.
Later, responding to a Dawn query about his absence from the Friday jirga, MNA Iqbal Afridi insisted that military operations in the merged districts had never achieved the desired results and had instead proved to be a source of destruction and prolonged displacement of innocent tribesmen.
He regretted being declared a proclaimed offender following the registration of numerous allegedly false First Information Reports (FIRs) against him, as he had consistently raised his voice against the military operations and forced displacements, which he said were actually aimed at gaining unlawful control over the natural resources of the newly merged districts.
Last month at least five terrorists affiliated with the proscribed Tekreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in an IBO in Tirah valley.
In September, at least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in blasts, which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.</p><small>2025-12-20 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2020281304c9ff6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962261/in-pictures-the-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: The Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>Jeffery Epstein, a convicted sex offender, died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking of underage girls. He held close associations with several influential people, including business tycoons and celebrities.
The US Department of Justice on Friday released a new cache of documents from its investigations into the late convicted sex offender.
The Epstein files have been a significant political problem for President Donald Trump, with many of his supporters and Republicans in Congress demanding their release. It remains to be seen if this partial release will satisfy Trump’s critics on the issue.

He served as the vice chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), which set up a camp years ago on Quetta’s Adalat Road, a site that has long stood as a symbol of protest against enforced disappearances in Balochistan.
VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch confirmed the rights activist’s passing to Dawn, saying: “He had been ill for a long time and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Quetta for the past two months.”
The group’s chairman added that the funeral prayers and burial would be performed on Sunday in Shaheed Sikanderabad district.

 

Baloch said the deceased’s struggle had remained prominent in human rights circles across the country.
In November 2011, Qadeer received the mutilated body of his son, Jalil Reiki, who was the information secretary of the Baloch Republican Party. The kidnapping and subsequent death of his son further galvanised the advocacy group, strengthening its efforts to support families enduring similar tragedies.
In 2013, the activist led a long march on foot from Quetta to Islamabad, joined by other Baloch men and women, to protest against enforced disappearances.
Since its inception, VBMP has raised its voice against the enforced disappearances of students, political activists and other civilians.
‘Legacy will endure’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) mourned the death and paid homage to the deceased activist.
“His legacy will endure in the countless families he stood beside. We reiterate that the state must take concerted action to restore the rights for which Mama spent decades campaigning.”







Advocate Rahab Khan Buledi, chairman of the Balochistan Bar Council’s Executive Committee, paid tribute to Qadeer in a statement.
“Mama Qadeer Baloch had been peacefully struggling for the recovery of missing persons for a long time. His democratic struggle is commendable. He was a strong voice of the oppressed,“ he said, adding that the council also paid homage to him.
Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal hailed him as a “symbol of resistance against state oppression, enforced disappearances and injustice.
”Despite immense personal loss and relentless hardship, he never abandoned the families of the disappeared or his demand for truth and accountability. Mama Qadeer’s struggle was not just personal, it embodied the collective pain and political resistance of entire people.“







Former senator Afrasiab Khattak said Qadeer “epitomised” the struggle for the recovery of all missing persons and would be remembered for his “fearless and valiant struggle”.







Advocate and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir said the “heartbreaking” news was a “huge loss” to the country’s human rights movement.
“Mama Qadeer will forever remain etched in our hearts and minds.”







“He will always be remembered for his struggle against enforced disappearances, for demanding justice for the Baloch and for standing bravely in the face of oppression,” said National Democratic Movement Chairman Mohsin Dawar in a post on X.
Journalist Kiyya Baloch said Qadeer left behind a legacy of “more than 16 years of non-violent struggle that continues to inspire today’s peaceful resistance against enforced disappearances”.
“He sat for endless days in front of the Quetta and Karachi Press Clubs and marched for countless miles all in the service of his people. May Mama Qadeer’s struggle to end the cruel practice of enforced disappearances someday be successful,“ said academic Nida Kirmani, a professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.

The absence of references to Trump was notable given that pictures and documents related to him have trickled out of previous Epstein releases for years. Trump’s name appeared in flight manifests listing passengers on Epstein’s private plane that were part of a first batch of Epstein material the Justice Department released in February, for instance.

 

The partial release was intended to comply with a law overwhelmingly passed by Congress in November that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein files, despite the Republican president’s months-long effort to keep them sealed. The scandal surrounding Epstein has become a self-inflicted political wound for Trump, who for years had promoted conspiracy theories about Epstein to his supporters.
It was not immediately clear how substantive the new materials were, given that many Epstein-related documents have previously been made public since his 2019 death in jail, which was ruled a suicide. Many of the files were heavily redacted — several documents with 100 pages or more were entirely blacked out — and the Justice Department acknowledged it was still reviewing hundreds of thousands of additional pages for possible release.

 

The material included evidence from several investigations into Epstein, along with photos of Clinton, long scorned by Republicans. But they appeared to include few, if any, photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s, before they had a falling out before Epstein’s first conviction in 2008.
Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing and has denied knowing about Epstein’s crimes.
‘This isn’t about Bill Clinton’
The Justice Department sought to draw attention to Clinton, with two agency spokespeople posting on social media images that they said showed him with Epstein victims.
Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said in a statement that the White House was attempting to “shield themselves” from scrutiny by focusing on the former president.
“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton,” he wrote.
Trump ordered the Justice Department last month to investigate Clinton’s ties to Epstein, in what critics viewed as an effort to shift the focus away from his own relationship with Epstein.
In images released on Friday, Clinton can be seen in a swimming pool with Maxwell and another person whose face is blacked out. In another image, he can be seen in a hot tub with what appears to be another person whose face is blacked out. Clinton has previously expressed regret for socialising with Epstein and said he was not aware of any criminal activity.
There were more than 1,200 victims or their relatives whose names must be redacted from the files, said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in a letter to Congress.
In a statement, the White House claimed the release demonstrated its transparency and commitment to justice for Epstein’s victims, criticising previous Democratic administrations for not doing the same.
But the statement ignored that the disclosures occurred only because Congress forced the administration’s hand, after Trump officials declared earlier this year that no more Epstein files would be made public.
Some lawmakers immediately criticised the administration for failing to release all of the files.
“This set of heavily redacted documents released by the Department of Justice today is just a fraction of the whole body of evidence,” Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
Republican US Representative Thomas Massie, a driving force behind the legislation, said on X that Friday’s release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law”.







The disclosure law required the Justice Department to turn over information about its handling of the Epstein investigation, including internal reports and emails. None of those materials appeared to be in the batch of documents the government released on Friday.
The law allowed the Justice Department to withhold personal information about Epstein’s victims as well as material that would jeopardise an active investigation.
Trump voters frustrated
Many Trump voters had accused his administration of covering up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscuring details surrounding his death in a Manhattan jail, where he was awaiting trial on charges of trafficking and abusing underage girls.
Just 44 per cent of American adults who identify as Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein issue, compared to his 82pc overall approval rating among the group, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. The issue has damaged Trump’s political standing ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress is at stake.
Last month, Democrats in the House of Representatives released thousands of emails obtained from Epstein’s estate, including one in which Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls”, without clarifying what that meant. Trump, in response, accused Democrats of promoting the “Epstein Hoax” as a distraction.
House Republicans released more emails the same day, including one saying Trump visited Epstein’s house many times but “never got a massage”.
Previous disclosures have revealed that even after his 2008 conviction, Epstein continued corresponding with high-profile figures, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Clinton’s former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, PayPal founder Peter Thiel and Britain’s former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was stripped of his royal title over his links to Epstein.
Representatives for Bannon, Thiel and Mountbatten-Windsor have not responded to Reuters’ requests for comment about their interactions with Epstein.
JPMorgan paid some of Epstein’s victims $290 million in 2023 to settle claims it had overlooked his sex trafficking. The bank kept Epstein as a client for five years after he was convicted of soliciting a minor in 2008.</p><small>2025-12-20 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20142619dda28a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962246/us-grapples-with-defining-mandate-for-gaza-stabilisation-force' target='_blank'><strong>US grapples with defining mandate for Gaza stabilisation force</strong></a><br><p>The United States (US) is facing a delicate balancing act in defining the mandate for a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza.
Any plan must address the concerns of potential troop-contributing countries while also satisfying Israel’s security demands — a combination that has so far proven elusive.
As diplomats gathered this week in Doha and Miami, it became clear that clarity on legal authority, rules of engagement, and operational responsibilities is a prerequisite for any country, particularly Muslim-majority nations, to commit troops.
Until these questions are resolved, phase two of the Gaza peace plan risks remaining largely a blueprint on paper rather than an actionable plan.
Consultations in Doha and Miami
Earlier this week, the United States and its partners convened a conference in Doha, Qatar, bringing together representatives from more than two dozen countries to discuss key aspects of the ISF, including leadership, rules of engagement, and operational structure.
The meeting, however, failed to produce a mandate that would satisfy both Israel and potential troop contributors.
The lack of consensus highlighted the challenge Washington faces in moving from a diplomatic framework to an actionable plan.
Turkish officials, for example, reiterated their readiness to participate, despite Israel’s objection to their participation.
On Friday, Washington hosted senior officials from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye in Miami to advance discussions on the second phase of the ceasefire.
The talks, led by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, aimed to bridge gaps rather than finalise agreements. Israel and Hamas were not directly represented.
The second phase envisions three intertwined steps: the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the establishment of an interim governing authority, and deployment of the proposed ISF to maintain order.
Officials described the discussions as constructive but acknowledged slow progress.
The talks occurred amid continued hostilities. An Israeli strike on a shelter in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood killed at least six Palestinians and wounded several others.
Diplomats have warned that deploying an international force without a clearly defined mandate could place troops directly in harm’s way.
‘Mandate first, commitments later’
In his remarks during a press briefing on Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasised that defining the mandate is a prerequisite for troop contributions.
Key questions remain unresolved, including the force’s legal authority, command structure, funding, rules of engagement, and duration.
“We owe countries more answers before we can ask them to firmly commit,” Rubio said, noting that several states have expressed willingness to consider participation, but no formal commitments should be expected at this stage.
Rubio specifically mentioned Pakistan, noting that Islamabad had offered to be considered for participation but had not formally committed.
He described Washington as “very grateful to Pakistan for their offer to be a part of it, or at least their offer to consider being a part of it,” while stressing that clarity on mandate and operational details is needed before any troop contribution.
Pakistan, Rubio added, could be a key partner if a mandate is finalised and concerns expressed by Muslim nations are addressed.
Rubio also outlined plans for a “Board of Peace” and a Palestinian technocratic committee to oversee day-to-day governance.
“I think the next step here is announcing the Board of Peace, announcing the Palestinian technocratic group that will help provide daily governance.  And then once that’s in place, I think that will allow us to firm up the stabilisation force, including how it’s going to be paid for, what the rules of engagement are, what their role will be in demilitarization and so forth,” he said.
US officials view these interim bodies as essential to providing a political framework that legitimises the ISF.
Without such structures, foreign troops risk operating in a political vacuum, caught between competing claims of authority.
Disarmament — the main sticking point
Disarmament of Hamas remains highly contentious. Bassem Naim, a Hamas official, insisted that talks must compel Israel to end truce violations and allow increased humanitarian aid.
Earlier this week, Hamas chief Khalil al-Hayya said that the group had a “legitimate right” to hold weapons and that any proposal for the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire must uphold that right.
Hamas has resisted full disarmament, arguing such steps cannot precede a credible political settlement.
Israel, meanwhile, demands assurances that Gaza will not again become a Hamas stronghold.
Rubio indicated that Washington aims to dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities while leaving room for further negotiation.
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. While the famine has officially been declared to have been averted, UN agencies warn that the population remains at serious risk.
Diplomatic tensions are compounded by the US House’s vote to sanction the International Criminal Court over its war crimes investigation — a move welcomed by Israel but criticised by human rights groups and several Muslim nations.
A long, uncertain road
Rubio estimated that full implementation of the second phase of the Gaza peace plan could take two to three years.
So far, the ISF remains largely conceptual rather than deployable.
What the Doha and Miami talks, along with Rubio’s statements, reveal is a broader reality: phase two is as much a political transition as a security arrangement, and no country — including Pakistan — is likely to commit troops until the ISF’s mandate, authority, and political framework are clearly defined.

He expressed these views in the inaugural address at the two-day national conference titled “Protection of the Consensus Constitution: The Need of the Hour and a Way Forward through Collective Wisdom”, organised by TTAP - an alliance of opposition parties.
The opposition alliance had announced the national conference after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
“The current situation in the country is such that the Constitution and the law have been torn to shreds, and raising one’s voice against it is the responsibility of every conscious citizen,” Achakzai said.
The veteran politician said that until now, they had remained under the illusion that at some stage constitutional supremacy would be established in the country, but that these hopes were now fading.
He stressed that all political forces must rise above temporary party interests, power-sharing considerations, and political affiliations, and think seriously about formulating a consensus course of action.
Achakzai said, “It has now become inevitable to raise a fundamental question: Is this country meant for the military, or is the military meant for the country? If the military is subordinate to the country, then what is the justification for constitutional exemptions?”
Speaking about negotiations with the government, he said it must be clear who the talks would be held with, on what points, and under what conditions.
“The first prerequisite for paving the way for negotiations is the immediate lifting of restrictions on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan by his family members, lawyers, and political leaders.”
“On the one hand, meetings with Imran Khan are being restricted despite court orders, while on the other hand, those who go to meet him carrying court orders are subjected to state violence and cases are registered against them—an outright injustice,” he said.







He further said that no army can fight a war or achieve real victory without the support of its people. He appealed to all political parties, civil society, and various schools of thought to step forward, raise their voices, and offer suggestions so that the country can be taken out of this dead end.
‘Marshal law has been imposed’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, speaking on the occasion, claimed that a “martial law has been imposed in the country”.
“When courts can’t do justice, judges can’t protect themselves in court, and civilians can’t protect themselves before judges in open court, the judiciary becomes irrelevant,” he said.







Gohar questioned how judges could maintain the “supremacy of law and the Constitution” if they could not protect themselves.
Referring to today’s judgment, in which PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were sentenced to 17 years in prison, Gohar said the “entire Pakistan is sad.”
“We were thinking maybe the convictions would end after May 2025, and we would walk towards justice. We tolerated everything and didn’t resort to disruption. We didn’t stage sit-ins. We didn’t take the law into our own hands. We kept hope alive that our leader would be released [from jail] and we would move forward, and the paths would open.“
“The path will open for the Constitution, law and order, and democracy. But every day, decisions are issued that are above the law and the Constitution, and they spread despair among the masses.”
Speaking about the convictions of PTI leaders, Gohar said, “Our leadership was convicted yesterday… They have been sentenced to around 70 years in total. Today, another decision is yet to come. It is expected that the leadership will be sentenced to 10 years. Another case will be taken up against them on Monday, in which the judge has said, ‘He will issue the verdict.’”
“The leadership’s sentence will be 70 years in total, while Bushra Bibi and Khan’s sentences will total 60 years. Seven cases against the PTI leadership are pending. If they are sentenced to 10 years in each of them, their total sentence will reach 140 years.”
“Till when will these sentences be issued? Every day, we hope that we will walk towards a path where the masses will get justice. Judges are no longer safe. Judges of civil courts, district courts, high courts, and the Supreme Court are not safe,” he said.
“Khan and Bushra were sentenced in a case in which all gifts were declared.”
“One of the items from the Toshakhana was again presented, and a trial was conducted in which Khan was sentenced. This is the first time in the history of the country that a person has been convicted multiple times in one case.”
“This is beyond the law and the Constitution,” he said, adding that it is visible even to a law student that “decisions are coming from somewhere else”.
“We were expecting 2026 to be a new year, a new hope, with a new path, but unfortunately, some people were barring the way for the masses. I appeal to them not to bar the way for the masses. When leaders don’t do that, the masses will find the way on their own,” he said.
On the first day of the conference, various political leaders participated, including the PTI chairman, Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Asad Qaiser, BNP chief Akhtar Mengal, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Javed Hashmi, Mohsin Dawar, Afrasiab Khattak, Safdar Abbasi, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Senator Mushtaq Ahmed, Syed Zain Shah, as well as journalists, lawyers, and other representatives of civil society.</p><small>2025-12-20 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20123707b577773.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962243/clear-torture-tactics-imrans-sons-say-incarcerated-pti-founder-being-kept-in-isolation-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>‘Clear torture tactics’: Imran’s sons say incarcerated PTI founder being kept in isolation in jail</strong></a><br><p>The sons of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, Kasim and Sulaiman, have stated that their father is being kept in isolation in jail, stating that these were “clear torture tactics”.
The two made the remarks in an interview with British journalist Mehdi Hasan, a four-minute preview of which is available to the public on Zeteo’s website. The full interview is behind a pay wall.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
In the interview with Hasan, Kasim and Sulaiman, were asked about the government’s claims of treating Imran like a “prince” during his incarceration.
“Couldn’t be less true,” replied Kasim. He said that Imran was being held in a cell that was six feet by eight inches, “barely enough to stand”.
“The conditions are awful. He is washing himself in brown, murky water. And the food he has is — he is not the one to complain — but it’s apparently dreadful. To be a prince is far from it,” he said.
Kasim also recalled Imran’s recent meeting with his sister Uzma, saying the former premier was “pretty furious from what we have heard.”
“He was just unhappy with the … complete isolation. They’re not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person just to try and break him,” he said.
“So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.

During the interview, Hassan also asked the two about the last time they were able to speak to their father.
In response, Sulaiman said he last spoke to Imran “at the end of July”.
“The court in Pakistan mandates that we have weekly calls but that’s just never been followed throughout his time in prison, which is over two years now,“ he said.
“I spoke to him for about six minutes last, around September,” Kasim said.
Sulaiman said that the last time they had met Imran was in November 2022, following an assassination attempt on the PTI founder’s life. “We went there for a week I think,” he said.
In a separate clip posted on Zeteo’s Instagram account, the journalist asked the two if they were worried by Imran’s “statements” against the Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Hasan then read out the statements posted from Imran’s X account.
“It does but that is his character,” Sulaiman said.
“Do you ever tell him to tone it down?” Hasan asked.
At this, Kasim laughed and said: “No, he goes headfirst into danger historically, and we kind of accepted it at a young age that he was going to go into very dangerous situations.”
Sulaiman recalled that when he was young, he feared for his father’s life, but added that he eventually got “used to it”.
Kasim noted that his father was a “man of faith”, adding that he always maintained that God would protect him.

Meanwhile, Mosharraf Zaidi, who is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, in response to the interview, dismissed the claims made by Imran’s sons on his alleged “isolation”.
“He does not spend any time at all in a ‘cell’. As a prisoner whose security and well-being [are] a priority for the state, he has designated living quarters,” Zaidi said in comments to Zeteo.
“He has his own gym facilities, his own outdoors lawn, his own space for walking and his own space for books and reading,” he added, adding that no other prisoner enjoyed the “space and leeway” Imran had.
He claimed that Imran’s children and supporters were being “misled by disinformation”.
“He spends at least six hours a day outside the area where he sleeps. He has a cook exclusively assigned to him, and a medical officer in the prison checks every meal he eats,” Zaidi said.
Speaking about Imran’s sons visiting Pakistan, Zaidi said that his children “will be treated with the rights and privileges due to all visitors to Pakistan —as per their status under the law [….] We hope the children have a chance to meet their father — but it is almost certain that the father and his political workers will try to exploit any visit by the children as a political event.”
“In that scenario, the local authorities will take whatever measures they need to take to disperse crowds and to ensure that political activity does not create the space for lawlessness and disorder,” Zeteo quoted him as saying.
Earlier this week, in an interview with Sky News, the brothers shared they had applied for their visas and were planning a trip to Pakistan in January. During the interview, they also commented on the conditions in which the ex-premier was kept and saying that he was being held in a “death cell”.
In July, they met with United States President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell in relation to their father’s release.
‘Don’t play the sympathy card’
Separately, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, while speaking to the media in Faisalabad on Saturday, dismissed the allegation that the former premier was being kept in isolation, warning his family and the party not to play the “sympathy card”.
“How could he (Imran) be alone in a jail that has 1,200 inmates?” the minister asked, saying that Imran had access to gym equipment, a personal cook, among other facilities.

         View this post on Instagram            

“The whole area is operated as per his will,” he said. The minister said that Imran’s communication with his sons included phone calls “totalling over 14 hours”.
Addressing the matter of their visa, the minister recalled Imran‘s sister Aleema’s claim that the ex-premier’s children were being denied a visa, adding that he had asked her to share their tracking number.
“Till today, I have not received tracking numbers … we are very clear that anyone who wants to come to Pakistan, we will issue them visas within a few hours,” he said.
He noted that for over two years now, Imran‘s sons “had not renewed their National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP), and they have not applied for visas as per our records“.
“If they have, give us the tracking number, and I assure you that they can come to Pakistan,“ the minister said.
“He is their father; they can come and stand with him and meet him,” the minister said. However, he warned them against “playing the sympathy card”.
“Do not try to gain sympathy by saying that the kids are being kept away from their father,” the minister said.
“I assure you, apply for a visa, and we will issue it immediately,” the minister reiterated.</p><small>2025-12-20 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20162018510af40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252/bangladesh-holds-state-funeral-for-slain-youth-leader-amid-tight-security' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh holds state funeral for slain youth leader amid tight security</strong></a><br><p>Tens of thousands of Bangladeshi mourners, including the country’s interim government leader, attended the funeral on Saturday of a slain youth leader and election candidate amid tight security.
Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died on Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support.
His death has prompted a wave of unrest in the South Asian nation that included coordinated mob attacks on major newspapers and cultural institutions.

 

Police and paramilitary forces were deployed across the capital for Saturday’s funeral, but there were no reports of any renewed violence.

Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said Hadi’s legacy would endure, describing the funeral as a collective pledge to uphold the ideals he had championed.
“Today, we have come to promise you (Hadi) that we will fulfil what you stood for,” Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the mourners, who included Bangladesh’s army chief and representatives from across the political spectrum.
In a rare and symbolic honour, Hadi was laid to rest on the Dhaka University campus beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.

Bangladeshis hope election will end years of instability
Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 — a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story.
But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups, including Islamist hardliners, have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024.
It has also exposed the limitations of Yunus’ interim government, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world’s largest apparel producer after China.
The government has declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi and has urged citizens to resist “mob violence by fringe elements”, warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition.
Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina’s ouster.
The rights group also condemned the attacks on the media as an assault on free expression.
Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups say continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election.
Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi’s killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists.
Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation.
The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster.
Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.</p><small>2025-12-20 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20123754d5e7d8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962242/finance-ministry-says-provincial-shares-under-nfc-released-fortnightly-no-outstanding-liabilities-exist-after-kp-cms-accusation-of-stalled-funds' target='_blank'><strong>Finance ministry says provincial shares under NFC released fortnightly, no outstanding liabilities exist after KP CM’s accusation of stalled funds</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Finance said on Saturday that the federal government released provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) on a fortnightly basis, adding that “no outstanding liabilities exist in this regard”.
The statement from the ministry came a day after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi accused the federal government of stalling development in the merged tribal districts by not disbursing funds under the NFC resource-distribution formula for the current fiscal year.
In the statement released on Saturday, the ministry reaffirmed the federal government’s “continued commitment to ensuring timely, transparent, and sustained financial transfers” to KP under the NFC Award and beyond.
It said that under the 7th NFC Award, KP’s share was determined at 14.62 per cent of the provincial share in the divisible pool.







“In recognition of the extraordinary burden borne by the province during the war on terror, an additional one per cent of the undivided divisible pool was allocated exclusively to KP,” it said.
It further added that although the 7th NFC Award was originally envisaged for a five-year period, the absence of consensus on subsequent NFC Awards (8th, 9th, and 10th) necessitated the continued implementation of the 7th NFC Award framework.
“Accordingly, KP continues to receive its due share, including the additional allocation for the war on terror,” the ministry said.
“The federal government releases provincial NFC shares on a fortnightly basis, and no outstanding liabilities exist in this regard,” it said.
It highlighted that Rs46.44 billion had been released to the KP government on December 17, “underscoring the federal government’s adherence to timely disbursement commitments”.
The ministry also noted that from July 2010 to November 2025, Rs5.867 trillion had been transferred to the province as its share of the divisible pool. During this period, Rs705bn had been provided to the province on account of the war on terror, “reflecting federal recognition of the province’s sacrifices and responsibilities”, it added.
It further said that the Centre had also ensured the uninterrupted flow of straight transfers to KP.
“From July 2010 to November 2025, an amount of Rs482.78bn has been transferred on account of royalties on oil and natural gas, gas development surcharge, excise duty on natural gas, and other related heads,” the ministry said.
It noted that in recognition of the province’s “unique fiscal and administrative challenges”, the Centre had also extended “substantial financial support beyond the NFC framework”.
It said that following the merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), the Centre had been financing the expenditures of the newly merged districts from its own NFC share; it said Rs704bn had been transferred since 2019 in this regard.
Further, the ministry said that an additional Rs117bn had been provided to the province “over the years” to support internally displaced persons.
“Despite constitutional devolution, the federal government continues to invest in provincial welfare and development,” it asserted. The ministry said that Rs115bn had been allocated to KP over the past 15 years from the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for “projects of a provincial nature”.
“Through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), an amount of Rs. 481.433bn has been spent in KP from FY2016 to FY2025 on unconditional and conditional cash transfers, providing critical social protection to vulnerable households,” it said.
The ministry said that the Centre was committed to strengthening the NFC framework through inclusive consultation. It said that during the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC, held on Dec 4, it was decided to constitute a dedicated sub-group to make recommendations on the merger of former Fata and their share in the divisible pool.
“At the request of the government of KP, the first meeting of this sub-group is scheduled for December 23, 2025, with the finance minister, KP serving as the designated convener, demonstrating a collaborative and transparent approach toward resolving outstanding fiscal matters,” it said.
The Ministry of Finance reiterated that the Centre remained fully committed to “equitable resource distribution, fiscal federalism, and sustained support for KP, ensuring that provincial needs, particularly those arising from security challenges, displacement, and administrative integration, are addressed in a timely and responsible manner”.</p><small>2025-12-20 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20141817fc1134e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962251/7-elephants-killed-by-train-accident-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>7 elephants killed by train accident in India</strong></a><br><p>A passenger train smashed into a herd of elephants in India’s northeast, killing seven animals on the spot, officials said Saturday.
No travellers were injured in the accident in Assam state, home to more than 4,000 of the roughly 22,000 wild elephants in India.
Senior Assam police official V.V. Rakesh Reddy told AFP that seven jumbos were killed, and one elephant sustained an injury.
Five coaches of the train, which was headed to New Delhi from remote Mizoram state, were derailed.

 

Authorities have introduced speed restrictions along routes designated elephant corridors, but the latest accident occurred outside of these zones, Kapinjal Kishore Sharma, an Indian Railways spokesman said.
“The loco pilot, on observing the herd of elephants, applied emergency brakes. However, elephants dashed with the train,” he said.
Deforestation and construction activity near their habitats force elephants to stray further afield for food, often bringing them into conflict with humans.

Chasing a world record 435 runs to win, England were reduced to 207 for six at stumps, still 228 runs short of victory and having played no small part in their predicament through batting misadventure.
Jamie Smith, on two, and Will Jacks, on 11, were left to try to salvage something from the wreckage of another demolition day for the tourists.
With holders Australia 2-0 up in the five-test series after eight-wicket wins in Perth and Brisbane, they need only draw the match to retain the urn.

But there is little prospect of a rousing comeback win from an England squad that have failed to live up to expectations.
“Obviously very disappointing. Uphill battle from here,” England opener Zak Crawley told reporters.
“We came here to win the Ashes and we’re staring down the barrel now …. It’s been tough, they’re a very, very good side…. Obviously we’ve been slightly short of our best but credit to them.”
Questions have been asked of England’s preparations, selections and batting approach, and there were plenty more teachable moments from Saturday’s play at Adelaide Oval.
Their batters seemed determined to squander the rare periods when they could reasonably be judged to be on top of the Australian attack.
They needed at least one, and preferably two, to stand up like Travis Head who put on 170, nearly half Australia’s second-innings total of 349, to effectively bat England out of the game.
Instead, they were prey for Australia skipper Cummins, who took three top-order wickets andextracted gold from a still-firm pitch that proved unyielding, initially, for others.
In his first test since July, coming off a back injury, Cummins became the second test captain to take 150 wickets, joining Pakistan’s Imran Khan (187).
Keeping the champagne on ice
England’s Ben Duckett was first to go, taking a half-hearted push at a nagging ball and sending an edge flying chest-high to Marnus Labuschagne in the slips.
The shot was neither Bazball aggression nor stout defence, something meekly in between.
Number three Ollie Pope fell for 17 in a similar vein, nicking off to the slips with a more hard-handed prod and watching in disbelief as Labuschagne dived forward to take a one-hander just above the grass.
Labuschagne raced around the wicket in open-mouthed celebration, and England were 31 for two.
Another collapse beckoned but Crawley (85) and Joe Root (39) dug in until just after tea.
Root was lucky not to be dismissed lbw when he failed to play a shot at the part-time spin of Head, only to be caught-behind off Cummins moments later, playing at a ball he should have left.
It was Cummins’ 13th dismissal of England’s master batter, the most by any bowler.
Root slapped his bat in frustration but his was a misdemeanour compared to the batting crime committed by Harry Brook, who was bowled for 30 by Nathan Lyon with a botched reverse sweep.
Lyon followed up by bowling captain Ben Stokes for five with a ball that pitched, straightened and crashed into middle and off-stump.
The collapse gathered pace as Crawley lumbered forward at Lyon, misjudged the flight and was gleefully stumped by the clinical Alex Carey.
He had batted well for his 85 to that point but his wicket came as the pressure rose, leaving England needing a miracle from Jacks and Smith. Each has struggled for runs when their team has been crying out for them.
Australia will keep the champagne on ice until victory is complete.
“We want to keep working hard and probably not look too far ahead,” said Carey, who singled out Lyon for praise.
“I just thought Nathan was bowling really well and kept putting lots of energy on the ball. He toiled away all day and finally got some reward.”</p><small>2025-12-20 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20114245da6a87a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962241/world-bank-approves-700-million-for-pakistans-economic-stability' target='_blank'><strong>World Bank approves $700 million for Pakistan’s economic stability</strong></a><br><p>The World Bank has approved $700 million in financing for Pakistan under a multi-year initiative aimed at supporting the country’s macroeconomic stability and service delivery, it emerged on Saturday.
The lender said the funds will be released under the bank’s Public Resources for Inclusive Development — Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), which could provide up to $1.35 billion in total financing.
Of this amount, $600m will go for federal programmes and $100m will support a provincial programme in Sindh.
The approval follows a $47.9m World Bank grant in August to improve primary education in Punjab.
A separate statement issued by the lender quoted Bolormaa Amgaabazar, the World Bank’s country director for Pakistan, as saying, “Pakistan’s path to inclusive, sustainable growth requires mobilising more domestic resources and ensuring they are used efficiently and transparently to deliver results for people.”
She said that through the MPA, the bank was working with the federal and Sindh governments to “deliver tangible impacts—more predictable funding for schools and clinics, fairer tax systems, and stronger data for decision-making— while safeguarding priority social and climate investments and strengthening public trust”.
Tobias Akhtar Haque, World Bank lead country economist for Pakistan, said stregthening Pakistan’s fiscal foundations was “essential to restoring macroeconomic stability, delivering results and strengthening institutions”.
“Through the PRID-MPA, we are launching a coherent nationwide approach to support reforms that expand fiscal space, bolster investments in human capital and climate resilience, and strengthen revenue administration, budget execution, and statistical systems,” he said.
“These reforms will ensure that resources reach the front line and deliver better outcomes for people across Pakistan with greater efficiency and accountability,” he added.
According to the statement, the federal component will focus on raising domestic revenues more fairly, improving budget planning and execution, and strengthening data systems for evidence-based decisions.
Key actions include advancing tax policy and administration reforms; financing and scaling the Integrated Financial Management Information System and its linked e-procurement platform; undertaking targeted subsidy reforms; and strengthening the national statistical system led by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
In Sindh, the programme is expected to increase provincial revenues, enhance the speed and transparency of payments, and broaden the use of data to guide provincial decision-making, it said.
The programme will directly support the increase of public resources for inclusive development, including more equitable and responsive financing for primary healthcare facilities and more funding for schools, it added.
In November, an IMF-World Bank report, uploaded by the finance ministry, said the country’s fragmented regulation, opaque budgeting and political capture are curbing investment and weakening revenue.</p><small>2025-12-20 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/201113063d9ed62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962238/google-warns-staff-with-us-visas-against-international-travel-due-to-embassy-delays-report' target='_blank'><strong>Google warns staff with US visas against international travel due to embassy delays: report</strong></a><br><p>Alphabet’s Google has advised some employees on US visas to avoid international travel due to delays at embassies, Business Insider reported on Friday, citing an internal email.
The email, sent by the company’s outside counsel BAL Immigration Law on Thursday, warned staff who need a visa stamp to re-enter the United States not to leave the country because visa processing times have lengthened, the report said.

Some US embassies and consulates face visa appointment delays of up to 12 months, the memo said, warning that international travel will “risk an extended stay outside the US”, according to the report.
The administration of US President Donald Trump this month announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, including screening social media accounts.
The H-1B visa programme, widely used by the US technology sector to hire skilled workers from India and China, has been under the spotlight after the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee for new applications this year.
In September, Google’s parent company Alphabet had strongly advised its employees to avoid international travel and urged H-1B visa holders to remain in the US, according to an email seen by Reuters.</p><small>2025-12-20 06:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/201025582763bf9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962223/us-carries-out-large-scale-retaliatory-strikes-against-isis-in-syria' target='_blank'><strong>US carries out large-scale retaliatory strikes against ISIS in Syria</strong></a><br><p>The US military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria on Friday in retaliation for an attack on American personnel, US officials said.
A US-led coalition had already been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces.







US President Donald Trump had vowed to retaliate after a suspected ISIS attack killed US personnel last weekend in Syria.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted “ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites” and said the operation was “OPERATION HAWKEYE STRIKE”.
“This is not the beginning of a war it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegseth said. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,” he added.







Trump said on social media that the Syrian government fully supported the strikes and that the US was inflicting “very serious retaliation”.







At a speech in North Carolina on Friday night, Trump called it a “massive” blow against the ISIS members that the US blames for the Dec 13 attack on coalition forces.
“We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria. It was very successful,” Trump said at a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
US Central Command said the strikes hit more than 70 targets across central Syria, adding that Jordanian fighter jets supported the operation.
One US official said the strikes were carried out by US F-15 and A-10 jets, along with Apache helicopters and HIMARS rocket systems.
Syria reiterated its steadfast commitment to fighting Islamic State and ensuring that it has “no safe havens on Syrian territory,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry.
Two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military.
Three other US soldiers were also wounded in the attack.
About 1,000 US troops remain in Syria.
The Syrian Interior Ministry has described the attacker as a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with Islamic State.
Syria’s government is now led by former rebels who toppled leader Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war, and includes members of Syria’s former Al Qaeda branch who broke with the group and clashed with Islamic State.
Syria has been cooperating with a US-led coalition against Islamic State, reaching an agreement last month when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House.</p><small>2025-12-20 05:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20094021f7264c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962236/ppps-sherry-rehman-says-minister-must-apologise-after-heated-exchange-with-palwasha-khan-during-senate-panel' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Sherry Rehman says minister must apologise after heated exchange with Palwasha Khan during Senate panel</strong></a><br><p>PPP leader Sherry Rehman has said that Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan must apologise following his heated exchange with Senator Palwasha Khan during a Senate panel meeting on Friday.
Pal­washa, who is also a PPP leader, and the federal minister had traded sharp remarks on Friday over the construction of a road allegedly benefiting a private housing society during a meeting of the Senate Stan­ding Committee on Com­mu­ni­cations.

         View this post on Instagram            

In a post on the social media platform X late on Friday night, Rehman said, “What happened today in a Senate standing committee can neither become normalised nor considered acceptable. No federal minister should speak the way Aleem Khan did with Senator Palwasha in a communications committee meeting.”
Rehman further said that it was Senator Palwasha’s “absolute responsibility and right to ask questions” and to hold the government accountable.
“He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said.







The confrontation between the minister and Senator Palwasha had begun when the latter questioned whether public funds had been used to build a road primarily serving a private housing scheme in Lahore.
Responding angrily, the minister warned that personal attacks would be met in kind. “If you make personal attacks, you will face the same behaviour,” he said, adding that while the government was willing to clarify its position, it would not lower itself to the level he felt the senator had adopted.
However, she maintained it was her right as a parliamentarian to question the use of taxpayers’ money and reiterated that she had merely sought clarification on whether the road had been constructed to benefit a private housing society. The exchange escalated further when the minister accused committee members of being “blackmailers and dishonest”, prom­pting strong objections.
Senator Pal­wa­sha said she had been humiliated by the minister’s remarks and announced she would raise the matter with her party’s top leadership. Following the intervention of the committee chairman, Senator Pervaiz Rashid, the minister tendered an apology. But Senator Palwasha declined to accept it.
Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?”
Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet”.</p><small>2025-12-20 05:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20075837f0da92a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962197/two-passenger-trains-escape-bomb-blasts-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Two passenger trains escape bomb blasts in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Two passenger trains narrowly escaped bomb blasts on the main railway track linking Balochistan with the other three provinces, officials said on Friday. 
According to officials, unknown armed men planted an explosive device on the main rail track between Sibi and Mushkaf area of Bolan Pass and detonated it. Another incident of blasting a railway track took place in the Dasht area of Mastung district. 
“The targets were the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail,” police officials said, adding that railway operations were disrupted due to the blasts at two locations. 
After receiving information about the explosions, the two trains, which had already departed for their destinations, were stopped at different stations as a precautionary measure. Railway officials said the tracks were damaged in the explosions, adding that after security clearance, engineers and other concerned staff repaired both damaged sections. 
“Both passenger trains were allowed to proceed to their destinations after the repair work,” the officials said, adding that the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail would leave for Peshawar and Karachi, respectively, on Saturday.
Militants have made several attempts to blow up the Jaffar Express over the past two months and have succeeded twice, targeting the train in the Dasht area of Mastung district and in the Shikarpur area of Sindh.

ISLAMABAD: The recent Sup­reme Court verdict, commuting a rape conviction to a charge of fornication, has sparked considerable controversy, with the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) sharply criticising the judgement, and one judge on the bench dissenting from the majority ruling.
The NCSW noted with concern that the prosecution’s findings — including investigative evidence and judicial conclusions reached by the trial court and the Lahore High Court (LHC) — were effectively disregarded, resulting in the accused being discharged from the offence of rape.
“Such an outcome raises critical questions regarding the adjudication of sexual violence cases and the application of legal standards relating to consent,” the commission regretted.
The NCSW also highlighted that consent could not be inferred from silence, delayed reporting, or the absence of physical resistance.
“Judicial interpretation must remain informed by the complex realities of trauma, fear, coercion, and power asymmetries that frequently underpin sexual violence,” it added.
The NCSW urged the judiciary and all relevant state institutions to ensure that adjudication in cases of sexual violence was firmly grounded in constitutional guarantees of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination, as well as Pakistan’s obligations under international human rights law. “Gender-responsive interpretation of law and survivor-centred judicial reasoning are imperative to prevent re-victimisation and carrying of justice,” the statement said.
In this context, the NCSW also reiterated the need for systemic institutional strengthening, which should include increasing the number of gender-based violence (GBV) courts, enhancing technical capacity and specialisation of GBV court staff, appointment of permanent judges along with conducting large-scale sensitisation trainings for justice sector stakeholders.

 

Particular emphasis must also be placed on first responders, especially the police, to ensure survivor-sensitive handling of complaints from the outset, the statement read.
Majority verdict
In a six-page judgement issued earlier this month, the top court comm­uted the sentence of a convict from 20 years of imprisonment to five after reclassifying the offense from rape to a consensual extramarital affair.
Justices Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, who delivered the majority verdict, relied on two factors: a seven-month delay in the complainant registering a rape case and the absence of “healed marks of violence on the entire body of the alleged victim”.
The court modified the impugned judgement by setting aside the petitioner’s conviction and sentence under Section 376 PPC, acquitting him of rape, and instead convicting him under Section 496-B PPC for fornication. The court was hearing an appeal filed by Hassan Khan against the Dec 18, 2018 judgement of the LHC, which had dismissed his plea.
Dissenting note
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar, the third member of the bench, dissented and voted to dismiss the petition by refusing leave to appeal.
In his dissenting note, the judge wrote that rape and sexual harassment cases often went unreported in our society as the victims feared the consequences of reporting.
“The victim often has to justify to [their] own family members about their character at the time when [they] report … such an incident,” he added.
“In the case at hand, the victim is of young age, unmarried, her parents have passed away, she has an elder brother and record also shows evidence of threats forwarded to the victim,” the dissenting note read.
It added that it clearly made sense as to “how reluctant a girl would be in these circumstances to share such an unfortunate occurrence with her own brother”.
Justice Panwhar observed that de­­lays in reporting sexual assaults to po­­lice were not fatal to the prosecution.
Defending the absence of healed marks of violence on victim’s body, the dissenting note stated the accused was carrying a weapon. “Any victim would be reluctant to resist such a perpetrator with a weapon in hand.”
The judge observed that a rape victim should not be penalised on “account of ostensible delay in reporting what she has undergone”.
“On the contrary, kindness, encouragement, and understanding are the requirements to approbate a victim’s difficult decision to purge the society of perpetrators of such heinous offences,” he added in his dissenting note.
Chaudhry Abdul Aziz, a former LHC judge, remarked that apparen­tly the majority judgement had tak­en “a very cautious view” by commuting the sentence of rape into fornication.
A good judge had to be very skeptical while deciding cases of rape, he said, adding: “The majority verdict seems to have tried to maintain a balance”.

LAHORE: In another case linked to the May 9 riots, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday acquitted former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while awarding 10-year prison sentences to senior PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict inside Kot Lakhpat Jail after concluding the trial of the accused in FIR No 852/2023, which relates to an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk. The case had been registered by the Race Course police, who later submitted a challan against 25 accused persons, including PTI leaders and party workers.

 

In the same case, the court also handed down 10-year imprisonment sentences to PTI workers Qasim Elahi, Muhammad Shehbaz, Mushtaq and Abdullah. However, the judge acquitted 12 other accused due to a lack of sufficient evidence against them.
This marks the fifth case in Lahore in which Mr Qureshi has been acquitted, while Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted. The majority of those convicted were charged with participating in the attack while armed with clubs, pelting stones and chanting slogans.
Previously, verdicts have alre­ady been announced in several other cases arising from the May 9 unrest, including trials related to the attack on Shadman police station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, and the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squ­ad vehicle near Jinnah House.
Barrister Taimur Malik, counsel for Shah Mahmood Qureshi, stated that despite the acquittal, the PTI vice chairman would not be released from Kot Lakhpat Jail as his bail pleas in three other cases are still pending. He expressed hope that bail in those cases would be granted sooner rather than later, instead of Mr Qureshi having to wait for the completion of the trials.
“We have now obtained his bail or acquittals in around 50 cases across Punjab and Islamabad over the last three years,” the counsel added.
The May 9 riots erupted following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan by the National Accountability Bureau from the premises of the Islamabad High Court. Subsequently, PTI leaders and workers launched protests across the country, during which military installations and public property were attacked.
Joint letter
Separately, five senior PTI leaders currently incarcerated at Kot Lakhpat jail issued a joint letter through their lawyer, stating that dialogue is the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises.
The letter, signed by Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed, stated that the party’s central leadership firmly believes that dialogue at all levels is the sole workable solution to the prevailing situation.
The incarcerated leaders said that Pakistan has been grappling with severe political, economic and social crises for the past three years and eight months, and that it is the responsibility of every patriot to think in the national interest and pursue objectives through peaceful and constitutional means.
According to the PTI leaders, negotiations alone can help pull the country out of the current turmoil. The letter further stated that the PTI founder has asked the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan to engage in consultations with national political parties in order to chart a way forward.
It added that broad-based consultation opens the door to meaningful dialogue. The imprisoned leaders also expressed hope that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas would provide guidance to the nation during this critical period.

Four security forces personnel were martyred when an attempt by terrorists to attack a security forces camp was foiled in the area of Boya in North Waziristan district.
In a statement, the FO said that Pakistan condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms and identified the attackers as members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, a group under the TTP umbrella.







“To convey our strong demarche, the Afghan deputy head of mission was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the statement read.
“The ministry conveyed Pakistan’s grave concern over the continued support and facilitation provided by the Afghan Taliban regime to the FAK/TTP, enabling them to carry out terrorist attacks against [the] Pakistan Military and the civilian population along the Pak-Afghan border and in adjoining areas,” it added.
The FO emphasised that the permissive environment enjoyed by the Fitna-al-Khawarij in Afghanistan contradicts Kabul’s commitments to Pakistan and the international community.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Pakistan has demanded a full investigation and decisive action against the perpetrators and facilitators of the terrorist attacks launched against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” the statement said.
Islamabad also asked Kabul to take “immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership and deny the continued use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”.
The FO warned the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserves the right to defend its sovereignty and protect its citizens, and will take all necessary measures to respond to terrorism originating from Afghan soil”.
Pak-Afghan relations
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
The Foreign Office also said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
On December 1, Saudi Arabia quietly facilitated a round of direct talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at easing tensions over cross-border terrorism, but the discussions wrapped up without any breakthrough.
A recent United Nations Security Council report rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity.
The assessment, contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, was submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.
“The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.</p><small>2025-12-20 02:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19233121c013cfd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962059/us-very-grateful-for-pakistans-offer-to-be-part-of-gaza-stabilisation-force-marco-rubio' target='_blank'><strong>US ‘very grateful’ for Pakistan’s offer to be part of Gaza stabilisation force: Marco Rubio</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday disclosed that Pakistan had accepted inclusion in the proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza, while stopping short of confirming a firm troop commitment.
Last Tuesday, Pakistan attended a conference in Qatar, which was hosted by US Central Command, to discuss the ISF’s command structure and other unresolved operational issues. Pakistan was among nearly 45 countries attending the meeting.
Responding to a question on whether Washington had received Pakistan’s consent to deploy troops for peacebuilding in Gaza, Rubio said the United States was “very grateful to Pakistan for their offer to be a part of it, or at least their offer to consider being a part of it,” adding that further clarity was still required before any country could be asked to formally commit.







“I feel very confident that we have a number of nation-states acceptable to all sides of this who are willing to step forward and be a part of that stabilisation force and certainly, Pakistan is key, if they agree to do so,” he added.
Rubio noted that key issues related to the force’s mandate, command structure, and funding arrangements were still under discussion.
“I think the next step here is announcing the Board of Peace [and] the Palestinian technocratic group that will help provide daily governance,” the secretary added.
“Once that‘s in place, I think that will allow us to firm up the stabilisation force, including how it’s going to be paid for, what their rules of engagement are, what their role will be in demilitarisation and so forth.”



The US State Department has formally approached more than 70 countries seeking troops or funding for the proposed force. Some 19 countries have reportedly so far indicated willingness to assist through troops, logistics, or equipment, with international deployment in Gaza potentially beginning as early as next month.
Diplomatic sources also told Dawn that Pakistan was considering deploying 3,500 troops as part of the ISF.
Rubio’s remarks come a day after Pakistan articulated its official position. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Andrabi, said Islamabad had not yet decided on contributing troops to the ISF, indicating that discussions were still at an exploratory stage rather than reflecting a final commitment.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught.
In September, US President Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan, which laid the foundation for the peace agreement signed in October by Israel and Hamas.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement was the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
In November, the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the conflict in Gaza, which also authorises the deployment of the ISF to the Palestinian enclave.
Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained. However, Hamas rejected the resolution and also decried the establishment of an international force whose “mission includes the disarmament” of Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza.
International troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as next month to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force, two US officials told Reuters, but it remains unclear how Palestinian Hamas fighters will be disarmed.</p><small>2025-12-20 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20072459d469b8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962208/partial-strike-as-lawyers-divided-over-ihc-judges-removal' target='_blank'><strong>Partial strike as lawyers divided over IHC judge’s removal</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A visible split among lawyers in the federal capital on Friday resulted in only a partial strike, as a small group of lawyers observed the call issued by the Islamabad District Bar Association (DBA) to protest the removal of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) played down the verdict that led to his ouster.
Justice Jahangiri was removed from office thro­ugh a short order passed by an Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The bench ruled that his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority” and that he had “ceased to hold” the office with immediate effect.

 

The short order was announced at around 3:30pm. However, sources said Justice Jahangiri had left his chamber for his residence approximately half an hour earlier, adding that he may have been informed of the decision before its formal announ­cement. An official of his court told Dawn that the judge personally met and embraced each staff member before leaving, telling them: “We will meet again if God so wills.”
Following the verdict, DBA President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar announced a strike to protest the decision. The IHCBA, however, chose not to issue any such call.
IHCBA Secretary Chaudhry Manzoor Jajja told Dawn that the verdict was “like one of the many decisions the IHC passes every day” and said there was no justification for a strike. He added that IHC judges — including Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Jahangiri himself — had previously opposed strikes over what he described as peripheral issues.
As a result of this division within the legal fraternity, the strike had only a limited impact. While routine attendance was reported at the Supreme Court, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and the Islamabad High Court, only a small number of lawyers boycotted proceedings at the sessions courts. A senior sessions court official estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of lawyers abstained from hearings in solidarity with the ousted judge.
Meanwhile, the IHC administration issued a duty roster for the coming week that did not include Justice Jahangiri’s name. Hearings in cases fixed before his bench were cancelled, and the administration is expected to redistribute his caseload among other available judges. Even before the formal de-notification, Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website.
Late on Thursday night, the Presidency confirmed that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC order. The move followed a direction in the short written order instructing the law ministry to de-notify him. The ministry forwarded a summary through the Prime Minister’s Office, which was subsequently approved by the president.







The controversy originated from a letter that surfaced on social media last year, purportedly issued by the University of Karachi (KU). During the proceedings, KU Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted records stating that the university syndicate had cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, alleging that it had been obtained through “unfair means”. He claimed the judge had been found cheating and creating a disturbance in an examination hall in 1988 and was debarred until 1992, but had allegedly appeared in an examination in 1989 under a changed name.
Justice Jahangiri’s counsel, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, argued that a sitting judge could only be removed through the procedure prescribed under Article 209 of the Constitution, which requires proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). However, amicus curiae Barrister Zafarullah Khan contended that where a judge’s eligibility or qualification was in question, the SJC process was not applicable, citing past judicial precedents.
The bench observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge was personal to the individual and independent of judicial performance. It noted that sufficient opportunity had been provided to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply and credentials, but he failed to do so.

ISLAMABAD: In a major policy reversal amid a slight improvement in fiscal stability, the government on Friday withdrew a ban on double benefits of pension and salary for re-employed civil, judicial and military bureaucrats, introduced earlier this year and touted as a major pension reform.
The Ministry of Finance silently issued a terse notification stating that two earlier relevant orders, dated April 22 and June 19, 2025, on the subject, “are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect”.
The bureaucracy had earlier restored its perks and privileges on account of board memberships in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) ab initio, and secured executive allowances and transport monetisation allowances exceeding Rs300,000 per month on top of salaries, allowances, and other ancillary benefits.
Under the April 22, 2025, order, the government formally notified that public servants would have to choose between the new salary and pension upon rejoining the public service on a contract or regular basis after retirement.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” the notification had stated.
The policy was amended on June 19 amid pressure from powerful bureaucrats, who argued that those opting to draw a salary “may face difficulties” in restoring their pensions once re-employment ended. The revised order allowed pensioners to continue receiving a pension during re-employment, provided their salary was reduced by an amount equivalent to the gross pension.
However, the pressure kept on mounting, leading to the withdrawal of both earlier notifications. This restores the old lucrative scheme under which re-hired government employees used to receive the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously, and, in some cases, multiple pensions.
This not only had an additional financial burden on the exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
This was part of the pension reforms the government had taken in hand to contain ever-rising pension liabilities under the IMF loan programme.
The measure allowing only salary or pension was initially announced by the then finance minister, Ishaq Dar, in the 2022-23 budget, but could not be implemented until it was reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget, before the IMF signed off on a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for personnel of the armed forces — has already been delayed by another year to 2026, despite a notification implementing it with effect from June 2025.
When contacted, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Sarwar Abbasi did not respond to a question about the forum that approved the latest reversal, as the earlier notifications had followed cabinet decisions and budget announcements in parliament.
He, however, said that “this specific change in relation to pensions had resulted in difficulties for the government in acquiring the services of experienced professionals for positions in various commissions and tribunals, etc, due to the reduced incentives”.
Also, this change applied to a very small number of individuals, and, in financial terms, the savings were negligible, he said. “It has, therefore, been decided to withdraw the change and restore the previous arrangement,” Mr Abbasi said.
On the other hand, the government has already introduced a contributory fund scheme for new entrants to the civil government and the armed forces of Pakistan.
In July, the government opened an unlimited financial avenue for senior bureaucrats through SOE board meetings while also imposing austerity measures on these enterprises.

ISLAMABAD / LAH­ORE: Reporting normalisation of Chenab River flows off late, Pakistan on Friday said it had sought an explanation from India over an “extraordinary reduction” in the river flows after what it described as the complete discharge and subsequent refilling of the Baglihar dam, in violation of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.
In a statement, the Min­istry of Water Reso­urces said the discharge of the Chenab River (mainstem) had “successfully stabilised following a significant period of volatility”.
It said Pakistan’s Commissioner for Indus Waters had taken up the matter with his Indian counterpart and sought details and data regarding the reduction in flows “under the framework of the Indus Waters Treaty”.

 

According to the ministry, hydrological records for the first half of Dece­mber 2025 showed the unusual decline persisted from Dec 10 to Dec 16. During the period, flows frequently dropped, with the lowest reading reco­rded at 870 cusecs, which was far below the historical 10-year minimum range of around 4,018 to 4,406 cusecs for those dates.
The ministry said satellite imagery was reviewed to assess the cause of the decline at Marala. It said a “significant reduction” in the surface area of Baglihar was observed in imagery dated Dec 8, which then increased in imagery from Dec 13.
“This reduction, followed by an increase in the surface area of Baglihar reservoir, leads us to believe that India has emptied the Baglihar reservoir followed by its refilling,” the ministry said.
It maintained that under the Indus Waters Treaty, India cannot empty the dead storage of reservoirs of run-of-the-river hydropower projects built on the western rivers. It said an explanation had therefore been sought through the Permanent Indus Commission.
The ministry said a “positive shift” in river hydrology began on Dec 17, when flows began to rise steadily. By 7am on Dec 17, the flow had reached 6,399 cusecs, bringing it back within the historical 10-year range for the first time since the mid-month decline.
It said data shared by the Punjab Irrigation Dep­a­rtment — responsible for monitoring Chenab flows at Marala (excluding Jammu and Manawar Tawi) for onward transmission to the Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters — showed that by Dec 19 (Friday), flows were within the 10-year range of maximum and minimum readings.
For instance, the readings on Dec 19 showed flows of 4,505 and 6,494 cusecs, which align with or exceed historical expectations for this time of the year.
The ministry said continuous monitoring would remain in place to respond to any future fluctuations. It added that information attributed to sources other than the office of the Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters “carries no effect whatsoever”.
Jhelum inflows
Officials, however, said the Jhelum River had also been experiencing disruptions as Indian authorities were holding and releasing water abruptly.
A senior irrigation department official said the river was also experiencing less inflows from upstream (India) to downstream (Pakistan) at Mangla Dam.
“It is really serious and alarming as well because around 15 million of the total 25 million acres of agricultural land, which is irrigated through various canals, is either receiving less or no water these days,” he added.
According to an internal report, Jhelum inflows and outflows at Mangla were 5,000 cusecs and 33,000 cusecs, respectively, on Dec 14. Inflows then fell to 3,300 cusecs on Dec 15 and remained at that level through Dec 19, while outflows stayed at 33,000 cusecs.
By comparison, the report said inflows recor­ded on Dec 19-20 last year were 4,400 cusecs, with outflows of 25,000 cusecs.
A Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) official pointed to similar readings at the Kerot Hydropower Project upstream of Mangla, suggesting abrupt upstream regulation by India. “The data at Kerot is also almost the same, which supports the view that water is being held and released abrupt­ly,” the official said, calling it a “serious matter”.
Another irrigation department official said the Chenab and Jhelum systems were crucial for irrigation through headworks, barrages and link canals, and warned that disruptions could harm crops. The official stressed that Pakistan had also faced difficulties during recent floods due to sudden releases without prior information.
Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Mehr Ali Shah could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts by Dawn.
However, he was earlier quoted by a TV channel as saying that the Jhelum flows were being observed. “For now, we have written a letter to India about the Chenab River. We will look into the issue further upon receipt of a reply,” Mr Shah said, stressing that Pakistan would raise its voice whenever India stops water.
