<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/280300256cbb790.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957711/gendered-cost-of-pakistans-population-imbalance-on-womens-work-and-lives' target='_blank'><strong>Gendered cost of Pakistan’s population imbalance on women’s work and lives</strong></a><br><p>At 2.55 per cent per annum, which translates to an average of 3.6 children per woman, Pakistan’s population growth rate is the highest in our region and amongst the highest in the world. 
Earlier this week, Dr Ali Mohammad Mir, Senior Director of the Population Council, outlined decades of haphazard, poor planning and misplaced policy directives on the part of successive governments that have led us to the dismal point we have reached today, where if nothing is done, Pakistan’s population is set to reach 385 million by 2050. 
While most of the concern about this rapid growth rate is framed in purely economic terms, very little attention is given to the actual women who bear the burden of both childbirth and childcare. 
It is also not a coincidence that Pakistan is regularly placed at the bottom of international indices related to women’s rights, appearing at 148 out of 148 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report in 2025. 
The persistence of patriarchy is fundamentally linked with Pakistan’s unsustainable population growth rate. Hence, any effective population policy must place women’s well-being and autonomy at the centre of planning. 
The dismal state of women’s rights
In terms of women’s economic participation, Pakistan has been among the bottom ten worst-performing countries in the world, according to the World Economic Forum. Only about 25pc of women are engaged in paid employment, and only 18pc of labour income goes to women. The higher birth rate, linked to the idea that a woman’s primary role is as a mother, is one of the reasons behind a low rate of economic participation. 
Women in Pakistan perform the vast bulk of unpaid labour within the home. According to UN Women’s ‘Progress of the World’s Women 2019-2020’ report, for every one hour a man spends on unpaid care and domestic work, Pakistani women spend 11 hours doing the same.

Of course, a higher birth rate means a higher amount of unpaid labour for women who are most often the primary caregivers for children. 

In terms of financial security, women are in an extremely poor position, with only three per cent of women as compared to 72pc of men owning a house and two per cent of women as compared to 27pc of men owning any land, according to the National Institute of Population Studies. 
This also means women are more dependent on producing male offspring as a form of security, which would incentivise having more children in the hopes of having a son. There is a clear link between the desire for more sons and a higher birth rate. 
The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2012-2013 found that 60pc of women with three sons did not want any more children, while only 21pc of women with three daughters felt the same. 
When it comes to health and survival for women and girls, Pakistan ranks 149 out of 153, according to the World Economic Forum, which includes a measure for reproductive rights and accounts for a worrying sex ratio of 92pc (as opposed to the naturally occurring rate of 94pc) of girls born as compared to boys. 
A skewed sex ratio is an indication of the practice of son preference; this has direct links with higher fertility rates overall.
Pakistan has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the region, with 11,000 maternal deaths occurring annually, and with underdeveloped parts of the country, such as Balochistan, showing some of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. If contraceptive use rises from 34pc to 52pc, 3,800 mothers’ lives could be saved annually.

It is telling that Aurat March’s slogan ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ was met with severe backlash across the country, underlying the anxiety surrounding women’s bodily autonomy.
This is reflected in statistics related to women’s decision-making surrounding their own health. In Pakistan, 41pc of women reported making decisions about their own health with their husbands, 37pc of women reported that these decisions were made primarily by their husbands, and only 10pc of women reported taking these decisions themselves, according to the National Institute for Population Studies.
This has direct implications for women’s ability to engage in decision-making regarding their reproductive health, as women who report higher decision-making capacity within the family are much more likely to engage in reproductive health-seeking behaviour.

While many may oppose the use of contraceptives for religious reasons, the idea that this is the main reason for the low uptake of contraceptives is largely untrue. In fact, many people would like to use modern methods of contraception,~~ but simply do not have access. The contraceptive prevalence rate in Pakistan is 35,~~pc while the overall demand is 55pc. The overall fertility rate could be decreased to 3.1 births per woman if this need was met. 
A lack of female empowerment in terms of education and decision-making is one of the main reasons for such a low contraceptive usage rate, combined with a basic failure in terms of service provision. Because of the high rate of unwanted pregnancies, Pakistan also has one of the highest abortion rates in the world, many of these conducted in extremely unsafe and unhygienic conditions. 

 

One of the factors contributing to high birth rates is the continued practice of early marriage amongst women and girls. According to the PDHS 2017-2018, young women aged 15-19 are more likely than young men to be currently married (14pc versus three per cent), which means both that their childbearing years are extended and that they are less likely to be able to assert any kind of authority over their reproductive choices, according to the National Institute for Population Studies.
Hence, all available evidence points to a clear link between a prevailing lack of gender equality and a continuously high population growth rate.
Empowering women and girls: A virtuous cycle
The long-term success of any family planning policy depends on the empowerment of women and girls, and the empowerment of women and girls can only take place if fertility levels are reduced.

Policies, therefore, must keep women and girls’ empowerment at the centre of planning efforts. This means moving away from blunt targets and focusing instead on improving the economic and educational opportunities for women and girls, along with improving access to quality healthcare overall.

This also requires an overall change in social attitudes, particularly amongst men, who often stand in the way of women’s empowerment.
Pakistan clearly has a long way to go both in terms of the achievement of gender equality and sustainable population growth, but the future need not be so grim. While the indicators may be far from ideal, the last four decades have shown some promising trends.
The fertility rate has declined significantly, even if progress is slow, and the number of women and girls who are gaining formal education and engaging in paid employment is also steadily increasing.
This is the time when policymakers should be making a coordinated push towards accelerating these processes by focusing their attention and investing resources in promoting an approach to family planning that centres the empowerment of women and girls.
Such efforts would spark a virtuous cycle—both helping to stabilise the currently unsustainable population growth rate and moving Pakistan closer to fulfilling its commitment with regard to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.

The sit-in began on Thursday afternoon and also included members of the KP cabinet. Visuals reposted by the PTI on X showed CM Afridi, along with other party workers, offering Fajr prayers outside the jail on Friday morning. Other images showed Afridi and others huddled around a fire. The sit-in was again livestreamed by the party on its social media channels.
Speaking on the livestream on Friday morning, the KP CM announced that the sit-in was being wrapped up, adding that he would now approach the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
“We will now go to the IHC to meet the chief justice,” he said, wrapped in a beige shawl to fend off the cold.
“We will request him that three of your judges had ordered the meeting [with Imran]. In the presence of all our lawyers, a judge directed the jail superintendent that a meeting should be arranged,” he said.
In October, a three-member IHC bench had asked the Adiala administration to allow a meeting between Afridi and Imran.

Recalling previous directives issued by the IHC, the KP CM said, “Previous orders were very clear that Khan sahib would be allowed to meet his family and lawyers on Tuesdays and party leadership on Thursdays.”
“I think courts should ensure the enforcement of their orders; otherwise, this is the law of the jungle,” he added.
CM Afridi also expressed frustration, stating that he had exhausted all “constitutional and legal” avenues available to meet his party’s founder.
“What other avenue is left for me to explore now?” he asked.
“I still have not received any answer to this. We had our suspicions yesterday, and we still do because we have not been able to meet him as yet,” he said.
CM Afridi lamented that despite court orders, he, other party leaders and Imran’s family were not being allowed to meet him. He also recalled the treatment meted out to Imran’s sisters outside Adiala last week as he said this.
“You have seen their condition yourself; they were grabbed by their hair and disrespected,” CM Afridi said, adding that such “tactics” were being used to “break the spirit” of his party leader.
Afridi went on to say that Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, “who is a pious woman,” had been made a target in an effort to “break” Imran. “These tactics have no place in a civilised society,” he added.
He expressed disappointment at the fact that courts were failing to ensure authorities complied with their orders.
“I have not been allowed to meet him despite being here all day, all night, and it’s morning now,” he said.
Afridi had staged the sit-in on Thursday afternoon after being denied a meeting with Imran, who he has been trying to meet since he became the provincial chief executive. He was also denied a meeting with Imran at the jail last Friday.
The KP chief minister, who replaced Ali Amin Gandapur last month, had arrived in Rawalpindi in the morning to meet Imran, but the jail administration did not allow him to proceed. The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police officials at the ‘factory naaka’.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Afridi said that police had stopped him in the afternoon at Factory Naka, near Adiala jail.
“I told the police that I was stopped last time, and I am also being stopped this time,” CM Afridi said. “I told them, ‘If you stop me, then tell me why you are defying court orders in writing’. They did not give me a reason.”

The KP CM added that the situation was “worsening” and questioned why the authorities were not complying with court orders.
“A province is being treated like a stepmother,” CM Afridi remarked. “If the representative of 25 million people is being treated like this, then it is not a good thing.
“Would you like it if it happened to someone else in another province tomorrow?”
The CM added that nobody was allowed to meet the PTI founder, be it his sisters, doctors, lawyers, or party leadership.
“These people (authorities) need to decide who they are standing with. If they continue with this attitude, then we will take a final option,” he said, without elaborating further.







PTI concerned about Imran’s health
The PTI expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks.
Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings.
“His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters, demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him.
A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.</p><small>2025-11-28 06:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2808232982fb0b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957772/pakistans-fuel-oil-exports-scale-fresh-high-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s fuel oil exports scale fresh high in 2025</strong></a><br><p>SINGAPORE: Pakist­an’s annual fuel oil exp­orts hit an all-time high this year and are expected to trend steady to higher next year, as higher dom­estic taxes deterred purchases while power plants are switching to cleaner alternatives, industry sources said.
The uptick in Pakistan’s fuel oil exports has added to supply in Asia, weighing further on prices in a market that is already well-supplied, traders and analysts said.
Fuel oil exports from Pakistan reached a fresh high this year, shipping data from Kpler and LSEG showed.

 

Exports so far this year have breached 1.4 million tonnes (about 8.9m barrels), up over 16pc from the full-year volume in 2024, the data from Kpler showed, with most of these exports ending up in Sou­th­­east Asia and the Mid­dle East. LSEG data sho­w­­ed exports at 1.33m tonnes so far in 2025, up from 1.11m tonnes last year.
The cargoes were most­­ly high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) and added mainly to marine fuel supply, while some volumes went to refineries as feedstock, market sources said.
“Pakistan primarily ex­­ports HSFO to Asia which have been seeing an exc­e­­ss in supply post-summer season and have depressed cracks in the region,” said Valerie Panopio, vice president for oil commodity markets at Rystad Energy.
Pakistani refiners sold more fuel oil via tenders this year after the government raised taxes for domestic fuel oil consumption, while power generators gravitate towards alternatives such as coal and solar.
The leading Pakistan fuel oil exporter was Pak-Arab Refinery, according to traders, while other ex­­p­orters included Cnergyi­­co, Attock Refinery, Natio­nal Refinery and Pakistan Refinery.
Cnergyico, which is the country’s largest oil refiner, has said it aims to boost exports. The company exported about 247,000 tonnes of fuel oil in 2024-25, its vice-chairman Usama Qureshi said.
Mr Qureshi added that he expects at least 50pc growth this fiscal year, supported by increased use of light-sweet crude that lifted its output of very low sulphur fuel oil.
The company has partnered up with global trading house Vitol to supply more low-sulphur marine fuel from Pakistani ports.
“The trend in furnace oil exports is only going to increase going forward in 2026,” said Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi, secretary general of Pakistan’s oil companies advisory council. “Fuel oil is no longer viable in electricity generation, and no longer profitable to sell in the domestic market, following the last budget,” he said.

He applied for a visit visa through a travel agency, confident it would be a “routine process”. Instead, his application was rejected twice: first in January, then again at the beginning of November.
The agency handling his case told him the reason was simple: he was “under 40”, and younger applicants were facing higher scrutiny. For Nadeem, who chose to be identified by his first name only, the explanation only added to the confusion already circulating among frustrated travellers.
“I don’t understand it. What does my age have to do with anything? I’m employed full-time, and I submitted my bank statement. My friend, a freelancer, got it on the first attempt. I have applied for a third time, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed, but it’s exhausting,” he told Dawn.
Visa rejections have recently become a recurring issue for Pakistanis travelling to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite the Gulf country’s close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with Pakistan. Abu Dhabi is Islamabad’s major trading partner in the Middle East and a key source of remittances, hosting a large Pakistani expatriate population.
On Thursday, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry told the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis, though he clarified there was no formal ban on Pakistani passports. Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the committee, told Dawn that the restrictions were imposed due to concerns about travellers “getting involved in criminal activities,” and said very few visas had been granted lately, “after much difficulty.”
The issue has persisted for months. In January 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis was informed that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”. Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig said the UAE had reservations about Pakistanis on visit visas potentially “resorting to begging”.
The following month, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, described the Gulf country’s refusal of visas to Pakistani nationals as a “serious and significant” issue. In comments to Arab News, he said Emirati authorities had raised concerns about the authenticity of documents, including educational credentials, as well as cases involving applicants with criminal records. “If they find a dichotomy somewhere, even if the document is genuine but the attestation either in Pakistan or in the UAE is not genuine, it could cause major rejections,” Tirmizi said, adding that AI-based verification systems were now being used.
In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.
Despite these assurances, early July saw renewed problems. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi raised the issue with his UAE counterpart, and during a July 11 meeting, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured full support in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens.
Yet, travellers continued to face obstacles.
Fatima Attarwala, a journalist, recalled her attempts to cover Gulfood, a major event in Dubai: “My visa got rejected twice. First, we went through one agency, then to the official agency coordinating the event, but every visa application for those under 45 was rejected. Even company directors’ visas weren’t approved in the first round. The second round only granted visas to applicants over 45 years of age. It’s not a Pakistan-only problem — people from Africa and other countries also faced the same.”
Syed Abbas Raza Naqvi, 25, who works for an American company, said he received repeated rejections despite corporate sponsorship. “I started trying in September last year for a conference in January. My company provided the invitation and all the supporting documents, but it still didn’t work. I tried three times. Eventually, a ‘guaranteed visa’ was issued at a higher fee, but the process remains opaque and stressful.”
Abbas applied for a five-year, multiple-entry visit visa in September this year, only to be rejected again.
“The visa cost $1,200 (Rs 339,000). I was refunded $650, but it was still a significant loss. Luckily, my company covered the expense, but overall, it was a disheartening experience,” he lamented.
A tech entrepreneur from Karachi, 36, who also had their visa rejected, told Dawn on the condition of anonymity that they had tried in September this year. “I then applied for a fresh visa rather than through my first application. Surprisingly, it was then granted in the same month.”
Muzamil Asif, a sports journalist assigned to cover the Asia Cup in Dubai, was unable to travel after his visa was rejected, despite having the necessary accreditation and documentation.
“Our travel agent said ‘100 per cent rejection’ for Dubai visas. Every agency refused to apply. The Pakistan Cricket Board advised applying via Abu Dhabi, but even then, the process was uncertain. In the end, my visa was rejected because I’m a single man under 35. The ticket and hotel bookings were already done, and my news outlet lost nearly Rs100,000.”
Travel agencies corroborated the trend.
Saher Nazeer, the customer services representative at Visa Express Karachi, told Dawn that “first-time and single-entry visa applications for Dubai face 70 to 80pc rejections, while family ties improve chances”.
Zaheer Zubair, the manager at Trips Travel & Tours, added that single visas had an approval rate of just 20pc, whereas family visas see around 80pc acceptance.
Ubaid Sajjad, a travel agent at AEG-Visa, cited strict financial requirements to get a visa. “You have better chances if you provide a six-month bank statement with around Rs3 million,” he said. “Insufficient funds are the major reason for single visa rejections.”
Meanwhile, Quratulain, an agent at Premio Travel & Tours, said “previous overstaying and unclear financial documentation” were the causes for rejection.
Discussions on Pakistani social media reveal wider frustration. Reddit users described blocked transit visas and contradictory messages from agencies like VFS Global, with one user noting that professional status or age often determined whether a visa would be approved. Some users said there was effectively a “ban on visit visas for Pakistanis in Dubai” due to concerns over alleged illegal migration.
However, a senior diplomat at the UAE embassy, who wished not to be named, dismissed the speculation, telling Dawn that “there is no ban on UAE visas for Pakistani citizens”.
“The UAE government issues visas daily to various categories of applicants. However, some Pakistani travel agents had tampered with applicants’ data in the past, leading to issues, after which a centralised visa system was introduced,” he said.
He added the UAE had set up three biometric desks at the embassy to ensure transparency in the application process.
“There are 2.27 million Pakistanis residing in the UAE, who can sponsor their families under the new law. However, those with criminal records — those who have tampered with their data — are being asked to correct their records,” the diplomat said.
On the other hand, UAE Ambassador Zaabi shared major visa facilitation reforms with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday, including online processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages. According to a post on the Ministry of Finance’s X account, nearly 500 visas are processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan.







Despite the diplomatic assurances and recently announced reforms, the experiences of Nadeem and other Pakistani visa seekers show how uncertainty still hovers over the process.
“It feels like you’re playing a lottery with your plans, your work commitments, and your money,” a dejected Nadeem told Dawn over the phone. “I just want to know if I can go or not and be done with it.”

Speaking during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, he said, “Fifty per cent of Afghans travel abroad using Pakistani passports. Whenever Afghans are caught by authorities abroad, they are carrying Pakistani passports.”
An official from the interior ministry acknowledged that this had occurred, but assured the committee that the practice had stopped.
“In the past, when people were deported from Saudi Arabia, it was found that deportees were Afghan citizens carrying Pakistani passports.”
Earlier today, the committee condemned Justice Ali Baqar Najafi’s remarks in the Noor Mukadam case that surfaced a day earlier, deeming them “ridiculous”.
Justice Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), observed that the Noor Mukadam case was the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”. It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
In a meeting today, the committee questioned what “would happen to the conviction rate in cases against women, which is already shameful, if a judge himself has made such remarks.”
The committee summoned advocate generals, prosecutor generals, police officials and all relevant authorities due to the low conviction rate.
Conviction rate in cases of gender-based violence (GBV) is reportedly as low as 1.2 per cent due to weak prosecution and judicial delays.
Women’s rights advocates say there is also no centralised GBV database, hindering data analysis. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, shelters and crisis centres, GBV courts, police protection cells, and the like are underfunded.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Later, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the FCC, established earlier this month after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which was uploaded on the SC website on Wednesday, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, also triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.

Mr Sharif was of the view that the “bigger criminals” that had brought the now incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan to power must also face justice.
Though the elder Sharif refrained from naming names, in 2023 he had accused former army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, ex-ISI head Gen Faiz Hameed, and former Supreme Court chief justice Saqib Nisar, as well as other senior judges, of playing a key role in his ouster from Prime Minister House in 2017. While there can be little argument that accountability, particularly of those who have interfered in the democratic process, is necessary, such an exercise should not be a selective one.
Mr Sharif had in the past taken a stand for civilian supremacy — and paid for it by losing his job. But his case alone does not provide a holistic view. For decades — well before Mr Khan’s arrival on the political scene — various state institutions played a role in making and breaking governments. And in the case of individuals, ironically, many of the same elements Mr Sharif had blamed for his ouster were seen to be involved in the fall of Mr Khan’s government, and in helping the PML-N return to power.

 

For example, Gen Bajwa was army chief both when Mr Sharif was sent packing and when Mr Khan’s government was removed. So all such episodes should be examined in detail, and not just viewed through a selective lens. It is a bitter truth that the politicians, including those belonging to Mr Sharif’s party, as well as state institutions, including the judiciary, have often played ball with unelected forces to oust rivals through palace intrigues. Their role needs further scrutiny.
Meanwhile, it is notable that while Mr Sharif bemoans the meddling of such forces, his own party men, including ministers, sing paeans to the hybrid system. Introspection is needed and the political class must reflect on how they themselves create situations that allow non-political forces to seize the levers of power.
Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto signed the Charter of Democracy in 2006 to strengthen civilian supremacy. That document states that “no party shall solicit the support of the military to come into power or to dislodge a democratic government”. Both the PPP and PML-N, as well as the PTI, have ignored this aim of the CoD, and resultantly, have been victims as well as beneficiaries of the hybrid system.
Perhaps a new charter is needed. For this, all political forces will need to set aside their differences and come together to agree on and work towards a truly democratic, constitutional order.

At the conclusion of the three-day 10th Pakistan-Russia Intergovernmental Commi­ssion (IGC) on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation, the two sides also signed three memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for cooperation in quality standards, anti-monopoly regulation and the media sector.
The Nov 25-27 IGC was co-chaired by Energy Minister Awais Leghari and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Tsivilev.







“The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to a broad, forward-looking partnership that supports the socio-economic development of Pakistan and the Russian Federation and contributes to regional stability and connectivity,” an official statement said.
Both sides expressed satisfaction with the constructive discussions on enhancing bilateral trade, diversifying export portfolios and strengthening business-to-business engagement.

At 10th Intergovernmental Commission, both sides agree to boost cooperation in trade, business and education

They reiterated the importance of continued cooperation to facilitate trade fairs, exchanges between business communities and improved market access for key Pakistani products, including textiles, sports goods, IT services, engineering items and agricultural commodities.
The two delegations also acknowledged the significance of advancing the pilot cargo movement along agreed corridors and confirmed their intention to operationalise a pilot train, marking a tangible step towards improving regional logistics and connectivity.
Energy cooperation remai­ned a central element of the dialogue, with both sides noting positive engagement in the oil and gas sectors, opportunities in LNG and LPG supply frameworks, and the importance of technical collaboration.
They also emphasised the potential for renewable energy, hydropower development, and water-related technologies, including hydrological monitoring and flood resilience.
In the industrial and technology sectors, discussions covered pharmaceutical cooperation, including insulin localisation, modernisation of the Pakistan Steel Mills’ metallurgical capacity, and possible ventures in heavy machinery, mining, and advanced manufacturing.
The two sides underscored the importance of scientific, academic and technological collaboration and reiterated plans to finalise intergovernmental agreements on higher education, the mutual recognition of degrees and scientific cooperation, alongside expanding scholarships, joint research and academic mobility in engineering, medical sciences, IT and space technology.
In this regard, both sides welcomed initiatives to establish Rus­s­ian language centres in Islamabad and Karachi. A special ceremony was hosted by the Federal Directorate of Educa­tion (FDE) at the Islamabad Model College for Boys I-8, where a centre for Russian language learning is being launched.
The delegations also expr­essed appreciation for expanding cultural, educational and people-to-people exchanges, including school partnerships, youth programmes and cultural outreach efforts.
During the session, the Russian delegation met survivors of the 2005 earthquake, highlighting the humanitarian solidarity between the two nations, and a cultural performance by Russian artists was held at the PNCA.
Pakistan acknowledged the installation of the Yuri Gagarin statue in Islamabad as a symbol of friendship and scientific coope­ration between the two nations.
The session also discussed avenues for cooperation in hum­anitarian and disaster management. The National Disa­ster Mana­gement Autho­rity (NDMA) of Pakistan and the Ministry of Emergency Situa­tions of the Russian Federation agreed to explore collaboration on early warning systems, emergency response training, and resilience-building measures.
The two sides also discussed opportunities in sports cooperation, tourism promotion and strengthening media and cultural linkages to support grea­ter public understanding bet­ween the peoples of both countries.
The three MoUs signed at the end included one between the Pakistan Standards and Qua­lity Control Authority (PSQCA) and Russia’s Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Met­ro­logy to strengthen collaboration in standardisation, metrology, and conformity assessment.
The second MoU was between the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) and the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia to support cooperation in competition law, exchange of expertise and capacity building.
The third MoU was signed by the state-run news agencies — Associated Press of Pakistan and Russia’s Sputnik — to enhance media cooperation and professional exchanges.
The two sides also decided to hold the 11th session of the Pak­is­tan-Russia Inter­gove­rnmental Commission in the Russian Federation in 2026 on mutually convenient dates.

Sources told Dawn that Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had packed their personal effects and shifted them back to their respective residences over the past week.
According to court officials, the judges instructed their staff to separate all books, documents, decorative pieces, and other personal effects that they had brought to the IHC after their elevation. The staff completed the packing earlier this week, and the material was quietly moved out of the high court building.

 

Sources said that the directions to pack up their chambers were issued shortly after the 27th Amendment came into force. The amendment has fundamentally altered the judicial structure by creating the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and enabling the transfer of high court judges without their consent.

Insiders say three judges have moved out their personal belongings

Two of the three judges — Justice Sattar and Justice Jahangiri — were appointed on Dec 30, 2020, and would remain entitled to pension and post-retirement benefits if they submit their resignations after Dec 31. Justice Sardar Ejaz, appointed on Dec 17, 2021, does not qualify for such benefits under the current rules unless the president exercises discretionary authority to relax the criteria.
The three judges are among the six IHC judges who last year wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) alleging interference of intelligence agencies in judicial affairs. The letter had triggered a debate over the independence of the judiciary and prompted calls for an inquiry from various quarters. Following this, five of the judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — challenged the transfer of three judges to the IHC earlier this year.
The transferred judges — Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, and Justice Mohammad Asif — were moved from the Lahore, Sindh and Balochistan high courts in February.
Justice Dogar later became the chief justice. The transfer orders were contested before a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which dismissed the petition on June 19. The judges then filed an intra-court appeal before the newly established FCC, which also rejected their plea.
Separately, four of the five judges — excluding Justice Jahangiri — attempted to challenge the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court under Article 184(3). However, the Supreme Court’s registrar’s office refused to entertain their petition, advising them instead to approach the FCC, which now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters under the amendment.

What they rarely acknowledge is something far more hopeful — this region is, quite literally, one of the world’s great democratic zones. One, 40 per cent of the world’s democracy lives in South Asia. Second, all eight countries have some positive or unique features that others can learn from.
That is the central argument of my new book, Democracy’s Heartland: Inside the Battle for Power in South Asia. Based on decades of engagement with elections at home and across the region, the book looks at Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka not only as theatres of crisis, but as a laboratory of democratic experiments — some successful, some deeply flawed, but all instructive.
For readers in Pakistan, this regional lens matters. Too often, India and Pakistan are compared only to score points. My aim, instead, is to ask what Pakistan has done that others can learn from, what India has done that Pakistan might adapt, and how both fit into a wider South Asian democratic story.
Pakistan’s recent constitutional history offers one of the region’s most striking examples of political self-correction. After years in which parliamentary practice became distorted, the 18th Am­­endment of 2010 restored a genuinely parliamentary system. It strengthened the office of the pri­me minister, reduced the scope for personalised discretion at the top and showed that constitutions can also be instruments of democratisation.

South Asia must see itself as a community of democratic practice.

Equally important was the federal dimension of that reform. The 18th Amendment did not simply rearrange powers in Islamabad; it pushed authority outward to the provinces. It recognised a basic truth many South Asian capitals resist: a diverse country cannot be run indefinitely from one centre. Provinces need real control over key subjects and resources, not symbolic recognition. Pakistan’s bicameral parliament, with its Senate built on provincial equality rather than population, reflects the same federal instinct.
Pakistan’s electoral framework also contains features comparatively advanced for the region. The National Assembly blends directly elected constituencies with reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, allocated through party lists. This ensures that groups often marginalised in majoritarian systems are present in the legislature by constitutional design rather than party goodwill. In a region where representation of women and minorities remains weak, Pakistan’s embedded guarantees merit serious study.
There is also a quieter story of democratic resilience that is easy to miss from the outside. Parties sidelined at different moments have repeatedly returned to the arena through elections. Civil soc­iety, lawyers and a vigorous media have pushed back whenever civic space narrowed. Voters have never abandoned the idea that elections are the only legitimate route to power. That stubborn commitment to the ballot is, in itself, a democratic resource.
At the same time, the fragility of these gains cannot be ignored. The recent 27th Amendment, passed in November 2025, has triggered a heated debate by reshaping Pakistan’s institutional balance. It grants lifetime legal immunity to certain office-holders and creates a new Federal Constitutional Court to take over constitutional cases from the Supreme Court. Critics fear this may weaken judicial independence and concentrate power in new ways. My purpose here is not to analyse one amendment, but to note what it underscores: democratic advances require constant vigilance. The same Pakistan that produced the 18th Amendment and deepened federalism now faces new tests in protecting those gains.

 

Just as other South Asian states can learn from Pakistan’s constitutional rebalancing, devolution and inclusive electoral design, Pakistan can also draw lessons from India’s experience. The first is the value of uninterrupted constitutionalism. In­­dia’s constitution, despite many amendments and a dark chapter during the Emergency, has happily survived. Institutions have had time to acquire habits; citizens have developed expectations about how power should change hands. Pakistan’s 1973 Constitution has now lasted longer than any previous charter. Protecting its continuity, rather than reinventing the state every decade, is essential for entrenching democratic reflexes.
A second area is election management. As former chief election commissioner of India, I have seen how much difference a credible election commission can make. For most of the republic’s life, the election commission of India has enjoyed cross-party legitimacy as a neutral arbiter. Pakis­tan’s Election Commission has been strengthened over time, but it operates in a more demanding environment. Further insulating it from day-to-day pressures, investing in a professional election machinery down to the polling station and allowing it to speak confidently in the public sphere are reforms that can draw on regional experience, while remaining Pakistani in design.
A third lesson is the normalisation of alternation in power. India has seen long periods of dominance, followed by coalitions and then by the rise of a new national formation. Governments have risen and fallen; leaders have lost and returned. Losing an election has become part of political life, not an existential crisis. Pakistan is already moving in this direction, with different parties and coalitions forming governments in Islamabad and the provinces over the last decade and a half. Consolidating that habit — accepting that no leader or party is permanent, only the rules are — may do more for democratic stability than any single constitutional clause.
In Democracy’s Heartland, I argue that South Asia must see itself as a community of democratic practice. Instead of treating each other only as cautionary tales, our eight countries should treat each other as case studies. Pakistan’s constitutional self-corrections, devolution of power and inclusive electoral design should be part of that shared learning; so should India’s constitutional continuity, large-scale election management and culture of alternation.
If Pakistani readers take away one message from my book, I hope it is this: South Asia is not just a region of crises. It is also a reservoir of democratic imagination. Whether we are prepared to learn from each other’s experiments — and mistakes — will determine whether this region can truly live up to its role as the heartland of democracy.

A key part of the new regulation makes the asset declarations of public servants accessible to the public. This will allow citizens to review a complete trail of an officer’s holdings from the point they join government service onward. The decision was announced on Thursday through an income tax not­i­fication SRO2263 that amends the ‘Sharing of Declaration of Assets of Civil Servants Rules, 2023’.
It significantly broadens the definition of a term “public servant” to include a wider range of government employees under the disclosure framework.
The term now includes officers in BPS-17 and above working for federal or provincial governments, as well as personnel in autonomous bodies, state-owned corporations and firms .
The only officials not covered by the new rule are those protected under an exemption listed in the National Accountability Ordinance of 1999.
Previously, the requirement was limited to a narrow definition of officials serving under the Civil Servants Act of 1973, which left a large number of public sector officers outside the reporting structure.
By bringing personnel across multiple layers of government and SOEs into a single disclosure structure, the authorities intend to create a more uniform standard of accountability.

Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” — Aristotle
WHY nations fail is the sum total of why humans fail. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, in their seminal work Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, focus on why people with the same geography, the same genetics and the same culture, sometimes living in neighbouring countries, can prosper or decline remarkably differently. Few books have captured my interest as strongly as this one. The authors rightly got the Nobel Prize in 2024.
The rise and fall of nations depends upon collective attributes which lead to the creation of different organisational systems and practices in societies. The collective attitude of a nation begins with the individual. Indeed, individuals in a society demonstrate all kinds of qualities but the character of a nation is determined by the predominant attitudes and behaviour of individuals.
What then makes individuals different? From where do these differences come and how do some develop qualities that take them far in life while others do not change throughout their life? And how so? This is an important question and has bothered many for long. Stephen R. Covey, a big name in leadership and management and the author of global bestsellers (the best known is his classic The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People) also started his professional life with this fundamental question and spent a lifetime researching, writing and explaining the origins of human effectiveness.
He explains in the beginning of this book what he learnt while reviewing literature on human success spanning over 200 years in the US since 1776. He underlined the key emphasis by all writers on character ethic as the foundation of success. Character ethic is made up of characteristics such as integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the golden rule of ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. The teaching of the character ethic is that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character.
His seven habits were eventually a precipitate of all that he learnt from writers on character ethic over centuries, as well as world religions, not just in America but globally. He referred to these habits as the principles of effectiveness — and principles, unlike values, are timeless truths.

The rise and fall of individuals and nations is not a coincidence.

The essence of these principles begins with the recognition of our life paradigm, that is, our invisible glasses through which we look at the world — in other words, our worldview. It is only when we become mindful of our paradigm that we can realise the importance of paradigm change. The power of paradigm change is also the basis of human conflict resolution.
The other important insight he shares is the framework of human effectiveness that begins inside-out. A personal victory — that is a victory within oneself — is an absolute precondition for any private victory — that is a manifest success. There is no shortcut to this route. No one can positively change the world, nobody ever has or ever will, without first changing oneself. This is a timeless fundamental truth.
In Covey’s framework, there are three habits which need to be developed to change ourselves and three others to be effective outside and then a seventh one to renew.
For inner world change, the first habit to develop is to learn how to be proactive. Rather than reacting to everything all the time, we have to learn how to take things in our own hands by taking initiative. We should inspire the change rather than wait to be inspired. We should select our response to stimuli rather than predictably react to everything. This gives us control rather than being remotely controlled by others.
The second principle is to develop a vision, that is, to develop a habit to begin with an end in mind and then to work towards it. The destination should be clear so that one can travel towards it, rather than feeling lost.
After developing a vision, one can manage oneself better to work towards it by prioritising urgent and important tasks. Most of our time should be spent on important tasks instead of exhausting ourselves with urgent but useless things. This is all about effective time management.
It is only when humans learn to change the lens through which they view the world, become proactive, set a vision and efficiently work towards it that they can affect change in the outside world. The first thing to accept in this context is that interdependence is a higher value than independence. By accepting this, we can work with others in a more respectful and productive way.

 

The first habit in this regard is to create win-win conditions by developing a mental state of abundance, instead of always complaining about scarcity. Others don’t have to fail for you to win. Both parties can win.
The second principle is to listen to others first rather than insisting that others should understand you. Once you have demonstrated empathetic listening you can expect others to listen to you. This is the basis of effective communication.
And the last principle of public victory is to learn to synergise. This is the art of making one plus one eleven rather than two. When this happens in human relationships and in teams, astounding results are achieved.
Renewal, the seventh habit, is all about refreshing and rejuvenating oneself by creating a work-life balance. Even if you have a Rolls-Royce it cannot be run indefinitely without regular fuelling. Humans are same. Four areas need to be regularly nourished: physical, mental, social and spiritual. This makes us ready to take on the world.
These time-tested and timeless habits make a difference at the individual, family and national level. The rise and fall of humans, and that of nations, is hence not just a coincidence.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi arrives at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.—Reuters

• Clarification follows concerns expressed by Imran’s son Kasim; Rana Sanaullah also dismisses reports of ex-PM’s transfer to another prison• KP CM Afridi stages sit-in outside jail after eighth snub at Adiala
ISLAMABAD: As reports about PTI chief Imran Khan’s ill health swirled on social and foreign media, both government and PTI figures dismissed such speculation on Thursday, saying the former prime minister — currently held in isolation — was doing well.
The clarification came when PTI activists staged a sit-in outside Adiala jail after authorities did not allow Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to meet the incarcerated party leader for the eighth time since he assumed office. His sisters and legal team were not allowed to meet Imran, either.
The lack of access to Mr Khan also gave rise to unconfirmed reports about his ill health and transfer to a high-security prison — which were picked up by a Japanese newspaper and the BBC.
‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trended on X on Thursday morning.
In a statement shared by the PTI, Imran’s son Kasim Khan also called on the international community and global human rights organisations to intervene and “demand proof of life, enforce court-ordered access, end this inhumane isolation” faced by his father.







Against this backdrop, Rana Sanaullah, who advises the PM on political affairs, told ARY News that Mr Khan was fine and his health was being taken care of. “There is a team of doctors that checks him on a weekly and daily basis [and looks after his] medicine, diet, facilities [and] exercises.” He said Mr Khan was getting everything befitting his position and status, adding that the PTI chief was still present in Adiala jail.
PTI leader Ali Zafar also dismissed reports about Imran Khan’s health in a DawnNewsTV show. “Thank God, the news is baseless, but it is even more important after this report that the government immediately allow us the opportunity of a meeting so we can go and see ourselves,” said the PTI leader, adding that once a meeting was held, they could come out and tell everyone that everything was fine. “We think it is very necessary that a meeting is facilitated with Imran; it’s been a month,” he added.
“There were news reports about Imran Khan, news from India and Afghanistan, attempts were made to spread discord; these reports have been denied. The government cannot harm Imran Khan,” said PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram while talking to Dawn.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, in an appearance on Geo News, stated that jail officials had already provided information on Imran’s health.
Senate protest
On the other hand, the PTI staged a noisy protest against the alleged mistreatment meted out to the former prime minister. The issue was raised in the House by PTI lawmaker Faisal Javed soon after the question hour. He claimed that Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and regretted that nobody, including his family members, lawyers and doctors, was allowed to see him. “This is against basic human rights, court orders, the jail manual and prison rules,” he remarked.







Minister of State for Interior Talal Cha­udhry, in his response, described Imran Khan as a VIP prisoner enjoying the facilities of exercise machines and a personal cook. He said meetings with a prisoner are regulated under the jail manual.
CM stages sit-in
Meanwhile, a sit-in led by KP CM Afridi continued outside Adiala jail. Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Mehmood Khan Achakzai also joined the protest on Thursday night to show solidarity with the CM.
Mr Achakzai said more sit-ins would be held across the country and “after that people will govern the country”. “It is unfortunate that the CM of a province is sitting outside the jail. MNAs and senators were not being allowed to meet Imran Khan,” he said.
The KP chief minister, who replaced Ali Amin Gandapur last month, had arrived in Rawalpindi in the morning to meet Imran Khan, but the jail administration did not allow him to proceed. The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, where Imran Khan is incarcerated, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police officials at the ‘factory naaka’.
The CM asked the officials to inform him in writing regarding the decision to bar him from meeting the incarcerated former premier despite the court orders, but his request was declined.
Amid uncertainty surrounding the health of Mr Khan, CM Afridi later told reporters that he wanted to meet Mr Khan to get “actual information” from him and share it with the nation. He said he had exhausted all legal and political avenues in his attempts to gain access to the PTI leader.

Justice Ali Baqar Najafi’s additional note, published on Wednesday, attributes the ghoulish crime to the “vice” of live-in relationships. At a time when the court ought to speak with moral clarity about violence, accountability and justice, the focus appears to have been shifted to policing personal conduct. Such observations diminish the gravity of the crime and echo the logic often used to excuse violence in our society.
Noor was murdered in cold blood. There is no ambiguity in this. But the note appears to treat the murder as the “horrible consequence” of societal vice. When conclusions shift responsibility away from the perpetrator, it implies that the victim’s choices created the conditions for her own death.
For decades, our society has justified so-called honour killings, domestic abuse and even sexual violence by employing a similar reasoning: that the victim behaved in a way that offended norms, and therefore, suffered the ‘consequences’. For anyone to be seen to employ such reasoning in a case as horrifying and clear-cut as this, is unsettling.

 

Courts do not merely determine guilt, they signal values. When a private relationship is described as a “revolt” against religion and seen to be linked to murder, the takeaway for society is that the victim asked for it. Such a narrative emboldens those who seek to rationalise violence. It also distracts from the fundamental failures the case revealed, such as delayed interventions, passive bystanders and a perpetrator whose privilege enabled impunity until the final act was committed.
Justice was ultimately upheld and that is crucial. But justice must also be accompanied by reasoning anchored in law, not finger-wagging. At a time when gender-based violence remains rampant, especially among the married and those who don’t ignore “societal compulsions”, the principle should be reinforced that no woman invites harm by her choices.

According to statements issued by the High Commission, the debate centred on the motion “This House Believes India’s Policy Towards Pakistan is a Populist Strategy Sold as Security Policy” had been confirmed weeks in advance. It is scheduled for 12:30am PKT.







Pakistan’s delegation, comprising former Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman Lt Gen (R) Zubair Mahmood Hayat, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and former diplomat Dr Mohammad Faisal, was already in London for the event.
The High Commission claimed that India’s originally announced speakers, General M.M. Naravane, Dr Subramanian Swamy and politician Sachin Pilot, “withdrew at the eleventh hour”, leaving the event without its opposing panel.
It further alleged that India later proposed “obscure and low-profile replacements” that did not match the level of the Pakistani delegation and “undermined the credibility and balance of the debate.”







“The collective retreat of the Indian delegation amounted to an unchallenged victory for Pakistan,” the High Commission stated, adding that India’s withdrawal “exposed the weakness of its narrative on a neutral academic platform”.
Sources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the last-minute shift was “very bizarre”, noting that such debates were typically finalised far in advance and that delegations typically agreed knowing who they were debating.
While the High Commission criticised what it described as India’s reluctance to face open questioning, many on social media questioned the reason behind India’s withdrawal, speculating that it may have been pressure from the Indian government on the panellists.</p><small>2025-11-28 02:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28074431a42c802.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957846/fo-says-use-of-drones-in-attack-on-chinese-workers-in-tajikistan-underlines-gravity-of-threat-emanating-from-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>FO says use of drones in attack on Chinese workers in Tajikistan underlines ‘gravity of threat emanating from Afghanistan’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) has condemned the attack which claimed the lives of three Chinese workers in Tajikistan, saying that the use of armed drones in the incident underlined the “gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it”.
Tajik authorities said on Thursday that three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border. The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south.
“The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement. Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack.
Subsequently, the FO, in a statement issued early on Friday, expressed Pakistan’s condolences and solidarity with China and Tajikistan over the lives lost in a “heinous terrorist attack in Tajikistan near its border with Afghanistan”.







“Pakistan unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack on Chinese nationals. The use of armed drones in the incident underlines the gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it,” the FO said.
“As a neighbour that has repeatedly suffered terrorist attacks orchestrated from Afghan soil, the people of Pakistan fully understand and share the grief and anguish of our Chinese friends and Tajik partners,” it said.
“Pakistan has consistently stressed that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism against its neighbours or any other country. The repeated use of Afghan soil by terrorist elements and their continued presence under the patronage of the Afghan Taliban regime, is a matter of serious concern for the entire region and the wider international community,” it said.
It added that concrete and verifiable action against the perpetrators, abettors, facilitators and financiers of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil was the only way to address “this growing menace”.
“Pakistan will continue to work closely with China, Tajikistan and other regional partners to promote peace, stability and security in our shared neighbourhood,” the FO said.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
Last week, Denmark, in the capacity of the chair of the UN Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the TTP in Central and South Asia and said that the terror outfit was receiving “logistical and substantial support” from the de facto Afghan authorities.
Meanwhile, Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries.
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population.
At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity.
Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”</p><small>2025-11-28 02:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2807324292a640f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957806/federal-constitutional-court-moved-against-law-that-created-it' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court moved against law that created it</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A plea asking the Federal Cons­titutional Court (FCC) to strike down the very law that brought it into being, i.e. the 27th Constitutional Amen­dment, was filed before the newly established court on Thursday.
“It is most respectively prayed that this petition may kindly be accepted and the 27th Amendment passed with ‘malicious design’ may kindly be struck down in the larger interest of justice,” read the petition, which was moved by Advocate Muhammad Shoaib in person.
Earlier on Nov 11, former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja challenged the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court, seeking a direction that the court retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the vires and constitutionality of the proposed amendment.
At the time, the FCC did not exist as the amendment in question had not yet been approved by parliament.
Similar pleas have been filed before high courts and the Federal Shariat Court, but this is the first time the FCC has been approached to strike down the law that created it in the first place.
‘One-man rule’
Filed under Article 175E of the Constitution, the fresh petition argued that the 27th Amendment was allegedly passed by a “puppet regime” with a “malicious design to establish one-man rule” in Pakistan by undermining the Constitution.

 

“When the country was passing through a constitutional crisis with the law and order situation deteriorating day by day, the government tabled the 27th Amendment in parliament with the objective of undermining the independence of the judiciary in a mala fide manner,” the petitioner claimed.
The petition said that the establishment of the FCC, by allegedly curtailing the powers of the SC under the garb of the 27th Amendment, was against the fundamental principles enshrined in the original provisions of the 1973 Constitution.
It further claimed that the federal government was being exploited by certain individuals for the purpose of their vested interests, whereas parliament had been used as rubber-stamp just to implement the whims of powerful.
It contended that the country was going through a “power-sharing crisis”, where one institution was overwhelming the powers of the others.
It added that the country was being governed through an indirect martial law, which had camouflaged the entire system and thus “disgracing the green book”.
‘Constitutional crisis’
The petition pleaded that the amendment would create institutional incoherence amounting to a constitutional crisis, as all powers would be concentrated in the hands of a single individual.
“This flagrant violation of the constitution by the government amounted to mockery of the parliament and the judicial system of the country,” the petition argued.
It added that granting immunity to the highest officials of the country from all criminal liability was a clear violation of Article 227 of the Constitution, which ordains that no law will be enacted in contravention of the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah.
Likewise, the introduction of Articles 175E and 185 of the Constitution would create a clash, as a parallel appellate system has been introduced, with one set of appeals to be filed before the SC and another before the FCCP, the plea read.
The petition argued that this amounted to a violation of natural justice, adding that the judiciary was the custodian of the rights of the people. “Therefore, the FCCP should play its role by striking down the 27th Amendment in the interest of justice,” it added.

ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court.
The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules.
On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians.
These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan.
In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases.
On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts.
The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9, 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional.
Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued.
‘Without lawful authority’
The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est.
The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.
“While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added.
The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary.
The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power.

 

It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles.
“If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared.
The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”.
“Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read.
“Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.”
The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment.
“It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.”
The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
“The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added.
“Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.”

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
According to sources, more than 15 such social media accounts have initially been found to be involved in spreading baseless propaganda and hatred against provinces.
It has been learned that the FIA has initiated action by identifying social media accounts spreading fabricated information. Legal action is being taken through the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, against those involved in the baseless propaganda.

 

According to FIA officials, some elements were sharing fake and misleading posts regarding the offloading of passengers, aimed at damaging the institution’s reputation and creating concern among the public. They added that the FIA Immigration Wing does not offload passengers who have complete documents and a legitimate reason for travel at any airport in the country.
Passengers with incomplete or fake travel documents are offloaded. Those who provide suspicious or unclear information, as well as those suspected of being influenced by human traffickers or illegal agents, are also offloaded. In the past, strict action was taken against individuals with a history of illegal activities or problematic travel records, added the officials.
The FIA officials made it clear that the public should not be overly concerned about the matter. Rather, they should stay away from illegal agents and always travel with complete and verified documents.
They advised that in case of a complaint, the public should contact the deputy director of the FIA Immigration Wing or its helpline at 1991.
Earlier today, the agency clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.</p><small>2025-11-28 02:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2723401293eee57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957739/gen-mirza-bows-out-as-last-cjcsc-chief-of-defence-forces-yet-to-be-notified' target='_blank'><strong>Gen Mirza bows out as last CJCSC; chief of defence forces yet to be notified</strong></a><br><p>The most sweeping transformation of the higher defence organisation took effect at midnight on Thursday with the abolition of the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, even as the government had yet to notify the appointment of the country’s first chief of defence forces under the new structure.
The operationalisation of the amendment to Article 243 of the Constitution, passed by parliament on November 13 and signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari, was timed to coincide with the retirement of the last CJCSC, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.
With his departure, the tri-service coordinating post created in 1976 stood dissolved, ending nearly five decades of institutional representation for the navy and air force at the apex of military decision-making.
Gen Mirza retired as the 18th and final occupant of the CJCSC office, a position which critics argued never fully realised its intended role of ensuring robust coordination among the three services.
Under the restructured command architecture, oversight of joint operations, multi-domain planning and inter-service integration has been consolidated in the newly created chief of defence forces (CDS), who will simultaneously serve as chief of the army staff (COAS), thus merging operational, administrative and strategic authority into a single dual-hatted role.
Although the government had not notified the CDF-cum-COAS appointment by Thursday evening, no surprises were expected.

 

Current COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir is set to assume the role, which resets his tenure to a fresh five-year term with the possibility of another five-year extension. This would keep him in command until at least 2030, and potentially through 2035.
Insiders say the delay in the notification stemmed from final work being done on the finer details of the appointment.
Field Marshal Munir’s anticipated elevation comes with a significant expansion of authority, including enhanced influence over nuclear command structure through the creation of a new four-star post, the Commander of National Strategic Command (CNSC).

 

The CNSC will oversee unified strategic operations now spread across the services. The appointment, reappointment and extension of the CNSC are tied solely to the CDF’s recommendation and shielded from judicial review through a sweeping exclusion clause that legal experts describe as unprecedented.
The overhaul of the armed forces’ hierarchy is anchored in the amendment to Article 243, which governs command and control of the military. Parallel revisions to the Army, Navy and Air Force Acts have eliminated the CJCSC office, redefined internal hierarchies and strengthened the CDF’s role, expanding the army chief’s influence across joint and strategic domains.
However, the National Command Authority Act has not yet been amended to reflect the new constitutional reality.
Despite the abolition of the CJCSC post, the future structure of the Joint Services Headquarters remains uncertain, with details still being finalised.
“I extend my best wishes and prayers for all the three services and in particular the tri-services headquarters, whatever form and demeanour it takes, for fulfilling the renewed responsibilities with dedication and commitment,” Gen Mirza said in his farewell remarks.



Supporters of the restructuring argue that a higher defence organisation had long been “anachronistic” and ill-suited to modern warfare spanning cyber, space, information and unmanned systems. They say eliminating duplication and empowering a single “strategic integrator” was essential for efficiency.
“I see tri-services synergy, jointness and coordination as a compulsion rather than a choice, with much-needed organisational reform to meet these futuristic challenges,” Gen Mirza said, defending the overhaul.
Critics, including former service chiefs and defence scholars, warn that the model centralises unprecedented authority in one office while diminishing the roles of the air force and navy, precisely when maritime competition, airspace threats and technological integration require their heightened relevance.</p><small>2025-11-28 02:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27225116bba75cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957737/security-forces-kill-22-terrorists-in-kps-dera-ismail-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 22 terrorists in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 22 terrorists in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was conducted based on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna al Khwarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR stated.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement read.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation.







On Tuesday, 22 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Bannu, the ISPR said in a statement.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/272152267e7fc8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957719/brilliant-chameera-seals-thrilling-win-over-pakistan-as-sri-lanka-make-t20-tri-series-final' target='_blank'><strong>Brilliant Chameera seals thrilling win over Pakistan as Sri Lanka make T20 tri-series final</strong></a><br><p>Dushmantha Chameera held his nerve with a barrage of pinpoint yorkers in the final over as Sri Lanka defended 184 to beat Pakistan by six runs in a nerve-jangling Twenty20 International tri-series encounter at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Thursday night.
Needing 10 off the last six balls with three wickets in hand, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha (unbeaten 63 off 44) could only manage a single and watch helplessly as Faheem Ashraf (seven) holed out to long-on and Mohammad Wasim blocked the final perfect yorker.
A packed house fell silent as Sri Lanka clinched victory and stormed into the Saturday final.
Pakistan were reeling at 43 for 4 in the sixth over after Chameera removed Sahibzada Farhan (nine) and Babar Azam (zero) in the space of three deliveries and young pacer Eshan Malinga rattled Saim Ayub’s (27 off 18) stumps.
From that precarious position, Salman and Usman Khan (33 off 23) launched a spirited counter-attack, adding 56 for the fifth wicket and keeping the asking rate in sight.
Usman fell trying one big shot too many against Wanindu Hasaranga (1-27), but Mohammad Nawaz (27 off 16) joined his skipper to raise Pakistan’s hopes again.
The pair smashed 70 in just 36 balls for the sixth wicket, with Nawaz clubbing two sixes and Salman bringing up a classy fifty. When Nawaz skied one to long-off with 22 needed off 12, the equation still looked gettable.
However, Chameera — who finished with superb figures of 4-20 — returned to dismiss Faheem in the penultimate over and then sealed the game with ice-cool execution under pressure.
Pakistan’s chase had begun confidently with Sahibzada and Saim adding 28 in the first three overs. But Chameera’s double strike in the fourth over — Sahibzada caught at cover and Babar trapped plumb in front — triggered a familiar top-order wobble.
Saim’s flamboyant 27 ended when Malinga (2-54) dragged one back to crash into off-stump, and when Fakhar Zaman (one) miscued to midwicket, Pakistan were staring at another collapse.
Salman, though, stood firm. Elegant drives were followed by audacious ramps and inside-out lofts as he carried the fight almost single-handedly.
His unbeaten 63 — laced with four fours and three sixes — ensured Pakistan took it to the final delivery, but it proved just short.
Earlier, Kamil Mishara’s scintillating 76 off 48 balls — studded with six fours and three sixes — formed the backbone of Sri Lanka’s imposing 184 for 5.
Put in to bat by Pakistan, Sri Lanka lost Pathum Nissanka early to a beauty from Salman Mirza, but Kusal Mendis (40 off 23) and the 23-year-old Mishara added a brisk 66 for the second wicket to wrest the initiative.
Even after Mendis fell lbw to a straighter one from leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, Mishara continued to dominate, reaching his fifty in style with an inside-out six off part-timer Saim.
Pakistan’s bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs on a batting-friendly surface. Wasim and Faheem proved expensive, while Abrar (2-28) was the pick of the attack with his clever variations.
A late flourish from Dasun Shanaka (17 off 10) and a run-out off the final ball — Shanaka stranded after a mix-up with Janith Liyanage (24 not out) — pushed Sri Lanka past 180, a total that looked unlikely during a brief mid-innings wobble.
Sri Lanka raced to 58 without loss in the six-over powerplay, with Mendis particularly severe on anything short. The wicket of Nissanka — bowled by a clever slower cutter from Salman — briefly applied the brakes, but Mendis and Mishara ensured the scoring rate never dipped below nine an over.
Abrar provided Pakistan their second breakthrough when he trapped Mendis in front with one that skidded straight, ending a dazzling knock that contained six fours and a six.
Kusal Perera’s struggle continued as he holed out to backward point off Saim for a labored six, leaving Sri Lanka 96 for 3 in the 11th over.
Mishara, however, refused to allow Pakistan any breathing space. He switch-hit Abrar for six, lofted Nawaz over long-on and punished anything short or wide with disdain.
His dismissal in the 17th over — skying a slog-sweep to long-on off Abrar — finally gave Pakistan some relief, but by then the damage was done.
Liyanage and Shanaka added 31 in quick time for the fifth wicket. Shanaka’s cameo included two towering sixes and two crunching fours, though his innings ended in unfortunate fashion when a desperate second run off the last ball resulted in a run-out, Babar’s direct hit from midwicket finding him well short.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271538592f03306.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957713/uae-not-issuing-visas-to-pakistanis-interior-ministry-official-tells-senate-body' target='_blank'><strong>UAE not issuing visas to Pakistanis, interior ministry official tells Senate body</strong></a><br><p>Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
The secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” he warned.
The official said that currently, the UAE was only issuing visas to blue and diplomatic passport holders.
Separately, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the Senate committee on human rights, also confirmed that the interior ministry official’s remarks to Dawn. She said the bar was attributed to concerns about people travelling to the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.
The committee was told that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis and that very few had been issued in the recent past “after much difficulty”, she said.
Meanwhile, a senior diplomat in the UAE embassy, who wished not to be named, dismissed social media speculation that there was a ban on visas for Pakistanis. Answering a question related to the purported “ban”, he told Dawn that “there’s no ban on visas for Pakistani citizens.”
UAE envoy shares steps to facilitate visa processing
On the other hand, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi shared “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb today, the latter’s ministry said.
The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said on X.
Nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, the statement added, further outlining reforms shared by the envoy.







Ambassador Al Zaabi emphasised boosting bilateral cooperation in trade, investment and cultural ties, while “appreciating the longstanding contributions of Pakistanis working in the UAE”.
Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the fraternal, strategic, and economic partnership between their countries, the statement said.
They also reviewed ongoing defence cooperation and agreed to continue working closely to unlock new opportunities in trade, investment, technology, people-to-people ties and other areas, it added.
Past UAE visa issues
Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July, which prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart.
In a meeting on July 11, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”.
In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.

 

This came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country.
However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27220944ea71a5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957735/police-move-shangla-woman-to-shelter-home-over-fears-her-family-will-attempt-to-kill-her' target='_blank'><strong>Police move Shangla woman to shelter home over fears her family will attempt to kill her</strong></a><br><p>Shangla police on Thursday sent a woman to a Darul Aman shelter home after expressing fear for her following a video of her that went viral on social media.
Aloch Police Station House Officer (SHO) Khurshid Ali told Dawn that the woman contacted the station, stating that her life is at risk and that her family is plotting to kill her.
“We sent a team to the area and brought the woman to the police station, where we recorded her statement,” SHO said.
He further said that the woman said a man filmed a video with her and uploaded it to social media, which drew the ire of her family.
“She said in the statement that her family might kill her and requested police protection,” SHO Ali said.
The officer added that the woman was produced before the magistrate on duty in the Chakesar courts, where, on his order, she was moved to the shelter home in Swat.
“We have started work on the case and submitted it to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency,” SHO Ali added.
Replying to a question, he elaborated that the suspect had fled the area, but expressed hope that they would arrest him with the help of the NCCIA.
“The woman was married to a man in a village in Puran,” the SHO added. “However, due to domestic issues, she had filed for divorce and the case is still ongoing.”
In September, a judicial magistrate in Karachi sentenced a man to a total of six years in prison for creating fake Facebook accounts in his friend’s name and misusing them to share her inappropriate photographs in an attempt to blackmail her.

“We are fully investigating that aspect of his background as well to include any known associates that are either overseas or here in the United States of America, that is what a broad-based international terrorism investigation looks like,” Patel said at a news conference.
The suspect worked with “the US government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar,” during the US war in Afghanistan, CIA Director John Ratcliffe told the New York Times and Fox News.
The two soldiers, part of a militarised law enforcement mission ordered by President Donald Trump months ago and challenged in court by Washington DC officials, were hospitalised and had come through surgery, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.
The suspect, who was wounded in an exchange of gunfire before he was arrested, was identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national.
Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that the two wounded soldiers were a man and woman.
She said the US government planned to bring terrorism charges against the gunman and seek a sentence of life in prison “at a minimum.”
Investigators seized numerous electronic devices from the suspect’s house in Washington state, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, Patel said at the news conference.
US Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro identified the two wounded Guardsmen as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. She said they had been sworn in as National Guard members fewer than 24 hours before the shooting.
Pirro said the suspect ambushed the two while they were patrolling near the White House. Armed with a powerful handgun, a .357 Magnum, he shot one Guardsman who fell and then shot again before firing multiple times at the second Guardsman.
Processing of Afghan immigration requests halted
Trump, who was at his resort in Florida at the time of the attack, released a prerecorded video statement late on Wednesday calling the shooting “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror.” He said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who came to the US during Joe Biden’s presidency.
The US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency later said that it has halted processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, “pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
According to the DHS, Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the US during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control of their homeland after the US withdrawal.
NBC News, citing an interview with an unnamed relative of the suspect, reported early on Thursday that Lakanwal served in the Afghan army for 10 years alongside US Special Forces troops and was stationed in Kandahar for part of that time.
The relative also said Lakanwal was working for online retail giant Amazon.com the last time they spoke several months ago, according to NBC News.
The DHS did not include other details of his immigration record, but a Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office.
Lakanwal, 29, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.
The shooting unfolded at midday outside a subway station in a bustling commercial area within a few blocks of the White House. Secret Service agents placed the presidential mansion under a security lockdown immediately after the shooting as a precaution.
In response to Wednesday’s shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked to send another 500 National Guard troops to join the more than 2,000 Guard soldiers previously mobilised in the nation’s capital.
Vice President JD Vance, who was in Kentucky on Wednesday, said in a post on X that the shooting proved that the Trump administration’s immigration policy was justified.“We must redouble our efforts to deport people with no right to be in our country,” he said.







Critics of the Trump administration’s immigration policy say it has employed illegal harsh tactics and swept up immigrants indiscriminately, including some with no criminal history and others in the United States legally.

Attack outside subway station
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has clashed openly with Trump over the deployment of Guard troops in her city, told reporters hours after the incident, “this is a targeted shooting.”
At the same news briefing, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, said the two Guard soldiers were “ambushed” and that the known assailant appeared to have acted alone.
The two soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, were on a “high-visibility patrol” outside the entrance to a subway station when the suspect “came around the corner,” drew a weapon and immediately fired at the pair, Carroll said.
After an exchange of gunfire, other National Guard troops subdued the suspect, he said.
Trump said in August he was ordering the National Guard deployment to fight crime in a city he said had become unsafe, despite objections from District of Columbia officials who challenged the move in court as an infringement on local government control.</p><small>2025-11-27 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2713505125c9ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957707/imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chatta-object-to-new-court-appointed-lawyer-after-previous-counsels-vanishing-act' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chatta object to new court-appointed lawyer after previous counsel’s vanishing act</strong></a><br><p>Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, on Thursday objected after the apparent vanishing act of the court-appointed lawyer representing them in the controversial social media posts case and the appointment of a new counsel.
Judge Afzal Majoka, who has been presiding over the case’s proceedings, too, was also seemingly unaware of the finalisation of the appointment of the new counsel when Advocate Taimur Janjua showed up in the Islamabad district and sessions court instead of Advocate Shakeel Jatt.
Advocate Jatt, who attended the case’s hearing as Imaan and Hadi’s court-appointed defence counsel for the first time on Tuesday, had previously refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
“I am in favour of a fair trial. I cannot ask questions that are dictated [to me]. My conscience does not allow this,” he had said. The counsel had alleged without sharing any specific details that he had “received 15 questions with the instructions that he should ask them during the cross-examination”.
Advocate Jatt had also sought more time from the court to prepare for the case, but Advocate Janjua showed up at the hearing today to represent Imaan and Hadi.
When he informed the court that he had been appointed as the couple’s counsel, Judge Majoka said the court had not yet received a notification in this regard.
A three-member prosecution team present at the hearing assured the court that the relevant notification would be submitted.
For her part, Mazari objected to the change, questioning who had made the new appointment and through what process. She also raised concerns over the “disappearance” of Advocate Jatt.
Mazari contended that she or Chattha had not expressed any lack of confidence in Advocate Jatt and requested the court to record their statements on the matter.
She further raised doubts over an application said to be submitted by Advocate Jatt for his removal as the duo’s lawyer. Moreover, she questioned why the court had not objected to the disclosures made by Advocate Jatt at the previous hearing.
After the court provided a copy of Advocate Jatt’s application to Chattha, the latter requested the judge to summon the lawyer. He also contended the defence had “not rejected” the counsel.
However, the prosecution objected to Chattha’s request, arguing that “while a sessions judge is the appropriate authority to summon a state-appointed counsel, the court hearing the case is not the relevant forum for such an action”.
The proceedings were suspended for a while after Mazari and Chattha requested for time to consult the newly appointed counsel. Judge Majoka accepted their request and the hearing was later adjourned for Saturday.
Earlier in the day, the court had suspended the proceedings twice, first until 10 am and later until 11 am, awaiting the appearance of the accused and a clarification about the appointment of a counsel for them.
An order from the office of the Islamabad west district and sessions judge regarding the appointment, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “Consequent upon the request made by Mr Muhammad Afzal Majoka, additional sessions judge Islamabad west, for the appointment of a defence counsel at state expenses, for Hadi Ali Chattha and Imaan Zainab Mazari accused […] Muhammad Taimoor Janjua is appointed as the defence counsel on state expenses.”
The proceedings were resumed after Mazari and Chattha held a meeting with Advocate Janjua. In a joint statement recorded before the court, the couple claimed that the new counsel was not following their instructions and that they did not trust him.
For his part, Advocate Janjua denied compelling them to follow any directions of his, saying that he only acted under the court’s instructions.
Chattha also filed an acquittal application during the hearing, urging the court to hear his arguments before calling the witnesses for cross-examination.
In his arguments, Chattha maintained that the first information report (FIR) registered in the case with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) was based on a “flawed source report”.
He alleged that the FIR was based on a source report that did not comply with legal requirements, and that screenshots submitted by the prosecution as evidence were taken from different devices and then combined to form a single image.
No mobile device had been seized, and no verification was obtained from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, he argued.
Moreover, the FIR was registered 22 days after the date visible in the timestamps in the screenshots, he further alleged.
Chattha also read out complainant Shehroz Riaz’s statement in the court.
He contended that the entire case was based on “just two Twitter accounts and a single report”. The NCCIA’s procedure for the registration of the FIR was not followed, he claimed, urging the court to accept his acquittal application.
The case against Imaan and Chattha has been registered with the NCCIA on accusations of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country in the case.
The two were indicted in the case on October 30, a day after the latter was arrested outside the courtroom over non-appearance. Mazari said that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Speaking to reporters after his release, Chattha had maintained that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings on October 29, but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”.
Before Tuesday’s hearing, Mazari had also alleged that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel” for her and Chattha.</p><small>2025-11-27 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27190646db59ffa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957728/human-rights-minister-assures-eu-mission-of-commitment-to-gsp-plus' target='_blank'><strong>Human rights minister assures EU mission of commitment to GSP Plus</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan assured the visiting European Union (EU) Monitoring Mission on Thursday of its total and complete commitment to the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+).
The country was granted GSP+ status by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.

 

A seven-member EU delegation is currently visiting Karachi as part of the fifth Biennial Review of the GSP+ scheme. It is led by Sirgio Baliberia, adviser to the GSP+ Directorate in the Directorate General for Trade. The monitoring mission will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme. Maintaining GSP+ status is critical for Pakistan to keep export costs low.
A press release issued by the human rights ministry today said Human Rights and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar welcomed the delegation at its headquarters today.
“Pakistan reaffirmed its strong commitment to the GSP+ framework, emphasising that the Pakistan–EU partnership remains central to governance reforms, institutional strengthening, and sustainable development. As one of the largest beneficiaries of GSP+, Pakistan highlighted the programme’s role in advancing human-rights protections and aligning domestic legislation with international standards,” the press release said.
The delegation was briefed on “significant legislative and policy progress” since 2014, including strengthened protective mechanisms for women, children, labour, marginalised groups and people with disabilities.
The Pakistani side reaffirmed its commitment to uphold human rights despite “challenges posed by counter-terrorism and climate change” and institutional advancements were highlighted with the retention of the National Commission for Human Rights’ “A” status under the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions and the continued independent functioning of the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) and the National Commission on the Status of Women.
The delegation was also informed that implementation of the National Action Plans on Human Rights and Business and Human Rights was ongoing at the federal and provincial levels.
It was also briefed on key initiatives promoting gender equality, including the National Gender Policy Framework (2022), gender-responsive budgeting and provincial measures.
“Flagship programmes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, benefiting over 9.1 million women and the Prime Minister’s Women Empowerment Package were highlighted as major drivers of women’s socio-economic inclusion.
“Progress on child rights was emphasised, including the establishment of NCRC, Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Agency and Child Protection Institutes, alongside recent child marriage restraint legislation. Efforts continue to address child labour, online exploitation and out-of-school children,” the press release said.
The Pakistani side further reaffirmed its commitment to freedom of expression and media safety, supported by the National Commission for Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals, and provided updates on sensitive human-rights measures, including reductions in capital offences, implementation of the Mercy Petition Policy, enforcement of the Torture and Custodial Death Act and an over 85 per cent resolution of cases by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances.
Tarar also underlined the country’s “robust constitutional and legal safeguards”, noting Pakistan’s recent election to the UN Human Rights Council as a “testament to the international community’s confidence in its constructive role”.

 

The press release pointed out that the delegation highlighted “certain areas for further attention” regarding human rights in the country and key issues requiring government action, including the need for strengthened policies, legislation, and robust institutions to effectively fulfil Pakistan’s obligations under the 27 core United Nations conventions.
“The minister reassured the delegation that the government of Pakistan remains fully committed to these obligations and noted that progress achieved to date, ongoing challenges, and future plans would be shared in detail during the delegation’s ongoing visit.
“The minister welcomed the EU’s constructive suggestions on enhancing data integration, inter-provincial coordination, treaty reporting and implementation mechanisms. Pakistan has taken these points on board and is advancing progress through strengthened reporting, provincial engagement and robust monitoring,” it said.
The press release concluded by saying that the ministry officials also commended ongoing EU-Pakistan cooperation under the Huqooq-i-Pakistan Project and reaffirmed its commitment to sustaining GSP+ progress, advancing human rights and promoting an inclusive, rights-based, and sustainable future.
GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports. Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
Pakistan and the EU underlined the importance last week of further deepening trade and investment ties, including through the GSP+ scheme, as a driver for sustainable growth, export diversification, job creation and mutually beneficial economic opportunity.
Earlier that week, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis had said the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the GSP+ scheme ahead of a review.</p><small>2025-11-27 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2718031334dd9ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957712/sindh-assembly-rejects-indian-defence-ministers-delusional-remarks-on-province-as-attempt-to-distort-history' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh Assembly rejects Indian defence minister’s ‘delusional’ remarks on province as attempt to distort history</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Assembly on Thursday rejected the remarks of India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh regarding the province as “delusional” and said they were a deliberate attempt to distort history.
On Sunday, Singh said that “civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India”, and that “who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again”. His words were strongly rebuked by the Foreign Office as “dangerously revisionist remarks” that revealed an expansionist Hindutva mindset.
The Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, stating that the House “unequivocally condemns the Defence Minister of India’s statement as delusional, inflammatory, and a deliberate distortion of history, made in violation of diplomatic norms and international law”.
The resolution, moved by Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, said the assembly asserted “with absolute clarity that Sindh is, and will forever remain, an inseparable and integral part” of Pakistan, and rejected any narrative, however absurd, which suggested otherwise.







The lawmakers rejected “with full force all revisionist, expansionist, and politically motivated claims emanating from India that attempt to rewrite the history of Sindh, Pakistan, or the movement for independence”.
It further condemned the extremist policies of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government that “threaten regional peace, undermine civilisational heritage, weaponise water resources, and endanger the environmental security of millions”.
The resolution also called upon the government to “pursue decisive diplomatic, legal, and multilateral action to protect the Indus River, defend Pakistan’s rights under international treaties, and hold India accountable for violations of water, environmental, or humanitarian norms”.
New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in April this year based on unsubstantiated claims regarding the Pahalgam attack, which were strongly refuted by Islamabad. A Sydney-based think-tank warned last month that India could manipulate river flows in the near term, presenting an “acute” danger for Pakistan.

 

In its resolution, the House expressed “firm solidarity with all communities, within Pakistan and across India, who respect the sanctity of the Indus, reject extremism and revisionism, and uphold the principles of justice, coexistence, and peace”.
The resolution presented by Chawla noted that Sindh was an “ancient civilisation with its own enduring identity, culture, a political consciousness, rooted in history far older and deeper than any modern state”.
It highlighted that the “people of Sindh, asserting their right to autonomy and dignity, chose in 1936 to separate from the Bombay Presidency, long before the creation of Pakistan, thereby demonstrating a clear and unequivocal will for self-governance”.
“Sindh was the first province to adopt the historic resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan, playing a decisive and irreplaceable role in the establishment of the nation envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” it stated.

 

The House described statements made by senior members of the Modi government as not only “historically baseless but also reflect a reckless, provocative, and revisionist agenda aimed at distorting facts and destabilising the region”.
“The people of Sindh, the people of Pakistan, and all fair-minded citizens of India reject such destructive policies and recognise the Indus as a sacred, life-giving artery of our collective civilisation,” it added.
The resolution stated: “The Modi government has overseen the gravest aggression against the Indus River in recorded history — an act that constitutes a violation of international laws and a breach of the Indus Waters Treaty, and an assault on the very ecological civilisational foundations of South Asia.
“An attack on the Indus River is an attack on a shared civilisation and millions of livelihoods, and on the cultural and environmental heritage that binds the region together,” it added.
The National Assembly later passed a similar resolution by PPP MNA Asad Alam Niazi denouncing the remarks.
“These statements are historically incorrect, politically irresponsible and contrary to the recognised geopolitical realities of the Indo-Pak region. The House reaffirms that Sindh is an integral part of the sovereign State of Pakistan and urges all individuals and institutions to refrain from making misleading, biased and destabilising statements,” it reads.







CM Murad urges Centre to raise issue on int’l level
During the assembly session, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah delivered a strong speech, condemning Singh’s statements and demanding that the federal government raise the issue at the international level.
“We demand from the Centre through this resolution that the Government of Pakistan raise this matter before the world,” he said.
“The Government of Pakistan should send this resolution to the world and tell them that India wants to occupy the Sindh River,” the chief minister added.

 

Reaffirming the province’s loyalty, he declared: “Sindh is a part of Pakistan and will always remain so, and its boundaries can not be changed.”
CM Murad stressed that the international community must be informed of India’s aggressive actions and statements. Following his speech, the resolution against the Indian defence minister’s remarks was unanimously approved by the Sindh Assembly.
The chief minister labelled Singh as panicked. “He is suffering from a state of perplexity. India’s panic began after [a specified event].
“The Indian defence minister was born in Uttar Pradesh. He has never drunk the water of Sindhu (Indus), and that is why his mind is corrupted,” Murad quipped, accusing India of attempting to weaponise the river.







Emphasising the historical and cultural significance of Sindh, the chief minister said, “The impression given by the defence minister of India is deplorable.”
He highlighted Sindh’s ancient history, noting its existence even before the Common Era. “The resolution that was presented narrates the entire history,” he pointed out. “Multan and Makran were included in the ancient maps of Sindh,” he added.
CM Murad highlighted the contributions of Sindhi leaders to the nation’s founding. “The Muslim League Sindh Chapter presented the Pakistan Resolution,” he said, adding that Pakistan was formed “due to the sacrifices of our elders”.

The ruling PML-N secured close to 64 per cent of the total votes polled in the by-elections for six National Assembly constituencies held on Sunday as it emerged victorious on all seats. Five constituencies were located in Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These seats, except for one, were vacated due to the disqualification of the opposition PTI MNAs.
The PML-N also won six out of seven Punjab Assembly seats in the province by securing 82.41pc of the polled votes. On the seventh seat, it had not fielded its candidate in PP-269, Muzaffargarh, against PPP nominee Alamdar Qureshi.
The ECP notified the following PML-N members as MNAs: Mahmood Qadir Khan for NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), Mohammad Nauman for NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), Muhammad Tufail for NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), Danyal Ahmad for NA-104 (Faisalabad-X) and Babar Nawaz for NA-18 (Haripur).
Excluding Nawaz, the four were later administered their oath by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq as the assembly’s 22nd session commenced.







Meanwhile, PPP’s Qureshi was notified for PP-269 (Muzaffargarh-II) and PML-N’s Sultan Ali Ranjha for PP-73 (Sargodha-III), Ali Haider Noor Khan Niazi for PP-87 (Mianwali-III), Azad Ali Tabassum for PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), Tahir Pervaiz for PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), Ahmad Shehryar for PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and Muhammad Hanif for PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI).
Meanwhile, for NA-96, ECP spokesperson Duriya Amir said: “Notification of the success of the successful candidate from NA-96 Faisalabad has been stopped. A code of conduct case is pending in the election commission against Talal Chaudhry and Bilal Chaudhry.”
The ECP had decided on Monday to withhold Bilal’s victory notification over the minister’s alleged violation of the code of conduct.
A four-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja took up the case for hearing. The state minister, who had been summoned, did not turn up. During the hearing, the bench observed that the state minister clearly violated the code of conduct.
It was emphasised that, as per the code, the minister was not authorised to participate in any election campaign and that strict action should be taken ag­­ainst him. The CEC rem­arked that Talal did not even bother to appear before the bench.
In response, the minister’s lawyer said that his client would appear before the commission. Later, the Election Commission exempted him from attendance for the first hearing. The CEC clarified that Bilal Chaudhry was not being disqualified; only the notification of his victory would be withheld. The hearing was adjourned till December 2.
By-poll performance
The PML-N had bagged 564,400 votes out of a total 883,108 or 63.91pc of the votes cast for the six National Assembly seats. In a surprising outcome, the PML-N also snatched from the PTI the NA-18 seat (Haripur, KP) against all expectations.
Political analysts had been hoping that at least this seat would be retained by the PTI because of certain factors, including the fact that KP is being ruled by the PTI, so there were minimal chances of rigging in the constituency.
“Now the PPP cannot blackmail the PML-N for the passage of the annual federal budget,” Dr Rashid Ahmad Khan, former head of Punjab University’s Political Science Department, had told Dawn, referring to the simple majority the PML-N would attain in the National Assembly after grabbing the six NA seats.
Discussing the factors about the defeat of the PTI in NA-18, he said the voters were alienated, believing that when their ballots were not “honoured” in the 2024 general elections, it would serve no purpose this time either. Also, it became clear that the PTI leadership without Imran Khan was unable to mobilise supporters, he added.
Endorsing his views, Pakistan Study Centre Director Dr Amjad Magsi had said that the PTI leadership was not clear-headed and failed to fully run the election campaign, while the lack of its traditional election symbol also played a role in the defeat. He said the turnout in the by-elections was low due to disappointment among the PTI supporters.</p><small>2025-11-27 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27122808e8c1789.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957696/amid-reports-of-arbitrary-offloading-of-passengers-fia-official-says-only-those-without-valid-documents-being-barred-from-travelling-abroad' target='_blank'><strong>Amid reports of arbitrary offloading of passengers, FIA official says only those without valid documents being barred from travelling abroad</strong></a><br><p>Amid reports regarding the arbitrary offloading of passengers travelling abroad, an official from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Thursday clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.
However, the FIA officer noted that a lot of people were those “who get deceived by various human smugglers in some way”.
Zia detailed that FIA immigration officials at airports check the travel documents of “all those people and profile them”, asserting that no one going abroad for a valid purpose was being stopped.
“All those who are denied from going abroad are refused due to them not having valid documents, or if they have permits or visas wherein the companies stated do not exist, and we have suspicions that human smugglers are trapping them and taking them abroad.’’



“We have seen cases where people get deceived by these human smugglers and change their routes mid-transit, or take an accomplice with them in the form of their mother or sister, through which they can exit here with the [safeguard] of an Umrah [visa],” Zia said.
He added there had been past cases where such people were deported from other countries, following which the FIA’s Anti-Human Trafficking Cell registers a case, conducts an inquiry and “such human traffickers are brought to a halt”.
He urged the public not to be fooled by migrant smugglers. The FIA officer said those networks were negatively portraying the matter to “create unrest” and secure financial gains for themselves.
He recalled the Mauritania and Greece boat capsize incidents, saying that innocent people were shown “dreams of Europe” and smuggled out of Pakistan via dunki (illegal land routes) or by transiting in other countries, only to be pressured into handing over exorbitant amounts of cash or even losing their lives.

 

“Not only does Pakistan’s name on an international level get maligned and the value of our green passport declines, but many countries have also created difficulties for us in obtaining visas,” the FIA Lahore director said.
Zia assured the public that immigration staff would facilitate all those who were travelling abroad for legitimate reasons with valid documents.
The FIA’s Facebook post said “such fabricated content aims to misguide the public and undermine institutional credibility”, and urged citizens to rely only on verified information from official FIA platforms.
Earlier this week, BBC Urdu reported that it spoke to some of the offloaded individuals, including a 25-year-old man from Hyderabad who had obtained a work visa for Saudi Arabia.
Another person, aged 35, who hailed from Punjab’s Sargodha, was stopped from travelling to Saudi Arabia from Karachi, and later also barred from travelling to Dubai from Lahore for work.
A resident of Punjab’s Jhang told BBC Urdu he was offloaded from Karachi as officials questioned why he was using that airport instead of the nearby one in Lahore, the reason for which he said was a cheaper ticket.
Earlier this week, it emerged that a number of genuine businessmen and tourists lodged a strong protest against the “harsh policy” to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, FIA Gujranwala Zone Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:38</small></div><hr>
