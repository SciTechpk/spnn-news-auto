The launch was marked by a seminar held to review and audit vulnerable public infra­­structure and buildings.
The initiative is aimed at ensuring coordinated nationwide implementation of the Infrastructure Audit Prog­ra­mme 2026 by bringing fede­ral and provincial stakeholders onto a single platform.
At the seminar, the NDMA presented the approved concept note establishing the na­­tional framework for the In­­frastructure Audit Program­­me, which has received formal endorsement from the Prime Minister’s Office for implementation across both federal and provincial levels.
Pakistan has repeatedly incurred heavy human and economic losses due to floods, earthquakes, and climate-in­duced disasters, said Federal Minister for Housing and Works Mian Riaz Hus­sain Pirzada while addressing the seminar as chief guest.
He said the losses were largely attributable not only to natural hazards but also to vulnerable and inadequately prepared infrastructure. He emphasised the urgent need to transition from a reactive, post-disaster response model to one focused on early identification of structural weaknesses and timely mitigation.
Mr Pirzada commended the NDMA for initiating this forward-looking programme in the national interest and said the Infrastructure Audit Programme represented a paradigm shift from respon­­se to prevention and from assumptions to evidence-based decision-making.
He said that systematic inf­rastructure health asse­ss­me­nts under the programme wou­­ld help identify risks in critical buildings, safeguard public assets, and enable inf­ormed planning and investment. He reaffirmed his ministry’s complete support to the NDMA in advancing the national initiative.
Speaking on the occasion, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said the seminar aimed to initiate co­­ordinated nationwide implementation of the Infra­stru­cture Audit Programme 2026 by bringing federal and provincial stakeholders onto a single platform.
He said the focus was to build a shared understanding of the audit framework, clarify roles and responsibilities, and align strategies and timelines to ensure systematic assessment and strengthening of critical infrastructure across the country during disasters and natural calamities.
Participants were briefed on the programme’s rationale, scope, and phased implementation plan, including prioritisation of high-occupancy and high-risk buildings, adoption of standardised audit methodologies such as visual inspections and non-destructive testing, development of digital reporting and decision-support systems, and incorporation of resilience indicators into infrastructure planning.
The seminar was attended by senior officials from federal and provincial governments, representatives of building control and development authorities, technical experts, engineers, academia, and development partners.
Published in Dawn, January 8th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-08 03:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08080518282f29f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965752/cabinet-halts-hike-in-fuel-margins' target='_blank'><strong>Cabinet halts hike in fuel margins</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Wednesday reportedly blocked an increase in dealers’ commission and oil marketing companies’ profit margin approved by its Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) early last month.
Informed sources told Dawn that the federal cabinet, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has linked the ECC-sanctioned Rs2.56 per litre additional bounty to the oil industry’s retail business for complete supply chain digitisation.
On Dec 9, Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb presiding over the ECC meeting approved an additional build-up of Rs2.56 per litre on petrol and diesel prices in two phases to improve the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and their dealers.
The ECC announced that it had approved a proposal to revise the margins of OMCs and petroleum dealers on petroleum and high-speed diesel, adjusting them in line with the national Consumer Price Index for 2023-24 and 2024-25, with increases capped between 5pc and 10pc. “It also decided that half of the increase in the margins will be paid immediately, while the remaining half will be conditional on the digitisation progress, with the Petroleum Division to report back by June 1, 2026”, it said.

PM links commissions and margins to full digitisation of petroleum supply chain

Under the decision, ECC had allowed Rs1.22 per litre increase in profit margins for OMCs and Rs1.34 per litre for petroleum dealers, in two equal installments. The first increase of 61 paise per litre in sale margins for OMCs and 67 paise per litre for dealers was to come into force with the following fortnightly price revision on Dec 15 or 31. This was to immediately take the OMCs’ margin to Rs8.48 per litre, while that of dealers was to rise to Rs9.31 per litre.
The second equivalent increase was scheduled to come into force on June 1, 2026 subject to digitalisation of their sales and stocks network and its live connectivity to the government entities like the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, the Federal Board of Revenue and Petroleum Division. With that increase, the OMCs would have charged Rs9.10 per litre while dealers were to get about Rs9.98 on sale of every litre. At present, OMCs are paid Rs7.87 per litre and dealers Rs8.64.
However, the government did not change revised rates for dealers and OMCs in two subsequent quarterly pricing revisions on Dec 15 and 31, although product prices were reduced significantly. When contacted, an official said the prime minister who had been personally pushing Digital Pakistan Initiative besides digitalisation of the entire petroleum sector from production to consumption stage and facilitated passage of an enabling law, opposed the two-phased hike in retail margins and linked implementation of ECC decision to 100pc digitisation, potentially with effect from June 1, 2026.
This followed a law passed in August last year by the parliament for digital tracking and monitoring of all petroleum products from import and production stage to storage, transportation and sales at retail outlets to minimise the menace of smuggling and adulteration, causing an estimated Rs300-500bn annual revenue loss besides associated environmental and engine degradation.
The Petroleum (Amendment) Act 2025 envisaged new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb the smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All the local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding individually and from their collective forums from the government to take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sales to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused revenue loss to the government.

Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey adamantly rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fired in self-defence, saying he has seen video of the shooting that contradicts the government’s “garbage narrative”.
“They’re already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence,” he said at a press conference. “Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly - that is nonsense.”
A visibly angry Frey said federal immigration agents were responsible for sowing chaos in the city, telling ICE: “Get out of Minneapolis.”
But he also urged residents to remain calm.
The shooting drew protesters into the streets near the scene, some of whom were met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical irritants at the demonstrators.

Trump has frequently employed the US military — which is currently funded at record spending levels — since returning to office, including strikes on Yemeni rebels, Iranian nuclear sites and alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as a brazen special forces raid to abduct Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.
“I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump said on Truth Social.







“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” the US president said.
Trump said the increase is possible due to revenue from the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on friend and foe alike.
The United States is already by far the world’s biggest military spender, and a hike to $1.5 trillion would push Washington’s financial outlay on its armed forces even farther ahead of its rivals China and Russia, though it could also spark an arms race with such countries.
Trump slams defence companies
Trump’s announcement on boosting the US military budget comes after Nato allies committed last year to increase their defence spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035 in response to pressure from the US president.
Even as he announced a budget goal that would be a major boon to defence contractors, Trump took aim at them in posts on Truth Social.
Defence contractors are “issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” while pay packages for defence executives are “exorbitant and unjustifiable,” Trump said.







The president said salaries should be capped at $5 million and that he would prohibit stock buybacks and dividends “until such time as these problems are rectified,” without specifying how he would do so.
The announcement took the markets by surprise, sending US companies in the defence sector — such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics — more than four per cent lower. Northrop Grumman lost more than five per cent.
Trump took aim at Raytheon specifically, saying the Defence Department told him the company was the “least responsive” to its needs and the “slowest in increasing their volume”.







Raytheon must boost its investments in plants and equipment, Trump said, threatening it with a loss of US government business if it does not comply.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/080728395e68664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965740/us-says-it-needs-to-control-venezuelan-oil-sales-indefinitely-to-drive-change' target='_blank'><strong>US says it needs to control Venezuelan oil sales indefinitely to drive change</strong></a><br><p>The US needs to control Venezuela’s oil sales and revenue indefinitely to stabilise that country’s economy, rebuild its oil sector and ensure it acts in America’s interests, top US officials said on Wednesday.
The comments reflect the importance of crude oil to US President Donald Trump’s strategy in Venezuela after US forces abducted and deposed the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a raid on the capital Caracas on Saturday.
“We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,” US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech & Utilities Conference in Miami.

 

He said the revenues would be used to stabilise Venezuela’s economy and eventually to repay oil majors Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips for losses when their assets were nationalised by former president Hugo Chavez nearly two decades ago.
US Vice President JD Vance said that controlling Venezuela’s oil meant controlling the country.
“We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime: ‘You‘re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America‘s national interest; you‘re not allowed to sell it if you can‘t serve America‘s national interest,” he told Fox News.







“And that’s how we exert incredible pressure on that country without wasting a single American life, without endangering a single American citizen,” he said.
Democratic lawmakers criticised this approach, which Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy equated to stealing Venezuela’s oil at gunpoint, while industry analysts warned about political instability as the country treads a fine line between denouncing Maduro’s abduction and appeasing the US.
The OPEC member nation sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves but accounts for only about one per cent of global supply after decades of underinvestment eroded production.
Stored oil moving to market first
US Energy Secretary Wright said the US would market stored Venezuelan oil first and then sell ongoing future production indefinitely with revenues deposited into accounts controlled by the US government.
Such sales already have begun and the US has engaged “the world’s leading commodity marketers and key banks” to execute and provide financial support for them, according to a statement from the US Department of Energy.

 

Wright added he was speaking to US oil companies to learn what conditions would enable them to enter Venezuela to help boost the country’s production in the longer term.
“The resources are immense. This should be a wealthy, prosperous, peaceful energy powerhouse,” he said.
On Tuesday, Washington announced a deal with Caracas to initially export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a sign the government of interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez is responding to Trump’s demand that it open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump said on Wednesday in a post on Truth Social that Venezuela has agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to purchase American-made goods.
“A wise choice, and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela, and the United States,” he wrote.







Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA said it was progressing in negotiations with the United States for oil sales. PDVSA board member Wills Rangel told Reuters the US will need to buy cargoes at fair market prices.
Shares of US refiners Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy were up between 2.5pc and 5pc.
White House meetings
Trump is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela’s oil production.
Representatives from Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron — the top three US oil companies — would be present, according to a source familiar with the planning.
Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson will represent that company at the meeting, another source said.
The companies, all of which have experience in Venezuela, have declined to comment.
Wright said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday afternoon that he spoke with the CEOs of all three companies immediately after Maduro was seized, and expected them to be engaged in rehabilitating Venezuela’s oil sector.
“Are they going to put billions of dollars into building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not,” he said. “But they want to be productive advisers and helpers in that process.”
Wright also told CNBC that some of the proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales could eventually be used to repay ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil for losses when they exited the country, but only after Venezuela’s economy is stabilized.
Chevron is the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Venezuela was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s. But mismanagement and limited foreign investment have since led to a huge drop in annual production, which averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year.
Wright said he believed Venezuelan production could be increased within a short period with an infusion of equipment and technology, but that a bigger recovery to past production levels would take years.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695edec2242bd.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965716/us-seizes-oil-tanker-linked-to-russia-in-north-atlantic' target='_blank'><strong>US seizes oil tanker linked to Russia in North Atlantic</strong></a><br><p>• White House says crew will be prosecuted; Hegseth asserts naval blockade in full effect ‘around the world’• Trump boasts of getting ‘30-50m barrels’ of crude; energy secy claims US will control Venezuelan oil ‘indefinitely’
WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after pursuing it from off the coast of Venezuela, in an operation that incensed Moscow.
Washington claims the tanker is part of a so-called ‘shadow fleet’ that carries oil for countries such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran in violation of US sanctions, and seized it despite the ship even though it was escorted by a Russian naval submarine.
The vessel had thwarted an earlier attempt to board it last month near Venezuela.
“The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court,” the US European Command, which oversees American forces in the region, said in a statement on X.







After the seizure of the Russian oil tanker, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth posted that the US blockade on Venezuelan oil was in full effect “anywhere in the world”.







Later, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the crew of the seized oil tanker was subject to prosecution.
“The vessel had a judicial seizure order… so that means the crew is now subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution, if necessary,” she said.
Russia slams US action
Russia’s Transport Ministry slammed the oil tanker’s seizure, saying “freedom of navigation applies in waters on the high seas, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states”.

 

“In accordance with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation applies in waters on the high seas, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,” Russia’s transport ministry said in a statement.
The vessel — which changed its name from Bella-1 to Marinera — had received “temporary permission” to sail under the Russian flag on December 24, the ministry said, adding that “contact with the ship was lost” after US naval forces boarded it “in the open sea, beyond the territorial waters of any state”.
The US military also announced a second sanctioned tanker ship had been seized in the Caribbean Sea.
Last weekend, US special forces had seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from Caracas in an unprecendented raid, and took them to New York “to face trial on drug charges”.
Since then, President Donald Trump has said that the US will “run” Venezuela and US companies will control its critical oil industry.
He is due to meet with US oil executives on Friday (tomorrow) over plans for Venezuela’s oil sector.
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said that 30-50 million barrels of “high quality, sanctioned” Venezuelan crude will be shipped to US ports, with the revenue — perhaps more than $2 billion at current market prices — placed under his personal control.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright later added that Washington would control sales of Venezuelan oil “indefinitely”.
It was not clear whether Venezuela’s new ruler — interim president Delcy Rodriguez — has agreed to hand over the oil, how the plan would work, or what its legal basis would be.
China may switch to Iranian crude
Meanwhile, Chinese refiners are expected to switch to heavy crude from sources including Iran in coming months to replace Venezuelan shipments halted since the US kidnapped the country’s president, traders and analysts said.
China, the world’s biggest crude importer, is a major buyer of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.

According to a notification issued late on Wednesday night, the regulator has determined separate consumer-end tariffs for each distribution company (ex-Wapda Discos) in view of their differing revenue requirements and permitted levels of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.
For CY26, the national average tariff has been set at Rs33.38 per kWh, down from Rs34.00 per kWh in 2025-26.
The Gujranwala, Quetta, Multan, Sukkur, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Tribal Areas and Hazara electric power companies had filed multi-year tariff petitions for the period 2025-26 to 2029-30, which have now been determined by the regulator.
In line with policy guidelines issued by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) and following the federal cabinet’s approval of the annual rebasing of consumer-end tariffs with effect from Jan 1, Nepra rebased the tariffs and issued its determination for the calendar year January-December 2026.
The determined tariffs have been communicated to the federal government for submission of the uniform tariff application.
The total revenue requirement of ex-Wapda Discos has been projected at Rs3.379 trillion, comprising Rs2.923tr for power purchase costs and Rs456.15 billion for distribution companies’ margins and prior-year adjustments, based on projected sales of 101,234 gigawatt-hours during CY26.

Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as special representative to Afghanistan during the first Trump administration, tweeted on Wednesday that it was “a misunderstanding… to think that the agreement covered Afghanistan-Pakistan issues”.
In a post on his X account, he also attached the text of the agreement, which — among other things — contained a commitment to prevent the soil of Afghanistan being used by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies.
However, he posited that “a similar agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan… would serve the interests of both countries”.







Expanding on the idea, Mr Khalilzad said that the accord should be one “in which both countries commit to not allow any individual or group including ISIS and TTP to use its territories to threaten the security of the other, and in which they accept third party monitoring of such.”
“Based on recent conversations with Taliban leaders, I believe they are prepared to negotiate such an agreement. And it could be game-changing for the relations between these two neighbours,” he wrote on X.
Mr Khalilzad, who facilitated negotiations between Kabul and Washington to secure the freedom of US citizens being held in Afghanistan, is viewed by both capitals as an invaluable interlocutor.
In Washington circles, Mr Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.

The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East.
The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region.
One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.
The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.
The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal.
Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday.
Tested in combat
Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets.
He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.
The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told Reuters, adding that it’s also cost-effective.
The aircraft was deployed during the conflict with India last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.
The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond.
The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.
Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.
In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn support package for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.
Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.
Arms sales outreach
Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.
Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.
Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.
On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.
“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News.
Pakistan is currently under a $7bn IMF programme, its 24th, which followed a short-term $3bn deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/072258580cb6d00.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965648/hes-not-that-happy-with-me-trump-mocks-indias-modi-while-recalling-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>‘He’s not that happy with me’: Trump mocks India’s Modi while recalling meeting</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday jibed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while recounting a meeting between the two, where the Indian PM had asked to meet the US president.
While addressing the House GOP (Grand Old Party) Members’ Retreat, Trump recounted a meeting with Modi, stating that Modi had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the US and had waited five years.
“Prime Minister Modi came to see me. [He said] ‘Sir, may I see you, please?’ Yes,” Trump recalled.
“I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now, because they’re not doing the oil,” he added, referring to India halting imports of Russian oil.
Trump also noted that the US is “getting rich because of tariffs”.
Meanwhile, India’s opposition Congress party took to X and uploaded a caricature of the scene, showing a timid Modi.







In a separate post in Hindi, Congress claimed that Modi went to the US uninvited to meet Trump after he took office last January, quoting the Indian PM’s request to meet him.
“You must remember - among the world‘s leaders, Modi is the only one whom Trump did not come to receive at the gate,” the party wrote, attaching a video of Trump’s remarks.







In response to the remarks, Indian lawmaker Priyanka Chaturvedi took to X and wrote, “His (Trump’s) condescending tone for India’s PM is demeaning. The GoI’s (Government of India) silence to all his insulting statements is bizarre because it reflects poorly on our nation.”
Former Indian minister Subhramanian Swamy shared this post.







The US is imposing 50 per cent tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil, causing tensions to rise between the world’s two largest democracies and strategic partners.
A punitive 25pc tariff was imposed due to India’s purchases of Russian oil, adding to Trump’s prior 25pc tariff on many products from India. It took total duties as high as 50pc for goods such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals — among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and China.
However, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One that he could raise the tariffs already in place.
“Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday.
“They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.</p><small>2026-01-07 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07210602cd0e8a2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965644/in-pictures-robots-gadgets-and-innovations-light-up-the-future-at-ces-2026' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Robots, gadgets and innovations light up the future at CES 2026</strong></a><br><p>Robots took centre stage at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 6, as the annual technology show opened to the public.

This photo essay documents the machines, their makers and the moments of interaction that reveal how near that future may be.

The federal government on October 4, 2025, signed an agreement with the JAAC to end the tense situation prevailing in the region since late September. The AJK government claimed it had resolved or was moving towards resolution of more than 90 per cent of the issues outlined by the JAAC.
“We have implemented all matters that were within our domain. However, federally funded projects are approved through a defined process, and that naturally takes time,” Minister for Information and Religious Affairs Muhammad Rafique Nayyar said at a press conference.
“Similarly, matters related to constitutional amendments also take time because they pass through different stages,” he added.
Nayyar said the PPP-led government, under AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, had worked day and night during its one-and-a-half months in power to resolve public issues.
“The prime minister is young and energetic. He has removed the word ‘rest’ from his lexicon and has kept himself and his team constantly on their toes for public welfare,” he said.
Nayyar added that the atmosphere of inertia in the prime minister’s office and the ministers’ block had come to an end and the government had held a record five cabinet meetings within 90 days, approving measures to resolve public matters on a fast-track basis.
“The biggest challenge for the present government has been restoring public trust, a task in which, by the grace of Allah, it is succeeding.”
Listing steps taken by the government in connection with the agreement, Nayyar said that since PM Rathore himself was among the signatories on behalf of the AJK government, it placed an even greater responsibility on the government to ensure its implementation.
Regarding the reduction in the property transfer tax, he said the cabinet had already approved reducing the property transfer tax to 8.5pc, and a notification would be issued after the required legislation was enacted.
As for health cards, Nayyar said the government was not facing any financial constraints and that negotiations with the relevant company were underway. The prime minister, he said, set a deadline of January 20 to resolve the issue.
Responding to a question as to why the government was not holding talks with the JAAC, Nayyar said the government was always ready for negotiations and wanted to move forward by taking all stakeholders on board.
“Our sincerity can also be gauged from the fact that the prime minister himself went to the house of a core member of the Action Committee. We are available 24 hours a day. If talks are to be held, just give us half an hour’s notice,” he said.
Nayyar clarified that the AJK government was not functioning under the agreement with the JAAC but under the public mandate. However, he added, the government remained fully committed to implementing all commitments made in the public interest.
The minister expressed regret that talks held in Islamabad on January 2 were attended by representatives of the federal and AJK governments, but members of the JAAC did not turn up.
Describing AJK as a highly sensitive region, Nayyar said the ancestors of its people had made immense sacrifices for its freedom.
“Our objective is to maintain an atmosphere of peace and order in the state and to resolve all legitimate public issues, and we will spare no effort to achieve this,” he added.
In response to another question, Nayyar said the PPP would contest the next elections based on its performance and would once again seek the people’s trust. He said elections would be held on time, as there was no provision in the Constitution for their cancellation.
The information minister said that when he had previously held the information portfolio two-and-a-half years ago, he had visited press clubs across AJK and made efforts to resolve their issues.
“We will seek guidance from the media and will take every possible step to strengthen it,” he added.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down towards the end of September last year.
Rival groups then staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
After two rounds of talks, an agreement between the JAAC, the AJK government and the federal government was reached.
On December 29, the federal government notified a nine-member committee to deliberate on a contentious clause of the agreement, the abolition of elite privileges and 12 seats reserved for Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir.
Under its terms of reference, the committee will deliberate on the issue of “members of the AJK Legislative Assembly other than the AJK constituencies (sic)” and has been auth­orised to meet as frequently as required and submit its recommendations to the Monitoring and Implementation (M&I) Commit­tee constituted under the Muzaf­farabad Agreement.</p><small>2026-01-07 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07221832fd8b34c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965647/noor-advances-to-squash-quarterfinal-after-egyptian-opponent-gets-aggressive-with-referee-abandons-match' target='_blank'><strong>Noor advances to squash quarterfinal after Egyptian opponent gets aggressive with referee, abandons match</strong></a><br><p>Tempers flared and expletives were hurled across the squash court faster than the ball as Egyptian squash player Fares Dessouky got into a heated argument with the referee and abandoned the match in the fifth game, which automatically allowed Pakistan’s Noor Zaman to advance to the quarterfinal of the Karachi Open.
Home favourite Noor was Pakistan’s last hope to make it to the quarterfinals after Ashab Irfan and Nasir Iqbal were eliminated from the tournament earlier in the day.
Noor was two sets down as Dessouky took the first two games 11-8, 11-9.

         View this post on Instagram            

Tensions had been building throughout the match, with Dessouky in the second game questioning how the score had reached 6-4 when it should have been 5-4. Spectators and international athletes alike, as well as squash icon Jahangir Khan sitting front row to the action, murmured that the score should be 5-4.
Dessouky took the second game as Noor’s coach gave him a pep talk that ostensibly helped him win the third game 11-5.
Dessouky, currently world number 15 with a career-high of seven, went neck-and-neck with Noor for the fourth game, which Noor ultimately took 11-9.
The Egyptian waited for Noor to exit the court before staring down the referee and asking him where he’s from, “because this is unbelievable”.
Spectators had climbed onto chairs and clung to every available surface to see the match, whose fifth set would decide whether Pakistan had another shot at a championship win or if the dominant Egyptians would prevail.
Noor was on his way to a potential match victory after he took the lead and ran with it. The king of comebacks had clawed his way back to the U23 world title in similar fashion last year after being two games down from his opponent. Having reached his career-best world ranking last year, and defeating France’s Melvil Scianimanico in the fifth set on Tuesday, Noor was in the zone to win today’s match.
At 6-3, Dessouky slammed his racket to the ground in frustration against the referee’s stroke decision. Referee Sajjad Khan, a member of the Asian Squash Referees, gave him a conduct warning for his behaviour.
No sooner had the fifth game continued that Dessouky blew a fuse and opened the door mid-game, which is not allowed and can result in a penalty depending on the referee’s decision.
The referee calmly asked him to shut the door and continue with the game but Dessouky began unleashing his wrath on the referee perched high on his seat.
“Close the door. Otherwise I’ll use the code of conduct. Just play on,” referee Khan said as Dessouky yelled “this is unbelievable” and a silent Noor watched on from the court.
Dessouky hurled expletives at the referee and said he does not care if he receives a conduct match, which means he willingly abandoned the match, thus, allowing Noor an automatic spot in the quarterfinal.
The two players shook hands and Noor clapped Dessouky on the back before bowing down in prayer. Dessouky warned Khan he would file a complaint against him with the PSA (Professional Squash Association), to which Khan replied the same.
The sea of spectators parted ways in the narrow corridor to allow a fuming Dessouky to pass through, who packed up his gear and stormed outside the arena. Onlookers were shocked and amused at the drama they had witnessed.
It was not the first time Dessouky had a conduct warning issued against him; a conduct game was awarded to him for his behaviour during the third game of the Egyptian Open in 2024 against compatriot Tarek Momen.
”The referee was fine in all his decisions, I don’t know what happened to [Dessouky] after 6-2; he just lost it and threw his racket and started swearing in English,” Noor said to Dawn right after the match.
“I feel sorry for him in a way, but this is also his fault.”
With the nation’s hopes for another championship title solely on him once again, Noor said he hopes to deliver on those expectations.
Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s Ashab Irfan was denied his dream of defeating a former world champion on home soil when his fairytale ending was denied by Karim Gawad as the Egyptian staged a comeback to prove why he’s one of the world’s best squash players.
Ashab gave the 34-year-old a run for his money as he sent the Egyptian into every corner of the Creek Club glass court right from the first game.
The sparse audience applauded every point Ashab scored, not just because he was one of three Pakistani players today, but because he was demolishing the former world number one he once idolised as a child.
Ashab took the first game 11-7 after carving out a lead for himself that Gawad could chase. The second game was closer but Ashab took it 11-9 to the delight of the home crowd.
Gawad took the third set 11-5 before defeating Ashab 11-8 in the fourth game. Ashab seemed to be losing steam against the men’s top seed and current world number four.

 

The Egyptian finished the game and match 11-5 to advance to the quarterfinal, where he takes on world number 17 Eain Yow Ng of Malaysia.
Pakistan’s sole wildcard entrant, Nasir Iqbal, opened the day with a 3-1 loss to budding Egyptian teenager Muhamad Zakaria. The fifth seed, world number 11 took the first game 11-6 before Nasir found his momentum and won the second game 11-7.
Zakaria then proceeded to demolish Nasir 11-7, 11-5 to win the match and cruise into the quarterfinals, where he’ll play Hong Kong’s Alex Lau.
“[Zakaria] is an up-and-coming player ranked 11 in the world right now. Obviously my mindset coming into this match was to win, but I struggled to get into the momentum I wanted to,” Nasir told Dawn after the match.
“Other than that in terms of speed and experience and skills, I was happy with my performance; I just couldn’t match [Zakaria’s] pace,” he admitted, adding that he had barely just recovered from dengue fever before the Karachi Open.
Noor, Ashab and Nasir are likely to play in the Asian Team Championships in April, also being staged on home soil in the capital.</p><small>2026-01-07 17:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07183913329ab3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965641/iranian-president-orders-security-forces-not-to-crack-down-on-protesters-distinguish-them-from-rioters' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president orders security forces not to crack down on protesters, distinguish them from rioters</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday ordered security forces not to crack down on economic protests, drawing a distinction between peaceful demonstrators and armed “rioters”.
Pezeshkian’s statement comes as Iranian cities continue to see a wave of protests against economic hardship triggered by price rises and currency collapse.
Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) claimed on Tuesday at least 27 protesters have been killed during the demonstrations that kicked off with a shopkeeper’s strike in Tehran on December 28.
Iranian media outlets, relaying official announcements, have reported 13 deaths, including members of the security forces and a policeman who was shot dead on Tuesday.
In a video released by the news agency Mehr after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Iran Vice President Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah said Pezeshkian had “ordered that no security measures be taken against the demonstrators”.
“Those who carry firearms, knives and machetes and who attack police stations and military sites are rioters, and we must distinguish protesters from rioters,” Ghaempanah added.
Army chief warns Iran’s foes
General Amir Hatami, commander of the Iranian army and one of its most senior military officers, warned Tehran will not tolerate outside threats “without responding”.

According to the Fars news agency, Hatami said “if the enemy makes a mistake,” Iran’s response would be more robust than during last June’s 12-day war with Israel.
In recent days, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if demonstrators were killed, while Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for the protests.
The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of a 2022 to 2023 movement, let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.
But the economic protests have attracted international attention, including from the leaders of the Iran’s international foes.

 

“We’re watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump told reporters on Sunday.
Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israel’s cabinet: “We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice.”
The war in June began with an unprecedented Israeli attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.
The United States briefly took part in the strikes, hitting three major Iranian nuclear sites.
Tear gas in Grand Bazaar
The latest demonstrations have spread to the heart of the economy in Iran, the capital’s Grand Bazaar, and several more towns and cities, especially in the west of the country.
On Tuesday, clashes erupted in the Grand Bazaar for the first time since the protests began, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds. In one case, gas drifted into a hospital.
To disperse a crowd, “tear gas was used in the alley adjacent to the Sina Hospital”, the ISNA news agency reported, citing a statement from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
The Sina Hospital is affiliated with the university and is about two kilometres from the Grand Bazaar.
The university denied claims that tear gas had been deliberately fired at the hospital.
Elsewhere in the Iranian capital, calm appeared to have returned on Wednesday. AFP reporters saw residents conducting business as normal in the shops of Vali Asr, the grand thoroughfare that crosses the city from north to south.</p><small>2026-01-07 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0720241898d923b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965640/shadab-abrar-sahibzada-star-as-pakistan-beat-sri-lanka-in-first-t20i' target='_blank'><strong>Shadab, Abrar, Sahibzada star as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka in first T20I</strong></a><br><p>Featuring for Pakistan for the first time since June last year, Shadab Khan impressed with the ball, teaming up with Abrar Ahmed as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the opening fixture of the three-match Twenty20 International series at the Rangiri Dambulla Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.
The all-rounder took two wickets, while Abrar hunted three victims to restrict Sri Lanka to a paltry 128-run total before Sahibzada Farhan’s half century helped Pakistan chase down the target with 20 balls to spare.
Shadab gave away only 25 runs in his four overs, bagging both his wickets in his very first over and could have gone on to take a third had it not been for a dropped catch later on.
Coming into bowl in the seventh over, after Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza’s pace — that accounted for a wicket for each — saw Sri Lanka post 35-2 in the powerplay, Shadab trapped a sweeping Kusal Mendis lbw and induced an inside edge off Dhananjaya de Silva’s bat for wicket-keeper Usman Khan to take a good catch.
With Sri Lanka looking to break the stranglehold while at 59-4 by the halfway stage, it was an opportunity for Abrar to pounce on. The mystery spinner deceived Charith Asalanka into playing a googly across, only to be caught behind, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 72-5 halfway through the 12th over.
The incoming Wanindu Hasaranga initiated a counterattack of sorts lofting Abrar for a boundary in the 14th over.  Liyanage joined in a slap off Mohammad Nawaz through the covers before dispatching the left-arm spinner past long-on, bringing up the 100-run mark for Sri Lanka.
Luck followed for Liyanage as an edge flew off his bat for another boundary as 16 runs came in the 15th over.
Hasaranga targetted Abrar once again, clubbing him straight down the ground for another four, but holed the spinner to Fakhar Zaman at deep cover to depart for 18 off 12, ending the only partnership that looked to threaten Pakistan.
Liyanage (40 off 31) followed suit in the 18th, finding Nawaz in the deep off Abrar (3-25) as he tried to clear the long-on fence. 
Salman Mirza (3-18) returned to dismiss Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka and the incoming Dushmantha Chameera before Wasim (2-7) wrapped up the first innings proceedings.
Pakistan, in response, took off with a flurry of brilliant attacking shots by openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada lead the side to a 59-1 by the end of the powerplay, with Saim departing on the penultimate ball of the sixth over.
The left-hander was castled by Theekshana but only after having hit three fours and a six — a lofted drive over cover — for his 18-ball 24. Sahibzada, on the other end, had used brute power to dispatch Chameera for sixes down the ground and over square-leg.
Sahibzada continued the onslaught, welcoming Chameera back with a straight drive for four more before captain Salman Ali Agha, having just joined him, danced down the ground to play Hasaranga’s leg-spin over his head for another boundary.
The skipper pushed Theekshana for his second boundary in the next over as Pakistan posted 92-1 by the halfway stage, but holed a juicy full toss by Hasranga to long-on to depart for 16 off 10.
Sahibzada (51 off 36) brought up his third half century in five matches with a cut for three off Chameera in the 12th over, reaching the milestone in 35 balls. But the right-hander perished three balls later, finding Shanaka at mid-off off Chameera.
Pakistan received yet another blow when Fakhar was stumped off Dhananjaya de Silva with 23 runs needed off 40 balls.
The incoming Shadab (18 not out off 12), however, brought Pakistan within touching distance of a win with a square-drive and a pull for consecutive boundaries off Chameera in the 15th over before Pakistan crossed the finish line with 20 balls to spare.</p><small>2026-01-07 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07212133825488c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965645/pia-incurred-rs22bn-loss-due-to-prolonged-grounding-of-aircraft' target='_blank'><strong>PIA incurred Rs22bn loss due to prolonged grounding of aircraft</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Wednesday was informed that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) suffered a loss of Rs22 billion due to the prolonged grounding of its aircraft.
Officials from the Auditor General’s Office informed the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that PIA aircraft spent an extended period in routine maintenance, ranging from 44 to 239 days, resulting in substantial losses in 2022.
One aircraft was grounded for 652 days, officials revealed while discussing the Aviation Division’s audit objections for the year 2023-24.
The audit department was of the view that, due to the management’s negligence, extended delays occurred, resulting in unjustified operational and financial losses of Rs21.82 billion.
Similarly, PIA incurred further losses of Rs8.6 billion due to the failure to dispose of spare parts or retired aircraft. The audit observed that the management held an inventory of spare parts from retired aircraft valued at Rs8.566 billion for the period 2015–2021, which had not been disposed of in violation of rules. The spares included parts from 747, 707, Cessna, SA-310, and WB-737 aircraft.
The audit observed that the failure to dispose of spare parts reflected negligence and inefficiency.
In addition to losing Rs2.61 billion due to the non-implementation of board of directors’ directives regarding properties, and another Rs1.669 billion due to irregular payments made without validation by the user department, PIA also suffered a loss of Rs0.112 billion from the irregular procurement of stores and spares.
In 2022, the audit pointed out that PIA management had procured various items amounting to Rs0.112 billion without observing Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and through non-prequalified vendors.
In response to these objections raised by the Auditor General’s Office, officials from the Ministry of Defence said that aircraft were grounded due to restrictions following the Covid pandemic. The grounding also became necessary due to global supply chain issues. They attributed it to structural repairs, financial constraints, and payment issues that affected the ability to conduct timely maintenance and repairs.
“The delays in the roll-out of these aircraft were caused by unscheduled repairs in the fuselage structure. Structural repairs are both unforeseen and require additional time and materials,” the defence ministry said, adding that leases on these aircraft were also reduced to a minimum.
Likewise, the defence ministry said that parts worth Rs3.8 billion had already been disposed of and the remaining parts would be sold according to procedure. The meeting was also informed that the spare parts would be acquired by the bidders who purchased PIA.
The Defence Ministry said that the procurement of parts became necessary to keep operations running. “Mission/flight-critical equipment, which was highly expensive and specified by the original equipment manufacturers (OEM), was essential,” said a senior official from the defence ministry.
Several other audit objections were referred to the Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) to handle fact-finding inquiries.</p><small>2026-01-07 16:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0720430886ff155.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965643/i-dont-ai-wedding-vows-fall-foul-of-dutch-law' target='_blank'><strong>‘I don’t’: AI wedding vows fall foul of Dutch law</strong></a><br><p>A Dutch court broke the hearts of a couple after ruling that their marriage, whose wedding vows were drafted with the help of artificial intelligence, was not valid.
The couple thought they had sealed their love at the April 2025 service in Zwolle, in the north of the country. Seeking an informal civil ceremony, they had asked a friend to officiate — so the friend turned to ChatGPT to help compose the vows.
Between them, however, they missed the point, a Zwolle court ruled on Tuesday.
Couples are required by law to declare that they will fulfil all the legal obligations linked to marriage, the court noted in its judgment.
“The aforementioned statement shows that the man and the woman did not make the declaration referred to in Article 1:67, paragraph 1, of the Dutch Civil Code,” it ruled.
The ruling quoted the AI-generated vows to make its point.
“Do you promise to stand by (women’s name) today, tomorrow, and forever?” the man was asked during the ceremony. “To laugh together, grow together, and love each other no matter what?”
‘A crazy couple’
They were also asked if they would “keep supporting each other, teasing each other, holding on to each other — even in difficult times?” Once those questions were answered, they were declared “not only husband and wife, but above all a team, a crazy couple, each other’s love and each other’s home!”
None of this found favour with the court, however, because of the text used at the ceremony, it ruled that the marriage between the man and the woman was not formalised.
“This means that the marriage certificate was erroneously recorded in the civil registry,” it added.
The couple argued that they had not intended to make this mistake and that the civil officer at the ceremony had not pointed it out at the time.
Changing the date of their marriage would hit them hard emotionally, they argued, asking to be allowed to keep the date of their initial wedding as that of their legal marriage.
But there was no happily ever after from the court.
“The court understands how important the marriage date listed on the certificate is to the man and the woman, but it cannot ignore the law,” it ruled.</p><small>2026-01-07 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071852092a28ee9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965642/kp-cm-calls-for-policy-shift-urges-consultation-with-province-on-counter-terrorism-measures' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’, urges consultation with province on counter-terrorism measures</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday sought a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terror policy-making.
Federal authorities have criticised the PTI-led KP government for failing to ensure security in the province, with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi saying that the party was in disarray and unable to achieve any of its policy goals.
In a speech at Peshawar University’s convocation ceremony, the CM said that the people of KP had warned about the resurgence of terrorism in the province, but were brushed off as propaganda.
“We would issue warnings that they (terrorists) were in the mountains and they were coming, that they had reached our markets and homes,” CM Afridi said. “We were told that we are spreading propaganda.”
He highlighted that if there was going to be a military operation, then the people of KP needed to be taken into confidence and made part of the policy process.
“There needs to be a policy shift, but not behind closed doors,” he explained. “It [policy] needs to be formed after consulting KP’s government, people and stakeholders.“
“A clear policy formed in this manner will play a role in lasting and enduring peace; a decision made behind closed doors will leave our people suffering, as they have for the past 17 years.”
The CM noted that the KP government and the government had “different intentions”, adding, “If they wanted to eradicate terrorism, then they would have sat with us and formed a policy.
“We came out of our homes, so they committed that they would give Rs400,000 to people whose homes have been lost to terrorism,” he said. “Imagine hearing that after sacrificing so much. They still have not received that money.”
Highlighting the impact of military operations, CM Afridi noted that families would lose breadwinners in collateral damage or terrorist attacks, causing them to suffer economically.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence.
Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.”
Meanwhile, on January 2, KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police thwarted hundreds of terrorism-related incidents, particularly in southern and merged tribal districts, while police personnel risked their lives but stood firm against the enemy.
Last year, the police neutralised 459 terrorists in several engagements and arrested over 1,300 militants, including 29 with head money, in 3,277 intelligence-based operations across the province.
The police said a large quantity of hand grenades, explosives, pistols, various weapons and ammunition was recovered.</p><small>2026-01-07 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071834350c56fb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965639/politicos-urge-govt-opposition-talks-seek-release-of-political-workers-as-confidence-building-measure' target='_blank'><strong>Politicos urge govt-opposition talks, seek release of political workers as ‘confidence-building measure’</strong></a><br><p>A group of former PTI leaders and others on Wednesday proposed that the government and the opposition hold talks to reduce tensions and suggested that political prisoners be released as part of “confidence-building measures.”
They made proposals in a formal statement issued at the conclusion of Wednesday’s conference in Islamabad, organised under the banner of the recently formed National Dialogue Committee (NDC). Ex-PTI leaders — including Fawad Chaudhry, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, Dr Shahzad Waseem, and Mahmood Moulvi — are leading the initiative.
“The meeting agreed to the proposal to initiate a fruitful negotiation process and declared that, in this regard, the government and the opposition should form separate committees comprising their respective representatives, between which the dialogue process should be initiated,” the statement read.







The NDC proposed that President Asif Ali Zardari, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif represent the ruling coalition in the talks. On the PTI side, it said: “After the announcement of the government’s committee, the National Dialogue Committee, in consultation with the opposition’s senior leadership in jail, will announce the names for the opposition committee.”
While the NDC also extended a special invitation to Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the opposition alliance reportedly refused to attend.
The NDC leaders also suggested that “comprehensive, concrete and practical steps be taken immediately for dialogue and confidence-building at the national level”.
These included the immediate release of “political workers” who were behind bars and the quashing of cases against them.

The NDC also advised that “all female workers, including” PTI founder Imran Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leader Yasmin Rashid, be released immediately and provided medical facilities.
“Restrictions on political activities should be lifted. Complete freedom of political activities should be ensured within the framework of the Constitution and law,” read another suggestion.
The NDC also called for the appointment of opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate — posts that have been vacant since August 7.
“The government and opposition forces should not use the Pakistan armed forces for their politics and should not spread negative propaganda,” the statement added.

 

It further said that “censorship imposed on the media should be ended and restrictions imposed on anchors should be lifted”.
The moot also expressed concern over the “political unrest in the country, the economic difficulties facing the country and its people, restrictions on political activities and the media, and the challenge of terrorism”.
As per the statement, the meeting appreciated the NDC’s efforts of “playing the role of a bridge between the government and the opposition”, stressing the “importance of promoting unity and solidarity in the country and reducing political tensions”.
The meeting “paid tribute to the sacrifices against terrorism of all security forces, including Pakistan‘s armed forces, police and Rangers, and prayed for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks and patience for their families”.
“The meeting reiterated that the entire nation is united for Pakistan’s sovereignty, defence and security, and for the dignity and respect of Pakistan’s institutions,” the statement read.
Ex-premier and Awaam Pakistan chief Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, expelled PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Liaqat Baloch, former Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar, and journalists Mohammad Malick and Kashif Abbasi were among those who attended the conference.
Speaking at the event, Shahid Khaqan said, “This is not an issue of Imran Khan‘s release, but of the country’s release. If the country is in the right condition, then Imran Khan sahib’s issue will get resolved too.”
Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight in November when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore during his short release from jail.
The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that they had no political discussion with his client.
In December, PM Shehbaz invited the opposition for a dialogue. While the PTI rejected the offer, the TTAP exp­ressed its willingness to engage in such a process, albeit conditionally.

 

Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has said that “confidence-building measures” between five major players — including President Zardari, PM Shehbaz, Nawaz and Imran — would improve the overall political situation.
Yesterday, noting Imran’s refusal to negotiate, Sanaullah said he felt compelled to advise the PTI founder to abandon his years-old entrenched confrontational approach and opt for dialogue instead.
TTAP top leadership to visit Lahore
Separately, a TTAP delegation is set to depart for a three-day visit to Lahore as part of the opposition’s “street mobilisation”, said a statement from the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai.
The group includes TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Senior Vice-Chairman Allama Raja Nasir, Vice-Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Secretary General Asad Qaiser.
The TTAP leaders will hold “political and social meetings” in Lahore, the statement said, adding that the politicians will also hold meetings at Zaman Park, apparently referring to Imran’s residence.</p><small>2026-01-07 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071808477dd76e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965638/easing-into-2026-the-soft-guide-to-start-being-productive-again' target='_blank'><strong>Easing into 2026: The soft guide to start being productive again</strong></a><br><p>January can be weird. One minute you’re enjoying fireworks, the next you’re staring at your inbox, wondering how you forgot your email password over the holiday break.
The glitter fades fast, and suddenly it’s back to deadlines, group chats and figuring out if you’re supposed to feel different now.
The new year often arrives with the pressure to improve: Cue the “new year, new me” captions and ambitious planners that still smell like a Kinokuniya display table.
But let’s be honest: Not everyone is in the mood for reinventing themselves. Maybe you’re in the mood for just a little glow-up, or maybe you’re just trying to get through your to-do list without spiralling.
Either way, here’s a mix of tools and tricks to help you ease into the year, whether you’re looking for fresh ideas, familiar favorites or just a little structure to soften the return to real life.
Don’t know where to start? Try a brain dump
Before you dive into your to-do list, consider starting with a brain dump. Think of it as emptying the mental junk drawer. Grab a pen and paper, and jot down everything on your mind, anything that you need to do, feel pressured to do or hope to do. Keep going until you run out.
Not a pen-and-paper person? Try a voice dump instead. Open your phone’s voice memo app and start talking. It can be just as effective, especially if your thoughts move faster than your handwriting.

Whether you’re writing or speaking, the point is to make space. Your first brain dump may not be complete the first time around, you’ll probably keep adding to it — but that’s part of the process. Once your thoughts are out of your head, you’ll start to see what actually needs your attention now and what can wait.
An added benefit for scatterbrains: You can’t forget if it’s recorded or written down. Just try not to lose that piece of paper (or forget which app you recorded it in).
Always on your phone? Let apps help you
If your screen time is already out of control, you might as well make it work for you.
Productivity apps like Todoist and TickTick are simple, ADHD-friendly tools that make list-making feel satisfying instead of stressful.
Todoist lets you use natural language (“email Rika every Thursday”) to set priorities and schedule recurring tasks. TickTick adds a built-in Pomodoro timer and habit tracker, which are great for people actually trying to change their patterns, not just log them.

If you want something more powerful, Notion, Coda, and Scrintal offer all-in-one workspaces.
Notion is basically the gold standard of productivity tools: projects, notes, databases, calendars, all in one clean interface. Coda and Scrintal have smarter AI features, especially if you’re juggling research or creative work.
While they’re not completely free, they offer a solid first step toward organising your chaos.
Prefer analog? Just write it down (with style)
For some, it still helps to write things down by hand. There’s something about putting pen to paper that makes a to-do list feel more real, and somehow more manageable. Sometimes your tasks only feel overwhelming because they’re swirling in your head. Writing them down often reveals it’s not as bad as it seems.
Handwriting also helps with memory and mental clarity. And no shade to digital calendars, but a whiteboard doesn’t emit blue light and won’t ping you during an existential spiral at 9 pm.

Having a small whiteboard in my workspace helps me keep track of what I need to do and gives me space to be creative at the same time. Making a to-do list suddenly feels more fun. And honestly, is there anything more satisfying than using a big marker to cross things off?
It’s a potential game-changer for both your brain and your workspace.
Think about food a lot? Go for Pomodoro or Eat the Frog
Now that your brain feels a little less cluttered, it’s time to actually check things off. Motivation is always the tricky part, so let’s start with some time-tested methods, the ones we keep returning to year after year, like a productivity version of “Auld Lang Syne”.
First up, the Pomodoro Technique. Designed to boost focus and prevent burnout, this method breaks your workday into 25-minute sprints, separated by five-minute breaks. After a few rounds, you take a longer rest to bookend the session.
Fun fact: It’s called Pomodoro because its creator, Francesco Cirillo, used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to track his focus.

Then there’s Eat the Frog, which asks you to start your day by tackling your hardest, most important task; most likely the one you’ve been avoiding. That task is your “frog”.
The phrase derives from a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Once that critter’s out of the way, the rest are just tadpoles.
Everyone has their preference, but let’s be real: We always come back to what’s worked before.
Procrastinate like a pro? Make it a team sport
Sometimes, the only thing stronger than your will to procrastinate is the accountability of a friend. Call it body doubling, call it communal suffering, but doing things with someone, even virtually, can help you push through.
Set a timer, hop on a video call and silently work side by side. It doesn’t have to be the same task. You could be prepping a meal while your friend clears their inbox. Just the presence of someone else doing something can trick your brain into staying on track.

You can even gamify it if you want. Who finishes first? Who gets the most crossed off?
Just a heads-up: There’s a fine line between boosting productivity and becoming a distraction. Set a clear goal before you start, agree on a rough plan and try to stick to the same timeline. Think of it as accountability, not just company.

In a new report, slammed by Israel, the UN rights office said “systematic discrimination” against Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territories had “drastically deteriorated” in recent years.
“There is a systematic asphyxiation of the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

 

“Whether accessing water, school, rushing to hospital, visiting family or friends, or harvesting olives — every aspect of life for Palestinians in the West Bank is controlled and curtailed by Israel’s discriminatory laws, policies and practices,” he added.
“This is a particularly severe form of racial discrimination and segregation that resembles the kind of apartheid system we have seen before.”
A number of independent experts affiliated with the UN have described the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories as “apartheid”, but this marks the first time a UN rights chief has applied the term.
Israel’s diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the report’s “absurd and distorted accusations of racial discrimination” against Israel, charging it exemplified the UN rights office’s “inherently politically driven fixation […] on vilifying Israel”.
Mounting settler violence
The report said the Israeli authorities “treat Israeli settlers and Palestinians residing in the West Bank under two distinct bodies of law and policies, resulting in unequal treatment on a range of critical issues”.
“Palestinians continue to be subjected to large-scale confiscation of land and deprivation of access to resources,” it added.
This had led to “dispossessing them of their lands and homes, alongside other forms of systemic discrimination, including criminal prosecution in military courts during which their due process and fair trial rights are systematically violated”.
Turk demanded on Wednesday that Israel “repeal all laws, policies and practices that perpetuate systemic discrimination against Palestinians based on race, religion or ethnic origin”.
The discrimination was compounded by continuing and escalating settler violence, in many cases “with the acquiescence, support and participation of Israel’s security forces”, the rights office said.
More than 500,000 Israelis currently live in settlements in the West Bank, occupied since 1967 and home to around three million Palestinians.
Violence has risen in recent years, surging especially since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the Gaza conflict.
Since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry.
According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations in the same period.
‘Almost complete impunity’
Since Israel’s offensive in Gaza began, Israeli authorities had also “further expanded the use of unlawful force, arbitrary detention and torture”, the report said.
Increased “repression of civil society and undue restrictions on media freedoms (and) severe movement restrictions” had also characterised “an unprecedented deterioration of the human rights situation” in the West Bank, it said.
There had also been rapid expansions of settlements, considered illegal under international law, even as unlawful killings of Palestinians were taking place “with almost complete impunity”, the report warned.
Of the more than 1,500 killings of Palestinians that took place between the start of 2017 and September 30 last year, Israeli authorities had opened just 112 investigations, resulting in only one conviction, it pointed out.
The report said it had found “reasonable grounds to believe that this separation, segregation, and subordination is intended to be permanent […] to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians”.
This, it stressed, amounts to a violation of an international anti-racism convention, “which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid”.
The UN rights office on Wednesday urged Israel to end its “unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including by dismantling all settlements and evacuating all settlers, and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination”.</p><small>2026-01-07 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071306064e36b40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965624/hospital-sources-say-4-killed-in-airstrikes-on-yemen-separatist-leader-skips-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Hospital sources say 4 killed in airstrikes on Yemen; separatist leader skips talks</strong></a><br><p>At least four civilians were killed in coalition strikes in Yemen on Wednesday, two hospital sources told AFP, as the force raided the home province of a separatist leader who was kicked out of the presidency.
More than 15 airstrikes hit Dhale, the home governorate of Aidaros Alzubidi, whose Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month before seeing the advance rolled back by the coalition and forces.
“The initial toll from the strikes on the province of al-Dhale is four civilian deaths and six wounded,” medical sources at the Al-Nasr and Al-Tadamon hospitals in al-Dhale told AFP.
The coalition said it had given Aidaros Alzubidi a 48-hour ultimatum to come to Riyadh for discussions, after Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month.
But he failed to board the flight carrying his delegation, and the coalition struck his home province of al-Dhale after accusing him of mobilising “large forces” there.

 

Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), which holds executive power, then announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of high treason. The showdown between Yemen’s rival factions raised fears that second city Aden, where the STC insisted its leader was still located, could be drawn into the violence.
Alzubidi “fled to an unknown location … after he had distributed weapons and ammunition to dozens of elements inside Aden”, coalition spokesperson Major General Turki al-Maliki said in a statement.
The coalition carried out new strikes to prevent Alzubidi from “escalating the conflict” and extending it into Dhale governorate, he said.
An STC official told AFP that Alzubidi decided not to join the delegation flying to Saudi Arabia for talks after hearing he would be asked to dissolve his group, which forms part of the PLC.
Later, the STC said it had lost contact with the delegation following its arrival in Riyadh, urging Saudi Arabia to “guarantee the safety of its delegation currently in Riyadh”.
Alzubidi “continues his duties” in Aden, the group said, calling on the coalition to halt the air strikes.
‘Grave crimes’
The PLC announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of committing several crimes, including “high treason” and “engaging in armed insurgency”.
“It has been established that [Alzubidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,” it said.
More than 100 people have been killed in the Yemeni coalition’s strikes on the separatists’ positions and in clashes on the ground.
The coalition and another group said it has asked STC deputy Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, who is in Riyadh and approved Alzubidi’s dismissal from the presidency, to “enforce security and prevent hostilities in Aden”.
A security official in Aden told AFP that the forces loyal to Mahrami have been deployed in the streets and government buildings, including the presidential palace.
Aden is an STC stronghold and home to the group’s headquarters.
After Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014, it became the government’s self-proclaimed temporary capital.

 

As the civil war progressed, the STC’s political and military influence expanded across south Yemen and they became a dominant force in Aden.
Another security official told AFP that two days ago, the STC evacuated its headquarters in Aden and moved the operations of its TV channel to an unknown location for fear of bombing.
Last week, Alzubidi had announced a two-year transition towards creating a new country, “South Arabia”, in Yemen’s south.</p><small>2026-01-07 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07163246b93a8d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965634/bangladesh-in-talks-with-icc-over-fate-of-t20-world-cup-games' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh in talks with ICC over fate of T20 World Cup games</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh cricket said on Wednesday it was in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a “practical” solution to its request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India.
India forced Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday, prompting anger in Dhaka.
With ties tense between the two countries, Bangladesh wants the ICC to shift their World Cup games from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.
The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.
Senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told AFP today that talks were ongoing with the ICC “regarding security issues”.

 

A BCB statement said it would “continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities”, seeking an “affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team”.
The BCB said it was “firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being” of the team.
The ICC has not commented.
Bangladesh international Mustafizur was snapped up at the IPL auction in December by the Kolkata Knight Riders for more than $1 million.
But he was let go on the Indian cricket board’s “advice” after what it called “recent developments”.
Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.

 

India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

In the case, registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca), Mazari and Chattha have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On Wednesday, the two submitted a written application to Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka during the hearing of the case, referring to a press conference addressed by the military spokesperson on January 6.
The application said the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. During the press conference, “references were made to matters directly pending trial before this learned court”.
“This is the exact prosecution case that is pending adjudication before this learned court,” the application said.
Mazari and Chattha contended that their request was a “clear requisite of natural justice in line with the Constitutional protection safeguarded for the accused persons with respect to the right to fair trial and due process”.
The court subsequently directed that a copy of the application be provided to the prosecution and said a decision on the request would be made after it heard the prosecution.
Later, the court said it was issue a decision on the application after the statements of the accused were recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
During the proceedings, prosecution witness Shahroz Riaz was also cross-examined. He made several admissions regarding the manner in which the inquiry in the case was initiated and the collection of social media content.
The hearing has been adjourned till January 8.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-07 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0714363003c4ebd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965630/special-protection-unit-being-set-up-in-islamabad-for-security-of-chinese-nationals-says-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Special protection unit being set up in Islamabad for security of Chinese nationals, says Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday that a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals.
According to a press release issued by the interior ministry, Naqvi made the remarks as he met China’s Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong in Beijing.
The two met at the headquarters of China’s Ministry of Public Security, where Naqvi received a warm welcome, the interior ministry said.
During the meeting, the leaders agreed to develop a joint and rapid response system against terrorism, including expanding training programs aimed at enhancing police capacity, it added.
Xiaohong lauded Pakistan’s efforts in countering terrorism and strengthening internal security, the statement said.
“We appreciate Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying.







During the meeting, “both ministers agreed on a joint strategy for training and enhancing the professional skills of police and security personnel”. They also vowed to maintain “an exchange of information between the police and other institutions of the two countries”.
Naqvi apprised the Chinese minister of the measures being taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan, at which the latter expressed his satisfaction.
“The protection of Chinese citizens and projects of mutual interest remains our top priority,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He further said that “effective measures had been taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan”. He said that “a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals“.
Chinese citizens have come under attack multiple times in Pakistan, and according to data shared by the National Counter Terrorism Authority in December 2024, as many as 20 had been killed and 34 injured in terror attacks in the country from 2021 until then.
The information was shared around a month after a security guard shot at two Chinese nationals in Karachi, leaving both of them injured.
In October that year, a bombing at the Karachi airport killed two Chinese engineers and left several others injured.
In July last year, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif said the government was building a safe and business-friendly environment for the Chinese community in Pakistan by enhancing their security.
He made the statement while chairing a meeting regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan, further highlighting that “the confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future”.
The PM also said that in light of the development of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure.
Cooperation on prevention of cybercrime
The pair also discussed cooperation in the prevention of cybercrimes.
“Pakistan wants to benefit from the support of Chinese institutions to enhance the capacity of the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA),“ the statement quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that Chinese-based AI technologies could be of “great help in countering terrorism and addressing security challenges”.
He said that Pakistan and China shared a bond based on “sustainable cooperation“. Naqvi expressed the desire to expand this cooperation further to tackle security challenges and protect mutual interests, the statement said.
During the meeting, it was decided that the two sides will hold meetings of a joint working group every three months, while a meeting at a ministerial level will be held once a year.
Naqvi extended an invitation to the Chinese minister to visit Pakistan, and conveyed his best wishes to the Chinese president and prime minister on behalf of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Xiaohong also invited Naqvi to attend the Global Security Cooperation Forum — to be held in China in September, the statement added.
The Chinese minister expressed willingness to cooperate with Pakistan at all levels, stressing that “Pakistan and China are strategic partners”.
He also hosted a luncheon in honour of Naqvi and his delegation, the interior ministry said.</p><small>2026-01-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07132757c8babdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965627/sindh-home-minister-announces-massive-operation-against-katcha-area-dacoits' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh home minister announces ‘massive operation’ against Katcha area dacoits</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar on Wednesday announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the Katcha areas of the province.
Speaking to reporters in Sukkur, Lanjar said a meeting was held wherein it was decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”.
“We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits that you see on social media,” he added.
Asked when the operation against the riverine dacoits was expected to begin, the minister replied, “You may consider that the operation has begun from today”.
Lanjar said dacoits would be “given a chance” to surrender before the courts. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them, there will be a fight, and they will get their just deserts,” he warned.
As per the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in Katcha Area of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, approved by the Sindh cabinet in October 2025, surrendering does not mean pardon or immunity.

 

All surrendering individuals shall face the prevailing law of the land, officials told Dawn, though voluntary surrender may be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing by courts.
The Sindh home minister appreciated the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation wherein a no-go Katcha area was vacated.
Responding to a question about whether the army’s help will be sought, Lanjar said, “The Sindh police is capable and the Rangers are with us in this, so I do not think we will need the army in our internal matters here.“
The minister further asserted that the required modern equipment will be provided to the personnel.
When a reporter mentioned that the dacoits employed drones, Lanjar said, “I do not think drones have reached them. Action is definitely being taken against their facilitators, too.”
On the possibility of a joint operation carried out by the Sindh and Punjab police, Lanjar said he has directed the Sindh inspector general to speak with his Punjab counterpart and the Bahawalpur regional police officer regarding the matter.

 

“This will surely happen only after a joint effort,” he stressed, noting that the area of Machka extends into Punjab. “I have strong hopes that we will wipe out these dacoits,” Lanjar said.
Asked about tribal disputes, the Sindh minister said this matter was also discussed in today’s meeting, and they had made the relevant contacts regarding the Jatoi-Mahar clash as well.
Although the Katcha areas extend to many districts of the central and southern Sindh, the districts such as Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad are particularly notorious for high prevalence of crimes like dacoity, kidnap for ransom and tribal conflicts.
On December 16, around 25 dacoits had attacked a bus near the Sindh-Punjab border and kidnapped 20 passengers after injuring the driver. The police recovered all the travellers unharmed the next day in a large operation.
When the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped at least 10 people from multiple vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5, 2025, it marked the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing M5 within Punjab’s limits.
As a safety measure, the police in Rahim Yar Khan later started running escorted night convoys on M-5 to protect motorists from dacoit gangs.
The Sindh and Punjab governments had vowed decisive action against the Katcha outlaws in August 2024, after a dozen policemen were martyred in a deadly attack by dacoits in the Machka area.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07132804e3c9081.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965625/contradiction-in-democracy-raza-rabbani-urges-na-speaker-senate-chairman-to-appoint-opposition-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>‘Contradiction in democracy’: Raza Rabbani urges NA speaker, Senate chairman to appoint opposition leaders</strong></a><br><p>Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani has called on the National Assembly (NA) speaker and Senate chairman to appoint opposition leaders in both houses of Parliament, saying that leaving the posts vacant “sidelines dissent”.
The posts have been lying vacant since August last year, when then-opposition leaders in the NA and Senate — PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz — were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan following their conviction in cases related to riots on May 9, 2023.
The PTI has nominated Pakhtun­khwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader for the NA and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the Senate slot, but their notification remains pending.
Rabbani pointed out in a statement on Monday that “Parliament is incomplete”, adding that “this exposes a contradiction in our democracy”.
“We talk of the supremacy of Parliament, yet less inclined to uphold this principle,” he added.
Saying that the “political system is already strained by polarisation”, he said the NA speaker and Senate chairperson should, under the rules, appoint leaders of the opposition, “as leaving the offices vacant sidelines dissent”.
“Such steps go towards weakening Parliament, a self-made disaster in a hybrid democracy,” he asserted.
As far as the appointment of the opposition leader in the NA is concerned, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said on Monday that the process would be initiated afresh.
He said this during a meeting with PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, who called on him to discuss the unusual delay in the opposition leader’s appointment.
Sadiq told Dogar that the rules on the matter were clear.
For his part, Dogar presented documents confirming the withdrawal of cases involving former Ayub from the courts.
He also reiterated demand for Achakzai to be appointed as the opposition leader.
In response, Sadiq emphasised that all proceedings would be conducted strictly in accordance with rules, laws, and the Constitution. He said he would inform the House about this matter in the upcoming session of the National Assembly.
The development came around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a letter to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub. The letter said the provision of details in writing was necessary for completing the process for appointing an opposition leader in the lower house of parliament.
Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC), but withdrew his plea in October last year, and the election on the seat that fell vacant due to his disqualification was also held and won by a PML-N candidate.
For his part, Sadiq had maintained that the matter related to appointment of a new opposition leader was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat had stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.
“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Dogar, the NA Speaker confirmed the receipt of documents pertaining to Ayub’s cases. Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of the decision.
“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said. He added the process would move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0712161903ed28e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965620/pti-pushes-back-against-criticism-of-party-leadership-policies' target='_blank'><strong>PTI pushes back against criticism of party leadership, policies</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has pushed back against criticism of its party leadership and policies, terming such remarks “regrettable”.
In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference.
It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism.
The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”.







The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities.
It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”.
It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI.
“This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families.
The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”.
The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions.
The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”.
“Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said.
It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”.
“The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said.
It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”.
“There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”.
“History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security.
“Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said.
KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI.
He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”.







“The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said.
The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”.
“Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said.
He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”.
CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”.
“In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said.
He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace.
“If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked.
“Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added.
He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”.
“It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said.
The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”.
“Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said.
He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed.
“It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added.
The statements from the PTI and the KP chief minister come after Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, accused the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists” and deciding to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan”.</p><small>2026-01-07 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0711195069f02c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965618/5-killed-24-others-injured-as-bus-plunges-into-ravine-near-talagang' target='_blank'><strong>5 killed, 24 others injured as bus plunges into ravine near Talagang</strong></a><br><p>CHAKWAL: Five people were killed while 24 others were injured as a passenger bus carrying them fell into a ravine near Talagang, Rescue 1122 said on Wednesday.
According to rescue officials, the incident occurred at around 2:15am early on Wednesday.
Chakwal Rescue 1122 spokesperson Qazi Muhammad Akram said the passenger bus was on its way from Rawalpindi to Bahawalpur.
As the motorway was closed due to fog, the driver opted for an alternative route and used the Talagang-Fatehjang Road, he said.
When the bus was passing by Dhoke Pathan village located on the bank of the Sowaan River, the driver lost control on a winding patch of road, the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said.
As a result, the bus plunged into a 100-foot-deep ravine, he said. Five passengers, including the bus driver, died at the spot while 24 others sustained injuries, he said.
He said that Rescue 1122 officials rushed to the scene after the incident was reported. He added that 15 officials and five emergency vehicles took part in the rescue operation which lasted for more than two hours.
Four of the deceased were identified as 56-year-old Abdul Sattar, the driver of the vehicle; 40-year-old Zia Ahmed from Kotli Sattiyan; 33-year-old Mohammad Ishaq from Lodhran; and 45-year-old Ramzan from Multan. The body of the fifth person has not yet been identified..
“We have taken the dead bodies to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Talagang while all the injured were taken to City Hospital Talagang,” District Rescue Officer Dr Mohammad Atique told Dawn.
He added that all the injured passengers were being examined at the hospital.
Meanwhile, Talagang Assistant Commissioner Suleman Mansha and Deputy Superintendent of Police Malik Azi visited the injured at City Hospital.
AC Mansha directed the hospital management to leave no stone unturned in treating the injured.
The incident comes days after another accident in Punjab, when over 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road on December 31, 2025. The death toll rose in the following days as more victims succumbed to their injuries, reaching 17 on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, authorities have closed several key motorways over traffic safety concerns due to dense fog in the province. Punjab Rescue 1122 said stated on Monday that it had responded to 1,081 road traffic crashes in the province during the previous 24 hours. These incidents claimed 24 lives and left 1,251 people injured, it said.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/070727365866baf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965604/trump-says-venezuela-turning-over-up-to-50m-barrels-of-oil-to-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Venezuela ‘turning over’ up to 50m barrels of oil to US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Venezuela’s interim government will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States, and that the proceeds “will be controlled by me” as president.
The development is a strong sign that the Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.
Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.
The blockade was part of rising US pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in US forces launching a “large-scale strike” in the country and kidnapping him this weekend.
Top Venezuelan officials have accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves.
Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the US, Trump said in a social media post.







“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he added.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.

 

Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.
The Asian country has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.
“Trump wants this to happen early so he can say it is a big win,” an oil industry source said.
Venezuelan government officials and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the government and state oil company***,*** did not provide comment.
Chevron in control of Venezuelan oil flows to US
US crude prices fell more than 1.5 per cent after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US.
That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.
Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.
It was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars.
Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at Venezuelan ports, giving a value for the deal at up to $1.9 billion.
Rodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under US sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.
Talks involve possible auctions with US buyers
Venezuelan and US officials this week discussed possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested US buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing US licences to PDVSA’s business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources told Reuters.
Those licences have in the past allowed PDVSA’s joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India’s Reliance, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni and Repsol, to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.
This week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two separate sources said.
The US and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said. Trump did not refer to this possibility.
Increased oil flows would be ‘great news’
US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the US Gulf would be “great news” for job security, future gasoline prices in the US and for Venezuela.
“Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,” he told Fox News, when asked about talks between the governments on oil exports.
“With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.”
US refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela’s heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000bpd before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.
PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. Without a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.
Oil traders reacted to news of the deal talks on Tuesday. Differentials for some heavy oil grades in the US Gulf slipped around 50 cents per barrel on Tuesday on the prospect of more Venezuelan supplies.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:23</small></div><hr>
