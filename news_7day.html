A high-speed train derailed and smashed into another oncoming train in southern Spain on Sunday, pushing the second train off the tracks and down an embankment in a collision.
The accident happened near Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360km south of the capital Madrid.
Of the 75 people hospitalised, 15 are in serious condition, the chief of Andalucia’s regional government, Juanma Moreno, told reporters early on Monday.
He said the death toll would likely be more than 20 and warned the number may rise by daylight.
“The forcefulness of the accident has been very strong … we will likely find (more) corpses,” Moreno said, adding that heavy machinery would need to be used to remove the trains’ wrecked metal pieces and try to locate any new victims.
El Pais newspaper reported that the 27-year-old driver of the Madrid-to-Huelva train, the one that was struck, was among the dead.
There were around 400 passengers on the two trains, most of them Spaniards travelling back to and from Madrid after the weekend. It was unclear how many tourists could be onboard as January is not holiday season in Spain.
“There are many injured. I am still trembling,” Maria San José, 33, a passenger on the Malaga-to-Madrid high-speed train that first derailed, told El Pais.
A passenger on the second train, who was not identified, told public broadcaster TVE: “There were people screaming, their bags fell from the shelves. I was travelling to Huelva in the fourth carriage, the last, luckily.” The second train, heading to Huelva and operated by state-funded Renfe, was travelling at around 200km per hour at the moment of impact, reported El Pais.
It was unclear how fast the first train was travelling when it derailed.
The cause for the crash is not yet known, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters at a press conference at Atocha station in Madrid, adding it was “really strange” that a derailment should have happened on a straight stretch of track. This section of track was renewed in May, he added.
‘Still people trapped’
The accident happened at 7:45pm (11:45pm PKT), about 10 minutes after the Iryo train left Cordoba heading towards Madrid, authorities said.
“The Iryo 6189 Malaga (to Madrid) train has derailed from the track at Adamuz, crashing onto the adjacent track. The (Madrid) to Huelva train which was travelling on the adjacent track has also derailed,” Adif, which runs the rail network, said in a social media post.
Puente said most of those killed and injured had been in the first two carriages of the second train, the Renfe Alvia that derailed on impact and plunged down the side of the railway embankment. The first carriage had 37 people on board and the second, 16, he said.
An Iryo-operated train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed, smashing into the Renfe train travelling from Madrid to Huelva, sending it careering down a railway embankment.
The Iryo train had more than 300 passengers on board, while the Renfe train had around 100.
Paco Carmona, Cordoba fire chief, told TVE that while the Iryo had been evacuated within hours of the accident, the Renfe carriages were badly damaged, with twisted metal and seats.
“There are still people trapped. The operation is concentrating on getting people out of areas which are very narrow,” he said. “We have to remove the bodies to reach anyone who is still alive. It is proving to be a complicated task.”
Horrific scene
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cleared his schedule for Monday to address the tragedy, while the King and Queen were following the developments with concern, a spokesperson said.
Foreign embassies sent text messages to staff asking them to confirm they were safe.
Adamuz Mayor Rafael Moreno told El Pais that he was among the first to reach the crash site alongside the local police and saw what he believed to be a badly lacerated body several metres from the accident site.
“The scene is horrific,” he said. “I don’t think they were on the same track, but it’s not clear. Now the mayors and residents of the area are focused on helping the passengers.”
Local television images showed a reception centre set up for passengers in Adamuz, a town of 5,000 people, with locals bringing food and blankets as nighttime temperatures hovered around 42 degrees Fahrenheit (6° Celsius).
Tearful passengers disembarking from the bus spoke briefly to local press before being guided inside.
Salvador Jimenez, a journalist for TVE who was on board the Iryo train, shared images showing the nose of that train’s rear carriage lying on its side, with evacuated passengers sitting on its upturned side.
Jimenez told TVE by phone from beside the stricken trains that passengers had used emergency hammers to smash the windows and climb out, and they had seen two people taken out of the overturned carriages on stretchers.
Iryo is a private rail operator, majority-owned by Italian state-controlled railway group Ferrovie dello Stato. The train involved was a Freccia 1000 train which was travelling between Malaga and Madrid, a spokesperson for Ferrovie dello Stato said.
The company said in a statement that it deeply regretted what had happened and had activated all emergency protocols to work closely with the relevant authorities.
Renfe said the derailment of its train had been caused by the Iryo train derailing into its path, adding that emergency services were still recovering passengers.
Renfe said its president was travelling to the crash site and that it was working to support passengers and their families. Adif has suspended all rail services between Madrid and Andalucia.</p><small>2026-01-19 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19120752030a6a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967821/gul-plaza-inferno-death-toll-rises-to-14-flames-continue-to-emerge-from-smouldering-debris' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza inferno death toll rises to 14; flames continue to emerge from smouldering debris</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno rose to 14 on Monday as eight more bodies were recovered and firefighting efforts resumed after flames re-emerged from the smouldering debris.
The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road, was finally doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday. A search operation was initiated amid fears of further casualties. Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit, but said the cause has yet to be confirmed.

 


According to DC South Javed Nabi Khosa, the cooling process is ongoing, while Fire Officer Zafar Khan stated that 90pc of the blaze has been brought under control, although “flames are still present in the inner market”.
“Two outer sections of the building have collapsed, and the internal structure is also damaged. Even after the fire is extinguished, the search operation will be conducted with extreme caution,” said the fire official.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalal said that firefighting efforts have restarted from the Rimpa Plaza side, as flames continue to emerge from the smouldering debris.
Earlier today, South DIG Syed Asad Raza confirmed to Dawn that eight bodies have been recovered since Sunday night by rescue personnel from the now-gutted shopping plaza.
“Fire safety operation has been completed. Cooling process has now started with the removal of debris from the site by KMC, TMC and Pakistan Navy personnel,” said the DIG.
Separately, Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that so far, five bodies have been brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, spoke to the media and said that “more than 70 people” remained missing.
“The reports of more than 70 missing persons are extremely alarming and constitute a major tragedy,” said the governor, adding that the incident has now “turned into a national tragedy”.
“Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said.
He further stated that determining the cause of the fire is necessary, but the priority for now is to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders.
Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
Traffic police announce alternate routes
In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza.
The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.
Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or the Quaid’s Mausoleum from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road.

‘Heartbroken’
United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza.
“May strength be with the community at this time,” she said.







The German Consulate Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.”







‘Delayed response’
The terrifying fire that erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but the delayed response and limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours.
Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.
Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.
A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.

The board called the transition to the auction model “a historic move after a decade of success” and said that it reinforced PSL’s “continued growth, competitiveness, and commitment to innovation”.
“This strategic shift is aimed at enhancing competitive balance, increasing transparency, and providing players greater earning opportunities,” PCB said in a statement today.







Under the revised player acquisition framework, each franchise may retain a maximum of four players, limited to one player per category. Previously, every franchise was allowed to retain eight players from their squad, including a mentor, a brand ambassador, and a Right to Match (RTM) option to retain a ninth player in the draft.
The rules pertaining to mentors, brand ambassadors and RTM have been abolished for PSL XI, the statement said.
“Newly inducted teams will be allowed to select and retain four players from the available player pool before the player auction,” it added.
It added that each franchise will also be allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in PSL X, enabling teams to strategically strengthen their squads with fresh international talent.
Further strengthening the league’s commercial and competitive outlook, the player salary purse has been increased to $1.6 million per franchise, which the statement said underscored PSL’s “commitment to rewarding player performance and attracting elite domestic and international cricketers”.
“These progressive measures reflect the League’s strategic trajectory and evolution, while remaining firmly rooted in its mission to promote cricketing excellence, fan engagement, and attaining unprecedented heights,” it said.
According to the statement, PSL 11 will officially commence on March 26. Additionally, Faisalabad has been added as an additional venue to host League matches, “marking the city’s return to (the) spotlight and further expanding the League’s national footprint”.
It added that additional details regarding the player auction process, schedule, and operational guidelines would be shared in due course.</p><small>2026-01-19 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1911470673536c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967841/58-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-gilgit-baltistan-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.8-magnitude earthquake jolts parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan on Monday, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said.
According to PMD, the earthquake struck at 11:21am at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre in Northwestern Kashmir.
According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which reports magnitude using the Moment Magnitude scale, the magnitude was reported to be 5.7, and struck Northwestern Kashmir at a depth of 31km.
It said that the quake was recorded 58 km north-west of Barishal in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
In October 2025, a 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi.
A month earlier, a 5.5-magnitude earthquake was felt in areas of KP.</p><small>2026-01-19 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191014339eae7a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967784/how-washington-sells-war-to-the-world-with-words' target='_blank'><strong>How Washington sells war to the world with words</strong></a><br><p>

WHEN the United States attacks another country, it doesn’t just send in troops or launch missiles. It starts with language. What we’re seeing in Venezuela is not random messaging, but a well-designed narrative system — built around three basic steps and repeated through a set of familiar rhetorical tricks. And once you understand how this system works, you start noticing the same pattern again and again.
The first step is disguise. Change what an action is called, and you change how it is judged. So the United States did not refer to its action in Venezuela as an “invasion”. In fact, it did not speak the language of war at all. Instead, it talked about “capture”, “arrest” and “joint operations with law enforcement”.
All of these terms are synonymous with domestic policing and not war. The effect is powerful. Once it is able to make its action look like law enforcement, questions of sovereignty or the United Nations Charter quietly fade out from the conversation.
The violence the US has unleashed is further neutralised through technical language. So, bombing becomes a “precision strike”, invasion becomes an “operation” and the civilian harm it caused is downgraded to “collateral damage”. Such wording does more than soften the blow, presenting war as a form of technical management — something orderly, controlled, almost bureaucratic.
At the same time, the targeted state itself is personalised. A country is reduced to a single leader; sovereignty, institutions and the population fade into the background. Once a state is thus reduced to just one individual, regime change can easily be sold as criminal justice rather than aggression.
The second step is redirection. If attention is diverted elsewhere, legality becomes irrelevant. This is why so much emphasis is placed on elite units and footage of “dramatic raids”. Command rooms, night-vision images and special forces narratives dominate coverage. The audience is encouraged to admire competence and efficiency. The more impressive the operation looks, the less space there is to ask whether it should have happened at all.
Tactical success is then used to conceal strategic violence. A fast, “clean” operation is praised as restrained and responsible, although it says nothing about long-term consequences — regional instability, civilian suffering, economic collapse or endless cycles of intervention. Winning the scene replaces winning the peace.
Public debate is carefully redirected toward procedure rather than substance. Media discussions fixate on whether Congress was informed or whether the timing was appropriate. These arguments divert attention from the core issue — who authorised the US to use force across its borders in the first place.
Cause and effect are then quietly reversed. Interference came first, but the story is told backwards, as if instability demanded interference, rather than interference leading to instability. History is edited to make aggression appear inevitable. The third step is erasure. Control memory, and you control moral judgment.

 

Latin America is not a new story. The US has interfered there more than 40 times. But that history is wiped clean. Each action is presented as exceptional, as if it has no connection to what came before.
And before the public can fully process what happened in Venezuela, new headlines — Trump talking about occupying Greenland within two months, or news about military deployments aimed at Iran — appear. Attention shifts. Venezuela fades. Accountability never arrives.
Even imagery is carefully controlled. The public is shown pictures of Nicolas Maduro — poorly dressed, exhausted, humiliated. What is not shown is the brutal process behind those images: the killing of dozens of Cuban bodyguards who died protecting him, and the violence of the raid itself. The focus stays on spectacle, not cost.
When invasion is reframed as governance, and war becomes routine administration, the most dangerous transformation has already occurred. It doesn’t happen on the battlefield. It is all in the wording.
Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-19 05:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19100216e188d04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967729/cotton-supply-at-ginning-factories-indicates-stagnant-production' target='_blank'><strong>Cotton supply at ginning factories indicates stagnant production</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) has released provisional national cotton production figures, showing that by Jan 15, 2026, a total of 5.49m bales arrived at ginning factories across the country.
This is only 7,000 bales higher than the output recorded during the same period last year, indicating near stagnation in cotton production.

 

According to the PCGA report, 2.58m bales reached ginning factories in Punjab, while 2.91m bales arrived in Sindh. Compared to the same period last year, cotton arrivals in Punjab declined by 4pc whereas Sindh recorded a 4pc increase.
The data reveals that textile mills purchased 4.84m bales from ginning factories while exporters bought 176,000 bales. Around 479,000 bales are still available for sale with the ginners.
At present, only 127 ginning factories are operational. Of them 91 are in Punjab while 36 are in Sindh.

Ginners call for ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones; say the challenge has shifted from production to consumption

The PCGA officials noted that during the past two weeks alone, 46 ginning factories in Sindh and 50 in Punjab became non-operational—far more than market expectations.
The association also reported a sharp upward trend in cotton prices over the past week, with prices rising by Rs300 per maund to reach around Rs16,500 per maund. The increase has been attributed to the extremely limited availability of quality cotton in the domestic market and rising international prices of cotton yarn and fabric.
Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq says that despite Pakistan’s cotton production remaining nearly 50pc below annual targets for several years, the real challenge has now shifted from production to consumption. He attributes this to the excessive cultivation of sugarcane in traditional cotton zones, which has not only reduced cotton acreage but also caused environmental pollution that had adversely affected cotton quality.
As a result, he says, many textile mills are forced to import high-quality cotton to fulfill export orders, putting severe pressure on the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
He urges federal and provincial governments to strictly enforce crop zoning laws instead of spending billions of rupees on cotton revival projects. He calls for a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation and the establishment of new sugar mills in cotton zones, which can help restore national cotton production to around 15m bales.
Haq warns that record decline in exports, soaring production costs for exporters and highly lenient import policies have pushed the cotton sector to the brink. More than 150 textile units have shut down completely, many others are operating partially, and hundreds of ginning factories have become inactive, placing the entire cotton industry ‘on a ventilator’.
He cautions that if ‘oxygen’ is not immediately provided to the cotton sector, the national economy itself can slip into ‘coma’. He points out that Pakistan’s cotton industry faces some of the highest electricity, gas, and markup rates in the world, along with multiple high-rate taxes and excessive intervention by various federal and provincial departments, all of which have sharply increased production costs and eroded export competitiveness.
Calling the current situation the worst economic crisis in the industry’s history, Ihsanul Haq urges governments to prioritise industrial revival over cash handouts.
He suggests that instead of spending around Rs1 trillion on welfare schemes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and Ramazan packages, these funds should be directed toward reviving industries, which would not only strengthen the economy but also significantly reduce unemployment and poverty.

Within seconds, burly firefighters point their hose at the fresh flare up, concentrating a high-pressure stream of water that momentarily douses the leaping flames.
By Sunday afternoon, around 16 hours after the Gul Plaza fire broke out, firefighters are still playing ‘whack-a-mole’ with the blaze.
They had a massive audience, as M.A. Jinnah Road is teeming with people — rescue personnel and fire fighters, volunteers, city officials, media crews and the general public.
“It was full of plastic products. It’ll be burning for days,” I overhear one bystander say.

 

“I hear they shut the [market] gates at 10pm,” another chimes in.
“There was a parking lot on the third floor, no telling what has become of that,” a third man volunteers.
Many of them are from the neighbourhood, or own businesses nearby. All eyes are on the section of the building that has collapsed, and many an outstretched finger points to a part of the building’s façade, where key beams seem to have lost structural integrity and the whole thing looks like it’s ready to keel over.
A quick glance at Google Street View shows that the collapsed part of the building housed shops and the entrance to the aforementioned parking area. In addition, the corners of the building next door, Rimpa Plaza, are also showing signs of fire damage. This is because there is virtually no gap between the two buildings.
While the crowds gathered at the scene aren’t disrupting the ongoing operation, security personnel do periodically have to ‘urge’ overzealous camera phone-wielding youngsters to back away.
While there, I spot dozens of water tankers from various official and private firms, since getting water in this congested urban locality is a major challenge. As I walk towards the charred building, bystanders note that another tanker has run out.
As they are speaking, a smaller unit approaches the flames, spraying a jet of what appears to be flame-retardant foam. This continues for a minute or so, before their supply is exhausted. A little while later, a snorkel arrives at the scene, and firefighters are able to turn their hoses to the upper stories, which continue to pour out smoke, indicating that some parts of the building are still on fire.
Amid roaring water jets and wailing sirens, an unsettling silence lingers beneath the rubble as people witness the battle between water and fire.

His voice trembles as he makes an unusual request: “Buy my kinnow at whatever rate you can”. The wedding date of his daughter is fixed, he says, and the fruit on his trees is the only asset he has left to turn into cash.
Factory managers hear such pleas daily this season. What was once  routine commercial transaction has turned into a human drama, reflecting a crisis engulfing Pakistan’s citrus economy  — one shaped by closed borders, rising costs, policy neglect, and the shadow of international sanctions linked to Iran.
Pakistan’s kinnow exporters face a perfect storm as the traditional overland route to Russia and adjoining markets through Afghanistan remains effectively closed. For years, this corridor allowed kinnow to reach Russia, Ukraine and the Central Asian Republics within six to nine days, keeping the fruit fresh and competitive.
With that route blocked due to tensions with Kabul on security affairs, exporters are diverting shipments through Iran — a route that takes around 25 days, significantly increasing transit time, costs and spoilage risk. What was once a backup option has become the primary route, and even that has become geopolitically risky.
Adding to exporters’ anxiety are renewed threats by US President Donald Trump to impose a 25 per cent tariff on countries trading with Iran, raising fears that reliance on Iranian transit and markets could invite penalties or complicate access to Western destinations.
Govt claims vs reality
Last week, the federal government announced that Punjab’s farmers would be allowed to export kinnow and potatoes through “alternative routes.” Growers and exporters say the announcement offers little practical relief.
“Iran was never a newly opened route,” says Hanif Hanjra, a small orchard owner. “It has always been there, mainly used after Iran finishes its own mandarin crop. Calling it an alternative to Afghanistan is misleading.”
According to growers, Iran cannot replace the Afghan corridor in terms of speed or cost. “Through Afghanistan, kinnow would reach its destination fresh and competitive. Through Iran, the journey is simply too long for a perishable fruit. Resultantly, the shipment costs multiply manifold,” Hanjra says.
Growers recall that Pakistan’s presence in Russian, Ukrainian and Central Asian markets was built largely through exporters’ own initiatives, particularly after ASEAN countries restricted kinnow import as Pakistani authorities failed to meet required documentation due to alleged demands for bribes and bureaucratic inertia.
Sajid Wining, a grower-cum-exporter who remained Pakistan’s top fruit exporter for nearly 14 years, said he eventually exited the kinnow business due to chronic policy neglect. “At their peak, kinnow exports earned around $450 million annually,” he said. “Yet fruit and vegetable exports were never treated as a strategic priority.”
He also criticised the failure to develop seedless kinnow varieties, while competitors such as China and Egypt moved ahead with seedless mandarins, capturing premium markets.
Price crash amid bumper crop
The crisis has hit orchard owners brutally. A former MPA and ex-tehsil nazim of Sahiwal, Ghulam Ali Asghar Lahri, said juice factories are offering as little as Rs300 per maund.
He revealed that a contractor who had purchased his orchard for Rs27.5 million — paying Rs1.5m as advance — walked away from the deal, forfeiting the amount because expected losses were far greater. “Some of my relatives are uprooting kinnow plants altogether,” Lahri said. “They don’t see this crisis ending anytime soon.”
Mohammad Mohsin Warraich, patron of Anjuman Kashtkaran, Sargodha, said the irony is that this year’s kinnow crop is bumper and globally appreciated for its taste and appearance. Yet growers are being forced to sell at Rs1,200 per maund or even less, compared to Rs2,500–3,200 last season.
“Factory owners exploit growers by citing Afghan border closures,” he said. “But only C-grade kinnow goes to Afghanistan, and its production is very low this year. A-grade fruit is exported by sea, and that route is open.”
Warraich added that Iran has, unlike previous years, reduced duties on kinnow imports and transit to Russia and CARs from the start of the season. “So why are prices collapsing?” he asked.
Former MPA and citrus grower Iftikhar Gondal said kinnow production costs have multiplied since the sharp devaluation of the rupee in 2022.
Fertilisers, pesticides and labour have become prohibitively expensive, while returns have collapsed.
“One acre of kinnow orchard fetched around Rs100,000 last year; this season it is barely Rs30,000,” he said. “Many growers cannot even find buyers for their orchards.” This uncertainty has also led to a drastic drop in land contract rates—from Rs200,000 per acre annually to Rs70,000, he said.
Gondal alleged that factory owners have formed cartels to fix rates, exploiting farmers while continuing exports. He estimated that nearly 30pc of kinnow orchards have already been uprooted, with farmers shifting to maize, sugarcane and other crops.
Zahoor Haral, a mid-level kinnow grower, warned that repeated crop shocks are pushing farmers toward selling land and migrating to cities or abroad. “The rural economy is collapsing,” he said, noting that contractors, labourers, transporters and shopkeepers all suffer when farmers lose purchasing power.
He dismissed the argument that low prices are driven by border closures alone. “Exporters buying kinnow at throwaway prices are not dumping it locally; they are shipping it abroad. So the excuse doesn’t hold.”
Shadow of sanctions
Hovering over the entire crisis is the geopolitical risk tied to Iran. Trump’s threat of a 25pc tariff on countries trading with Tehran has unnerved exporters, who fear that dependence on Iranian routes could expose them to penalties or market restrictions.
Growers are now calling for structural reforms: the creation of Kissan Markets to allow direct sales to consumers, promotion of value addition through juice, pulp and powder processing units, and the establishment of a Citrus Control Board — similar to the Sugarcane Control Board  — to regulate pricing and transactions between growers and factories.
Until such measures are taken, orchard owners say scenes like the one at the factory gate — fathers pleading to sell fruit at any price to meet family obligations — will only multiply.
And Pakistan risks losing not just export markets, but an entire citrus economy once considered a flagship of its agricultural exports, now squeezed between closed borders, rising costs and global politics far beyond farmers’ control.

Faced with the prospect of daily-use items, groceries and other essentials becoming more and more expensive, it seems that one of the ways city-dwellers are coping with inflation is by changing where they shop.
Once considered a novelty, the ‘dollar’ or ‘discount’ store, and its counterpart ‘fixed price’ shops are now emerging as a ubiquitous entity in markets across Lahore and Karachi.
These outlets, which are also known as ‘sale shops’ or ‘fair-price shops’, can be considered Pakistan’s version of ‘fixed-price’ shops (such as the Poundland chain in the UK). After having their hey-day in the 2000s and 2010s, such stores had petered out post-Covid.
But now, with the rising prices of commodities, the fixed-price concept is seeing a resurgence in popularity, with customers not just coming in to buy trinkets and toys like they used to.
In fact, when Dawn visited a number of such stores across Lahore and Karachi, it emerged that people are primarily stacking their baskets with daily-use and household items from these stores.
Their purchases can include accessories, crockery, cosmetics, handbags, jewellery items, kitchen utensils, toys, cleaning supplies, stationery, or even socks.
During visits to the Saddar, Kharadar, Garden, and Bahadurabad areas in Karachi, and Anarkali, Gulshan-i-Ravi, Fortress Stadium, and Icchra in Lahore, Dawn found people from all walks of life shopping at these outlets.
Despite not being definitely mapped, these ‘sale shops’ have a strategic advantage: a fixed price for all items ranging between Rs100 and Rs280, with only a few integrating a minor selection of costlier items.
But with the dollar hovering around the Rs280 mark – still quite steep for the average city-dweller – most stores have had to abandon the mandatory peg to the prevailing exchange rate, settling for a more affordable price tag that is lower than the actual rate of the greenback on the open market.
In Lahore’s Old Anarkali Bazaar, for example, such shops stock a variety of products, including jewellery items, cosmetics, toys, kitchen utensils, handbags, crockery, and even mobile accessories.
A woman working the storefront at an Rs190 store in Lahore gave the example of a well-known shampoo brand that usually retails for Rs1,500. But at her store, she said, the same product could be obtained for Rs190.
While it wasn’t clear whether the product she was selling was ‘genuine’ or a knock-off, for many shoppers, the distinction mattered little.
At a dollar store in Karachi’s Saddar area, which is selling all items for Rs280 – not too far from the actual value of the dollar – a woman shopper told Dawn she was there to buy “quality essentials at a reasonable price”.
Looking to purchase a set of teacups, she said that she wasn’t happy with the price point of traditional utensil vendors and found this option more suited to her needs.
Comparing the fixed-price shop to weekly bazaars that pop up over the weekends, she said that rather than being open on specific days, the fact that these stores are open all week round adds to the convenience factor.
But a visit to the Clifton Sunday Bazaar revealed that the vendors there were making hay by stocking a wider variety of clothing and household essentials.
‘Sale’ shops, by contrast, seem to be capturing the customers that would previously flock to the ‘landa’, or second-hand market.
De-dollarisation of discount stores
As the prevailing exchange rate has made dollar-pegged pricing unsustainable for shoppers, owners of these ‘fixed price’ stores have rushed to cap their prices in rupees to maintain the aura of affordability.
Shopkeepers in Old Anarkali told Dawn that the outlets were previously branded as ‘one dollar shops’, and that the signage had recently been changed to ‘sale shops’, while the pricing model remained unchanged.
Stores that haven’t localised their business model have struggled to compete. This was evident from Dawn’s survey of ‘dollar stores’ mapped in key parts of Karachi, including DHA and Clifton, which had long since gone out of business.
The owner of one such erstwhile store, who Dawn reached out to through the contact listed on Google Maps, said they had closed when $1 was being exchanged for about Rs180.
According to him, even with prices capped at Rs170, demand was not as strong, and the business wasn’t able to keep pace with the rising prices of goods either.

At the same time, a shopkeeper in Kharadar, who Dawn spoke to, says that they have now opened two more branches for their iteration of a Rs200 discount store, where prices range from Rs40 to Rs200.
Meanwhile, a shopkeeper selling cups and plates at Clifton’s Sunday Bazaar told Dawn that the dollar impact was not felt much in ‘landa’ prices.
Nadeem ul Haque, former vice chancellor at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, told Dawn that this trend of ‘localised’ dollar shops, shows how market forces work.
He said that the concept was born out of excess local supply, which is linked to the “global industrial overload” catering to those whose purchasing power has been reduced in recent years.

Speaking to reporters after congratulating the newly-elected cabinet of the Timergara Press Club, Mr Khan alleged that trucks carrying flour were being stopped at Attock and bribes demanded, leading to severe shortages in Lower Dir and parts of KP, where a 40kg bag of flour was being sold for as much as Rs6,000.
He said the situation amounted to a clear violation of Article 151 of the Constitution, which guarantees free trade among provinces, adding that despite Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being an integral part of Pakistan, the federal government was treating the province unfairly. He also criticised the provincial government for ‘failing to fulfill its constitutional and moral responsibilities’.

 

Responding to a question, Mr Khan said military operations were underway in various parts of the province, but stressed that the growing insecurity must be curbed immediately as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not afford further loss of lives. He said instead of military operations, the capacity of police and other civilian institutions be upgraded to cope with the menace of terrorism.

Inayat says capacity of police should be enhanced instead of conducting military operations

Meanwhile, talking to reporters at the residence of party’s leader Maulana Wahid Gul in Khar area of Bajaur, Inayatullah Khan called for resolving the unrest in the merged districts through dialogue rather than military operations.
He expressed sympathies with the family of the JI leader over the Friday night’s bombing targeting his house, and said his party had long held the ‘principled stance’ that issue of law and order in the tribal districts must be resolved through peaceful means, not by use of force.
The JI leader alleged that military operations in the tribal districts were not only causing destruction and unrest but also adversely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of residents.
Responding to a question, the JI leader said their party was in favour of dialogue on all issues, whether they pertained to security or internal political conflicts.
Condemning the bombing at Wahid Gul’s residence, the Jamaat’s provincial chief called it a cowardly act, stating that such incidents were unacceptable and were intended to silence the voices of peace.
He stated that the relevant authorities must immediately arrest those responsible for the attack.

With economic activity languishing, rumours of ministerial changes have popped up as well, as if somehow specific personnel are the only thing standing in the way of six per cent growth. Despite IMF tutelage, these pressures will not be easy to stave off. Something will eventually give.
What are the usual pathways to growth? In Pakistan’s case, reducing interest rates and easing up of import restrictions coupled with some sort of a tax let-off usually generates economic momentum based on consumption. This has been the script for several decades. Beyond the brief rush that it provides, its other outcomes too are fairly straightforward.
There is increased pressure on scant reserves, a widening fiscal deficit and downward pressure on the currency. In some sequence and combination, this usually leads to devaluation and inflation, followed by a return to the IMF’s doorstep in the face of looming default. Macroeconomic stabilisation ensues through a throttling of economic activity via increased interest rates, import restrictions, and higher taxes. In other words, a move back to square one.
For the generation gaining adulthood in the 2000s, this particular sequence has already played itself out four times, neatly coinciding with a transfer of power between different actors. The fundamentals are still the same suggesting that the planned pursuit of growth would be a fifth repetition of the boom-bust cycle in just under two decades.

There is no straightforward path to growth that doesn’t see us back to square one in a year or so.

What is this ‘fundamental’ that has stayed the same? If we reduce growth to a simple arithmetic problem of finding enough dollars to spend, then nothing has truly changed on that front. In fact, dollars are even harder to find today than they were a few years back. The standard source of foreign exchange, ie, exports, are stagnant. Domestic capitalists find it difficult to both make things that the rest of the world wants and getting the rest of the world to buy the thing they make.
Global cheap credit liquidity has dried up, there are no substantial geostrategic rents to be obtained, no Sino or Saudi benevolent patrons who can shower billions, and no queue of dollar-armed investors waiting to set up shop in the country. The only saving grace here are the common people, who ship themselves abroad to labour in harsh conditions for the sake of their families. Their earned billions are ventilating an economy otherwise plagued by asphyxiation.
This cursory, yet fairly standard, picture of the economy shows that in the current scenario, with all things being the way they are, there is no straightforward path to growth that doesn’t see us back to square one in a year or so.
Mainstream, technocratic answers to breaking this bind are both familiar and banal. ‘Reform’ is the word most frequently thrown around. The power sector needs to be reformed so that the cost of making stuff (to sell to the world) can go down. The economy needs better documentation so that the burden of taxation on the formal sector (that makes things and employs people) eases up. The size of the government in terms of personnel and their regulatory footprint needs to be reduced so that there is more money available to be spent on enhancing human capabilities (and productivity).
Maybe some of these standard technocratic prescriptions will take place in my lifetime (I am approaching 40). They may even lead to some of the results they’re supposedly meant to produce, but there’s little guarantee either way. There are other prescriptions too, more radical ones that involve mass mobilisation and the redistribution of means and resources to people in order to boost domestic production and consumption. However, the likelihood of such a path being traversed is even lower.
Either way, past experience suggests that implementing even the most benign reforms is costly: the intra-elite political conflicts they produce are untenable, and most Pakistani decision-makers, civilian and military, are reluctant to go through with it. Why? Because politicians, even those with dubious mandates, have constituencies and status quo beneficiaries as benefactors; and the establishment, apart from being a status quo beneficiary itself, wants a resuscitation of legitimacy in the shortest time possible, which can’t be squared with the long gestation period of technocratic reform.

 

So, instead, we’ll likely see some jugaar that opens up space for economic activity and staves off difficult questions in the short run, passing them on to the next set of faces in charge. Two such shortcuts come to mind.
The first was alluded to by Khurram Husain in his piece last week — an external liquidity injection of the geostrategic/ geopolitical variant. Whether that comes through defence pacts and a backdoor to a new normal in the Middle East (or in the immediate region) is moot. If it were to transpire, it might give the Pakistani government some breathing room without changing too much domestically.
There is a second shortcut too; a domestic variant, being eyed and talked about for some time now. This one involves forcibly changing the nature of fiscal relations between the centre and the provinces through an amended NFC. By starving the provinces and holding onto more resources, the centre will be able to reduce its uptake of more debt, bring down interest rates, increase development spending and maybe even offer tax rate reductions for a short period of time.
The boost in growth will be welcomed, even if its wholly temporary. But in the process, a long-standing ‘irritant’ — the devolution of significant resources away from the centre — will also be solved. And it doesn’t take much to predict in whose pockets these freshly retrieved resources at the centre will end up.

From upending the global trading system to launching military attacks in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, he has shown contempt for international law and the sovereignty of other nations. For someone who vowed to end wars and not start new ones, his aggressive actions and rhetoric suggest the contrary.
Trump’s ‘America First’ foreign policy means riding roughshod over others. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, aptly described the Trumpian worldview when he poured scorn on a “rules-based system” and declared: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” That means the exercise and projection of raw American power, whatever the consequences.
What kind of world is emerging from this? To be sure, Trump is acting in an environment already characterised by a fragmenting global order and increasing disregard for international rules and norms by other big and regional powers. The use of hard power by countries has become all too frequent in pursuit of a ‘might is right’ approach. Trump is reinforcing or sharpening these trends and pushing the world into a Hobbesian state of lawlessness.

 

Today, the world has increasingly become one ruled by impunity. In a speech to the General Assembly over a year ago, UN Secretary General António Guterres said the world had entered “the age of impunity”. He was prompted to say this by the Israeli aggression and desperate situation in Gaza but he was also referring to the growing number of countries acting this way. “They can invade another country, lay waste to whole societies” and “thumb their nose at international law”, he said, pointing to the fact that this “age of impunity” is everywhere. He is, of course, right. This era of impunity is reflected not just in the US assault on Venezuela and bombing of Iran but the genocide carried out by Israel in Gaza, its military attacks on neighbouring countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and India’s military strikes against Pakistan. None of these powers thought their actions entailed much cost and they faced no international accountability.

Countries have to navigate a no-rules world amid great uncertainty and volatility.

If international institutions were designed to deter and check such behaviour that isn’t happening in today’s no-rules world. Multilateralism and multilateral organisations have been under stress for well over a decade. But the attitude of big powers, especially Trump’s conduct, has accelerated this trend and magnified the pressure. The UN’s paralysis and ineffectiveness are evident from its failure to stop the genocide in Gaza, the war in Ukraine and end other conflicts, such as in Sudan. Its growing irrelevance is laid bare by its role as a bystander in wars and crises, unable to perform its core responsibility, albeit due to big power politics and clashing interests. The result is a loss of faith in multilateralism with trust in global institutions at a record low. The recent withdrawal by the US from 66 international organisations including 31 UN entities is another setback for the multilateral system and will further weaken it.
The world has now entered an era of a ‘new great game’ which involves intense resource tussles between the big powers. It is reflected in the competition between the US and China over rare earths and critical minerals essential for semi-conductor and defence industries. In this regard, the US under Trump is trying to catch up with China, which has built a virtual monopoly, having made strategic investments in these sectors over decades, including in Africa. China has a near-monopoly in the extraction and processing capacity of rare earth minerals, which are used in electronics, electric cars and military weapon systems including fighter jets. Last year, it used its leverage in the rare earth elements global supply chain to push back against US tariffs. Beijing imposed restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals which forced Washington, faced with an industrial shutdown, to back off and lower tariffs.
The Trump administration is now frenetically seeking to reduce its dependence on China by developing alternative sources of supply. It is hosting G7 ministers this week to discuss this. It struck a minerals deal with the Democratic Republic of Congo, which sought US mediation for a peace accord with Rwanda. Washington also signed a mineral resources agreement for joint investment with Ukraine.
Of course, the resource battle is not limited to minerals even if that is an important new front. It rages over oil, as Trump’s action in Venezuela shows, over technology and other vital commodities. It is a throwback to the past when colonial powers competed for resources and occupied countries to pillage their resources. What some analysts have called America’s “resource imperialism” has familiar echoes of the past.

 

The Middle East continues to figure as a region of conflict and volatility that is consequential for international peace and security. Beyond Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has temporarily paused under Trump’s peace plan, the region is witnessing a high-stakes contest for regional dominance. But instead of the old confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Middle East is facing tensions between Gulf states who are competing on many fronts and are engaged in proxy wars to establish their regional ascendancy. The rivalry between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates erupted into the open over Yemen. The two countries back different sides in Sudan and have divergent interests in Libya and Syria. UAE’s close ties with Israel adds another dimension to the geopolitical competition. The US shift in policy priority to China and disengagement from the Middle East over the years created a power vacuum that Gulf states are trying to fill in their contest for influence. The KSA-UAE power struggle is, above all, about who will become the main trade and investment hub. KSA is now planning a military coalition with Egypt and Somalia to contain UAE’s regional power. Their rivalry is destabilising for the region and compounds its challenges.
With geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic confrontation intensifying across the globe this points to a disordered world. It challenges countries to navigate a rule-less terrain in an environment of great uncertainty and volatility.

The former grouping is seen as loyal to the edicts of Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, while the faction in the Afghan capital is led by the likes of Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob.
As per the BBC, a leaked audio recording reportedly of Mullah Akhundzada dating back to January 2025 warned against divisions within Taliban ranks, with the hard-line movement’s supremo asserting that differences could lead to the emirate’s “collapse”. Taliban leaders, however, have downplayed the divisions, describing them as differences of opinion within a family.
One incident cited by the official British outlet as evidence of divergences between Kabul and Kandahar was last year’s internet shutdown, ordered by Mullah Akhundzada. Within days of the edict, Afghanistan was back online, as the Kabul faction apparently defied their leader and had the internet restored.
Differences among the Taliban are natural; the movement has various power centres. While Mullah Akhundzada may reign supreme, Siraj Haqqani has considerable power, being the scion of veteran Mujahideen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani. Mullah Yaqoob, son of ex-supremo Mullah Omar, also has a significant following, particularly amongst younger Afghans.
Whereas Mullah Akhundzada is based in his Kandahar redoubt, living a near medieval life, the Kabul leaders are relatively urbane men, hobnobbing with global leaders in the Gulf, Russia, China, etc. The latter faction knows that Afghanistan cannot prosper without shedding some of the rigid curbs ordered by the supreme leader.

 

The Kabul leaders are hardly progressive but they do hold relatively more moderate views compared to Mullah Akhundzada and his inner circle. In the current context, this may be the best bet to reintegrate the country with the rest of the world. For example, the Kabul grouping reportedly favours education for girls beyond primary school, and some members of this faction have previously been disciplined for their views.
While major internal strife among the Taliban is unlikely, it is possible that the Kabul leaders may try to further assert themselves to implement more ‘pragmatic’ polices, without rocking the boat, thus giving Afghans a little more freedom. They should also revisit the policy of hosting foreign terrorist groups, including the banned TTP, and impress upon Mullah Akhundzada that cross-border attacks by these groups on Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan. Although a ‘Kabul Spring’ is hardly in the offing, limited change in Afghanistan could be in the air.

A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation’s economic strategy, particularly given the country’s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.
Unfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.

 

That said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.

History shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports

However, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan’s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.
The Musharraf era
During the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.
When the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.
Stability over fundamentals
The above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100–105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency’s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee’s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.
Market distortions and eroding confidence
The last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.
In early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.
These shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.
Repeatedly underminig exports
These episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis — too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.
Gradual adjustment and integrated policy
Successful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.
For example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share — a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.
Conclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy
Pakistan’s core issue is not deciding between a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.

PROTESTERS scuffle with an ICE supporter who was in downtown for ‘Americans Against Islamification’ rally.—AFP

WASHINGTON: The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government’s deportation drive, two US officials told Reuters on Sunday.
The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent.
President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act.

Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year.
In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances.
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.
Trump’s threat
“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
The soldiers subject to deployment specialise in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two US Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said.

Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.

 

Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived last night with full force and resources, the scene here would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.

Traders say fire could have been contained sooner, but limited resources and delayed action by authorities allowed it to spread unchecked

A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.
“Had the operation started properly the moment the fire broke out, perhaps so much damage could have been avoided. By morning, everything had been consumed by the flames,” one shopkeeper said, looking over the rubble.

 

“If a proper rescue operation had been in place, people could have been saved, and businesses might have survived. The government doesn’t seem to realise that these weren’t just shops – thousands of households’ livelihoods were at stake,” a clothing dealer lam­ented.
“At first, the smoke kept spreading, and then the fire reached the upper floors. If the teams had arrived on time, perhaps people could have been brought out safely,” a young man on the scene recounted.
Atmosphere of fear and mourning
The fire that could still not be fully extinguished by Sunday night has cloaked the bustling M.A. Jinnah Road and Saddar area in an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and mourning.
The rising sun, usually seen as a symbol of life and hope, appeared sorrowful this Sunday morning in Karachi. The light that every day awakened new hopes in shops and businesses was silent, as if it too had lowered its gaze after witnessing the blaze and destruction.
Along with traders and the relatives of those who died, even the air around Gul Plaza seemed to be grieving.
Some are searching for their loved ones, while others are consumed by the agony of losing their businesses. Every eye looked wet and every face appeared drained and hopeless.
The same market where shopkeepers raised shutters every morning and the voices of bargaining echoed, today stands as a burning skeleton. Where once crowds of buyers gathered, now victims, relatives, rescue workers and onlookers stand clustered together.
The intensity of the fire has already caused part of the building to collapse.
One glance at the rubble is enough to realise the scale of the devastation. Hundreds of shops have been destroyed.
It is clear that when a building burns, it is not only brick and metal that burn. Livelihoods, trust and the hard labour of years also burn to the ground.
The piles of debris and ash have shattered the economic lives of traders within moments.
‘Everything was here’
A middle-aged trader who had been running his business in the building for nearly two decades stood on the road looking at the charred structure on Sunday morning.
After a long silence, he uttered just one sentence: “Everything was here.”
In that single sentence lay the struggle, livelihood and hope of an entire life.
Another affected trader broke down while speaking to Dawn and pointed toward the burning building. People around him tried to console him, but every heart around seemed to be grieving.
Majid, who owned a children’s clothing shop, said he and other shopkeepers had stocked merchandise for the Eid season, but “now everything has turned to ashes.”
A dangerous design, an ageing structure
Among the public, there is also a belief that the scale of the fire is tied to the risks that had accumulated over time.
Gul Plaza is among the commercial centres of Karachi built decades ago. Over the years, thousands of shops, warehouses and stockrooms became packed into narrow corridors.
Fabrics, plastics, cardboard cartons, other goods, cramped pathways and substandard wiring created an environment that made today’s disaster unbearable.
Traders say that such calamities not only destroy wealth, but also push an entire class to stand once again before time and debt to rebuild what was lost.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.

 

Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.

 

He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

• Macron wants ‘never-before-used anti-coercion instrument’ against US• Meloni calls tariff threat a ‘mistake’• Dutch FM dubs it ‘blackmail’• UK, Norway mull over response
LONDON: Global markets face a fresh bout of volatility after President Donald Trump vowed to slap tariffs on eight European nations until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.
Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached.

 

“Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins.
“The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder.
On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

 

An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy.
France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said.
Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat.
Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told the BBC, calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”.
“We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said.
Trade war fear
France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too.
“In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.
Norway, targeted by the tariff threat but, like Britain, not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.
“I think one needs to stop and think so that a trade war can be averted that would lead to a downward spiral. Nobody would win,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told NRK television.

Tajikistan, in Central Asia, shares a mountainous border with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities.
According to Tajik security services cited by the state-owned Khovar news agency, “four terrorists were neutralised” after they refused to put down arms in the southern Khatlon region.
Tajik authorities have reported at least five deadly incidents on the mountainous border, which is some 1,350 kilometres (840 miles) long, since November.
An AFP count using official data found that 16 people have been killed in total. These include Tajik border guards, Chinese workers and what Dushanbe calls “smugglers” and “terrorists”.
After attacks on Chinese nationals in November, Tajik authorities urged the Taliban government to take measures to prevent destabilisation of the volatile border region, where drug traffickers and militants are active.
In December, five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, according to Tajik state media. It added that the people killed in the clash included “three terrorists” and two Tajik border officers.
Dushanbe is also concerned about the presence in Afghanistan of members of the terrorist organisation Islamic State in Khorasan.

DAMASCUS: The Syrian president and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced an immediate ceasefire after fierce fighting, which saw the government forces take control of territories held by the Kurdish SDF.
The Syrian army, in its lightning advance towards the key city of Raqqa in the north, captured Tabqa before reaching a ceasefire with the Kurdish forces on Sunday on all fronts. Al Jazeera, quoting the Syrian state media, said that the SDF forces agreed to withdraw to the east of the Euphrates under the agreement.

 

According to Al Jazeera, the agreement provides for the immediate and complete administrative and military handover of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates to Damascus. The agreement also allowed the government to assume control of all civilian institutions in the two governorates, and current employees would be reinstated through decrees.
The government promised it would not target the SDP supporters or fighters. The ceasefire granted the Syrian government control over all border crossings as well as oil and gas fields in the region. In addition, all civil institutions in al-Hasakah Governorate are to be integrated into official Syrian state institutions and administrative structures, while a presidential decree will be issued naming a candidate as governor.

 

The agreement also stipulated that a list of proposed leaders submitted by the SDP command will be used to fill senior military, security, and civilian posts in the central government, while heavy military forces from the city of Ain al-Arab/Kobani will withdraw. Furthermore, it also envisaged a local police force affiliated with the Syrian interior ministry besides the creation of a security force drawn from local residents.
The agreement also allowed the integration of the administration in charge of the Islamic State camps into the Syrian state structure.
Syrian army advances
Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the Syrian government troops were entering the outskirts of Raqqa and were advancing deeper into the northeast of the country, the last stronghold of the US-backed autonomous Kurdish-led administration. Two Syrian military sources said that tanks had begun entering Raqqa, once controlled by the Islamic State, which the SDF captured in October 2017.
Thousands of residents took to the streets of Raqqa to celebrate the Syrian army’s advances as SDF forces pulled out their equipment, two residents said.
The army, with its Arab tribal allies, had earlier taken control of Deir al-Zor’s main oil and gas fields east of the Euphrates River — a key source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — dealing a major blow to the group.

Addressing a jirga comprising parliamentarians and elders from Bajaur tribal district in Chief Minister’s House here, he said that peace had been restored in 2018, however, deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation.
He stated that decisions, taken behind closed doors, had always worsened the situation.

 

Sources privy to the meeting said that participants discussed law and order and development schemes in Bajaur district. They said that situation could not be brought under control until all the stakeholders were on the same page.
“Governments are run with wisdom. There should be a mechanism where all the stakeholders agree on a point and be on the same page. That is how I believe things will normalise,” former governor Shaukatullah told Dawn.

Elders from Bajaur, Khyber and Kurram apprise chief minister of their issues

Others said that there were issues but they were performing duty, protecting their areas and never allowed outsiders to stay on their land. “As far as military operations are concerned, you know well that the chief minister himself is helpless and cannot stop it in his own hometown, how do you expect him to stop such action in Bajaur,” a participant told this scribe on condition of anonymity.

 

He said that development in the merged district was also discussed in detail in the meeting.
He said that the chief minister promised that if the funds, promised by federal government for merged districts, were not released, he would cut funds from other developmental projects and divert them to Bajaur.
A statement issued by Chief Minister’s House said that the participants of jirga presented suggestions for establishing permanent peace and expressed full confidence in the chief minister, assuring him all out support.
The jirga discussed law and order situation in the province, improvement in Pak-Afghan relations and development strategy.
It said that the chief minister announced increasing compensation for partially damaged houses in Bajaur from Rs0.16 million to Rs0.5 million following recent operations. He said that federal government had promised Rs1 billion annually at the time when the previously tribal areas were being merged with KP, however, over the past seven years, only Rs168 billion was released.
He said that federal government was not providing funds for Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). He issued direction for increasing the upper age limit for recruitment in police department in merged districts.
Also, in another jirga with members from Kurram and Khyber districts, the chief minister said that he understood the agony of military operations. He added that he would not leave his people alone.
He told the jirga members that sectarian issues caused damage and enemies took advantage of the situation. He said that he would soon visit Kurram to resolve issues of displaced persons. He ordered registration of those people, who had left their homes due to the law and order situation, within one week.
Our correspondent from Mansehra adds: Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi said that the street movement launched from Karachi on the directive of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan would bring revolutionary changes in political system of the country.
“This mammoth crowd, which gathered at midnight to welcome the convoy of the street movement from Haripur to different parts of Hazara, is an eye-opener for the government. The people want immediate release of PTI jailed founding chairman, Imran Khan,” he said while addressing cheering crowds at Khatm-i-Nubowat Chowk and College Doraha in small hours of Sunday.
PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Babar Saleem Swati, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar and deputy president Kamal Saleem Swati were also present on the occasion.
The chief minister said that the street movement had successfully mobilised people from Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would soon reach every nook and corner of the country.
“We want to make it clear to the government that this time it cannot suppress the people’s street movement. We have turned every city and every square into D-Chowk,” he said.
Mr Afridi said the country needed Imran Khan’s leadership to steer it out of the prevailing socio-political and economic crises, accusing federal government of failing to address those challenges.
The convoy of the street movement entered Mansehra through Karakoram Highway at Datta, proceeded through Ghazikot and concluded at College Doraha in the early hours of Sunday.

• Dacoits warned to lay down arms            
RAHIM YAR KHAN: A large-scale, joint operation by Punjab and Sindh police is ongoing in the katcha areas of Rahim Yar Khan, including Machka, Kacha Rajwani and Ronti, with 1,700 personnel, drones and armoured vehicles deployed against bandits.
According to Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bahawalpur Ghazi Muhammad Salahuddin, Rahim Yar Khan police had cordoned off Kacha Rajwani, with contingents from Rajanpur (Punjab) and Ghotki (Sindh) taking part. Sindh police and Rangers were also conducting action in adjoining riverine areas.
He said 1,700 police personnel had been deployed along with eight drone teams, six bulletproof vehicles and three armoured personnel carriers.
Modern technology was being used to ensure effective progress and restore law and order in the area, he said, adding that police were conducting action against criminal elements under a coordinated and well-planned strategy.
The RPO clarified that suspects who renounce criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to the police would not be engaged in encounters and would be produced before the courts in accordance with the law. However, criminals have been strictly warned to lay down their arms and surrender.
He further emphasised that the operation would continue until the writ of the government was fully established in the riverine areas.
District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan Irfan Ali Samo stated that action against criminals was ongoing and that ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the public remained the top priority.
According to details, police with a heavy contingent and full combat equipment have launched a decisive operation against bandits after cordoning off the areas of Machka and Kacha Rajwani.
Earlier this month, the Sindh government announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the katcha areas of the province, vowing to eliminate them through the use of state force.
Speaking to reporters after presiding over a high-level meeting on the law and order situation in the Sukkur and Larkana ranges, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said it had been decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”.
“We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits you see on social media,” he said, adding that special focus would be placed on Sukkur and Larkana.
Mr Lanjar stressed that dacoits would be given a chance to lay down their arms and join the national mainstream. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them. There will be a fight and they will be eliminated through the use of state force,” he warned.
The home minister thanked the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation in which a no-go katcha area was vaca­ted. He said individuals kidnapped from Sindh were recovered from Punjab with the full cooperation of the Rangers and other security agencies.

Police rushed to the site and shifted the bodies to Sui Hospital. Their identities could not be ascertained till late evening.
Security sources said the operatives were burying an underground landmine when it detonated. Following the incident, police and security forces reached the site and launched further investigations.
Grenade attack
Meanwhile, in another incident, unidentified assailants carried out a hand grenade attack near Aftab Chowk in the Sakran area of Hub district late on Sunday evening. No casualties were reported.
According to police sources, the attackers were riding a motorcycle. After throwing the grenade, they fled the scene. Police said the explosion did not result in any loss of life; however, it caused panic among residents of the area.
Following the incident, police cordoned off the area and launched an investigation.
In 2025, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.
At the start of this year, Balochistan’s top police officer vowed to further strengthen the force in 2026 through improved planning, modern weapons and specialised training.

According to the TTAP’s manifesto, “Democracy rests on the foundation of transparent elections; therefore, restoring public trust in the transfer of power is possible only through fair elections.”
The manifesto demanded “the immediate appointment of an impartial chief election commissioner and the holding of transparent elections under a new election commission.”
It further called for an independent investigation into the alleged rigging in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, the identification of those responsible, and their punishment under Article 6 of the Constitution, which corresponds to high treason.
“Through the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments, the independence of the judiciary has been undermined by keeping the sword of judges’ transfers hanging over their heads,” it said.
“Conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, have been sidelined.”
“The TTAP manifesto said it “strongly condemned” the recent actions against Justice Tariq Jahangiri, terming his disqualification the “latest example of an attack on the judiciary”.
It further condemned the “false cases and convictions” against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife.
“TTAP demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, including former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Mian Mahmood ur Rashid, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Hassan Niazi, Ali Wazir, Haji Abdul Samad, Wali Mohmand, Dr Mahrang Baloch, and the detainees of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee,” the manifesto said.
Moreover, it called for an end to restrictions on meetings of party leaders and family with Imran.
Referring to the PECA law, the manifesto termed it a move to “silence critical voices and curtail media freedom”. It labelled the legislation as “black law” and demanded its “immediate revocation”.
During the APC, members slammed the “economic exploitation” of media networks, including Dawn TV, by imposing an advertisement ban.
The manifesto also demanded that the ongoing military operation in the Tirah Valley be “stopped immediately”, urging that the “federal government should take the provincial government into confidence on all matters”.
“All issues with Afghanistan should be resolved diplomatically,” the manifesto read, further asking the “unanimous demands” of the Jirga held in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly be immediately accepted.
‘Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if provinces get their rights’
Speaking to the APC, TTAP chief Achakzai said, “Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if the provinces get their rights.
“We have to understand the problems of every province.”
“Come, let’s save our country,” Achakzai said, adding, “If you call the people of Waziristan and tell them that it is [Pakistan] your country, the terrorism will end.”
He alleged that the mandate of 25 million people was stolen in the Feb 8 elections.
“We have to come out on Feb 8 to protest peacefully,” he added, saying, “people will have to be united.”
‘90 per cent of people are in favour of Imran Khan’
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) head and nominated leader of opposition in the Senate, Allama Raja Nasir, said, “90 per cent of people in Pakistan are in favour of Imran Khan.”
“Despite keeping Imran in jail, they couldn’t keep people away from him. Only the public can pull Pakistan out of this turmoil,” he said.
Abbas also urged people to take to the streets and join the peaceful protest on Feb 8.
“If people come out on Feb 8, we will see a big difference on Feb 9.”
‘Over 200 FIRs and over two years in jail’
Former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said that Imran had been in jail for two years, and over 200 first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against him.
“His wife and nephew are also in jail,” Qaiser said, adding that the PTI founder had always opted for a life of struggle over lavishness.
“Despite problems, he [Imran Khan] stood firm and resolute.”
The ex-speaker said that Imran’s perspective was centred around human rights; therefore, he “will never compromise.”
He further stated that Imran had denied vengeance once he got in power.
“Our Constitution gives the freedom to express and assemble, but we are not allowed to hold public gatherings.“</p><small>2026-01-18 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1816032599c5cf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967681/trump-invites-pm-shehbaz-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Trump invites PM Shehbaz to join Gaza ‘Board of Peace’: FO</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been invited to be a part of the Gaza “Board of Peace” that is being formed by United States President Donald Trump, the Foreign Office has said.
“The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi in response to media queries.
“Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added.







The so-called “Board of Peace” has begun to take shape as the US moves on to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which stands decimated after two years of Israel’s bombardment.
Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory.
The United States has invited the heads of around 60 states to join the Board of Peace, including those of Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia.
However, the charter of the board, which does not mention Gaza by name, suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations.
On Friday, the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and his senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel.
According to Reuters, the board also includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza.
Other members of the executive board include UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Sigrid Kaag; Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020.
A Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo on Friday, which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue.

 

Former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, who is leading the committee, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years.
Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.</p><small>2026-01-18 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/18193841fc22843.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967685/policeman-martyred-by-unknown-assailants-riding-a-motorcycle-in-kps-bannu-district' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman martyred by unknown assailants riding a motorcycle in KP’s Bannu district</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: A target killing incident occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, where unknown assailants riding a motorcycle opened fire on a policeman, killing him on the spot.
According to a police statement, the incident occurred in the district’s Mamma Khel area, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Haved Police Station. It added that the martyred policeman was deployed at the Mazanga police checkpoint when he was attacked.
District Police Officer (DPO) Yasir Afridi said, “The martyred policeman, identified as Iqbal, was in his native village of Akhund Mamma Khel, when he was shot.”
“After offering evening prayers, he was on his way back home when motorcycle riders opened fire on him in front of his house, killing him on the spot,” the DPO added.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation, while further investigation into the incident is underway.
The security situation in KP has worsened over the last three years with an increase in terrorist attacks, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire deal with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces, police personnel, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Last month, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan revealed that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025. He added that during the attacks, 79 sustained injuries, while in retaliatory action by the police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
Meanwhile, an important jirga was held in Bannu under the chairmanship of Brigadier Umair Niazi of 116 Brigade and Deputy Commissioner Faheem Khan, with the elders of Jani Khel, during which the security and administrative situation of the district was reviewed.
During the jirga, demands were raised regarding law and order, road repair and construction, action against absentee teachers, and the restoration of 4G internet services.
Brigadier Niazi assured the jirga elders that peace and stability would be ensured, directed government employees to resume their duties, stressed avoiding all contact with terrorists under a zero-tolerance policy, and announced that all roads in Bannu would be opened after the completion of security arrangements.
The elders appreciated the steps taken by the institutions and assured their full cooperation.</p><small>2026-01-18 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/181810111f482f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967684/iran-considers-gradually-restoring-internet-after-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>Iran considers ‘gradually’ restoring internet after shutdown</strong></a><br><p>Iranian authorities have said they are considering “gradually” restoring internet access after imposing a communications shutdown 10 days ago, as nationwide protests in the country began to subside following a crackdown by security forces.
Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years.
Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into “riots” and blamed foreign influence, namely from Iran’s foes, the United States and Israel.
The rallies subsided after the crackdown carried out by security forces amid a communications blackout that started on January 8 as the protests grew in size and intensity.
Government officials have said calm has been restored, with schools reopening on Sunday — Iran’s weekend falling on Thursday and Friday — after a week of closure.
Late Saturday, the Tasnim news agency reported “the relevant authorities announced that internet access would also be gradually restored”, but gave no further details.
Citing an unnamed “informed source”, the agency said local messaging applications “will soon be activated” on Iran’s domestic intranet.
On Sunday morning, AFP was able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut.
Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored on Saturday morning.
For days, text messages and international phone calls — and at times even local calls — were cut off.
Iran has since been relying on its intranet, which has supported local media websites, ride-hailing apps, delivery service and banking platforms.
Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) alleges it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces. However, the media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests.
On Saturday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “a few thousand” people had been killed by what he called “agents” of the United States and Israel, and Iranian local media has reported multiple deaths among security forces.
Khamenei said authorities “must break the back of the seditionists”, as local media has reported thousands of arrests and rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been detained.</p><small>2026-01-18 14:51</small></div><hr>
