Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate as Tsunami waves hit the Pacific coast of the country.
Meanwhile, Hawaii recorded tsunami waves measuring up to 4ft, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. However, no waves of consequence have hit Hawaii yet.

Tsunami waves with a height of 10-13 feet recorded in parts of Kamchatka


The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia’s remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.
The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.
The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor in 1952, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.

“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.
A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 ft) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.
Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.
“The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,” Kamchatka’s geophysical service said on Telegram.
Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.
In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed around 220,000 people in 11 nations.
Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s TASS state news agency.
“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.
“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”
While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.
Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.
“Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.
Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.
“A state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,” the Sakhalin government said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team recorded that the Klyuchevskoy volcano —  a highly active volcano in the region — ejected ash to a height of up to 3 km (1.8 miles) above sea level as a result of the quake, Al Jazeera reported.
“The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km [4.9 miles] above sea level may occur at any time,” said KVERT in a statement.
KVERT has assigned an orange colour code for aviation hazards to the volcano, which indicates an increased likelihood of eruption.
Japan records tsunami waves
The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, Al Jazeera reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK World.
Waves as high as 60cm (1.9ft) were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to NHK.
The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm (0.6ft) earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3 metres (9.8ft).
Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.
According to Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the country’s Pacific coast has already been hit by four to five rounds of tsunami waves, and has warned that there are no signs of the Tsunami waves receding, Al Jazeera reported.
There is also a chance of powerful and unexpected surges, it added.
Earlier, Japan’s weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10ft) to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).
Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.
Footage on public broadcaster NHK showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.
“We came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn’t go in at all, not even close to the water,” local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told AFP as she left the area with her young daughter.
Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.
Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 tsunami caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.
There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.
Tsunami waves hit Hawaii; warnings issued across the Pacific
Tsunami waves measured up to 4ft were recorded in Oahu, Hawaii, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre, the BBC reported.
Tsunami waves were “now impacting Hawaii”, the Centre said in an update.
The US National Weather Service confirmed the reports, according to Al Jazeera.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green said so far, no waves of consequence have hit the islands, but all flights in and out of Maui were cancelled, Reuters reported.
Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning Centres issued a Tsunami Warning — its highest level alert — for the entire US state of Hawaii, with the first waves expected at 7:17pm local time (10:17pm PKT).
“People are also advised to stay away from the beach and not to go to the coast,” the seismology centre said in a warning.
Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,” the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.
 






The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.
“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,” US President Donald Trump said in a social media post.
“A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. Stay strong and stay safe!”
Tsunami alerts were pushed to mobile phones in California, according to local AFP reporters.
The US Tsunami Warning System also warned of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours across the Pacific. According to the seismology centre, waves reaching more than 3 metres were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3 metres were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.
Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.
It described the potential conditions as “hazardous.”
In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, AFP reported.
The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.
Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.
“After an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,” the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation “will be kept under constant surveillance.”
Ecuador officials ordered ‘preventive evacuations’ from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, AFP reported.
Meanwhile, China’s tsunami warning centre said that waves of between 30 centimetres and one metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard.
“Based on the latest warning and analysis results, the Tsunami Advisory Centre of the Ministry of National Resources has determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to cause damage to certain coastal areas of China,” the advisory centre said.
‘Ring of fire’
Kamchatka and Russia’s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.
“However, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high … as one might expect from such a magnitude,” said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.
“Aftershocks are currently ongoing … Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.”</p><small>2025-07-30 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30104153cd5138a.jpg?r=104413' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Curfew imposed as forces launch ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ in Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>• Sources say four terrorists killed

They demanded the lifting of curfew and an end to the military operation. “I would take the whole people of Mamund to roads to hold a protest demonstration against the operation if the offensive wasn’t halted by tomorrow,” said Dr Hamidur Rehman.
JI leader and former senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan also expressed concerns over the launch of the operation and urged authorities to stop it immediately.
 






Also, an emergency meeting of Bajaur Peace Action Committee was held on Tuesday at the residence of MPA Anwarzeb Khan to demand an immediate halt to the operation.

They alleged that civilian casualties indicated that locals were affected in the operation.
No official statement was issued to confirm civilian casualties in the operation till the filing of this report.
Meanwhile, the residents of War Mamund tehsil held a protest on Tuesday evening against the suffering of local population in the operation.
Scores of people, mostly youth and political activists, gathered at Shago Village Chowk on Tuesday evening. They alleged that a number of innocent people were killed and wounded during an exchange of fire between security forces and terrorists.

• Mysterious woman accused of ‘trapping’ accused men surfaces in court
ISLAMABAD: A two-judge bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has said any commission formed to investigate the alleged misuse of the blasphemy law could interfere in cases pending before other courts.
The judges on Tuesday explained the reasons for suspending a single bench’s order in the high-profile case.
The now-suspended judgement was issued by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan after 42 hearings in the case whose proceedings were streamed live, in a divergence from the norm.
It directed the federal government to establish an inquiry commission within 30 days to investigate the allegations of entrapment, custodial deaths, flawed investigations and violations of fundamental rights.
The order, issued on July 15, said nearly 400 FIRs and around 700 individuals were implicated for allegedly committing blasphemy online.
 
 

The court also flagged irregularities in FIA’s investigations, including the reuse of Facebook IDs across multiple FIRs, same-day arrests and FIR registrations, private detentions and the use of unverified digital evidence.
Last week, an IHC bench comprising Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Azam Khan heard appeals challenging the single-bench’s ruling.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench suspended for a month the order to form the commission.
During Tuesday’s hearing, the two-judge bench noted the nearly 400 blasphemy cases, at the heart of this issue, were registered nationwide.
The trials in most of these cases had already concluded, resulting in either convictions or acquittals. In some cases, appeals have been filed against those decisions that are currently pending before various high courts.
The order stated that forming an inquiry commission in such a context could interfere with pending, potentially rendering the legal process “ineffective”.
Interim or final order
The two-judge bench also clarified that Justice Khan’s order was final as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
 
 

The question over the order’s status was raised during the last hearing when the petitioners’ lawyer claimed the case was initially decided but the written verdict stated it would remain pending.
The division bench further clarified that although intra-court appeals are typically not filed against interim orders, the single bench’s ruling was final in nature as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
‘Mysterious’ woman
Also on Tuesday, a woman named Komal Ismail also appeared before the division bench along with her lawyer.
She is accused of honey-trapping the victims using a false social media identity by the name of “Imaan”.
In a hearing earlier this month, Justice Khan directed the FIA to block her national identity card after she repeatedly failed to appear before the court.
 
 

During Tuesday’s proceedings, Ms Ismail’s counsel argued her client was not a party in the main case, yet her CNIC was blocked and her name placed on the Exit Control List.
Justice Soomro responded that Ms Ismail had only been asked to appear before the investigating officer and questioned the harm in complying with that direction.
The bench emphasised that while the case involving Ms Ismail remained under investigation, the court would not interfere in the matter.
Later, the court linked Ms Ismail’s applications with the already pending intra-court appeals and adjourned the hearing.

•  Officials’ reluctance to share names of mill owners with lawmakers draws rebuke
•  Committee told Rs150m spent out of Rs1.95bn allocated for flood awareness campaign, rest of the money diverted
ISLAMABAD: Amid a hike in sugar price, the Public Accounts Committee was informed on Tuesday that the sugar mills have earned Rs300 billion due to recent fluctuations in the rates of the essential commodity.
The Auditor General of Pakistan made these revelations during the meeting of the apex parliamentary panel, which convened the high-stakes session to review the sugar import and export policy, rising prices, and the lack of transparency in the sugar industry.
The PAC met under the chairmanship of Junaid Akbar Khan and it was briefed by Industries and Production Secretary Saif Anjum, who stated that price regulation and relevant laws fell under provincial jurisdictions.
He revealed that from 2013 to 2023, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) permitted sugar exports amounting to 5.09 million metric tonnes, of which 3.927 million tonnes were actually exported. In 2023-24 alone, the country had a surplus of 1.3 million tonnes, and 790,000 tonnes were cleared for export, the secretary said, adding that the price remained “stable”.
However, the PAC members expressed serious concern, citing ground realities. Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan and other members, including Omar Ayub and Senator Fauzia Arshad, contradicted the government’s claims about the commodity.
Omar Ayub reported that sugar was selling for over Rs200 per kilogramme in many regions, while National Food Secu­rity Secr­etary Amir Mohy­uddin maintained the national average was Rs173. According to Senator Fauzia Arshad, sugar had become both scarce and unaffordable.
‘Cycle of mismanagement’
Mr Akbar, meanwhile, slammed the cycle of mismanagement, stating, “Every year we repeat the same drama: first export (sugar), then import it.”
The PTI lawmaker questioned the lack of transparency, asking, “Who owns these sugar mills?” The committee had requested a list of owners, but the industries secretary said only directors’ names were available.
 
 

The committee rejected this explanation, demanding complete records. It warned, “No further briefings will be accepted without disclosure of owners.”
The Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) also drew flak for failing to regulate the industry effectively. “This is daylight robbery,” said MNA Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood, citing massive profiteering and poor governance. “Rs287 billion have gone into a few pockets,” claimed MNA Riaz Fatyana, while others accused the president and prime minister of allegedly protecting the profiteers.
The Federal Board of Revenue officials told the panel that a list of mills’ directors had been obtained, but the lawmakers sought full ownership transparency, leading to heated exchanges among the members.
Malik Amir Dogar named President Asif Ali Zardari, Jahangir Tareen, and the ruling Sharif family as major sugar mill stakeholders, leading to fiery arguments with fellow lawmakers Shazia Marri, Afnanullah Khan, and Bilal Mandokhail.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan noted that only 42 families profited from this massive windfall. “Why is no one else allowed to set up sugar mills?” he questioned, pointing to the concentration of ownership and lack of competition.
PAC member Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood highlighted that sugar was currently available in India at the equivalent of Rs143/kg, much cheaper than local prices.
The food secretary responded that the reduction in sales and other taxes was intended to make sugar more affordable. However, he warned that an import duty of Rs80 per kg would naturally make imported sugar more expensive.
The PAC chairman also questioned the rationale behind importing sugar despite claims from all provinces that ample stock was available. “If there was enough stock, why was the decision made to import it?” he asked.
 
 

Regarding sugar stocks, officials claimed 1.9 million tonnes were available, which will last till November. Nonetheless, PAC members voiced concern about potential spoilage and stressed the need for careful planning ahead of the next crushing season. The government had approved the import of 300,000 tons of sugar to stabilise the supply, while pledging it would not affect farmers or involve previous export destinations.
The PAC members reiterated that the issue would not be dropped until full transparency over sugar mill ownership and profit beneficiaries was achieved. Separately, the PAC scrutinised Rs1.95 billion supplementary grant allocated to the Press Information Department for a flood awareness campaign. Audit officials revealed that only Rs150 million was spent on the campaign, while the rest was diverted elsewhere. The matter was referred to a subcommittee for investigation.

• Amit Shah says three Pahalgam attackers killed; Farooq Abdullah wonders whether they were the same men
• Congress leader challenges Modi to say ‘Trump is lying’ on role in ending hostilities with Pakistan
NEW DELHI: In a bedlam of barbs and innuendoes in India’s parliament on Tuesday, the BJP government claimed teaching Pakistan a lesson in their recent military standoff.
But the leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of cowardice in not taking Pakistan head-on, while forcing the army and the air force to avoid military targets at the start of the war.
India, Mr Gandhi added, could not afford Modi as prime minister.
For his part, the Indian PM applauded his achievements in the hunt for those who killed 26 Hindu tourists in Pahalgam on April 22.
As if on cue, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that three of the terrorists had been killed and that two of them were identified as members of the now-defunct Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
Farooq Abdullah, a former chief minister of India-held Kashmir, welcomed Shah’s claim with a caveat, wondering if they were indeed the same men who attacked tourists in scenic Pahalgam.
Claiming all-round success in the short war, Narendra Modi kept scrupulously silent on the losses of Indian aircraft in the air battle with the Pakistan Air Force.
He spoke in Hindi, with plenty of pauses for dramatic effect. Like when he spoke about how the opposition leaders were asking why he did not take back Azad Kashmir: “Who else can they ask this to except me?”
India, he said, had called Pakistan’s “nuclear bluff”, and showed the world it would no longer be cowed by threats of escalation.
Shift in strategic posture
He claimed India struck “terror bases deep inside Pakistan” in just 22 minutes after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, and that “Islamabad’s sabre-rattling, including veiled nuclear threats, did not stop India from responding forcefully”.
It is worth noting that Indian military officials have previously said there was never a moment of nuclear threat from either side.
“Pakistan had some inkling of Indian action and started issuing nuclear threats, but could do nothing when terror targets were hit,” Modi said.
“India responds on its own terms; bullets will be met with cannons.”
This response, he claimed, exposed the limits of Pakistan’s deterrence and revealed a shift in India’s strategic posture. “Only three countries spoke for Pakistan at the UN,” he said, but didn’t say how many spoke for India.
Rahul Gandhi had said in his speech that many countries had condemned terrorism, but none had condemned Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
“No leader of any country asked India to stop any action in its defence against terror,” PM Modi said.
US Vice President J.D. Vance had tried calling him “three-four times” during Operation Sindoor, the Indian PM claimed, but he was too busy in high-level meetings with the armed forces.
Rahul’s challenge to Modi
Before Mr Modi’s speech, Rahul Gandhi had thrown a dare at the PM, pointing out President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of having stopped the war between India and Pakistan. “If Trump is lying, let Modi say he is lying,” Rahul had said.
Modi claimed Operation Sindoor had “planted India’s flag firmly in the global defence market” and there was an increasing interest in India-made munitions.
He also repeated the Indian claim that Pakistani military officials pleaded for a halt in hostilities.
He said former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had cost India dearly with the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Modi called the treaty as unfair to India’s farmers, saying “blood and water cannot flow together”.
There was no mention of the losses India suffered in the prime minister’s speech. Several opposition leaders in both houses had asked for details on how many fighter jets, including Rafales, were lost.
Mr Gandhi claimed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had himself revealed that the Director General of Military Operations was told by the Government of India to ask for a ceasefire just 30 minutes after Operation Sindoor began. “You told them we will not hit military targets; we do not want escalation.”
“The government of India informed the government of Pakistan that we have no political will, and we will not fight,” he said.
Mr Gandhi also quoted Captain Shiv Kumar, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, as saying that India had lost some aircraft and that happened only because of the constraints given by the political leadership not to attack air defence and military targets. “You tied their hands behind their backs and the defence minister has said this in parliament itself.”

The people had to leave different villages in Taunsa, including Mauza Moor Jhangi, Bait Kachhela, Panj Darain, Bait Channar, Bait Ashraf, Jarh Leghari and Mouza Baloch Khan.
In Layyah, the people were evacuated from Mouza Lohaj, Thori, Samra Jhok Khan, Basti Kanjo Mohana, Darkhan Khokhar, Panwar, Alliyani Basti, and Rakhwan. A double-storey police check post built in Rakhwan was also submerged completely by floodwater and all its structure demolished. A high school in Basti Alliyani also submerged by water and cracks appeared in its building.
In Karor Lal Esan, Bait Mongar was also flooded and all its houses and mosque were also destroyed. The floodwater entered cultivated lands, making it a part of the river in Layyah and Karor Lal Esan.
In Dera Ghazi Khan, several villages were submerged by floodwater including Jhok Utra, Kot Chuta, Malkani Kalan.

DG Khan residents protest turning of river for new Layyah-Taunsa Bridge

The residents of the area protested against poor management of a bund built to turn the river to construct Layyah-Taunsa Bridge. They said that the river had changed its way and started flowing in another direction, engulfing thousands of agriculture land where different crops, including cotton, were destroyed by the medium level flood.
“A high level flood in the past would easily pass from Layyah but the poor design of the newly-constructed Layyah-Taunsa bridge changed the flow of the river and it started flooding old localities and villages. Thousands of acres of crops also come under water in both districts,” the locals said.
The crack emerged in the bank of the river to protect the Layyah-Taunsa Bridge also could not be filled after two days due to poor management of the authorities.
A resident of Layyah Khurrum Khar told Dawn that out of their 450 acres, only 175 acres was left dry and all their land had been swallowed up by the Sindh river.
He also said the government had changed the way of the river to construct the Layyah-Taunsa Bridge and it resulted in catastrophe for their land.
“We only can demand the government to fix the problem otherwise we would become landless and the river will also swallow our villages permanently,” the man decried.
Earlier, the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a flood alert for several regions as the province braces for rising water levels in major rivers and urban flooding due to more heavy monsoon rains.
According to the Pakistan Met Department (PMD), scattered to widespread thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls are expected over the upper catchments of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, and Ravi rivers, as well as in Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, and Lahore divisions over the next 48 hours.
The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has reported that the Indus river is currently at medium flood level at Guddu, while low flood conditions persist at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, Taunsa, and Sukkur.
Meanwhile, the Jhelum and Chenab rivers are experiencing low to medium-level flows and more flow is expected due to an incoming weather system from July 30 to 31. The FFD also warned of moderate flooding in the nullahs of the Ravi river and tributaries of the Kabul river, with increased flows expected in the Sutlej river at Ganda Singhwala after 24 hours. Urban flooding is likely in Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Lahore.
PDMA Punjab issued alerts to commissioners and deputy commissioners of multiple divisions, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur.
Relief Commissioner Punjab Nabeel Javed directed officials to remain vigilant and ensure all precautionary measures are in place.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia emphasized the need for advanced preparations, including the activation of emergency control rooms and disaster response teams.
He urged the public to cooperate with administration efforts, particularly in evacuation procedures for riverside settlements and livestock.
Reservoir levels remain under watch, with Tarbela Dam at 87.08% live storage and Mangla Dam at 57.36%. Historical data indicates the potential for significant peaks, though current forecasts suggest manageable conditions.
The Punjab government has assured citizens of comprehensive support, including food, clean water, and medical aid at relief camps.

The Thari villagers and their pereẽ, who specialises in reading footprints in the sand, tracked the camels to a village across state lines, but they had to cough up 180 rupees in bhung or gratification to get them back. As camel stealing was not a cognisable offence under the Indian Extradition Act of 1903, however, the police could not arrest the thieves and extradite them to face punishment. Amending the law was out of the question, the correspondence debated, and so would a Border Badmash Conference be considered to tackle the menace?
 


Exactly 100 years later, the Tharis are still complaining of camel snatchings, but with one anthropological exception — they can no longer play detective in the desert. You see, it is impossible to track footprints on a road, whose construction in the 21st century changed all that.
I recently went to Tharparkar to report on these and other complaints, for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), which was holding its first ever camps in the district’s four main towns. The Commission had invited people from all over to talk about the violations they face, their problems and what they consider are their remedies. It wanted me to travel from Karachi to Islamkot with its team, stay overnight and then head to one camp being held in Nagar. The trip would wrap up the next day in Mithi at a meeting with members of civil society. My job was to write the information shared at the camp within 3,000 words. This was a task that should have barely taken a week but it took me three months. For you to understand why, allow me to take you back to the first night, in Islamkot.
Urine theft
My nanny for this visit is a socialist Thari of indeterminate age, S— sahib, whom I adore at first sight because he carries the air of someone who knows the land and has kept its time. Most of all, he understands that I am a foreigner who will need Thar to be translated. I am already fearful no ethical reporting can come out of parachuting in, hoovering up a few interviews and dressing them up as a feature.
I confide in S— sahib a self-conscious burden that writing about Tharparkar risks having an anaesthetic effect on the reader. If by some miracle, however, they remain conscious beyond the second paragraph, the sedative is sure to set in once the two inescapable topics of hydrology and petrology make an appearance. You feel compelled to always mention that there isn’t enough water in Thar but there are stupid amounts of coal.
Mercifully, S— sahib understands my predicament and elegantly plans an off-the-cuff briefing for me with his friends, a group of journalists, doctors, activists, tradesmen and babus. And so, on our first evening in Islamkot we head to dinner at a Hindu businessman’s office in the bazaar.

S— sahib’s group of friends tolerates my infantile questions on their material circumstances. As the evening wears on and my ink runs out, however, I dread that I’ve heard it all before: the necessities of civic life are in short supply but government neglect is in ample abundance. Thar does not have rain, colleges, hospitals and intolerance, but it does have deaf revenue officers, a land mafia and simplicity. To make matters worse, my ability to process all this information for a story is compromised by hypoglycaemia. It is well past my dinner time.
Suddenly, our host, the businessman, heaves himself up and proclaims, “What’s the matter S— sahib, won’t you have something to drink?” It dawns on me that my presence has probably had an inhibitory effect on the katchehri.
S— sahib does not answer and casts around the room for moral support, but his friends abandon him to disappear into their cell phones or check their manicures with their teeth.
“Well, I’ll have one.”
Our host freezes in the middle of proffering options extracted from his desk drawer. Everyone’s eyes snap to me.
I sit back and cock my head.
The businessman laughs. “Well, S— sahib,” he says with a twinkle in his eye, “What’s it gonna be?” And without bothering to wait for an answer, he plonks down the Toyo Nasic glasses and hollers for ice.
Relieved laughter defrosts the room. The gamble paid off. They feel as if I am one of them and can speak freely now.
This marked a turning point in my assignment, and so what follows below is as tight a version as I can muster of what I heard over three days in Thar. This includes insights I had the privilege to hear as a ‘female reporter’ in a room full of Sindhi- and Dhātki-speaking Meghwars, Lohanas, Sharmas and Kumars in Islamkot. Much of what these men said was corroborated by the villagers and townsfolk who spoke at the camp the next day and at the consultation in Mithi the next. By the end of the visit, I suspected that one single ailment could perhaps convey what they were all speaking of: the injury caused by Thar’s violent encounter with Capitalism. Allow me to make the case.
The Road

Tharis are not nature’s favoured subjects. It conspires against them from subterranean depths by offering up eyewatering supplies of black gold, rendering them vulnerable to corporate greed, displacement and ecological disaster. Meanwhile, it is tight-fisted with another precious resource, water, from on high above, leaving them to battle droughts every two to three years.
Qehet and coal gave Musharraf reason enough in the 2000s to decide that the desert needed to be open for business. The red carpet was rolled out, as a network of roads connecting towns like never before. The Road has since acquired metonymic status with Thari time being marked by the phrase Jab Road bana, just as Muhammad bin Qasim’s arrival is given as the beginning of Sindh’s official history in textbooks.

The Road made it possible for outsiders — businessmen, middlemen, opportunists — to penetrate a land that had otherwise been shut off for centuries, so much so that the Tharis began to complain that they stopped being able to recognise faces in the market. Theft and robbery went up, bringing with it a sense of insecurity that had never before been experienced here. (For an in-depth study, consider Arif Hasan’s Tharparkar: Drought, Development And Social Change)
The Road made Thar known to the rest of Pakistan and as a result of the drought, one of the first things that the new media access paid attention to were the dying babies. In reaction, sarkar and other saviours decided the solution was to bankroll nutrition programs and cash handouts. Even today, pregnant women, new mothers and children receive about Rs3,000 each a month under the Benazir Income Support Programme. The government doctor at the katchehri felt that these interventions have had a corrupting effect on Thari society. “Naturally, when one woman receives that money, she tells the others,” he said, before going on to confess his own capitulation. He could take one pregnant woman’s urine and make it possible for three non-gravid women to cash in. “It’s the truth, why should I lie?” he added. (I was not able to independently verify his claims.)
These so-called ‘fake’ pregnancies aren’t even what needs to be investigated, for Rs3,000 a month hardly enriches households under the poverty line. What the doctor claimed next is worrying: Women are having more babies — for cash. “They talk about family planning,” he scoffed, “but at the same time, they are giving money to encourage people to have more children.” His correlation between welfare checks and fertility rates is a tenuous one at best, but these remarks deepen my suspicion that government and non-government decision-making is doing more harm than good in a place like this.
Identity theft
I was further persuaded that it has always been easy to do systemic violence in Thar when I learnt how its very name came about. There was no such thing as ‘Tharparkar’ until the British squished together Thar and Parkar when they turned it into a district in the 1900s. This region was actually called Dhāt, and it was part of the Greater Rajputana states (Rajasthan desert). Parkar was an entirely separate region in Kutch.
This history lesson unfolded in Chhachhro, which nanny S— had persuaded me with his geriatric flirtations to go to, instead of Nagar, my original assignment. No one ever goes to Chhachhro, he told me. Indeed, this taluka’s sense of isolation became clear at its press club, where I was greeted with wonderment by activists Ali Akbar Rahimoo and Gautam Rathi. “We ourselves were wondering how come the HRCP had chosen to organise a camp here,” Ali Akbar said. “No one ever comes to Chhachhro.” In fact, when he sent out invitations for the HRCP human rights camp, people were confused. Did he want them to have their eyesight checked like at a medical camp?
Before the session began, Gautam Rathi and Ali Akbar felt I must understand the contours of Chhachhro’s history, which sets it apart from Thar’s and would help me understand present-day concerns.
Crucially, they say, up until the British showed up here, all this land was collectively owned and people lived close to water (wells and tarais or natural ponds). Throughout history, the Tharis lived off their livestock and whatever they could grow and barter (milk, ghee, wool, leather). The British introduced the ‘Rani Chaap’ coins with the Queen’s relief, a police force and a Revenue system and by 1930 had started granting people state land. But even then, the gowcher was left untouched so everyone’s animals could graze freely.

The British stayed here for about a hundred years, building dispensaries and schools, which made them well-liked by the Thari people who had not experienced governance in this shape before under Muslim Talpur, Kalhoro and Rajputana conquerors. The phrase, ‘Jee bhoora tina’ (lit. you did the White man thing) is still used today as praise for accomplishing what no one else does. When it came time for the British to leave at Partition in 1947, there was a general disbelief compounded by the upheaval caused by migrations.

The other major shaper of Thari history was the war with India in 1965, when this area was severed from Rajasthan. Thari Hindus were viewed with suspicion as they had family ties in India, giving the government a reason to step up surveillance. Paranoia ratcheted up by 1971 when India took over Chhachhro briefly and gutted it. It was only two years later, after the Shimla agreement, that the district was returned to Pakistan. It took a while for men to rebuild Chhachhro and for a long time it was known as the town of single men because it was unfit for families.
This historical tangent explains why Chhachhro was kept hermetically sealed up to 2001, so it could act as a buffer zone with India. “Since the 1971 war,” said one man at the camp, “The state of Pakistan has never treated [the people of] Tharparkar like a proper citizenry. We survive here like a colony.” There could be no roads into it, no TV, no tourists, no radio. That is why, the men told me, when The Road was built in the 2000s, everything changed.
The wrong address
Chhachhro Press Club is a no-computer, no furniture affair on the town’s main road. The HRCP organisers elect to seat people indoors and they leave the black refrigerator-sized speaker in the driveway. In a stroke of marketing genius, Ali Akbar Rahimoo tells the HRCP volunteers to keep the boombox facing the street so anyone who had gone about their business in town that day was sure to have heard about two dozen men blast out an untrammelled stream of anger about what was happening from villages Tar Dos to Khensar. HRCP didn’t need social media. It just held a five-hour organic live audio broadcast.

He is known as the encyclopedia of Thar because of his vast knowledge of its history and customs.

Some men spoke into the microphone with hands squarely gripping the lectern. Then there were others who had come clutching files and stood like children. They held back from the mic as if it were an unpredictable object that would steal their voice. They had come from all over Chhachhro and the new tehsil Dahli, which together are home to about a third of Thar’s population. Despite their scale, however, both districts are so thin on government presence that you have to drive two hours to Mithi to get any official business done. Dahli still doesn’t have a press club, and thus you never really hear about it.
You might assume that water scarcity topped the list of speaker priorities. It didn’t. Another natural resource, one that is in obscene amounts, emerged as the root of human rights violations: land. Gul Sher, a dignified young man whose family has lived in Khokhrapar for nine generations or three hundred years, came bearing news that about 800 sq km at the border had been sold to private companies. “But in the eyes of the law, none of this land belongs to us,” he said. “There are no ownership documents — nothing that proves we exist here.”

He was speaking at the Chhachhro HRCP camp on April 15, 2025.

I was expecting people to talk about garden variety human rights abuses (enforced disappearances, religious discrimination) at the HRCP camp for this is what we are used to hearing in Pakistan. And while they may very well be taking place at some scale, a far greater collective violence is being visited upon this land. It is just not visibly perpetrated by other humans as it is linked to the way people are impacted by the invisible flow of Capital and the alienation and abstraction it creates.
Tharis are constantly at risk of dislocation and dispossession even though they are perhaps the only people in Pakistan who all own homes, even if it is a thatched hut. The trouble is that they do not have the papers to prove it because the government has not surveyed the land. (A project was abandoned with only Kaloi and Islamkot covered two years ago). Proof lies in the number of court cases, which lawyer Shaukat Sindhi mentioned in Mithi. “Naturally, people will end up killing each other over plots,” he said. “The shame is that some of them are dying for fifty square yards, which is barely worth fifty thousand rupees.”

A map (above) explains why the Tharis are worried and the lack of a land survey could lead to widespread long-term inequalities. In the centre of Thar is a great 9,000 sq km chunk of land under which coal has been found. People fear they will have to eventually be told to vacate it. If Thar is 19,000 sq km large, that leaves about 10,000 sq km for the population. The government claims that half of the remaining land is cultivable and half is not.
Even if you go by the government’s standards and divide the cultivable half, that leaves 3.5 acres per family. Ali Akbar, who proposed this quick math, said, “Just computerise the land records for each family’s 3.5 acres at least. Do it and get it over with and do us all a favour.” If the Thari right to land were acknowledged, they could lease their property to outsiders and have proprietary and financial protection.
Selective application of state power leaves vacuums where local muscle can flex and businessmen can benefit from the absence of regulation. No one helps when feudals cut off access to gowcher by blocking pathways. Kalo Meghwar, in a scarlet turban, fluffy dhoti and scuffed brogues, said his graveyard, gowcher and pond have been taken over for four years by a badmash. “Our things are stolen, our homes are taken over, but since we are poor, we can’t take names,” he said. “The last time I took names, they treated me badly.” He stopped complaining three years ago but it has become too much. The HRCP team pressed him to be specific, but eventually let him be. There could have been informants in the room.
In a way, the Tharis are fighting less for their own human rights and more for their animals’ right to thrive and flourish. “Our way of rearing the livestock is centuries old,” said Dr Mashooq Ali in Mithi. “You go to any village and people don’t even know a Livestock Department exists, Animal Husbandry Department exists.” If this region is home to eight million or 15pc of Sindh’s livestock, why has more research not been done? Why don’t the three hundred veterinary centres work so the animals are vaccinated and can receive first aid? How can forty veterinary staffers for the district cater to eight million animals? Even if the vet makes it to your village in five hours, you won’t have the five thousand rupees to pay him for a sick goat.

Shopfront government
I would be doing a disservice to the people I met at the human rights camp by merely regurgitating what they said and not conveying the sophistication with which they said it. Each man made a concerted effort not to repeat what the previous speakers had said and instead add to the knowledge being shared. It was as if everyone valued the time and effort all of us had made to travel to Chhachhro and wanted to ensure that the HRCP team received as diverse a briefing as possible. (Usually at seminars, men will not stop speaking until you pry the mic from their necrotic hands). No, here I was witnessing something else: the spirit of community and mutual respect.
The men’s complaints were not discrete; something deeper connected them all. In my search for answers, I stumbled across a few thinkers whose theories fit beautifully (Claude Lévi-Strauss, David Harvey, Arturo Escobar, James C Scott, James Ferguson for those interested). The more I read their work, the more Thar seemed like a textbook example of a violent encounter with modernity.
Isolated places like it disintegrate when the powerful forces of modernity arrive at its doorstep — in this case because coal was discovered. Capitalism speeds up the collapse of such a society because it introduces the logics of profit, individualism and accelerated time. A self-sufficient region that fed, clothed and housed itself, is told that it is primitive and backward and needs to live better, easier, healthier, richer. They replace barter with cash, eat into gowcher for roads and railways, and introduce digital banking. A family who managed with their livestock and open land is forced into daily wage labour so its children can buy ten-rupee factory biscuits from Karachi.
When a coal-hungry State becomes interested in places like Thar then, they first have to make it easy to navigate and decipher. They need to be made ‘legible’ so maps, surveys and roads are drawn on what is considered a blank slate. As this new system is codified and becomes the formal documented way to manage Thar, intangible local knowledge and autonomy is replaced. The Road erases the centuries old wisdom of tracking prints in the sand.
The Road made it possible to penetrate the land so that Capitalism could invade the commons (gowcher and tarais) and turn them into profit-generating assets.
Corporations can now extract minerals, exploit labour, eat up land shared between villages. This is called accumulation by dispossession. Mandir leader Krishan Sharma gave an example of it in Mithi: “There is so much talk about Thar coal that little space is left for Thar salt.” At the border, the Sindh government has given corporate giant Hubsalt leases. Its machinery at plants in Ankerio and Mokhai process more salt than labourers can by hand. The mazdoor who would be able to make a year’s living in the saltflat in the winter has been replaced, I was told.
A reservoir was built with water taken from Nabisar village but it is meant to cool the power plant, not people. That plant sends 2700MW to the grid but the place it comes from doesn’t even get 10MW. Meanwhile, people have to shell out Rs18,000 for water tankers. “They say that Thar will change Pakistan,” scoffed activist Qamaruddin Rahimoo in Chhachhro. “But who will change Pakistan? They’ve discovered coal! Well, you expect us to eat coal? There is no light where they found coal.”
Even Thar rail is a cruel joke, they said, because not only is the government taking their land, it is cutting trees to make way for it — sheer blasphemy as one tree feeds 12 goats. They watched in horror as an NED university campus was built on what they say was a swathe of gowcher. Is all this construction even necessary? “For the last 15 years, Tharparkar has been a resource dumping site,” argues Ali Akbar. “There has been so much civil work here, you cannot even fathom it. You are making two-two hundred dispensaries.” The airport is just for the ‘corporates’ because Tharis certainly can’t afford the fare.
The rush to modernise and spend money is called ‘isomorphic mimicry’. The State copies what it thinks looks modern but without actually building capability to make it work. This is why Ghulam Murtaza Samejo said all he could report on the performance of elected union councillors is that tiles have been installed from the chowk to the press club with the Rs1.2 million Chhachhro budget. The town is otherwise turning into a garbage dump. Isomorphic mimicry is why only a fraction of the reverse osmosis plants work today and their staff is either not paid or their pay grazes the minimum wage. This applies to the health unit opened in Musharraf’s time. It was upgraded to a taluka headquarters hospital and given a brand new takhti, but it is still operating with its original 20 beds, according to Qamaruddin Rahimoo.
I hear you saying: But who is against development? Surely the Tharis wanted The Road. In each town I visited, people demanded connecting roads, electricity, water, hospitals, fresh textbooks every school year. No one wants isolation, to be hungry or not have food and medicine. The trouble with the way in which this kind of ‘modernity’ arrives is who decides it, who benefits and who is left out. The government and not the Tharis decide where the roads will be built. These roads are then marketed as a public good. Development does not solve problems, but redefines them to fit the logic of intervention.
I should mention here that the aforementioned theorists never said that traditional societies are devoid of injustice or their own cruelties. But removing them in the name of progress leads to collapse. As long as Tharis are not calling the shots, the burra sahib is merely replaced by the babu in Islamabad. It is no coincidence that Thar’s MNAs and MPAs were not even from Thar (but pirs such as the Jeelanis, Makhdooms, Mirs of Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Umarkot) up until The Road was built. In the meantime, infrastructure and energy projects have all been decided elsewhere.
Fall sick with the healing
The clearest evidence of this systemic violence done in the name of modernity with the machinery of Capitalism then, to my mind, is the suicide, and they were on everyone’s lips. About seven Tharis per 100,000 are killing themselves each year. I suspect, each individual case’s reasons aside, this is an expression of helplessness in a society whose culture is atrophying, people are being exploited and entire lifeways are being erased.
Early media coverage led to some government attention. A study was done, journalists were bussed in to scratch around, and a toll-free helpline was set up — imagine the Tharis dialing in. Mobile phone brain rot and unrequited love top the list of culprits but no one was satisfied with these explanations at the Mithi consultation. Lawyer Bhooro Mal Kohli wanted to know why every case of a young woman’s suicide is put down to one explanation: her “zehni tawazun” or mental balance was not right. Others said suicides are taking place when people cannot pay back their microfinance loans.
One reason for the lack of agreement on the cause of suicides is the absence of post-mortems. They are legally required in suspected cases but the police have to back off if the community resists. Then there are logistical challenges, according to SSP Adil Memon who oversees the district. If a person dies by suicide in a disconnected part of Thar, moving the body to a centre for a post-mortem is expensive. He has to dedicate an officer to take the tissue samples all the way to the nearest serologist, in Sukkur. Chhachhro does not have a woman MLO and even where they are available, they are reluctant to do a case because they will have to keep showing up in court.
An economist’s blueprint
Plenty of plans for Tharparkar are afoot but I find their self-confidence frightening so I ask what the Tharis would prefer as a solution and one man’s name kept coming up: economist Dr Kaiser Bengali.
I was told that his poverty reduction plan for Sindh had methods that would work for Thar as he understood how ‘development’ should take place without ruining the region. There should be a town every 40km, rainwater harvesting and mobile schools and healthcare facilties. These plans did not prioritise cement-heavy spending and were actually approved by the cabinet in 2021, but he says, it hasn’t been put into action.
 

This map from the Sindh poverty reduction plan for Tharparkar shows settlements dotted across the district. This is a highly unusual pattern because no clusters or densities exist. People spread themselves out over Thar because water was so scarce. Economists such as Kaiser Bengali now say that any planning should work with the natural patterns as much as possible and not gun for high-rise dense city formations generally considered the norm and solution elsewhere in Pakistan so the government can attend to as many people as possible in as small a space.

Dr Bengali’s plan finds favour because it takes its cues from Thari knowledge. Take, for instance, how the people have dwelled in the desert. Maps show villages dotted nearly equidistantly; the Tharis spaced themselves out by the location of wells and availability of water. There are no dense cities.
This principle flies in the face of modern city planning. A state cannot afford to set up and manage a hospital for a five-hut village but it could for a cluster of villages with a population of 10,000. Dr Bengali’s answer takes the middle ground by proposing rural clusters, which he says has already worked in Sujawal’s Chohar Jamali where they built 17 roads at a 40-km radius to connect villages. Other proposals to the government have specified a 10-km distance, according to work done by Sohail Sangi, Ali Akbar Rahimoo and a few other Thari activists.
The formula takes it a step further by giving rural growth centres functionality: Mithi for government, Nagar for the coal industry and so on. But all this has to happen soon for the land mafia has a free hand. Dr Bengali says the size of plots have to be policed so density does not develop given the water scarcity.
When I argue with Dr Bengali that Capitalist forces destroy cultures, he is blunt: “That culture [you are talking about] in Thar was largely starvation.” His prescription for it smarts even more. “Chhachhro should be phased out,” he says. “There is simply no water there.” It should not become a high-density population area. He even believes that livestock should stop being a source of livelihood as it is too water-intensive. Half of the animals die in the drought anyway, he says primly.
Dr Bengali’s attitude may be deflating but his formula is promising. I come away from this brief exposure to people in Islamkot, Mithi and Chhachhro certain of only one thing: it is not that easy to run Thar because the usual methods do more damage even if they seem to deliver.
What happens in Thar, stays in Thar
As S— sahib wraps up the katchehri in Islamkot and I exchange telephone numbers with the group of men, a chorus of protests erupt. This is zyadti [unfair], I am told, “You didn’t finish.”
Nanny S— gravely tells the group. “This is a test for us. Ye hamara imtehan hai: How much we keep this to ourselves is our zarf. A sahafi will do anything for their story.” I have a feeling he is referring to me.
But the others understand. What happened here, says one of them. “Kia hua?”
“Nothing,” I reply. “I have no idea.
What happened?” I gather up my notebook, bag and prepare to leave.
Yes, we didn’t see anything, comes the reply.
And so, on that cool night in Islamkot, deep in the heart of Dhāt, no one saw anything. There was no story to tell. No one was the wiser.

Pakistan has lately seen a surge in terrorism across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has also worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.
“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement said.
Field Marshall Munir also shed light on Pakistan’s recent military escalation with India, condemning New Delhi’s “blatant sponsorship of terror proxies, characterising them as a failed attempt to target the deep-rooted patriotism of the people of Balochistan.”
The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
He elucidated that India, having suffered defeat in Marka-i-Haq — the period of conflict from April 22 to May 10 — had “now escalated its proxy war to advance her nefarious designs.”
He said New Delhi was using Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan — terms the state uses to refer to the TTP and terrorist groups in Balochistan, respectively — as “pawns of Indian hybrid war against Pakistan.”
“The COAS said that these proxies will face a similar fate and humiliation as faced in Marka-i-Haq,” the statement said.
During his talk, the army chief also emphasised that terrorists knew no bounds of religion, sect, or ethnicity, necessitating a unified national response, stressing the imperative of collective resolve in confronting this menace.
He highlighted the “pivotal role of development initiatives in Balochistan, advocating for enhanced inter-agency cooperation and a cohesive national approach to propel provincial progress and national advancement.”
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace, the COAS underscored the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, protecting national prestige and ensuring the well-being of its citizens, the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-07-30 05:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/300951585eaf71e.png?r=095205' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927550/bisp-not-probing-any-irregularities-involving-miftahs-firm-chairperson' target='_blank'><strong>BISP not probing  any ‘irregularities’ involving Miftah’s firm: chairperson</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The head of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has said the organisation was not investigating alleged irregularities involving the company of former finance minister Miftah Ismail.
“BISP is not investigating the case but those involved in any wrongdoing must be punished,” BISP Chairperson Rubina Khalid said in a press briefing on Tuesday.
She was referring to allegations that Mr Ismail’s family company unfairly benefited from World Food Programme (WFP) contracts linked to the Benazir Nashonuma Programme (BNP), a BISP initiative to address stunting among pregnant and lactating women and their children.
Last week, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in the Senate that a former finance minister had increased the budget of BNP at a time when his company was the sole supplier of specialised nutritional food under the programme.

Rubina hails nutrition programme’s impact on mothers and children

The minister didn’t name Mr Ismail, who is a critic of the current government. The former finance minister has rejected the allegations and called them politically motivated.
Ms Khalid said the controversy about the allocation would not affect the while programme, which according to official data so far has benefitted 645,800 pregnant women and 630,000 children.
“It is a wonderful programme to take care of mothers and children by providing healthy nutrition for two years since birth,” she added.
She credited the programme for cutting the rate of stunting in children by more than six per cent.
Exit strategy
While talking about BISP’s effectiveness and it’s impact, Ms Khalid rejected the impression that the programme was “turning people into beggars.”
She said BISP was a support programme and did not bar anyone from doing job or business.
“We give a quarterly stipend of Rs13,500 to the beneficiaries, which means Rs4,500 per month. No one can run their house with this meagre amount, but it somehow reduces the gap between income and expenditure of the poor class,” Ms Khalid added.
She said BISP’s Hunarmand Programme was aimed at providing financial and technical assistance to the deserving students.
“Recently, two students who have benefited from the programme have clinched top positions in Class X in Multan,” she added.
When asked about steps taken to protect women beneficiaries from fraud, Ms Khalid said a new project was being launched on Aug 14 under which bank accounts of the beneficiaries will be opened in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Quetta, Gilgit and Muzzaffarabad, etc.
She said the programme has chalked out an “exit strategy” to see if the programme is having a tangible impact on people’s social status.
Under the strategy, more than 10 million beneficiaries of BISP will have to verify their status every three years.
The strategy has been implemented from June to determine whether the beneficiary’s monetary status has improved.
If any improvement in their financial status is confirmed, the said beneficiary will be removed from BISP’s beneficiaries’ data, Ms Khalid added.

Minister for Housing Riaz Hussain Pirzada reached out to Allama Dr Shabbir Hassan Maisami, while Punjab Governor Salim Haider talked to Allama Arif Hussain Wahidi, secretary general of the council, by phone.
The engagements reportedly focused on the difficulties pilgrims were facing due to the government’s decision to bar them from travelling to Iran and Iraq by road.
The SUC leaders said a significant number of pilgrims travel by road through Balochistan every year to visit holy sites in the two countries.
They told the government functionaries that the ban had triggered widespread concern and unrest among the pilgrims who had planned to visit Karbala for Arbaeen, the annual observance of the Chehlum of Imam Husain.
Sources within the SUC confirmed that government representatives had assured them of further consultations and of exploring viable options to resolve the matter.
Earlier, the SUC had publicly rejected the government’s move, calling it a violation of the pilgrims’ fundamental rights.
MWM slams decision
Senator Allama Nasir Abbas, a leader of the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslim­een, criticised the federal government’s decision to impose travel restrictions on pilgrims.
Senator Abbas made it clear that every year “almost a million people belonging to both Shia and Sunni schools of thought travel to Iraq for pilgrimage during this sacred occasion, but now they are being denied the right to perform their religious duties.”
He recalled that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had recently visited Iran, where he held talks with his Iranian and Iraqi counterparts about facilitating travel for Pakistani pilgrims. “But without any consultation or prior notice, the government abruptly declared that no one will be allowed to travel by road,” he added.

Americans re-elected Donald Trump, knowing his fascist proclivities, to accomplish precisely this aim. Notwithstanding the clownish aspects of the fascist consolidation of power (reminiscent of the classical precedents), the cruelty, vengeance, ignorance and pettiness are real, and threaten to take down the entire human species in the course of the predictable implosion from within.
In writing about incipient American fascism since the late 1990s, I have always been careful to note the missing elements compared to the Italian and German precedents, particularly the lack of a charismatic leader and a revolutionary militia, but no such doubts remain. I was cautious even 10 years ago, when pointing out the limited appeal of the alt-right’s ethno-nationalist fantasies, but no longer hesitate to declare this a classical fascist dictatorship in its objectives. Curtis Yarvin’s prescription for a revived monarchy, appealing to authoritarian tech bros, is useful as shorthand, but the case of American fascism is overdetermined and suffers from a surfeit of explanations.
In just six months, this version of Trump, empowered by reactionary oligarchs during the 2020-2024 interregnum, has been worse than the most diehard pessimists expected. Trump’s personal buffoonery aside, the masterplan being executed to convert this nation into an authoritarian/ monarchical/ post-constitutional ethno-state is breathtaking for its rigour, discipline and single-mindedness.
In retrospect, Democrats clearly must have been privy to these internal machinations, glimpses of which appeared in Project 2025, but because they have themselves been the main party carrying the neoliberal virus, serious opposition is precluded. In basic substance they agree with the conversion of the American citizen into a compliant consumer-subject, and the convergence of pseudo-AI (not the real thing) with the radical aims of depopulation, disenfranchisement and the projected importation of the apocalyptic warlordism of the Mad Max world the empire has already conjured, with the help of its abject proxy Israel, in the Middle East.
When crushing media dissenters with debilitating lawsuits and studiously ignoring federal judges’ orders to stop disappearing migrants to foreign concentration camps (whether in El Salvador or South Sudan) or to reinstate essential government employees laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE chainsaw-wielders, the administration does so with the assurance that the supreme court will always provide it with just enough cover to go ahead with its plans, whether to end Medicare and social security or to fatally undermine birthright citizenship.
The post-constitutionalists are also guaranteed zero real opposition from the Democrats, who have shown more gumption over taking down one of their own, and the brightest and most popular at that, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, while remaining silent accomplices to the deportations, the gutting of entire agencies like the FDA and the Department of Education, and the acceleration of the anti-Islamic wars in the Middle East.

Civil society is paralysed and unable to summon any meaningful response to the daily annihilation of liberties.

The empire is putting itself out of business by dismantling federal government agencies looking after health, education, safety, retirement and welfare. It is destroying the second-to-none higher education system by punishing universities for so-called DEI by defunding them, banishing international students, and ending basic research. It is destroying immigration by going after birthright citizenship in addition to unprecedented mass deportations resembling the former Latin American dictatorships’ ‘disappearances’. It is imposing a radical tariffs regime all but overturning the global economic order that it painstakingly constructed and defended by military coercion over the last 80 years. It is militarising a long-running subterranean civil war by putting the military on the streets without provocation and without bothering to invoke legal justification.
In short, because this is faster and more comprehensive than expected, and more disciplined and organised because of the oligarchic forces emboldening Trump and using him as an instrument to attain complete asymmetrical power, civil society is paralysed and unable to summon any meaningful response to the daily annihilation of liberties. The worst of the symbolism has been the omnipresent masked mercenaries, masquerading as official ICE agents, arresting dutiful immigrants showing up in court for their appointments while pursuing legal means of residency.
Except for a handful of the usual leftist critics who remain on the fringes, and have been so since the Bush administration’s preview of the current atrocities under more legal cover, there is no appetite among Americans for a reckoning of how and why we got here, aside from a cute nostalgic wish to return to ‘normality’ as it existed before, where ‘we the people’ allegedly sent our obedient representatives to Washington, and monarchy ended with the 1776 revolution.
But why would an empire which — if things were managed skillfully — could have lasted a long while yet, especially given China’s hesitancy to claim the mantle of world leadership, end itself? World-class universities, a global trading regime supporting dollar hegemony and a largely undeserved high domestic standard of living, and in-migration of the best and brightest, are features of the late-stage empire to be crushed only if you desire in the end to destroy even your own MAGA supporters.
Trump’s autarkic sensibility — which has resonated strongly with less-educated Americans all throughout the Cold War and afterwards — might represent the wish to carve out three independent authoritarian zones, America (with expanded he­­m­­ispheric territory), Russia (with claims on Euro­­pe) and China (much of Asia, except the Middle Eastern oil states), but this seems too schematic, and American military strategy won’t allow it.
There is the perfect symmetry of empire beginning with genocide and ending with one. The psychological burden of fighting endless wars and flattening nation after nation for more than 80 years, in Latin America, Africa, Asia and more recently the Muslim world, has become too much to bear. At some point, when empire’s atrocities become too great, the contradictions and hypocrisies dissolve entirely, as the empire implodes in a burst of honesty, and citizens step back to admire their own gruesome handiwork.
The scary thing is that Trump is merely an exc­l­a­mation point, giving vent to the vapid brutality of the American soul, in both its liberal and conserva­t­­ive incarnations, with no varnish or prettification.

The interaction between the top diplomats came about a month and half after President Donald Trump hosted Pakistan’s army chief at a White House lunch, the first time a US president has feted a military chief from Pakistan who wasn’t the head of state as well.
It signalled a dramatic revival of relations that had remained dormant for the past four years. It’s certainly a positive development. Yet the contours of the new phase of the Pak-US relationship have yet to fully emerge. It seems more of a transactional than strategic relationship at this point.
There is also the question of whether the resetting of ties is the result of an institutional policy review in Washington or just Trump’s personal initiative, considering the American leader’s mercurial approach to key matters in international relations. Pakistan would be dealing with an administration that has the dubious reputation of rapidly changing priorities.
Pakistan’s military and civilian leadership seem pleased with the way they have boosted the US president’s ego by nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, but the results of such actions are short-lived in light of the extreme ups and downs that this critical bilateral relationship has experienced over seven decades.

Historically, the Islamabad-Washington engagement has been framed narrowly.

With the end of America’s two-decade-long war in Afghanistan in 2021, Pak-US relations have come full circle. Originally touted as a strategic relationship, it morphed into a transactional one. Perhaps the biggest confusion in various US departments revolves around how to deal with Pakistan — as friend or foe? Post-9/11, the two nations could at best be described as ‘frenemies’.
Pakistan was blamed for America’s humiliation in Afghanistan. During Joe Biden’s administration, the relationship hit a new low. After the Afghan war, changing regional geopolitics created a fresh alignment of forces. The growing strategic alliance between the US and India and the China-Pakistan axis are reflected in the emerging geopolitics.
Pakistan’s growing strategic relations with China and the escalating tension between Washington and Beijing, too, cast a shadow over future Pak-US relations. Although Pakistan was still engaged by Washington diplomatically, the relationship went into deep freeze. Meanwhile, the US tilt towards India, which had emerged as Washington’s strategic ally in the region, too, affected Pak-US ties.
After a long freeze, a thaw was witnessed soon after Trump returned to the White House for the second time. In his first address to a joint session of Congress in March this year, the American president praised Pakistan for capturing the mastermind of the deadly attack at Kabul airport in August 2021, which had killed over a dozen American soldiers.
It was apparent that despite hitting a low in their relationship, the two countries continued to cooperate on counterterrorism. The capture of a key terrorist leader of the militant Islamic State group, who was involved in the killing of American soldiers in Afghanistan, was one such example. Counterterrorism assistance helped with the thaw. Recently, Centcom chief Gen Michael E Kurilla detailed how such cooperation had led to the capture of the terrorist. “They [Pakistan] are in an active counterterrorism fight right now, and they have been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world,” Kurilla said in his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee in Washington.
Yet another significant breakthrough in the relationship between the two countries came with America’s role as peacemaker in the recent conflict between India and Pakistan. President Trump claimed it was US intervention that prevented a nuclear war between the two nations, though India has continued to deny yielding to outside pressure. It may have been the first time that trade was leveraged by an American administration in peace diplomacy.
The episode reflected a significant change in Washington’s stance on the Pakistan-India conflict. In recent times, America had shown little interest in facilitating bilateral engagement beyond reactive diplomacy to manage crises. But Trump’s public and vocal intervention in this case marked a departure from Washington’s long-standing policy of de-hyphenating its relations with the two South Asian nations. Some analysts see the change as the Trump administration’s move to recalibrate its tilt towards India.
India is certainly not happy that the US, which it considers a strategic ally, tried to play the role of arbiter. Yet, there is a limit to the role of an external power in bridging the widening cleavage between two warring neighbours. Pakistan’s expectations that Washington could help bring itself and India to the negotiating table are unrealistic.
Historically, the Islamabad-Washington engage­­ment has been framed narrowly, dictated either by short-term security interests or a common challenge. But the growing interest in rare earths and other minerals has also come to define the Trump administration’s policy towards Pakistan. Several US companies have reportedly shown an interest in Pakistan’s emerging minerals sector. But security issues in the region, where most of the mineral deposits are supposed to be located, makes it hard to attract foreign investment.
Pakistan is also close to reaching a deal with Washington on tariffs that is likely to give it an advantage over other competitors. Pakistan’s exports to the US are over $5 billion annually — 18pc of the total exports of the country. Textile products comprise 75 to 80pc of total exports to the US.
For Pakistan, the US remains an important trading and economic partner. But there is also a need to be cautious so that the country doesn’t become a tool in America’s regional conflicts at the cost of relations with strategic allies. These concerns are heightened in the backdrop of growing regional tensions that directly or indirectly involve the US. Pakistan must not allow itself to be sucked into America’s wars.

Indian Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday told parliament that three suspects killed in an alleged encounter near Srinagar, as part of the so-called Operation Mahadev, were responsible for the Pahalgam killings. He alleged that the suspects were Pakistanis.
However, local security sources had on Monday told Radio Pakistan that New Delhi could stage “fake encounters” involving Pakistanis incarcerated in India and label these counterterrorism operations. The ISPR chief had earlier expressed similar fears. Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi indulged in more Pakistan-bashing during Tuesday’s parliament session.
But it is not just Pakistan that is casting doubt on India’s Pahalgam narrative; credible voices within that country are also questioning the official line, particularly New Delhi’s efforts to link Pakistan to the terrorist attack. P. Chidambaram, India’s former home minister, is the latest to question the BJP’s narrative. Talking to media outlets, Mr Chidambaram said there was “no evidence” that the Pahalgam attackers were Pakistanis, and that the state had not given clear information about the episode. The former minister further said New Delhi was hiding facts about losses suffered by India during the four-day conflict in May. “Be upfront,” he chided the government.
The BJP is facing similarly stinging queries in parliament regarding the incident. It is overly convenient that the current home minister triumphantly announced that the attackers had been traced and killed — and expediently linked to Pakistan — as more and more Indian voices demand the truth.
Instead of spinning a narrative that has few takers, the BJP regime needs to be honest with its own people, as well as the world. Promoting doubtful accounts will mislead Indians and further damage ties with this country that have already hit rock bottom. Moreover, many of India’s traditional foreign allies are not ready to accept New Delhi’s charge against Pakistan.
The rational course of action would require India to honestly tell the world what happened, admit that mistakes were made, and try to patch things up with Pakistan to reduce the chances of further conflict in the subcontinent. The least that should be expected from New Delhi is to not further drag Pakistan into this quagmire and blame it for India’s own failures.
However, this requires statesmanship, and currently there appears to be no one imbued with this quality in the ruling set-up. It is unfortunate that jingoism, radical religious nationalism and arrogance seem to be the current driving forces of Indian policy towards Pakistan.

• UK moves towards ‘recognition’ of Palestinian state; Ishaq Dar calls it ‘test case’ for the world
GAZA / LONDON: The besieged territory of Gaza is slipping into famine, UN aid agencies warned on Tuesday, as the death toll from Israel’s nearly 22-month war surpassed 60,000.
The World Food Programme (WFP), Unicef and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned that time was running out and that Gaza was “on the brink of a full-scale famine”.
Meanwhile, the Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) air-drops will not be enough to avert the “humanitarian catastrophe”.
“The worst-case scenario of famine is now unfolding in the Gaza Strip,” said the IPC, a grouping of NGOs and institutions that serves as the world’s main monitor for gauging malnutrition, in a statement.
The IPC said its latest data shows that “famine thresholds” have been reached in most of Gaza and hunger-related deaths of young children were rising fast.
Although Israel launched daily pauses in its military operations in some parts of Gaza over the weekend, and opened secure routes to enable UN and other aid agencies to distribute food, Israeli strikes continued overnight, killing 30 people in the Nuseirat refugee camp.
Speaking in Geneva, the WFP’s emergency director Ross Smith said the humanitarian disaster was reminiscent of last century’s famines in Ethiopia and Nigeria’s Biafra region.
“This is unlike anything we have seen in this century,” he told reporters.
UK move towards recognition
Following an emergency meeting of his cabinet, UK PM Keir Starmer had announced that Britain would make the move unless Israel took substantive steps to allow more aid to enter Gaza, made clear there will be no annexation of the West Bank and commits to a long-term peace process that delivers a two-state solution.
Starmer said his government would make an assessment in September on “how far the parties have met these steps”, but that no one would have a veto over the decision.
“I have always said that we will recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution,” he said in a Downing Street address.
France recently announced it would formally recognise the state of Palestine in September, and the UK would become the second permanent member of the UN Security Council to do so, if it goes ahead with the recognition.
UN conference
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has termed the Israel-Palestine question a “test case” for the world, particularly the United Nations, and sought “credible and enforceable international action”.
His call came during the three-day conference on ‘The peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution’, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia.
In his remarks, Deputy PM Dar told the conference, “The Palestinian question is a test case for the United Nations and the world. Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
During his speech, Mr Dar urged the conference to “ensure universal recognition of the state of Palestine and its full UN membership”.
He said, “Pakistan stands ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters… Pakistan is prepared to contribute to the building of institutions, including through participation in the Arab-OIC Plan, and any international protection mechanism.
“The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people. The occupation must end, and end now. It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine’s full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region.”
On the sidelines of the conference, Mr Dar met Palestinian PM Mohammad Mustafa and held a detailed exchange on the grave situation in Gaza and occupied Palestinian territory.
He also met Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya, expressed their “deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza”.

The remarks came from Justice Ayesha A. Malik , who was a member of the two-judge bench alongside Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, which decided the Sindh government’s appeal against a Feb 27 decision of the Sindh High Court (SHC) Circuit Bench Larkana.
The case was brought by Sorath Fatima, whose father was an employee of the Road and Transport Department, Sindh.
He died in February 2002 and his pension was awarded to his widow — Ms Fatima’s mother — who also died in December 2012.
Ms Fatima, being an unmarried daughter, sought the pension of her father, which she received until she married.
However, when Ms Fatima’s marriage ended in August 2022, she sought the resumption of her father’s pension on the grounds that being a divorced daughter, she was entitled to it.
The Sindh government denied her application, and Ms Fatima challenged the decision before the SHC, which ruled in her favour. The Sindh government then appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court.
 
 

In the 10-page judgment, Justice Malik expressed the concern that a daughter’s entitlment to pension depended entirely on her marital status.
“This dependency model reveals that there is a systematic bias that treats a daughter as a dependent, with her financial dependency shifting from parent to spouse,” the judgment added.
This assumption not only perpetuated “stereotypical mindset about women being dependent members” but also fails to recognise women as individuals or “autonomous individuals” who can be financially independent.
It is also based in the “flawed belief” that unmarried or divorced women are financially dependent, while married women are financially secure, the judgment highlighted.
Justice Malik said pension was an “earned right” passed onto the legal heirs of a deceased government servant.
Justice Malik emphasised the need to revisit pension law and remove marital status as a condition for entitlement.

“US President Mr Trump has said that he got the war between Pakistan and India stopped. There is no achievement bigger than this diplomatic achievement,” PM Shehbaz said while speaking at a gathering after inaugurating the upgraded Pak Business Express and newly introduced passenger facilities at Lahore railway station.
“We are streamlining our relations with the United States,” he added.
On Pakistan’s relations with China, PM Shehbaz said work was underway on the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “We are in full coordination with China on the CPEC-2,” he said.

Lauds railways for upgrading dining facilities and other services like Wi-Fi

He also highlighted improvements in Pakistan’s economic performance, including a drop in inflation from 38pc to 5pc and a reduction in the policy rate to 11pc.
Railway ‘progress’
In his address, the prime minister acknowledged the deterioration of Pakistan’s railway system, once considered a model for public transport. “The railway system in Pakistan was once the best, but unfortunately, it faced destruction,” he said, adding that he had appointed Hanif Abbasi as Minister for Railways to address these issues.
 
 

PM Shehbaz applauded the railways for upgrading its passenger services, including the introduction of Wi-Fi, escalators, modern dining rooms and clean washrooms, as well as the ending of obsolete ticket checking and purchasing systems. He stressed the need for further digitisation to meet future goals.
He asked Mr Abbasi to revive international freight services through goods train operations and commended the improvements in cleanliness and the provision of ATMs at railway stations.
Mr Abbasi, in his address, discussed ongoing developments in the railway sector, including digitisation, new coaches and the expansion of online ticketing services. He stressed that the railways had earned Rs93 billion in revenue during the 2024-25 fiscal year, with support from provincial governments for infrastructure improvements.
Kyrgyzstan ties
PM Shehbaz on Tuesday also met with a high-level delegation from Kyrgyzstan, led by Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Edil Baisalov, to discuss bilateral cooperation.

• Omar Ayub complains to CJP about ‘procedural violations’ in May 9 trials
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has postponed the hearing of a set of challenges instituted by PTI founder Imran Khan over being denied post-arrest bail by the Lahore High Court (LHC) in eight cases related to the May 9 violence.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the two-judge bench took up the matter on Tuesday, but adjourned proceedings until Aug 12, although PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja informed the bench that senior counsel Sal­man Safdar, who had filed the app­eals, had requested an adjournment until next week.
Mr Raja also asked the bench to issue notices to the respondent, mainly the state, through Punjab’s prosecutor general. However, the court adjourned the case for Aug 12, ignoring both requests to push the hearing date to next week and for the issuance of notices to the respondents.
In his plea, Imran Khan had argued that contrary to the prosecution’s accusations that he orchestrated the May 9 violence, he was held incommunicado in NAB custody at the time of the alleged offence.
Therefore, his involvement in the May 9 riots was impossible, Mr Khan argued, also reminding that the Supreme Court had already held that the case of an abettor who was not present at the scene of occurrence stands on a lower legal footing than that of a principal accused.
On Nov 27, 2024, an anti-terrorism court had denied Mr Khan bail in the eight cases, which include the Lahore attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty Chowk, PML-N offices in Model Town, the Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House and violence at Sherpao Bridge. The LHC later rejected Mr Khan’s bail plea as well.
The fresh appeal contended that the PTI founder had been allegedly subjected to an unprecedented campaign of political victimisation since his ouster from the office of the prime minister two years ago.
Omar Ayub writes to CJP
Separately, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan has written to CJP Yahya Afridi, raising concerns over procedural violations in the ongoing trials related to the events of May 9.
In his letter, Mr Ayub urged the CJP to initiate a judicial inquiry into allegations of misconduct by police and prosecutors and to reopen concluded trials.
“This letter is a solemn appeal on behalf of myself, my party, and the many Pakistani citizens who have been caught up in the web of rushed and unfair May 9 trials currently being conducted in multiple cities,” Mr Ayub wrote.
“The Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs) in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sargodha, and other cities are hearing cases related to May 9 with a speed and manner that shocks the conscience of any impartial observer”.
“Hearings commence early morning and extend late into the night; in fact, it is reliably reported that in some cases, proceedings continue until 2am to 3am. This is neither justice delayed nor justice served — this is justice crushed and justice buried under the weight of exhaustion, coercion and haste.”
Mr Ayub also accused the authorities of using the trials for political persecution, alleging that police reports and prosecutions lacked credible evidence and were marked by procedural irregularities.
While claiming that media access to these trials has been severely restricted, he said: “The courts must stand as bulwarks against tyranny, and when constitutional rights are trampled, it is their duty to restore justice and equity.”

Some of them returned to the country during Muha­­rram, others had fled the Iran-Israel war a month ago; and nearly all of them possess valid travel documents issued by the Iranian government. But the border crossing, located almost 70km from the port city of Gwadar, has remained closed since the Iran-Israel conflict broke out.
The stranded individuals have been staying in hotels and other lodgings, while immigration officials await ‘fresh orders’ to process their exit. The recent bar on travelling to Iraq and Iran by road has only complicated matters.
An official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), posted at the Gabd border, said the students had valid travel documents, but they could not be allowed to cross, as the border was still closed.
“No fresh order has been issued by the Pakistani authorities concerned for opening the border with Iran (after the war ended),” FIA Deputy Director Asif Naseem told Dawn.
He said that in addition to the earlier closure, a recent decision by the government to ban road travel during Chehlum had also imposed restrictions on such travel. The FIA official said the students could travel to their destination by air.
Last week, the Iranian embassy in Islamabad issued guidelines for pilgrims, saying the land entry would be subject to the approval of the Pakistani government. A day later, the government said no such travel would be allowed on account of security concerns.
However, it did not specify if the ban pertained to the Chehlum pilgrims or applied to all travellers entering Iran. In any case, land crossings with Iran haven’t re-opened since the war.
 
 

“More than 50 students, some with families, are stuck at the Gabad border, while hundreds more are waiting in Karachi and other towns, as Pakistani immigration officials claim they have received no instructions to process their exit,” said Maulana Ali Anwar, brother of one of the stranded students.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Anwar, who is also a Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM) office-bearer, said his brother was stuck at Gabad. He added that many other students had been staying in Karachi and other cities after receiving the news about the stranded students.
According to Mr Anwar, the students, having Iqama, return to their native areas every year during the Muharram holidays and start returning to Iran in the Islamic month of Safar.
‘Arrangements being made’
On the other hand, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry told Dawn that arrangements were being made to facilitate “some 30 to 40 students” stranded at the Pak-Iran border. Jus­tifying the ban concerning land pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq, he claimed it was meant to facilitate Zaireen.
According to the minister, the government will introduce fundamental changes by August 31 to regulate pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq on the pattern of Haj and Umrah.
Asked to comment on fears that the ‘tour operator mafia’ would be the ultimate beneficiary of this policy, he said hundreds of operators would be registered under an open and transparent policy, noting that healthy competition would benefit the pilgrims. “It is a successful model in many parts of the world,” he remarked.
He said Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq were in the process of formulating a joint strategy to facilitate pilgrims, adding that the interior secretary would soon pay a visit to the two countries for follow-up meetings with the relevant authorities. He also revealed that a ship service for pilgrims was being mulled.

A day earlier, representatives from the State Bank of Pakistan, finance min­istry, commercial banks and exchange companies met with senior security officials to discuss steps to bring down the dollar price, stabilise the exch­ange rate and stop the smuggling of US currency to Afghanistan and Iran.
Another meeting, held on Tuesday, was dominated by the crypto agenda and saw Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) CEO Bilal Bin Saqib gave a presentation on the usage of virtual currencies in Pakistan.
In May, Mr Saqib was appointed the PM’s special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.
“We were told that the cryptos are the future currency for the changed economic world,” said a banker, on condition of anonymity.
 
 

He said the presentation and subsequent Q&A on crypto took “80 per cent time” of the meeting held on Tuesday.
Participants of the meeting Dawn spoke to said it seemed like the government was in hurry to make use of cryptocurrencies on a large scale and make them part of the economy as soon as possible.
Some have raised questions about the high-level of risk involved, but Mr Saqib played down the speculative risks.
Although cryptocurrencies have been in vogue for years, most central banks around the world have steered clear of any attempts to regulate them.
On July 9, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed had said that they were preparing to launch a pilot for a digital currency, and were finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets.
 
 

The SBP and Finance Division are currently engaged with the Pakistan Crypto Council to develop an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for virtual assets.
“Risks are still high, since the prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate with wide margin, like Bitcoin prices could jump from $35,000 to to $70,000,” a financial expert said.
However, he claimed that both the SBP and the government were ready for crypto transactions.
On Tuesday, banks, foreign exchange companies and gold traders were briefed on the benefit of such currencies.
Participants of the meeting were told that the central bank would issue licenses for crypto trading banks and other financial institutions. One banker hinted at the possibility of opening field offices in major cities to make virtual assets easily accessible and promote virtual transactions.

• Chitral MNA decries conviction based on ‘political vendetta’
• Gohar warns commission to stick to Constitution
• ECP official says appeals process remains open
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday disqualified Abdul Latif, a PTI MNA from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions have been taken in recent days.
The move comes just a day after three other PTI lawmakers were disqualified, including a senator and the leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.
In a notification, the ECP said that under its July 29 order, Mr Latif was disqualified in accordance with Article 63(1h) of the Constitution. His seat in the National Assembly has become vacant following the disqualification.
In May, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad sentenced Mr Latif and four others to 27 years in prison for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, attack on the Ramna police station. The verdict was announced by ATC Special Court-II Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, who found the accused guilty of arson, violence and attacking law enforcement personnel during the riots.
Earlier on Tuesday, a five-member bench of the commission, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard a reference, a representation and a complaint to de-seat Chitrali on the basis of Anti-Terrorism Court verdict of May 30, 2025. The bench reserved judgement, which was placed on its website after office hours.
“Deriving wisdom from the referred judgement wherein it has been held that “where there is a conviction recorded by a competent court against a person who is a member of the Parliament which has attained finality, the role and function of the Election Commission is confined to issuing notification of disqualification of the concerned member on the basis of the verdict of the Court,” it reads.
Despite his conviction, a firebrand Mr Latif denied the charges, claiming he was wrongfully convicted in retaliation for refusing a Rs2 billion bribe to support the “controversial” 26th Constitutional Amendment. Mr Latif described the conviction as politically motivated, calling it an act of vengeance.
‘Democracy at stake’
PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed concerns over the disqualification of PTI lawmakers, warning that “democracy is at stake”.
Talking to a private TV channel, he acknowledged the growing concerns regarding the way political trials have been conducted, hinting that the situation had been clear from the beginning.
“We could see the writing on the wall,” he added.
The PTI leader also asked the ECP to refrain from justifying its actions and instead “follow the Constitution and the law”.
Appeals ‘open’
When asked for comment, a senior ECP official clarified that under the Constitution, a parliamentarian stood disqualified from office following a conviction.
The official explained that while the right to appeal remains intact even after disqualification, the disqualified member’s seat remains vacant until a court ruling overturns the conviction.
The official noted that if a member receives interim relief from a high court, which suspends the sentence, the disqualification remains in place. However, should higher courts overturn the conviction, the ECP would restore the individual’s victory notification.

A notification has been issued by the Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department, enforcing Section 5 and 7 of the Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health Ordinance, 2002. 
The new policy prohibits smoking, use of e-cigarettes, vapes and all tobacco-related products in the parks. It also bans the sale of such items at tuck shops, cafes and vending points within or around the public parks. 
According to the notification, visible ‘No Smoking’ signboards will be installed throughout the parks and designated staff will actively monitor compliance. All Parks and Horticulture Authorities (PHAs) have been instructed to fully implement the law within 10 days. 
“Since the litter from cigarette butts and packaging pollutes the environment and harms the aesthetic appeal of green spaces, this decision is a forward-thinking step to ensure clean surroundings and protect public health especially the youth,” said Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal said during his to the Lawrence Gardens along with the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) Director General Mansoor Ahmad.  
“The move reflects the Punjab government’s broader commitment to sustainability, community well-being, and the intelligent use of public resources, reinforcing the province’s goal of modernising urban life while preserving public health,” he added. 
Under the decision, all public parks across the province have officially been declared no-smoking zones. 
The secretary inspected various parts of the Lawrence Gardens and emphasized the need to preserve and highlight the park’s historic identity. 
He directed that all the laws and regulations must be strictly enforced in public gardens and parks to ensure a peaceful and healthy environment for families and fitness enthusiasts. 
However, it has not been announced how the ban would be implemented and what would happen in case of violation. 
When France recently imposed a nationwide ban on smoking in parks and on beaches, it came with a clear rule of 90 euros fine on the violators and in case of nonpayment of fine within 15 days, the fine would go up to 135 euros. 
According to the Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health Ordinance, 2002, a violator may face a fine from Rs1,000 to Rs100,000, depending on severity and frequency of the violation.

According to District Food Controller (DFC) Shad Muhammad, Additional Assistant Commissioner and Food Inspector raided a location in Kuzabanda based on intelligence information. The raid resulted in the recovery of the slaughtered donkey and the arrest of two individuals, belonging to Hunza and Mansehra.
The arrested people claimed they were supplying the meat to Chinese officials working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
“However, an investigation is necessary to determine the actual purpose of the meat,” the DFC emphasised.
“Notably, the arrested individuals neither belong to the butcher community, nor do they have a shop,” he added.
An investigation has been initiated and a letter sent to the food department.
The DFC also highlighted that even if the arrested persons’ claim is correct, slaughtering a donkey in public is not allowed. “Instead, it should be done within residential premises,” he added.
The authorities will investigate further to bring more facts to light and determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Battagram District Police Officer (DPO) Ayaz Khan told Dawn.com that a case has been registered against the accused and an investigation has been started.
 
 

The first information report (FIR) seen by Dawn.com shows that the two people have been booked under Sections 272 (Adulteration of food or drink intended for sale) and 273 (Sale of noxious food or drink) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“It is yet unclear whether or not any attempt was being made to supply the meat,” the DPO said.
Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr Musadik Malik speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’ said: “As Muslims, this act of giving someone else donkey meat to eat is impure and undesirable.”
He added that enforcement was needed to curtail such crimes.
On Sunday, in a major crackdown on illegal meat trade, the Islamabad Food Authority seized about 1,000kg of donkey meat from a farmhouse located in Tarnol.
Over 50 live donkeys were also confiscated during a raid on the premises and a foreign national was taken into custody on the spot.</p><small>2025-07-29 19:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/292309298f67cc9.jpg?r=230941' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official' target='_blank'><strong>Curfew imposed as 3-day operation against militants begins in Bajaur: official</strong></a><br><p>The Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew at 16 places of the district on Tuesday and initiated an operation against militants in the areas.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq confirmed the development to Dawn.com.
A notification in this regard issued by Bajaur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Shahid Ali Khan said there was a need to impose restrictions on all kinds of movement on the main roads and outside houses at Badi Siah, Tarkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanata and Zagai area of Tehsil Loe Mamund to prevent any untoward incidents as recommended by the Bajaur District Intelligence Coordination Committee to ensure public safety during targeted actions against militants.
The DC imposed a ban on all kinds of movement of individuals outside houses, on roads, vehicles and all forms of traffic on all roads at the above villages with effect from 5am today till 5pm on July 31 (Thursday) under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
It instructed all individuals to comply with the order and restrict all movement on the roads and outside houses, warning that anyone found violating the order would be liable for legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Awami National Party President Aimal Wali Khan alleged that innocent people were injured in the operation and called on the violence to stop.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl also said that it could not support the operation.
The decision came following the police repulsing an attack by terrorists on Thangi checkpost on Sunday night. Officials had told Dawn that terrorists attacked the joint police and FC post in Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday night around 9:42 pm. They said that police and security forces personnel at the post responded effectively to the attack.
They said that no casualties were reported in the attack. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Police on Monday started checking suspicious vehicles and people to thwart terrorist activities in the district. Several police officials took part in the exercise, searching vehicles and people on roads and exit and entry points, said a statement.
On July 10, Awami National Party politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead by unidentified suspects in the district.

In a statement issued today, Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP) Vice President Karrar Haidri said: “Former Olympic and world champion biathlete Laura Dahlmeier sustained serious injuries after being struck by a rockfall while attempting to summit Laila Peak.
“The incident occurred around noon on July 28 at an altitude of approximately 5,700m. Dahlmeier was climbing with her mountaineering partner, Marina Eva, when a sudden rockfall hit her, resulting in significant injuries.”
It said the expedition organiser immediately alerted emergency services and a coordinated rescue operation was launched with support from Pakistan Army aviation helicopters and local high-altitude porters.
It added that rescue helicopters were unable to land at the accident site on Monday due to the challenging terrain and adverse weather conditions.
“Efforts to evacuate Dahlmeier by air continued into July 29 with ground support teams on standby, awaiting a break in the weather.
“Marina Eva successfully descended to base camp and is reported to be in good health. Meanwhile, worsening weather continues to delay aerial access to the injured climber, leaving the rescue team prepared to respond as soon as conditions permit,” the statement said.
A press release posted on Dahlmeier’s Instagram account said that a helicopter overpass determined that she was at least “seriously injured” and “there were no signs of life”.
It said she was in the region with friends since the end of June and successfully climbed the Great Trango Tower (6,287m) on July 8, with Laila Peak the second planned summit goal.
It said she was a state-certified mountain and ski guide, an active member of the mountain rescue service and considered an experienced and risk-conscious mountaineer.

GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said an international mountaineering rescue team was currently overseeing the recovery operation and experienced climbers in the area were assisting in the mission.
Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Klára Kolouchová, died after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.
Kolouchová, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte­m­pting to summit the mountain.

Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Earlier in the day, media reports said that the incarcerated former prime minister told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
Responding swiftly to the reports, PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram said: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan. I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”
 






In a follow-up post, he said: “There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that Imran Khan’s children will come to Pakistan. So far, only the date for this has yet to be determined. And everyone should remember that when they decided to come, they clearly told their father that we are not seeking your permission but informing you. So, avoid these propagandas because they are of no use.”
 






Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the entire matter “one drama among many dramas”, adding that “the purpose was not the meeting of father and child but political gain. No move by the founder happens without political or financial gain.”
 






Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry previously questioned what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p><small>2025-07-29 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29193003e66b4be.png?r=193759' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927425/18-migrants-die-50-missing-after-shipwreck-in-eastern-libya' target='_blank'><strong>18 migrants die, 50 missing after shipwreck in eastern Libya</strong></a><br><p>At least 18 migrants died in a shipwreck off the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya over the weekend, and 50 are still missing, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday, citing reports.
Ten survivors have been accounted for so far, the IOM said.
Tobruk is a coastal city near the border with Egypt.
Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in a Nato-backed uprising in 2011, Libya has become a transit country for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the desert and over the Mediterranean.
“This latest tragedy is a stark reminder of the deadly risks people are forced to take in search of safety and opportunity. Libya remains a major transit point for migrants and refugees, many of whom face exploitation, abuse, and life-threatening journeys,” the IOM said.
Last month, at least 60 migrants were feared dead after a pair of shipwrecks off the coast of Libya. The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found.
Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea.
A number of Pakistani migrants were feared to be among the dead after a vessel capsized near the Marsa Dela port, northwest of Zawiya city in Libya in February. The boat was carrying around 65 passengers at the time of the accident.
The development followed a similar incident in January in which a boat carrying 80 passengers capsized near Morocco. While the identities of at least 13 Pakistanis killed in the incident were confirmed, over 40 Pakistanis were reportedly murdered by African human traffickers on the boat and only 22 survived the tragedy.</p><small>2025-07-29 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2918262817776f8.jpg?r=182641' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927414/islamabad-police-say-students-shifted-amid-outcry-over-operation-to-vacate-qau-hostels' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad police say students ‘shifted’ amid outcry over operation to vacate QAU hostels</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad Police on Tuesday said that some students were “shifted” during an operation to vacate the hostels of Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) that generated intense criticism.
Videos circulating on social media since the early hours of today showed police personnel outside the hostels with some of them about students being arrested or taken away. The videos elicited strong criticism with many decrying why action was being taken against students and saying that over 70 were arrested.
A statement from the Islamabad police confirmed the development, saying: “At the request of the university administration, [the] Islamabad police provided legal police assistance. The students had vacated 11 hostels, while regarding the remaining four hostels, the university administration stated that some students were not vacating them despite instructions from the university administration and were residing there illegally.
“Upon the written request of the Quaid-i-Azam University administration, assistance was provided to the university administration and security guards. Those students who resisted this peaceful process have been shifted from the hostel, and now legal action will be taken based on the written request of the university administration.”
 






A statement from the university said the district administration took action in the morning to vacate the hostels after the deadline expired.
“It should be noted that [the] Quaid-i-Azam University had decided to temporarily close the hostels from July 13, 2025, in view of the annual repair, maintenance and renovation work during the summer vacations. A large number of students complied with this decision and vacated the hostels, however, some students were still there who had been given repeated time by the university and the district administration to vacate the hostels,” it read.
It added that the Islamabad High Court had dismissed the students’ petition challenging the administrative action of the university as inadmissible and confirmed the autonomy of the institution under the Quaid-i-Azam University Act 1973.
“[The] Quaid-i-Azam University once again reiterates its commitment to providing a safe and conducive environment for students while maintaining discipline, academic standards, and institutional autonomy,” the statement said.
Contesting the police statement, human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir in a post on X questioned why entry was not being allowed to the Secretariat police station. “We just had a meeting with the vice chancellor [of the QAU] and he clearly stated that he did not make any such request,” she added.
 






She alleged that over 70 students were “being kept in illegal detention without any first information report (FIR)” at the Secretariat police station and the authorities were “refusing to share copy of FIR”.
 






Former senator Afrasiab Khattak termed the police crackdown “shameful”.
“Forty students are arrested because they are requesting to be allowed to stay in hostels to prepare for their exams. They must be immediately released and the issues should be resolved by negotiations. Campuses are important part of civil society,” he wrote on X.
 






Academic and activist Dr Taimur Rehman said the students were protesting to start the summer semester. “Imagine. They were arrested because they want to study,” he said.
 






Artist, environmentalist and activist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior lamented that “universities in Pakistan have turned against their own students”.
“Seventy students from Quaid-i-Azam University have been arrested in Islamabad for simply requesting that hostels be kept open over the summer. Keep our students safe! Keep campuses safe!”
 






The incident was also strongly criticised by former human rights minister Dr Shireen Mazari in a series of posts on X.
In September, as many as 25 students were injured in a clash between two groups at the university. Of the injured students, 20 were admitted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and five to Polyclinic.
The university (once named Islamabad University) was established in July 1967 under an act of the National Assembly and started teaching and research programmes for PhD and MPhil degrees. Later, it also started offering master’s, graduate and undergraduate programmes.</p><small>2025-07-29 13:41</small></div><hr>
