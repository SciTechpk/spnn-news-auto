New Delhi neither confirmed nor denied it was shifting policy towards Russia.
“It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario,” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.
“Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”
 






Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has previously defended buying oil from Russia, a historic partner of India, despite Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Trump in August raised tariffs on Indian exports to the US to 50 per cent, with Trump’s aides accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine.
“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy,” Jaiswal added. “This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions.”
India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85pc of its oil needs.
New Delhi traditionally relied on Middle East nations.
But since 2022, it shifted sharply toward discounted Russian crude, taking advantage of a buyer’s market created by Western bans on Moscow’s exports.
“Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement,” Jaiswal said.
“This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India.
Discussions are ongoing.”</p><small>2025-10-16 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1611032888a389a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949293/aurangzeb-meets-saudi-finance-minister-briefs-him-on-ongoing-privatisation-of-pia-and-key-airports' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb meets Saudi finance minister, briefs him on ongoing privatisation of PIA and key airports</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met his Saudi counterpart on the third day of his ongoing US visit, the finance ministry said on Thursday, adding that the former briefed the latter about the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, D.C., where  Aurangzeb arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip.
A foreign ministry statement issued today said Aurangzeb continued a series of high-level meetings in the US capital, including his engagement with Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan.
“He apprised his Saudi counterpart of the ongoing privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports, underscoring the government’s resolve to attract strategic investments through transparency and efficiency,” it added.
 






The development comes after a parliamentary committee was informed last month that the PIA Corporation Limited was expected to be privatised by November this year. The national flag carrier’s privatisation is a key condition under the $7bn IMF bailout package approved for Pakistan.
The planned sale of the PIA would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades, with divestment of loss-making state firms a central plank of last year’s bailout.
Regarding the said bailout package, Aurangzeb reaffirmed during his meeting with Al-Jadaan that Pakistan remained steadfast in pursuing economic reforms under the IMF programme to ensure long-term macroeconomic stability, the finance ministry statement said.
It added that the two finance ministers also reviewed the growing trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Moreover, the statement said, the two ministers agreed that institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) could play a vital role in mobilising private sector investments in Pakistan.
“Aurangzeb also sought Saudi support for infrastructure development projects, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a deeper economic partnership with the kingdom,” it said.
Other engagements
Apart from meeting his Saudi counterpart, Aurangzeb also held other meetings on the day, the finance ministry statement said, adding that the “engagements focused on reinforcing Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms, exploring new avenues for international investment, and strengthening bilateral financial cooperation”.
In a key meeting with US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black, he “highlighted significant investment opportunities within Pakistan’s oil and gas, mines and minerals, agriculture, IT and pharmaceutical sectors”.
The finance minister also underscored the consensus at the leadership level to enhance trade and investment ties, welcoming the DFC’s interest in facilitating private sector-led funding for projects in Pakistan, the finance ministry statement said.
Separately, he also met Azerbaijan’s first deputy finance minister, Anar Karimov, reaffirming strong economic and strategic ties between the two countries, the statement added.
In the meeting, “he congratulated Azerbaijan on successfully hosting COP29 and highlighted the Pakistan-Azerbaijan Preferential Trade Agreement (January 2025) and Transit Trade Agreement (December 2024) as key platforms to diversify bilateral trade beyond oil and rice into textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and agricultural products”.
During his meeting with Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Executive Vice President Hiroshi Matano, Aurangzeb expressed “appreciation for MIGA’s support in ongoing arbitration matters and reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding both investor confidence and national interests”.
According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb welcomed MIGA’s proposal for a short-term trade finance facility to ensure access to “critical imports” such as food, fertiliser, energy and essential machinery, and emphasised the importance of its timely implementation.
He also acknowledged MIGA’s continued support for Pakistan’s power transmission and distribution sectors, the statement added.
The finance minister also attended the Borrowers’ Forum Roundtable, where he discussed the “crucial balance between servicing high debt obligations and financing essential social sector investments”, the statement said.
At the meeting, he commended the establishment of the forum as a “valuable platform for collective action, knowledge sharing, and policy coordination among debtor nations”. The statement further said that he also stressed the importance of improved debt management, enhanced technical capacity and better access to sustainable finance for climate resilience and infrastructure development.
The minister also met with members of the Pakistan Bank Fund Staff Association (PBFSA), the statement said, adding that he briefed them on recent fiscal, monetary and external sector progress and referenced the country’s upgraded sovereign credit ratings.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, energy reforms, privatisation, social protection, and inclusive green growth while responding to participant queries.”
Later, the statement detailed, Aurangzeb held a “productive meeting” with the senior management of Standard Chartered Bank, acknowledging the long-standing partnership between the Bank and Pakistan.
“During the discussions, the minister highlighted the external validation of the country’s ongoing economic reforms by international rating agencies. He briefed the team on Pakistan’s recent Panda Bond issuance and plans to tap international capital markets through Eurobonds and International Sukuk.
“The meeting also covered trade financing facilities, with the minister requesting the bank to share additional proposals for consideration to further strengthen collaboration.”
Earlier in the day, the statement said, the finance minister attended a session of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (CFMCA), held discussions with British economist Stefan Dercon and participated in a media interaction with the Wall Street Journal.
He also addressed global investors at the Citi Macro Forum, where he, alongside the finance secretary and State Bank of Pakistan governor  presented a “comprehensive overview of the positive developments on Pakistan’s fiscal, monetary, and external fronts”.
He attributed the current economic momentum to effective stabilisation measures, structural reforms and prudent monetary management, noting the successful negotiation of a staff-level agreement with the IMF, the statemnent said.
It added that Aurangzeb subsequently joined finance ministers and central bank governors from the MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) region in a meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
As a lead speaker, he underscored “Pakistan’s achievement of macroeconomic stabilisation and welcomed the staff-level agreement with the IMF. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to advancing reforms in taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, and privatisation”.
Moreover, he highlighted Pakistan’s “digital transformation and tariff policy aimed at enhancing competitiveness and exports”, while inviting international investment in key sectors including mining, digital infrastructure, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, the finance ministry statement said.</p><small>2025-10-16 06:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16112726ab4608a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949295/punjab-govt-appoints-special-prosecutors-for-cases-registered-against-tlp-in-lahore-sheikhupura' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt appoints special prosecutors for cases registered against TLP in Lahore, Sheikhupura</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has appointed special public prosecutors to represent the state in terrorism cases registered against the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in the districts of Lahore and Sheikhupura, it emerged on Thursday.
The development comes after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religio-political party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and a series of arrests.
As per the official figures, as many as 2,716 people have been arrested after the Muridke operation. Out of these, some 251 were taken into custody by Lahore police and 178 by Sheikhpura police. The government has also barred around 2,800 people from travelling abroad, according to Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
According to an order issued by the Punjab government’s public prosecution department yesterday, seen by Dawn.com, Advocate Supreme Court Rana Shakeel Ahmed Khan and Advocate High Court Chaudhry Khalid Rasheed have been appointed as special prosecutors for all cases registered against the TLP “within the jurisdiction of Lahore and Sheikhupura districts/region”.
The appointments — notified following a letter by the Lahore deputy inspector general (DIG) legal for Punjab police chief Dr Usman Awan — were made under Section 18 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), which allows the government to appoint public prosecutors or law officers to Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs), a high court or the Supreme Court.
The special public prosecutors will coordinate with investigation officers, joint investigation teams for “efficient investigation, proper preparation of case files and represent the state before trial courts in all matters including remands, bails and trials etc; and Honorable Lahore High Court, Lahore (Principle Seat) in all matters, including bails, appeals, revisions, petitions for suspension of sentence, writs and other miscellaneous applications”.
Terms and conditions will be issued separately, the order stated.
Even as police intensify their crackdown on the group following the events that transpired in Muridke, the authorities have decided to take a series of measures to “neutralise” the threat the TLP has posed to the law enforcers and non-Muslim communities since its inception.
The decision to put the radical outfit on a leash is being linked to some crucial meetings, where the TLP’s tainted record of violent agitations, fatal attacks on the law enforcers, as well as ransacking of Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship came under discussion.
 
 

Meanwhile, the number of cases registered against the outfit has reached 72, with at least 39 registered in Lahore, amid arrests of second- and third-tier leaders of the TLP.
As the whereabouts of TLP chief Saad Rizvi remain unknown, Lahore DIG Faisal Kamran said Rizvi had escaped during the police operation. He added that the police have managed to trace his location and he would be arrested soon.
It may be noted that a money laundering probe has also been initiated against Rizvi after law enforcers recovered huge sums of money during a raid at his residence in Lahore. The total currency allegedly recovered from the residence amounted to Rs110 million, including 50,000 Indian rupees.
Chaudhry, the minister of state for interior, has said action against the TLP protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of those involved in the May 9, 2023 riots, which led to a country-wide crackdown on the PTI.</p><small>2025-10-16 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16111434004c11e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949291/15-of-a-family-dead-8-injured-as-truck-overturns-in-swat-rescue-service' target='_blank'><strong>15 of a family dead, 8 injured as truck overturns in Swat: rescue service</strong></a><br><p>At least 15 people were killed — all from the same family — when a Punjab-bound truck overturned in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district early morning on Thursday, according to a Rescue 1122 official.
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Malakand Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Shafiqa Gul said in a statement, “At least 15 members of the same family were killed and eight others sustained injuries when a truck overturned near tunnel No. 3 of the Swat Motorway on Thursday morning.”
The dead and injured include men, women and children, she said.
“The family was from the Gabral area of the Bahrain tehsil and were travelling to Punjab when the tragic incident occurred,” the statement said.
Rescue teams rushed to the site of the incident and carried out relief operations along with Motorway police, as per the spokesperson. She further said that the injured had been taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, Batkhela.
“Doctors at the hospital confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives,” she said, adding that four of the injured were in critical condition and have been referred to Swat.
Last month, at least 11 people were killed, and another three were injured after a truck crashed in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan due to brake failure. On September 11, two women were killed, while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Mansehra. Two days before that, five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur.</p><small>2025-10-16 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1512085787bc5eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948626/the-assassination-of-liaquat-ali-khan-a-death-foretold' target='_blank'><strong>The assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan — a death foretold</strong></a><br><p>I sometimes wonder if there have been any bleaker periods in our country’s history than the current times. But then I read or listen to some of our history, and realise that the quagmire we rest on is simply a build-up of years of lies, deceit and dastardly actions of a coterie of self-interests that have existed since independence. On this day, the 74th death anniversary of Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, the nation needs to rethink, reassess and reflect.
The facts surrounding my grandfather’s assassination have become clearer to me over the past few years. There remain some stalwart supporters of the first prime minister, who have undertaken extensive research, including from the period right after his assassination, and have come to their conclusions regarding where the blame falls.
 
 

Unfortunately, for this nation, the investigation and documentation of facts surrounding the conspiracy that was given to Nawabzada Aitzazuddin, the then Inspector General of Special Police, never saw the light of day. Aitzazuddin was travelling to Peshawar to meet PM Nazimuddin and update him on the results of the investigation when the military plane he embarked on mysteriously crashed. The documents aboard were apparently ‘destroyed’ too.
Such mysteries make it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction, blurring the lines between truth and lies, and effectively keeping them away from the heart of the matter.
Unresolved mysteries
A few years ago, BBC News Urdu ran a brief yet empathetic audio story on the assassination, informed by high-quality research and thoughtful insights. It revealed questions raised by Begum Ra’ana Liaquat Ali Khan on her husband’s first death anniversary, all of which remain unanswered to date.
 


She recalled that her husband was about to deliver an important policy announcement the day he was murdered, a speech that was not made public posthumously. Why, the Begum questioned.
She had more inquiries; why was her husband’s murderer killed on the spot, even when he had already been pinned down by people? And why was Mohammad Shah Gul, the sub-inspector who took down the murderer, given a promotion instead of a rebuke? Who actually were the high-level conspirators wanting Liaquat out of the way, and why?
And, finally, why were all of her questions still up in the air?
I am aware of the people whom my grandmother was convinced had a hand in her husband’s murder. None is alive today, and, from what I have heard, death didn’t come to them easily, each paying a price in their own way for their involvement in the conspiracy.
I am a firm believer in karma — our individual and collective actions result in reactions of equal weight across the spectrum of our own lives and of those closest to us. Notwithstanding those from within the government who participated, there is also sufficient circumstantial evidence to suggest that certain foreign interests were also at play.
The man who believed
I recently finished listening to a series of podcasts wherein US-based author Farooq Babrakzai — the younger son of Said Akbar, who assassinated Liaquat Ali Khan — was interviewed by journalist Haider Mehdi. Their interaction was based on Babrakzai’s recently published book ‘The Assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan – A critical look at the early history of Pakistan’.
 


Apparently, while no Pakistani publisher was willing to publish the book, a publishing house in India consented. There is talk that there will be a book launch in Pakistan soon.
The interview is quite revealing, not only in the kinds of narratives being created and curated during the early period of our history, but also in how certain events are construed by the author. At some level, I do appreciate the thought and research put into the writing, solely on the basis of the podcast, because I have yet to read the book.
But it also leaves me deeply unsettled and pained over how people have a chance to better understand my grandfather’s killer, but not him. The ruling elite of the past 70 years has made it a mission to ensure that the public remains unaware of the level and depth of the sacrifices the Quaid-e-Millat made for his country and his people, both during his life and upon his death.
Thoughts of that fateful day keep passing through my mind. The podcast plays back the one minute of the live Radio Pakistan recording of Liaquat Ali Khan’s opening words — Baradran-e-Millat — and then two shots ring out in close succession. Chaos ensues.
 
 

I keep thinking of how a murderer brought his 11-year-old son to such an occasion. The only logical explanation is that he must have been sure of an escape. There are other thoughts, too: were the two shots fired from the same gun? Not so close together. Not likely.
Did my grandfather know he was going to his death? He had been warned of a conspiracy attempt against his life. Why choose to go to Rawalpindi, the hotbed of an earlier conspiracy? Why not just stay safe in Karachi? Who can say — hindsight after all is 20/20. But in my heart, I know. He was unafraid because he truly believed in unity, faith and discipline.</p><small>2025-10-16 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16094008796e69c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949287/trump-authorises-cia-operations-in-venezuela-raising-pressure-on-maduro' target='_blank'><strong>Trump authorises CIA operations in Venezuela, raising pressure on Maduro</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump confirmed on Wednesday that he authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolas Maduro’s government.
The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision, saying the Trump administration’s Venezuela strategy aims to remove Maduro from power.
The administration has offered $50 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest and conviction on drug trafficking charges.
The new authority would allow the CIA to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean, the Times reported.
Asked why he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela, Trump told reporters his reasons were migration of Venezuelans to the United States and drug trafficking.
 






“I authorised for two reasons really,” Trump said.
“Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America…they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.
“And the other thing are drugs,” Trump said.
Trump has not provided evidence for his claim that Venezuela is sending former prisoners to the US.
He added that the US has made progress intercepting drug shipments at sea, and that additional efforts are now focused on overland routes.
“We are looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” Trump said.
 
 

Reuters could not independently determine what specific actions Trump has authorised and the White House declined to elaborate on the president’s comments.
Historically, the agency’s involvement in such operations has varied widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint.
The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, particularly during the Cold War, and helped topple South America’s cocaine trafficking empires at the end of the 20th century.
Reuters has reported that the CIA has been running covert operations in Mexico for years to track down the country’s most-wanted drug traffickers.
Venezuela’s government said Trump’s remarks constituted a violation of international law and said US actions were aimed at legitimising a “regime change” operation with the goal of seizing the country’s oil resources.
“Our Permanent Mission to the UN will raise this complaint with the Security Council and the secretary general tomorrow, demanding accountability from the United States government,” Venezuela said in a statement released by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on his Telegram account.
‘Venezuela feeling heat’
Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of being a hub for trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl, but US records have shown that Mexico is the main source of fentanyl.
Trump was asked by a reporter why he did not have the Coast Guard stop suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been US practice for decades.
Trump called such efforts “politically correct” and said they had not worked.
 
 

Trump declined to answer when asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, saying: “I think Venezuela is feeling heat.”
Trump has ordered a large US military buildup in the southern Caribbean, and the troops have conducted at least five strikes on vessels the Trump administration has described as involved in drug trafficking, without providing evidence.
The campaign is the most recent example of Trump’s efforts to use US military power in new, and often legally contentious, ways, from deploying active-duty US troops in Los Angeles to carrying out counterterrorism strikes against drug trafficking suspects.
The Pentagon recently disclosed to Congress that Trump has determined the United States is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels.
‘Venezuela also released prisoners into US’
Trump also accused Venezuela of releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, although he did not specify which border they were crossing.
Neither Maduro’s Information Ministry nor press representatives for opposition leader Maria Corina Machado immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s remarks.
The Trump administration has provided scant information about the strikes, frustrating members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans.
On Wednesday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration moved the US closer to outright conflict.
“The American people deserve to know if the Administration is leading the US into another conflict, putting service members at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation,” she said in a statement.</p><small>2025-10-16 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f04d921a50b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949239/withering-geoeconomics' target='_blank'><strong>Withering geoeconomics</strong></a><br><p>IT was almost exactly three years ago that a paper was published by Moeed Yusuf and his co-author Rabia Akhtar arguing in favour of a pivot away from geopolitics towards geoeconomics as Pakistan’s primary external orientation. That paper had built upon the National Security Policy (NSP) of 2021 which had expanded the meaning of the word ‘security’ to include human dignity and prosperity as well. Lasting security, the NSP had argued, cannot be built with guns alone, but must also secure people’s rights to live in dignity and pursue their own prosperity.
Recent developments provide a good opportunity to revisit the arguments made in that paper. Subsequent developments have vindicated substantial portions of what the writers were saying but at the same time, things seem to have moved in the opposite direction to the one they urged policymakers to take.
 
 

The paper argued that a sound economic footing built on domestic reform is the key to securing Pakistan’s future. It argued that for a pivot to geoeconomics that was “a significant departure in how Pakistan perceives its own utility for the world”. They observed that Pakistan had traditionally seen itself as a “net security provider to the West, a strategic neighbour for China, and a partner to key Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia as a means of soliciting foreign economic support”. But this model was “structurally flawed”, they argued. And rightly so.
Sadly the advice seems to have generated little more than chatter and ample nodding of heads, with little to no impact on policy. Some of this is due to the powerful hold that geopolitics has on the minds of the establishment, and in equal measure, it is owed to the fact that the world evolved in ways different from what the authors foresaw.

All signs are now pointing in the direction of yet another incoming geopolitical rent.

The authors were right in seeing neoliberalism coming under increasing strain and countries around the world retreating into “economic nationalism”. They were right when they said this tendency would drive a greater role for ‘geoeconomics’ in the future, as more and more countries subordinated their economic policy to the requirements of a changing global order. They were right in pointing out that Pakistan would be at a disadvantage in this world due to its economic weakness, and must deploy a form of geoeconomics that is a “win-win” for its partners rather than a zero-sum game.
But this was the easy part. They were writing after the tariff wars of the first Trump presidency after all, and the dying throes of the liberal world order were all around us. Much of the hysteria around China’s Belt and Road Initiative had peaked, but was still around, and it was possible to see how the world was going to be carved up into competing economic blocs. The conventional wisdom at that time (to which I also subscribed in those days) was that a day was coming when Pakistan would be forced to choose between America and China, that the days of foreign bailouts were ending, Pakistan’s addiction to geopolitical rents would have to be broken.
In pointing the way forward, the authors laid the emphasis on “connectivity”, particularly in energy, as well as “development partnerships” that sought investments rather than aid. And here things began to fall apart.
A few things have happened since then to render outdated this vision of ‘connectivity’. First is the depth of the transformation sweeping the world of energy, as the solar-plus-battery revolution renders the world of gas pipelines, cross-border power transmission lines, foreign investment in refineries and giant power plants obsolete. Connectivity for the authors hinged on energy above all else, but with the energy sector itself in such profound flux, the vision was stillborn.
Second, the connectivity rested on good relations with Afghanistan, normalisation of ties with India, and a lifting of Iran’s sanctions. Each of these now seems like a remote possibility, so even if there was to be a cross-border demand for energy transmission — whether via the Iran gas pipeline or the CASA electricity transmission line — the regional situation seems to be closing these possibilities off more than opening them up.
Development partnerships resting on investments have taken a mortal hit from the most recent episode of near bankruptcy that Pakistan is still trying to emerge from. The message from the past few years that has gone to all foreign investors around the world is that Pakistan is not able to afford any investment because the economy here tends to run out of foreign exchange. The only condition under which investors might come into Pakistan now would be if they were riding the coat-tails of geopolitics.
Most importantly, all signs are now pointing in the direction of yet another incoming geopolitical rent. The specifics are unknown, but Pakistan’s rulers seem to be busy securing for themselves one more round of security-related inflows of exactly the sort that the authors of that paper said Pakistan needs to depart from.
 
 

The stars are aligning for Pakistan in almost startling ways, even if the ground beneath our feet feels a bit shaky. In other places, Moeed Yusuf had warned that Pakistan sits nestled between two regions that have a rising arc of conflict — East Asia and the Middle East — and that these conflicts will find their way to Pakistan. But it turns out Pakistan is instead sitting in the sweet spot, where the conflicts of these regions won’t bother us, but our utility to the big powers in each of these regions will increase.
Today all three — the US, China and Saudi Arabia — are smiling on Pakistan. Yet one more round of geopolitical rents seems to be gathering on the horizon (though it is still not clinched). And old ways of thinking consider themselves vindicated while those of us who have always argued for the merits of learning to stand on our own feet, must perhaps wait another decade for our moment.

Published in Dawn, October 16th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-16 04:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949236/navigating-fragility' target='_blank'><strong>Navigating fragility</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN remains caught between cautious economic optimism and persistent challenges. This is the central message of the IMF’s latest assessment of the country’s outlook for the current fiscal year and its medium-term growth trajectory.
The Fund’s new World Economic Outlook report projects Pakistan’s GDP to grow by a modest 3.6pc, with average headline inflation rising slightly to 6pc from 4.5pc last year, and the current account balance shifting from a 0.5pc surplus to a manageable 0.4pc deficit — twice the finance ministry’s estimate of 0.2pc of GDP.
These projections, issued days after the IMF completed its two-week review of the economy this month, appear fairly optimistic, given that they do not account for the economic impact of the recent devastating floods. A revision of the Fund’s outlook, therefore, cannot be ruled out once flood loss estimates are finalised. The government has already scaled down its own growth target for the year from 4.2pc to 3.5pc, while the World Bank expects growth to slow to around 2.6pc in view of the flood damage.
Should we be worried about ‘worsening’ economic fundamentals? Fortunately, even the new projections do not suggest a reversal of our hard-won economic stability, at least for now. What they highlight, however, is that recovery remains fragile, constrained by the economy’s limited capacity to absorb internal and external shocks, and that Pakistan is unlikely to break out of its low-growth trap in the near to medium term without risking more economic distress.
 
 

Meanwhile, the 33pc year-on-year surge in trade deficit to $9.4bn during the first quarter of the current fiscal, from $7bn a year ago, is a troubling sign for economic stability, especially when the flood impact is yet to show up in the balance of trade. To some analysts, this sharp widening of the trade gap, driven by a spike in imports and a decline in exports, signals potential economic overheating, raising concerns about the sustainability of the current growth pattern.
If the trend holds, we could end up with an annual trade deficit exceeding $36bn — nearly $10bn higher than last year’s — putting renewed pressures on the recently accumulated foreign exchange reserves. Previously, high trade deficits have repeatedly undermined economic stability, stifled growth, fuelled inflation and constrained investment by triggering balance-of-payments crises every few years. That is what Pakistan has experienced in recent years.
The economy will remain vulnerable to internal and external shocks, including extreme weather events, until it creates conditions conducive to attracting investment in productive sectors to expand and diversify exports. The stakes could not have been higher for a country desperately seeking sustainable, inclusive economic growth in the face of low productivity, stagnant private investment, a high trade deficit and elevated debt. The floods may not have caused these challenges, but they will exacerbate them.

This figure undercounts women’s work, particularly the work they do in the informal sector or from home — areas where the majority of working women in Pakistan remain concentrated. But working from home does not carry the same empowering potential that working outside the home does. Similarly, the informal sector typically houses precarious, even hazardous work. So, why don’t more women switch to less vulnerable occupations that also carry a greater potential to raise their status? What are the factors that influence whether or not to participate in the labour market, where to work and how many hours to spend at work?
Financial need remains the primary reason why most of us work. The pressure to provide in economic terms is much higher for men than for women, particularly in societies such as ours that have a strong male breadwinner bias. This means that for many, and more so for men rather than women, the option to not work, simply does not exist.
Yet, working and earning an income is aspirational too. It is the means through which we raise our standard of living and look to achieving loftier goals, especially for our children. Certainly, access to and control over monetary resources has been linked with overall well-being, especially for marginalised groups. Talk to working women, and they will inevitably highlight the fact that having their own stream of income reduces their dependency on others while raising their status within the household. Here, it is the nature of the work that they do that really matters.
 
 

Indeed, not all work is equal. Work outside the home, and that which brings in a steady stream of income, is generally considered more empowering than precarious work. Similarly, jobs that have benefits associated with them, such as pensions, health benefits and paid leave and that are regularised, such as those found in the formal sector, are considered to make the biggest difference on decision-making power. However, even within the formal sector, men and women do not always find themselves vying for the same set of jobs.
When it comes to the type of work that a person does, there are several interconnected factors at play. Greater financial pressures see men being pushed towards occupations where there are larger chances of quick advancement and high pay. For women, the decision of whether and where to work, and which sector to occupy, must balance financial independence with other factors. Particularly when reproductive work falls in women’s spheres, time that must be spent to fulfil domestic responsibilities becomes a primary factor driving the decisions surrounding work.

Men and women do not always find themselves vying for the same set of jobs.

Indeed, social expectations around reproductive roles, and the subsequent higher domestic burdens that women face, often translate into more frequent career breaks, if not an exit from or a failure to enter the labour market altogether. This means that women often pick sectors and roles that allow for greater flexibility and do not penalise discontinuity in career timelines. Yet, ease of breaks comes at other costs. Usually for those with low educational achievement, this means informal sector employment or home-based work. Amongst those who are in the formal sector, jobs that see a greater ease of exit and entry often mean lower wages or sacrificing how far up the occupational ladder women are able to climb.
On the flip side, men typically face strict expectations around their productive roles. Taking breaks in their career, not financially providing for their families, or allowing standards of living to slide, are just not feasible options for them.
Hence, one of the biggest factors underpinning the decisions surrounding work is social norms. Not only do these norms determine the gendering of productive versus reproductive spheres, they also result in pressure to perform certain types of jobs. The subsequent siloing of men and women across sectors is further cemented through a stigmatisation of individuals who go against the established grain. We see this most frequently as an acceptance of women going into sectors that are extensions of their caregiving roles, such as teaching and nursing, and hostility towards women who enter male-dominated spaces. The same holds for men as well — take a survey of early years and primary schools, and while there will be men in administrative roles, there will be very few, if any, in teaching roles.
So, how do we break the norms around work? Ironically, through the labour market. There is a documented lagged effect between women entering the labour market and a softening of gender norms. Hence, as more women take up jobs and participate more actively in the public arena, stereotypes around men as primary or even sole earners within the household, and women as the main caregivers, are shown to change in the medium to long term, ultimately leading to an easing of gender segmentation across and within sectors.
 
 

This, of course, begs the question: how do we raise women’s entry into the labour market? There has been much experimentation with different types of interventions such as introducing role models or reducing care burdens through daycares.
However, it is financial motivations that tend to be most effective. Whether the push comes through macro-fiscal crises or cash transfers conditional on employment and microenterprise support, such as that done in Latin America, greater women’s labour force participation leads to norm shifts. And this is precisely what is needed to change the decisions around work for the better.

“Pakistani airspace will remain closed to Indian registered aircraft,” the NOTAM said.
Neither aircraft owned or leased by Indian airlines nor Indian military flights are allowed to use Pakistan’s airspace, the authorities said. The ban on the use of airspace will be in effect from Oct 15 to Nov 24.
 
 

The restriction was imposed due to ongoing tensions between the two nations. Pakistan initially shut its airspace on India in April this year and it has maintained the closure ever since.
Earlier on Tuesday, amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afgha­nistan, Pakistani authorities issued a Notam to restrict multiple air routes over its territory, for “operational reasons.”
Several routes were limited on Oct 15 and 16 between 7:30pm and 9:30pm each day. However, the restriction notice was withdrawn by Wednesday afternoon.

The move aims to protect consumers from serious health risks and ensure fair competition in the cosmetics market.  
The CCP’s Office of Fair Trade and Market Intel­li­gence Unit found that several popular whitening pro­ducts available in sto­res and online contain da­­ng­erously high levels of mercury. Many of these products falsely claim to be safe and effective while concealing mercury content from their ingredient lists.
Mercury is a toxic substance that can cause kidney damage, neurological disorders, and skin disea­ses. Its use in cosmetics is banned in most countries.
Despite this, many whitening creams in Pakistan continue to use mercury under misleading labels such as “fairness, glow, and lightening”.  
Under Section 10 of the Competition Act 2010, fal­se or deceptive marketing is prohibited and can res­u­­lt in penalties of up to Rs75 million or 10 per cent of a company’s annual turnover.
The commission has initiated action against all companies responsible for producing or promoting these harmful products. It warned that such practices not only endanger public health but also distort fair market competition.  
Consumers have been advised to stop using any whitening creams suspec­ted of containing high levels of mercury. 
The CCP also urged citizens to rep­ort deceptive advertising or unsafe cosmetic pro­du­cts through its Online Co­­mplaint Portal available on the commission’s website.

According to well-placed sources in the IHC, the judge has obtained a five-year visa on his official passport following the cancellation of his Green Card.
 
 

The decision came in the wake of recently introduced amendments to the Presidential Order and a General Standing Order which make it mandatory for judges to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from chief justices of their respective courts before leaving the country, even during holidays or vacations.
The new standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued under the policy state that the entire time of a judge, including leave, vacations and holidays, is at the disposal of the state. The chief justice has been empowered to regulate such leave and may cancel it even after a judge has departed abroad. Judges are also required to provide their contact details and addresses during any period of leave.

New rules require judges to get NOC from CJs before leaving country even during holidays

Sources said that these regulations have created complications for judges holding foreign permanent residencies, particularly US green cards.
Under American immigration laws, green-card holders must demonstrate intent to permanently reside in the United States, and prolonged absences — especially those exceeding six months — can lead to inquiries and potential revocation of residency rights.
In cases where a green card holder remains abroad for more than a year, they may lose their status unless a special Returning Resident Visa is obtained.
Judicial insiders told Dawn that the new policy effectively made it difficult for judges to retain foreign residencies while fulfilling their constitutional and administrative obligations in Pakistan. They said that the judge’s decision to rescind his green card was made to avoid any conflict with the newly imposed travel restrictions and to ensure full compliance with the court’s administrative framework.
The development has also dispelled speculation that some judges were considering resigning amid reports of internal differences and administrative grouping within the Islamabad High Court.
Instead, the move is being interpreted as an effort to align with the institutional policy and maintain transparency regarding foreign travel.
Earlier, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had raised objections to the NOC requirement in a letter addressed to the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court, terming it “a blatant impingement of the Fundamental Right of movement of a judge” and “tantamount to a de facto placement of judges on the Exit Control List”.
His letter argued that such adm­inistrative controls undermined the independence of the judiciary.
The IHC administration, however, maintains that the policy aims to bring uniformity, discipline and transparency in judicial conduct, in line with constitutional principles and public service standards.

The action was undertaken in Mohmand district, officials said, thwarting an attempt by dozens of militants to enter Pakistan, PTV News reported.
 






The operation was carried out on the basis of credible intelligence rep­orts, indicating that a large group of militants was mobilising near the mountainous Khor area of Baha­dar Kalay, officials said.
“Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area and launched an intensive operation,” sources said.
State media claimed that at least 30 terrorists had been eliminated, but local sources said the number may be higher.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press, but PTV News claimed the incident demonstrated how the Afghan government was now relying on militant groups to try and exact revenge after their attempts to attack Pakistani territory were effectively foiled.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time and would last for 48 hours.
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
The announcement from Islamabad came before the Taliban’s version appeared on social media. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a post on X that “at the request and insistence of the Pakistani side”, the ceasefire would begin after 5:30pm Kabul time and remain in force “unless there is a violation”.
The statements differed on key points, with each side claiming the ceasefire was requested by the other. Pakistan specified a 48-hour duration, while the Taliban described an open-ended truce. Only Pakistan mentioned a follow-up dialogue process.
A senior Pakistani military official, speaking on background, said the Taliban requested the ceasefire after facing what he described as a “powerful response” from Pakistani forces.
Although neither side disclosed whe­ther external mediation played a role, diplomatic sources suggested Qatar helped facilitate the understanding.
 
 

Soon after the announcement, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace. Mr Dar thanked Qatar for its “consistent support and positive role”, the statement added.
 






This was the second ceasefire between the two neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. Diplomatic insiders said that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
‘Ceasefire may not hold’
The ceasefire, while a pause in hostilities, highlights the diminishing leverage Pakistan wields over Kabul despite its historical role as the Taliban’s principal external supporter.
Observers warn that the ceasefire may prove temporary without a framework for structured dialogue or a third-party monitoring mechanism in place.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also expressed a lack of confidence in the ceasefire, stressing that the Afghan Taliban had become a “proxy of Delhi”, Dawn.com reported.
Speaking to Geo News on Wednesday night, the defence minister said that the Afghan Taliban are “fighting a proxy war” on behalf of India and stated that they have become a “stooge” for New Delhi.
 
 

“I have my doubts that the ceasefire will hold, because the [Afghan] Taliban are being sponsored by Delhi,” he added. “Right now, Kabul is fighting a proxy war for Delhi.”
Mr Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness and capability to defend itself in the face of further aggression from Kabul.
“We have the capability and we will attack them, God willing, if they escalate or widen the radius of this war,” he said. “There have been deep strikes in Afghanistan and a ceasefire was agreed on after the intervention of friendly countries, but it is fragile. I don’t believe this will last long.”
However, Mr Asif added that in this situation, Pakistan will respond positively to any constructive dialogue but will not tolerate ceasefire violations or attacks on its territory.
“If they bombard our border areas or attack our posts, then we have to respond in kind,” he said. “We do not want to fight, but if we are attacked, we have the right to respond.”
To a question about whether the mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia could come into play here, the minister said friendly countries will “effectively intervene” but noted that it is speculation at present.
Latest escalation
The latest escalation began late on Tuesday and continued into early Wednesday, when Taliban fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on Pakistani border positions in the Chaman sector of Balochistan.
According to officials, the fighting erupted around 2am after Taliban forces opened heavy fire on a Pakistani post in the Sui Karez area of the Kozak Pass using mortars and other heavy weapons.
Pakistani troops stationed in the area retaliated immediately, and intense exc­hanges continued for several hours. The clashes expanded when Taliban forces opened fire across multiple points along the border, including the border town of Chaman, damaging the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Friendship Gate on their side.
Officials said Taliban fighters also targeted nearby villages, injuring many civilians, including women and children.
“At least five civilians were brought to the district hospital with bullet and splinter injuries,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, medical superintendent of the Chaman government hospital.
Authorities declared an emergency in all Chaman hospitals and closed schools, while the anti-polio campaign in the area was suspended as residents began fleeing to safer areas.
“The attack started in the early hours and heavy fighting continued until around 8am,” said Habib Ullah Bangulzai, deputy commissioner of Chaman. He confirmed that additional troops had been deployed to the sector to reinforce the defences.
Pakistan’s military said its troops repulsed the Taliban attacks and launched retaliatory strikes targeting militant camps and installations in Kandahar and Spin Boldak, from where the attacks had been mounted.
“Pakistani jets targeted these important camps being used by Fitna al-Khawarij,” an official said, using a term referring to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Afghanistan-based terrorist group Islam­a­b­ad blames for recent cross-border attacks.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) later said that at least 20 Taliban fighters were killed and several of their installations destroyed.
Sources in Kandahar said the Taliban confirmed eight deaths in Spin Boldak, including a couple in Vesh Mandi, the first Afghan town across the border. A large number of Taliban fighters were reported wounded in Pakistani strikes.
By morning, heavy exchanges of fire were also reported from multiple points along the Kurram border region, with ISPR saying 25 to 30 Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij militants were killed in the Pakistani response that destroyed several posts and tanks.
Kabul explosions
Shortly before the ceasefire announcement, two explosions rocked Kabul’s Taimani neighbourhood around 4pm local time. The Taliban said the blasts were caused by an oil tanker fire, but residents reported two separate explosions roughly 20 minutes apart. Videos circulating on social media showed a multi-story building engulfed in flames.
Kabul Surgical Centre said it had received 40 casualties, including five fatalities.
 
 

While Pakistan’s military did not officially claim responsibility, state-run PTV reported that “precision strikes” had targeted the leadership of Fitna al-Khawarij.
Tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban regime have soared since Oct 9, when Kabul accused Islamabad of conducting airstrikes inside Afghanistan — an allegation Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied.
The Taliban launched coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11, in which 23 soldiers were martyred. Pakistan claimed its retaliatory operations killed about 200 Taliban fighters.
As both sides enter the temporary tru­ce, questions remain over the next steps. A Pakistani diplomat, speaking anonymously, said the focus will now be on “disengagement details and getting assurances about dismantling cross-border terrorist sanctuaries — the central issue behind this unprecedented escalation”.
The crisis underscores a sharp deterioration in Pakistan-Taliban relations that once appeared anchored in mutual dependence. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
For Pakistan’s military, the recent border clashes are not merely a border management issue but a reflection of Afgh­anistan’s unwillingness to curb cross-border militancy. For the Taliban, Pakistani airstrikes are seen as violations of sovereignty, reinforcing its domestic narrative of resistance to external interference.

Ashley Tellis, 64, who has worked in or advised the US government for more than two decades, was found to have kept more than 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, a criminal affidavit said on Tuesday. 
Late in the evening of Sept 25, Tellis entered the State Dept, where he served as an unpaid adviser, and appeared to print from a secret document on US Air Force techniques, the affidavit added. 
It said Tellis met multiple times with Chinese officials at a restaurant in Fairfax, Virginia. 
At one dinner, Tellis entered with a manila envelope but did not appear to leave with it, and on two occasions the Chinese officials presented him a gift bag, the affidavit said. 
Tellis faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on the charges of unlawfully holding documents, the Justice Department said. 
Lawyers for Tellis did not immediately respond to a request for comment “The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for Virginia’s eastern district who has become known for pursuing charges against critics of President Donald Trump. 
The State Department confirmed that Tellis was arrested Saturday but declined further comment due to the ongoing investigation. 
Tellis, a naturalised US citizen originally from India, is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and served in senior positions under former president George W. Bush.

According to a notification issued by the Finance Division, the petrol price now stands at Rs263.02 per litre from Rs268.68 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has dropped to Rs275.41 per litre from Rs276.81 per litre.
Meanwhile, superior kerosene oil (SKO) and light diesel oil (LDO) also experienced rate cuts, with SKO dropping in price from Rs184.97 per litre to Rs181.71 — a drop of Rs3.26. LDO price dropped by Rs2.74 from Rs165.50 per litre to Rs162.76.
The notification added that the new rates were decided on the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
 






Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs79.50 per liter on diesel and Rs80.52 per liter on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per liter climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs17-18 per liter custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per liter distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.</p><small>2025-10-15 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1521464066e74ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949126/greta-thunberg-beaten-threatened-with-being-gassed-in-israeli-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Greta Thunberg beaten, threatened with ‘being gassed’ in Israeli custody</strong></a><br><p>Swedish activist Greta Thunberg revealed that she was beaten, humiliated and threatened with being “gassed in a cage” during her time in Israeli custody, Swedish news outlet Aftonbladet reported in an interview published on Wednesday.
Greta was one of 450 people aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla, a humanitarian aid mission involving over 40 vessels which aimed to deliver food, water and medicine to the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s two-year onslaught on the besieged enclave.
The boats were intercepted by the Israeli navy on October 1, with Greta and all other activists being arrested and kept in Israeli custody. She was released and deported to Greece on October 6.
In her interview, Greta recounted her treatment in Israeli custody, which ranged from humiliation, threats of violence and physical beatings.
“She doesn’t want headlines about herself and the torture she says she was subjected to,” Aftonbladet reported.
“That was one of the first things she said on the evening she returned home, at a press conference in Sergels Torg together with several of the other Swedes who participated in the large Global Sumud Flotilla that attempted to bring emergency aid to Gaza.”
Quoting Greta, the report read, “This is not about me or the others from the flotilla. There are thousands of Palestinians, hundreds of whom are children, who are being held without trial right now, and many of them are most likely being tortured.”
“This shows that if Israel, with the whole world watching, can treat a well-known, white person with a Swedish passport this way, just imagine what they do to Palestinians behind closed doors.”
Greta noted that what the flotilla activists went through is “only a small, small part of what Palestinians have experienced” and described bullet holes with bloodstains and messages carved into the cell walls by Palestinian prisoners detained there previously.
The activist recounted the night the flotilla was boarded, mentioning chemical agents employed by Israel and saying “that she will never again be able to look at a starry sky without thinking about drones”.
“It was extremely hot down there. We just sat there. Those who weren’t guarding us walked around the boat, tearing things apart and throwing everything around,” she described.
“After about 20 hours, they arrived in Ashdod, Israel’s largest industrial port, 40 kilometres south of Tel Aviv. A soldier pointed at Greta Thunberg and said, ‘You first, come on!’” the publication wrote.

Greta added that she was not allowed to wear her t-shirt with “Free Palestine” on it and was ordered to change. She put on an orange one with the text “Decolonize” instead.
“And then I put on my frog hat. When I’m about to get off the boat, there are a bunch of police officers waiting for me,” Greta recalled. “They grab me, pull me to the ground, and throw an Israeli flag over me.”
Aftonbladet reported that Greta was dragged to a paved area fenced in with iron fences in a “protracted scene that lasts for over six hours”, according to Greta and several participants in the flotilla.
“It was kind of dystopian,” Greta said. “I saw maybe 50 people sitting in a row on their knees with handcuffs and their foreheads against the ground.
“They dragged me to the opposite side from where the others were sitting, and I had the flag around me the whole time. They hit and kicked me. Then they ripped off my frog hat, threw it on the ground, stomped and kicked it, and kind of threw a tantrum,” she added.
“They moved me very brutally to a corner that I was turned towards. ‘A special place for a special lady’, they said,” Greta explained. “And then they had learned lilla hora (little whore) and ‘Hora Greta’ (whore Greta) in Swedish, which they repeated all the time.”
Greta added that while the Israeli flag was draped around her, guards would attack her if she touched the flag, even if it flapped towards her. She then described being bound “very tightly” with zip ties.
“They took my bag and threw away everything they interpreted as being related to Palestine,” she added. “They took every item and stared into my eyes while slowly cutting them up with a knife, while ten people took selfies.”
The activist also described the moment far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir came to the facility and verbally abused the detainees.
“He shouted, ’You are terrorists. You want to kill Jewish babies.’ Those who shouted back were taken aside and beaten. They were thrown to the ground and beaten,” Greta recalled. “But I could only see it out of the corner of my eye, because every time I lifted my head from the ground, I was kicked by the guard standing next to me.”
She then described a “moving scene” to Aftonbladet: “I needed to go to the bathroom and asked to do so. Then I had to be led through where people were sitting and they saw me. A female member of the Swedish delegation said, ‘We are with you, Greta.’
“Then she was taken aside and assaulted. When I continue through the rows of people sitting there, they say ‘Slay!’” she added, referring to a slang term meaning to do something well.
“They say ‘Slay’ because they know it’s my word. And those who say slay get beaten by the guards. I continue forward and then someone shouts ‘Slaaaay’. And then more and more people join in and shout ‘Slay’, and when everyone is shouting it, they can’t assault everyone,” Greta said.
Greta then described being taken into a building to be searched and undressed, stating that the guards had “no empathy or humanity”.
“There’s a lot I don’t remember. So much is happening at once. You’re in shock. You’re in pain, but you go into a state of trying to stay calm,” she said.
She described being forced into a cleaning closet, where Ben-Gvir hurled abuse at her while the exchange was filmed.
“Then Ben-Gvir and his media team come in and stand there filming, and he says, ’I will personally make sure that you are treated like a terrorist and that you rot in prison. You are Hamas. You are a terrorist. You want to kill Jewish babies’,” Greta described.
“While he is shouting, I sit as calmly as I can and quote UN conventions and say that Israel is not immune and must respect international law. I thought this was being recorded and would be spread to the public, but I still haven’t seen it spread.”
Greta then said she refused to sign papers stating, among other things, that she had entered Israel illegally, Aftonbladet reported, adding that she was then put in a freezing cold prison van, before being transported to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert.
“It was mockery, rough handling, and everything was filmed,” she said. “Everything they do is extremely violent. People’s medications were thrown into the trash can in front of their eyes. Heart medication, cancer medication, insulin.”
She also described a large picture covering one wall, showing a bombed-out Gaza and people fleeing, with text in Arabic reading, “The new Gaza” next to a large Israeli flag, Aftonbladet reported.
“In prison, she is held in different cells. Sometimes a cell of around 15 square meters with 13 other prisoners,” the report read. “There are many days—four? Time blurs together; there were no clocks. They receive hardly any food and no clean water during their entire captivity, but are forced to drink from the tap in the toilet sink, where something brown flows. Several became ill.”

Greta told the outlet that she “couldn’t afford to cry” because of dehydration and said that she was locked in an isolated cell filled with insects.
“It was so hot, like 40 degrees. We begged the whole time: Can we have water? Can we have water? In the end, we screamed. The guards walked in front of the bars the whole time, laughing and holding up their water bottles. They threw the bottles with water in them into the trash cans in front of us,” she recounted.
Aftonbladet reported that around 60 people were put in a small cage outdoors, citing several participants of the flotilla, adding that most of them did not have room to sit down.
“When people fainted, we banged on the cages and asked for a doctor. Then the guards came and said, ‘We’re going to gas you’,” Greta outlined. “It was standard for them to say that. They held up a gas cylinder and threatened to press it against us.
“During the nights, guards regularly came by and shook the bars, shining flashlights, and several times a night they came in and forced everyone to stand up,” she added.
The activist told the Swedish outlet that Stockholm did not do anything to ensure better conditions for Swedish prisoners and that there was no access to legal representation except for five minutes with a lawyer at a port.
“We were together and told them about the treatment we received. About the lack of food, water, about the abuse. The torture. We showed them the physical injuries we had — bruises and scratches,” she said.
“We gave them all our contact details — I gave them my father’s number and the number of our contact in the organisation. We were clear: everything we say now must be released to the media.”
Greta told Aftonbladet that three people from the Swedish embassy made contact with her and her fellow Swedes, but only to tell them that they had consular access.
“We said over and over again: we need water. And they saw that the guards had water bottles,” she recounted. The embassy staff said: ’We’ll make a note of that.’ One of us, Vincent, said: ’Next time we meet you, you must bring water.’“
When the embassy staff returned two days later, Greta said they did not bring any water, “except for a small bottle of their own that was half empty”.
“Vincent, who was in the worst shape, got to drink it,” she told Aftonbladet. “We kept asking the guards, ‘Can we have some water?’ but they just walked around with their water bottles and didn’t answer.”
Aftonbladet reported: “Several participants reported that a female activist became enraged and kicked the trash can where the guards had thrown their water bottles. Bottles spilled onto the floor, and Greta and the others threw themselves on the floor and hurried to open the bottles and drink the water left behind by the guards.”
Greta added that the embassy staff saw this but left the prison anyway.

Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo.
Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed.
Fatima Sana shone with the ball earlier as England could only make 133-9 after being put into bat. The Pakistan skipper ended with figures of 4-27 that included three of the English top-order batters including their captain Nat Sciver-Brunt.
England’s innings was interupted in the 25th over when rains first arrived in the Sri Lankan capital before the game resumed several hours later.
Having lost their first three matches at the tournament, Pakistan needed a win to boost their chances of reaching the semi-finals and they looked a team on a mission.
Just in the second over of the first innings, Diana Baig struck after Tammy Bemaunt left one that jagged back in and took her off stump — a picture-perfect wicket for Pakistan’s front-line pacer after a no-ball earlier in the over.
Fatima followed it up with an even better delivery — pegging back Amy Jones’ middle stump with one that seamed back in after pitching in the corridor of uncertainty.
The Pakistani skipper followed it up with another booming inswinger to get her opposite number Nat Sciver-Brunt by making a mess of her stumps.
 






Heather Knight was the next to follow in the same over as England slumped to 39-4 in just the seventh over.
The English side were in all sorts of trouble at the end of the powerplay — losing half their side for just 54 led by Fatima’s three scalps.
Alice Capsey got a chance in the 18th over when Muneeba Ali dropped a regulation catch inside the circle at square-leg off the bowling of Rameen Shamim.
However, Rameen eventually got her scalp five overs later when Capsey missed a sweep and was adjudged lbw on a ball that — according to ball-tracking — would have hit the leg-stump.
Rain came to the rescue of the English batters as their innings was teetering along at 79-7 at the halfway mark of the innings.
Pakistan were by far the happier side going into the rain-induced break, but memories of Beth Mooney’s hundred that rescued Australia back from the brink of disaster after being 76-7 must have been on the minds of Fatima’s charges.
After play resumed with the innings curtailed to 31 overs per side, England’s Charlie Dean hit a few boundaries to help her side cross the 100-run mark before falling to Fatima.
Pakistan’s openers got the innings going with a boundary in the very first over as Muneeba Ali sent the ball to the fence through point.
Omaima Sohail returning to the side hit a couple of boundaries through the covers before rain stopped play in just the seventh over of the innings.
The players also observed a minute of silence in remembrance of squad member Shawaal Zulfiqar’s father, who passed away on Monday.
 






Last week‘s defeat against Australia left their knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot and needed a win today to keep their campaign alive.
Pakistan had made two changes in their side, with Aliya Riaz and Omaima Sohail back in the team.
Speaking at the toss, Fatima said: “Pitch looks like it will spin, and we will want to take advantage. The spinners will want to take advantage … we want to bat longer, build partnerships. We need to finish off games.”
Pakistan women’s all-rounder Syed Aroob Shah said on Tuesday that the team was looking to “perform better with the bat” ahead of the England encounter.
Squad member Shawaal would be continuing with the squad after her father passed away in Sialkot, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on the same day.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15164031c6ad39c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949102/coas-munir-calls-on-president-zardari-discusses-internal-and-external-security' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir calls on President Zardari, discusses internal and external security</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir called on President Asif Ali Zardari at the Presidency on Wednesday, where both discussed internal and external security threats.
The meeting comes in the wake of escalating border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with security forces repelling an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border this morning and killing 15 to 20 fighters, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
Today’s clash, the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, follows the incident in Kurram on Tuesday night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to a statement from the President’s Secretariat, Field Marshal Munir briefed the president on Pakistan’s overall internal and external security landscape.
“He (army chief) also apprised the president of the recent security situation arising from the aggressive and provocative actions of the Afghan Taliban regime, as well as the measured and befitting response by the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” the statement read.
It added that the president reaffirmed that Pakistan will defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs and expressed full confidence in the “strength, valour, capacity, and preparedness of Pakistan’s Armed Forces”.
President Zardari “lauded their (armed forces) vigilance and professionalism in defending the nation’s frontiers and in swiftly repelling cross-border attacks along the Afghan border”, the statement concluded.
 






President Zardari later met a delegation led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and reviewed matters of national significance, including the prevailing political and security situation, and recent regional as well as international developments affecting Pakistan’s strategic and economic interests.
PM Shehbaz apprised the president of his recent visits to Egypt and Malaysia, including his engagements with international leaders and efforts for peace in Gaza.
“President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif also held a one-on-one discussion, during which they exchanged views on key national priorities and the overall direction of government policies. Both leaders agreed to continue political consultations on matters of national importance,” a statement from the PPP said.
 






According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the weekend skirmishes which began with the Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border.
The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15200603b8e6e10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949121/cop-shot-dead-while-guarding-polio-team-in-kps-nowshera-police' target='_blank'><strong>Cop shot dead while guarding polio team in KP’s Nowshera: police</strong></a><br><p>A police constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district on Wednesday, police said.
The attack comes a day after a Levies constable was shot dead while guarding a polio team in the province’s Swat district.  The government launched a nationwide polio eradication campaign earlier this week, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children. A special order was issued for the drive, with the deployment of 285 police personnel across the country to provide security to the vaccination teams.
A statement shared with Dawn.com by Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah said that the constable, identified as  Maqsood, was killed on the spot when assailants opened fire on him. However, he managed to protect the polio workers he was accompanying.
“The attack took place within the jurisdiction of the Nizampur police station,” the statement said. “Following the incident, security for polio teams across the area was tightened, while the campaign in the affected locality was suspended.”
It added that following the attack, Regional Police Officer (RPO) Mardan Jawad Qamar and District Police Officer (DPO) Nowshera Ahmed Shah visited the site and reviewed the situation.
“A heavy contingent of police reached the area soon after the incident, cordoned it off, and launched a search operation to trace the attackers,” the statement added.
Law enforcement agencies are making “full efforts” to arrest those involved, it said.
The statement further added that the funeral prayer for the martyred constable was offered with official honours at the Police Lines, Nowshera.
“The ceremony was attended by police and army officers, political and social figures, and a large number of locals.
“The body of the martyred officer was sent to his native place, Khushgi Bala, “where the martyr will be buried with full official honours,” it added.
Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP.
Data from September showed that the number of vaccine refusals in KP dropped in the most recent immunisation drive. However, in some areas, such as Lowi Mamund tehsil, residents announced a boycott of the drive.
In May, a policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was martyred in a gun attack by unidentified assailants in Balochistan’s Noshki district, while another was killed in KP’s Bajaur district in February.
Meanwhile, in August, two more polio cases were reported in KP, bringing the national tally to 23 this year.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had previously claimed similar attacks on polio teams, falsely portraying the inoculation campaigns as a Western conspiracy to sterilise children.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15215045224ed4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949108/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-pakistani-tank-captured-by-afghan-taliban-amid-recent-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show Pakistani tank captured by Afghan Taliban amid recent conflict</strong></a><br><p>Posts from Afghan media outlets and users on social media platform X on Wednesday shared a video allegedly showing a Pakistani tank captured by the Afghan Taliban. However, the tank in the clip is not Pakistani.
On Sunday, fierce border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorists. Both nations claimed to have destroyed the border posts of the other side.
On Tuesday, fighting flared up again between the neighbours in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The next day, the third major skirmish also took place, with the Pakistani security forces saying an attack by the Afghan Taliban was repulsed in Spin Boldak, killing about 15-20 Taliban fighters.
Meanwhile, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a social media post that the Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”.
Today, Indian journalist Sidhant Sibal, assistant editor of foreign affairs at Indian media outlet WION, shared a video on X of a tank being driven.
The post’s caption read: “Islamic Emirate government releases videos of Afghan forces capturing Pakistani weapons and tanks. Pakistan launched an attack in the border areas of Afghanistan in the last 24 hrs, Afghan side has said.”
The post gained 15,100 views, but was deleted after a few hours.
The same video with a similar claim was shared by Mujahid as well, with the following caption: “In retaliatory operations, multiple Pakistani aggressor soldiers were killed, their posts and centres were captured, weapons and tanks fell into the hands of Afghan forces, and most of their military installations were destroyed. However, the mujahideen, with high spirits, are ready to defend their homeland, sanctuaries, and people.”
The post gained 247,800 views.
The video and claim were also shared by state-owned Afghan television channel RTA Pashto with the caption: “In Spin Boldak, the enemy’s captured tank!”.
It also shared a picture of the very same tank in the video.
“Be victorious,“ said the caption of the post, which gained 12,000 views. The same video and claim were also shared by the media outlet’s English account on X.
Afghan digital media outlet Zawia News also shared the same video with the caption: “The Taliban claims that in the morning battle in Spin Boldak, in addition to inflicting casualties on the Pakistani side, they have also captured posts, weapons, and a tank from them. Due to the firing from the Pakistani side, civilian people and traders have also suffered casualties as well as financial losses.”
The post gained 7,000 views.
The video with a similar claim was further shared by an Indian propaganda account on X with the caption: “Big! The Islamic Emirate govt releases videos showing Afghan forces capturing Pakistani weapons and tanks”.
The video gained 77,000 views.
The video was widely shared by different Afghan and Indian users on X as can be seen here, here, here, here and here, collectively gaining more than 85,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter.
It was observed that some users in the comments of the posts contested the claims and said the video showed an Afghan T-62 tank.
 


As per the Tank Encyclopedia, a voluntary online database of armoured vehicles, the T-62 is a Soviet main battle tank introduced in 1961 as a successor to the T-55. It features a distinctive 115 millimetre smoothbore gun, a low-profile turret, recognisable by the fume extractor positioned midway on its barrel.
It was also used by the Soviet army in Afghanistan and later by the Afghan forces.
Comparing the tank seen in the video with reference images of the T-62 on the website shows that both feature a similar gap between the fourth and fifth road wheels.
The placement of the fume extractor in the middle of the barrel can also be seen in both images, distinguishing it from similar tanks such as the T-55, which features the extractor closer to the muzzle.
 


A keyword search to confirm whether or not the Afghan Taliban used the T-62 tank showed that according to The International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Afghan Taliban possess several T-62 tanks, which they inherited from the Soviet era and the former Afghan National Army. Many of these were left behind after decades of conflict and later refurbished for limited operational use or display.
A June 23, 2021, article on Dutch open-source intelligence defence analysis website Oryx titled: “Disaster at hand: documenting Afghan military equipment losses since June 2021 until August 14, 2021,” also reported that five T-62 tanks were captured from the former Afghan forces by the Taliban.
A February 10, 2025, article by Militarnyi, a Ukrainian media website focused on military and defence issue, titled: “Afghanistan begins restoring M114 Howitzers,” also reported that the Afghan Taliban had restored T-62 tanks.
An image search for pictures of Afghan Taliban using the tank yielded a June 30, 2022, X post, from an account describing itself as being “focused on military history of Afghanistan”, with the following caption: “The Taliban reactivated several T-62 and T-55 tanks in Kunduz. They’re in service of the 217 Omari Corps.”
The post shared images of Afghan Taliban members riding the tank.
 






Furthermore, an Oct 13, 2025, YouTube video was also found by Indonesian news outlet Tribun Jateng that showed the Afghan Taliban transporting their T-62 amid the current tension with Pakistan.
 


Meanwhile, neither a keyword search yielded any mainstream media reports on Pakistan having or using T-62 tanks nor did an image search led to any pictures of the tank being used by the Pakistani military.
Contacted for comment, Dawn.com news editor Ali Osman not only confirmed that the tank in the viral video was a T-62 tank, he also said that it was never inducted into the Pakistan Army.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows a Pakistani tank captured by the Afghan Taliban amid their recent conflict is false. The tank shown is the T-62, which does not belong to Pakistan and continues to be used by Afghanistan.

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.
 
 

Meanwhile, lingering tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over cross-border terrorism broke out into outright fighting and skirmishes over the weekend that left several dead and injured on both sides. A temporary ceasefire was announced today after three days of fighting.
Addressing a press conference outside Adiala Jail after a meeting with Imran, Barrister Gohar said: “Today, Imran has sent this message: ‘I offer you people that release me on parole and I will solve the Afghanistan problem for you.’”
The same was mentioned a little earlier by Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who said the PTI founder was pained by the repatriation of Afghan refugees in haste after Pakistan hosted them for decades.
As per Noreen, Imran said it was the job of politicians to achieve peace and had offered to play his part in the endeavour if he was released on parole.
 






“They should think because the conditions of Pakistan have become such that three million people have left the country, multi-national companies are leaving the country, and there is no foreign investment in Pakistan. He [Imran] says there is a need for peace and that only comes with political stability,” she said.
However, expressing doubt, Imran’s sister said her brother would never be taken up on his offer.
A message posted on Imran’s X account, which is not controlled by him, asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, the federal government, or the Afghan government.
“The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” the message had said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province.</p><small>2025-10-15 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/151858043a02c44.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949112/police-launch-operation-to-demolish-houses-vacated-by-afghans-in-karachis-sohrab-goth' target='_blank'><strong>Police launch operation to demolish houses vacated by Afghans in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth</strong></a><br><p>Police on Wednesday launched an operation to demolish hundreds of houses vacated by Afghans in Karachi’s Afghan Camp in the Sohrab Goth area to prevent “illegal occupation by rogue elements,” officials said.
The land belongs to the Malir Development Authority (MDA). It comprises 3,117 houses, including those of 200 to 250 Pakistani families. Around 15,680 Afghan nationals were previously residing in the camp. Of them, 14,296 have returned to Afghanistan, while the remaining 1,384 are still living there and are being repatriated in phases.
West Zone Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Irfan Ali Baloch told Dawn.com, “The government-owned land was spread over 200 acres, with 3,000 houses built to accommodate Afghans.”
DIG Baloch further said he had written a letter to police authorities to set up a special committee comprising representatives of the city administration, police and other relevant institutions to prevent illegal occupation of the vacated government land.
“It was the biggest camp of displaced Afghans where an estimated 30,000 Afghans used to live,” he said.
“They were repatriated to their home country recently in three phases as per the policy of the federal government. However, 2,000 Afghans are still living there.”
DIG Baloch said he talked with Karachi’s commissioner, and the operation was launched to demolish the houses to prevent the land mafia from occupying them. He added that structures built over 20 acres were demolished today.
“The operation would continue for the next three to four days,” DIG Baloch said.
In October 2023, the government gave an ultimatum to all undocumented immigrants to leave Pakistan by the end of that month or risk imprisonment and deportation to their respective countries.
The following month, the government initiated a nationwide operation to deport illegal foreign nationals, the majority of whom were Afghans, after the deadline to voluntarily leave the country had expired.
In March of the following year, Pakistan began preparations to launch the second phase of its repatriation drive to send nearly one million ‘documented’ Afghans back to their homeland, with directives to district authorities and police to map and collect data of their whereabouts across the country.
This year, March 31 was officially set as the deadline for Afghan Citizen Card holders to leave Pakistan voluntarily, with a renewed warning by the interior ministry that mass deportations would commence afterwards.</p><small>2025-10-15 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15193915e54b11e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949118/fbr-again-extends-deadline-for-filing-income-tax-returns-to-oct-31' target='_blank'><strong>FBR again extends deadline for filing income tax returns to Oct 31</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Wednesday announced that the October 15 deadline for filing income tax returns will now be extended to October 31.
A notification issued by the revenue board read that the deadline was being extended following requests from trade bodies and tax bar associations, and was being implemented as per Section 214A of the 2001 Income Tax Ordinance.
“The Federal Board of Revenue is pleased to communicate that the date of filing of Income Tax Return for Tax Year 2025, for the persons who were required to file their returns by September 30, 2025 and was extended up to October 15th, 2025 … is further extended to October 31, 2025, in view of the requests from various trade bodies and tax bar associations,” the notification read.
 






This is the second time the FBR has extended the deadline for filing income tax returns despite an earlier stance that it would not do so, signalling that the tax authority yielded to pressure from various quarters and walked back on its firm commitment.
At midnight on September 30, the initial deadline for filing tax returns for tax year 2025, the FBR announced that it was extending the deadline to October 15.

Sharaa, who once headed the Syrian branch of al Qaeda and who toppled predecessor Bashar al-Assad, a close Russian ally, late last year, was speaking at the start of Kremlin talks with Putin, his first visit to Russia since coming to power.
“There are bilateral relations and shared interests that bind us with Russia, and we respect all agreements made with it. We are working on redefining the nature of relations with Russia,” Sharaa, who was speaking in Arabic, told Putin.
Putin told him that Moscow was ready to do all it could to act on what he called “many interesting and useful beginnings” that had already been discussed between the two sides when it came to renewing relations.
The Kremlin chief also congratulated Sharaa on the fact that parliamentary elections were held earlier this month in Syria.

“I believe that this is a great success for you, because it leads to the consolidation of society, and despite the fact that Syria is currently going through difficult times, it will nevertheless strengthen ties and cooperation between all political forces in Syria,” said Putin.
Russian military bases
The Kremlin said before the talks that the fate of Russia’s two main bases in Syria — the Hmeimim air base in Syria’s Latakia province, and its naval facility at Tartous on the coast — would be discussed.
Russia, which has economic and energy-related interests in Syria that it also wants to secure, has a military presence at Qamishli airport —in the northeast near the borders of Turkey and Iraq — as well.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Moscow believed Damascus wanted the military bases to stay and spoke about an idea of also using them as logistics hubs to get aid to Africa by sea and air.
Syrian officials are seeking guarantees that Russia will not help rearm remnants of Assad’s forces, a Syrian source said before the talks.
Sharaa is hoping that Russia might also help rebuild the Syrian army, the same source said.
Sensitive visit
Sharaa’s visit is sensitive. Russia used its military muscle to back Assad for years against Syrian rebels who came to power in December last year, led by Sharaa. Moscow then granted asylum to Assad and his family when they fled the country.

The Assads now live discreetly in Moscow, according to Russian media.
Sharaa will use the talks to formally request that Moscow hand over Assad to face trial over alleged crimes against Syrians, two Syrian sources told Reuters.
Russia prides itself on being able to protect its foreign allies and is not likely to agree to hand over Assad to Damascus. Lavrov said on Monday that Russia had given Assad refuge because his life had been under threat.
Sharaa, who is hoping to secure economic concessions from Russia, including the resumption of wheat supplies on favourable terms and compensation for war damage, is expected as well to press for Moscow’s backing to resist Israeli demands for a wider demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
He may also raise the issue of redeploying Russian military police as a guarantor against further Israeli encroachments, one of the two sources said.
The Kremlin said it did not expect Putin and Sharaa to hold a news conference after their talks.</p><small>2025-10-15 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15181636575b211.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949099/governor-kundi-administers-oath-to-ptis-sohail-afridi-as-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Governor Kundi administers oath to PTI’s Sohail Afridi as KP CM</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath to PTI MPA Sohail Afridi as the province’s chief minister on Wednesday.

Afridi also held up a portrait of PTI founder Imran Khan during the event.
 






After his oath-taking, PTI leader Asad Qaiser extended “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi.
“I hope that, God willing, he will take effective measures to resolve the province’s issues and for the welfare and prosperity of the people […] And that he will also play a role in securing the release of all innocent prisoners, including Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and Shah Mahmood Qureshi,” Qaiser posted on X.
 






The CM’s focal person on digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi said that upon arrival at the CM’s secretariat, a well-equipped police contingent presented a guard of honour to Afridi.
 






Afridi was elected the new KP chief executive on Monday during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and amid the prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
 
 

Declaring Afridi’s election constitutional, Peshawar High Court (PHC) Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah had orderered Kundi a day ago to administer the oath by 4pm today or else the provincial assembly speaker would perform the ceremony the same day under Article 255(2) of the Constitution.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had subsequently also asked Kundi to fulfil his “constitutional and legal responsibility” in accordance with the high court’s order and return to his province to administer the oath to Afridi.
Following the PHC’s order, a spokesperson for Kundi had said the governor would administer the oath, adding that arrangements were being made at the Governor’s House.

Afridi’s election was held amid uncertainty about the status of Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position. The two resignations submitted to Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who is also from the PTI and stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — were returned over “disparate signatures”.
The PTI maintained that a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s approval under the Constitution. With this contention, the party elected Afridi in a session boycotted by the opposition. The same day, in a pre-emptive move, it approached the PHC with the request pertaining to Afridi’s oath-taking.</p><small>2025-10-15 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1512464055dda17.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949071/security-forces-repel-attack-along-balochistan-border-15-20-afghan-taliban-killed-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces repel attack along Balochistan border, 15-20 Afghan Taliban killed: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces repulsed an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border on Wednesday, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
According to a statement by the ISPR, Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
It added that as Pakistani troops repelled the attack, 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban were killed and several others were injured.
“The situation is still developing. There are reports of further buildup at staging points of Fitna-al-Khwarij and [the] Afghan Taliban,” the statement said.
Fitna-al-Khwarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR said that the attack from the Afghan side was “unfortunately […] orchestrated through divided villages in the area, with no regard for [the] civil population”.
“The Afghan Taliban also destroyed the Pak-Afghan Friendship Gate on their side, which clearly displays the mindset with regard to mutual trade and easement rights of the divided tribes,” it added.
The statement by the military’s media affairs wing underlined that the incident in Balochistan was an isolated event.
“On [the] night of October 14/15, Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij tried to attack Pakistani border posts in Kurram Sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“These attacks were effectively repulsed, causing heavy losses to Afghan posts. Eight posts, including six tanks, were destroyed in the effective yet proportionate response of Pakistani troops. Twenty-five to thirty Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij fighters were suspected to have been killed,” the ISPR said.
The ISPR further stated, “The insinuations that the attack was initiated by Pakistan are outrageous and blatant lies, just like the claims of capturing Pakistani posts or equipment. The propaganda of [the] Taliban regime can be debunked with basic fact checks.”
The statement also reaffirmed that the “armed forces stand resolute and fully prepared to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. All acts of aggression against Pakistan will be responded to with full force”.
Before the ISPR’s statement today, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid also posted on social media platform X about the incident at the border in Balochistan.
He alleged that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”. The Afghan government spokesperson also claimed heavy losses on the Pakistan side, including the capture of posts and weapons, as well as fatalities.
President, PM laud security forces
Following the incident in Balochistan, a statement on the PPP’s X account said President Asif Ali Zardari had “strongly condemned” the cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
“Attacks from Afghanistan are a blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he also paid tribute to the armed forces for their “courage and professional expertise”.
The president said the Afghan Taliban government was continuously “violating” the 2020 Doha agreement — a deal signed between the US and Afghan Taliban that included guarantees from the Taliban that it would prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the US and its allies.
President Zardari accused the Afghan Taliban of “providing safe havens to Taliban terrorists”, who he said were a threat to other countries in the region. The president said such measures were destabilising the entire region, including Pakistan.
“The Afghan government is deviating from its promise to establish a broad-based representative government,” he further stated.
On the incidents along the border in Kurram and Balochistan, he said the Pakistan Army had “effectively repelled the attacks” in those areas.
He called on the Afghan authorities not to let their soil be used for terrorism and anti-Pakistan activities.
“Such attacks harm the peace and friendly relations in the region,” the president said, adding that Pakistan wanted peaceful ties based on cooperation with all its neighbours.
“Any aggression against Pakistan will be met with a strong and unequivocal response,” he asserted.
 






A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) today said premier Shehbaz Sharif had expressed concern over “incitement” by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna-al-Khwarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan (the term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan) at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
He also paid tribute to the security forces for repelling the attack by the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram sector, the statement said. It further quoted the PM as observing that the Pakistan Army had given a “strong” response to the Afghan Taliban’s “unprovoked aggression”.
“National integrity will be defended at all costs. The use of Afghan soil for incidents of terrorism in Pakistan is condemnable,” he added.
Tense ties
Today’s border clash in Balochistan is the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following the incident in Kurram last night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border. The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with recent increase in hostilities at the border.
On Monday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ that there were “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he had said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister had also said that hostilities between the two sides could resume “at any time”.

In the latest global ranking issued on October 7, Pa­­kistan’s travel docum­ent was placed at 103 in the list — tied with Yemen — and ranked higher than only those of Iraq (104), Syria (105) and Afghanistan (106).
Per the ranking, Pakistan and Yemen’s passports permit visa-free access to 31 countries only out of 227 travel destinations, Iraq’s allows travel to 29, Syria’s gives access to 26 destinations, and Afghanistan’s travel document only affords the bearer access to 24 destinations without a visa.
Pakistan’s passport has been declared the world’s fourth worst since at least 2021 on the Henley index, which calculates countries’ “visa-free score” — the number of destinations travellers can access without a prior visa, or with a visa on arrival.
The travel document placed 100th on the list in 2024 and 2023, 109th in 2022 when it allowed entry into 32 countries sans a prior visa, and 107th in 2021 with the same visa-free score.
 
 

The top spot yet again belonged to Singapore, as its passport provides citizens visa-free access to 193 destinations, followed closely by South Korea in second place with a visa-free score of 190, and Japan ranking third with 189 destinations its citizens can visit without a visa.
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and Switzerland rank fourth, with visa-free access to 188 locations.
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland and the Netherlands rank fifth with a visa-free score of 187.
Also notable was that for the first time since the Henley Passport Index was created 20 years ago, the United States has fallen out of the world’s top 10 most powerful passports.
“Once unrivalled at No.1 in 2014, the American passport has now slumped to 12th place, tied with Malaysia, with visa-free access to only 180 of 227 destinations worldwide,” Henley said in a press release.
Similarly, the British passport has slipped to its lowest-ever position on the index, dropping from sixth to eighth since July, despite also once holding the top spot in 2015.’
The United Arab Emirates’ passport, which entered the top 10 for the first time last year, hiked one spot, moving to eighth with a visa-free score of 184.
China’s passport, which ranked 59th last year with 85 destinations accessible without a visa, dropped to 64th with its visa-free score lowering to 82.</p><small>2025-10-15 10:33</small></div><hr>
