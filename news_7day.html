<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/3011404689ce737.gif?r=114101' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921060/how-the-sc-constitutional-bench-handed-two-thirds-majority-to-an-unelected-unity-regime' target='_blank'><strong>How the SC Constitutional Bench handed two-thirds majority to an unelected ‘unity’ regime</strong></a><br><p>This past week, the Supreme Court’s ‘Constitutional Bench’ — itself still under constitutional challenge — decided to strip the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the single-largest party in Parliament, of its reserved seats.
It also went one further: it thought to hand those seats to the ruling coalition. Thus, for the first time in our history, nearly two dozen seats were gifted to the same parties that had lost at the polls.
To break this down further: the public’s votes were doled out to those they had voted against. The result is an unelected ‘unity’ regime being handed a two-thirds majority, the very haul it needs to mangle the Constitution in earnest.
We know this to be true because of the disaster that has been the 26th Amendment — around last fall, the coalition parties were smarting from their lack of numbers. It was only after months of cajoling or coercing opposition lawmakers that the amendment could be passed — that too as a watered-down version of an even more atrocious bill.
 
 

But after this latest verdict, the Constitutional Bench has served that Constitution on a platter to the rejected parties: they can now reshape our legal order all by themselves.
This is because the PTI’s reserved seats are what tip the scale: to meet the magic number of 224 seats (in a 336-strong assembly), the regime, at roughly 213 altogether, needed another 11 to get over the line.
They now have those and more: up for grabs were the PTI’s 22 reserved seats, and the coalition got all of them; 14 to PML-N, 5 to PPP, and 3 to fence-sitter JUI-F.
 


In sum, amendments can pass much easier now, regardless of whether their authors were voted in or not. If the Constitution Bench’s view is anything to go by, democracy is besides the point.
What are reserved seats?
Reserved seats have a long and storied past in Pakistan — they were one of founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s core demands, put to British rulers as well as the Hindu majority.
And with reason: to ensure historically underrepresented groups get a say in Parliament. That’s why, of the total 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly at present, 60 have been earmarked for women; 10 for religious minorities.
Given that equal opportunity doesn’t always mean equal participation, these candidates have been shielded from the rough and tumble of a direct election. They are instead allotted seats from pre-existing party lists after the election is over, in proportion to how many general seats their party has won.
It follows that the more general seats a party wins, the more the reserves that fall in its share.
That is, until the Constitutional Bench’s ruling: having turned that formula on its head, the Court has shown it’s better to lose with the system than win against it.
Take, for example, the absurd outcomes trickling out of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: in a province the PTI swept last year, the PML-N, PPP, and JUI-F are now eyeing more seats in reserve than what they’d won in the general election altogether. The PPP, for example, hopes to bag two reserves — despite securing just one seat in the actual polls.
Apart from women and minorities, the Constitutional Bench seems to have created a third category: losers that serve democracy’s latest derailment.
How did all of this start?
It begins, as so much of this judicial surrender does, with former Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa. More specifically, with Isa’s infamous bat symbol verdict, yanking away the PTI’s electoral symbol right before the polls. (Punishment, per the Isa Court, for not holding intra-party elections.)
Enough ink has been spilt over how gross that verdict was, so we push ahead: the logical result of the bat symbol ruling should have been that PTI candidates would have to contest the polls under a symbol other than the bat, or, worst-case scenario, individual symbols.
Which would have been penalty enough: in a land where, in the eyes of the voting public, the symbol is the party, the PTI bore a clear handicap. But the election commission, cartoonishly hostile to whichever party is out of the deep state’s favour, went one further: it ruled that no candidate could contest from the PTI platform whatsoever.
In sum, the PTI hadn’t so much as lost its symbol as it had been dissolved overnight. Not only would its members have to contest with baingans, bottles, and bajas as its symbols, they would now have to do so as independents — as if the party didn’t exist.
 
 

Trap after trap
As we now know, a historic number of PTI-backed independents made it to Parliament anyway. But even there, the election commission met them with trap after trap — whittling down their numbers as much as possible.
For starters, the PTI’s broken bat fell foul of Rule 94 of the Election Rules — that parties are entitled to reserved seats only if they are allotted a symbol.
Looking for a way out, the 80 PTI indies first thought to join sectional party Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen, which had both symbol and seat. It was hoped the boost in MWM’s numbers would help PTI claim all the reserves it was entitled to.
But for reasons still hazy — rumour has it that PTI conservatives were ill at ease with their new ally’s brand — Imran Khan’s partisans opted out of MWM. Instead, they veered into Sunni Ittehad Council, another sectional party — one that hadn’t contested the election, let alone won a seat.
This blunder opened up a second trap: the law mandates that reserved seats be allotted to parties that actually contest the polls. And since Sunni Ittehad hadn’t contested, the election commission smirked, it was ineligible for reserves.
Not that this was what the commission used to think: it had tossed the Balochistan Awami Party a reserved seat in 2019 after elections were held in the ex-tribal areas, without the party ever having contested them. When confronted, the commission shrugged: if it was wrong then, it was correct now.
And it was also correct, it ruled, to have handed PTI’s reserved seats to the parties that had lost them.
Though Sunni Ittehad would appeal the commission’s ruling, a full bench of the Peshawar High Court upheld it: they were entitled to no reserves.
Try as it might, the independents had run out of options. So they returned to the Isa Court, which had created the crisis in the first place.
‘A cascading series of errors’
Thus began a month of Sunni Ittehad Council vs Election Commission of Pakistan. After eight anguished hearings, the Isa Court announced its decision on July 12, 2024.
On the question of how many reserved seats were bound for PTI, the Court split four ways: 8-2-2-1.
 


Justices Mandokhail, Isa dissent: 11 seats
Co-signed by Justice Isa — the closest he ever came to recognising the havoc wreaked by his bat verdict — Justice Mandokhail’s dissent repaired only a fraction of the harm.
It did so by cutting the 80 PTI independents in two: the 39 that had declared themselves PTI in their election forms, and the 41 that hadn’t. “We do not agree with … the ECP declaring PTI’s 39 affiliated returned candidates as independents,” the dissent held. “The electorate voted for them in their such [sic] capacity.”
The judges directed that reserved seats be allotted to PTI in proportion to those 39. The remaining 41 stood knocked out, based on the technicality that their forms didn’t say PTI (even as they claimed the party, and the party claimed them).
In sum, the dissent halved PTI’s rightful share, and handed the loser parties reserved seats well above their proportion. Per the Isa Court’s formula, the ruling regime would still walk away with a two-thirds majority it never won.
Justices Aminuddin, Afghan dissent: 0 seats
The lowest score came from Justices Aminuddin Khan and Naeem Akhter Afghan, dismissing the petitions.
In their 25-page opinion (of which nearly 17 were consumed by facts and background), the dissenters held that Sunni Ittehad was before the Court, not PTI.
And since Sunni Ittehad hadn’t contested the polls, it deserved no reserved seats. Nor did PTI, which hadn’t asked the court for relief anyway.
The dissent proved extraordinary for two reasons: it didn’t cite a single precedent, and it was the first minority opinion to urge that its own majority be disobeyed.
Justice Yahya dissents: 0–11(?) seats
Like Justices Aminuddin and Afghan, Justice Yahya also dismissed Sunni Ittehad’s petitions outright.
As for the 80 PTI claimants, he directed the election commission to revisit the notifications of the 39 indies that had declared themselves PTI in their election forms; specifically, the lucky few that had also provided party certificates.
But unlike Justice Mandokhail’s dissent — which had at least handed over reserved seats to PTI in proportion to those 39 — Justice Yahya kept it narrow: he held that the Court itself could not order any such allocation. To do so “would not be legally appropriate”.
And though he found its behaviour “deeply concerning”, the same election commission was left to decide the future of the assembly.
8-member majority: 22 seats
Authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, the majority went furthest in restoring the people’s will. It held the election commission had been wrong to pretend as if the PTI stood dissolved, even if it had lost its symbol.
It also acknowledged the chaos caused by Justice Isa’s bat verdict: issuing it on the same day that party tickets required submitting had “contributed in causing confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates, and the electorate”.
Nor could such candidates have been forced to run as independents, or been deprived of their reserved seats.
 
 

Since the electorate couldn’t be made to suffer for the commission’s unlawful acts, the Court ordered that the 22 reserved seats be returned to PTI “as an obligation of justice”. The Constitution was a covenant, Justice Shah held; one that affirmed “the supreme role of the people in shaping their destiny”.
As to Justices Isa, Mandokhail, and Yahya excluding at least 41 independents, the majority replied: “We are completely at a loss to understand the logic, other than the constraint of the circumstances, as to why a candidate of a national-level political party … would become an independent candidate by his own free will.”
To quote the majority’s Justice Munib Akhtar, a “cascading series of errors” by the commission had forced the party into such a predicament. Whether or not the judge meant it as a reference, that exact expression was first used in relation to a gory plane crash from 1985 — a metaphor for systems breaking down.
And they would break down again: the state never implemented the verdict.
Review reversal
With no small encouragement from Qazi Faez Isa, the election commission refused to budge. Even the 26th amendment was passed — and the judiciary wrecked along with it — without the PTI being returned its reserved seats.
Hence, also, the amendment’s brand-new ‘Constitutional Bench’. Having achieved much of what it was created for — allowing military trials of civilians, as well as executive interference in the appointments of Islamabad High Court judges — the bench was set for a third act: reviewing Sunni Ittehad.
If while going against all principles of review: though the Supreme Court rules mandate that a review bench must be the same as the original, five of the eight majority judges were dropped without explanation.
They were replaced by seven newcomers, most brought in by the unity regime’s court-packing plan, which had inflated the Supreme Court’s 17-judge strength to 34. For context, India has 33 judges, despite a population five times the size.
Then again, policy concerns were hardly on the executive’s mind. “Observers will ask why the authorities are suddenly worried about how many judges there are in the Supreme Court,” a Dawn editorial wondered when the packing was underway. “Does it have something to do with how the bench ruled in the reserved seats case?” Well, yes.
As it turns out, when said court-packing was alleged before the bench, one new judge did recuse himself from the proceedings — but the bench was never reconstituted. For the first time ever, a smaller bench (12 members) would review the decision of a larger bench (13 members).
 
 

And in yet another first, that bench itself was headed by its most fervent dissenter: in what seemed to be pure happenstance, the executive had already decided on Justice Aminuddin as head of the Constitutional Bench. (The only judge on the judicial commission to have voted for Justice Aminuddin had been Justice Aminuddin.)
All of which brings us to the end scene: if not obvious already, Sunni Ittehad has been reversed in review. The PTI’s haul of reserved seats has dropped from 22 back to 0; its seats again dished out to the losers. Designed for the underrepresented, they are now tools for overrepresentation.
Not only has Justice Aminuddin’s view prevailed, even the original majority’s judges have swapped sides: Justices Mazhar and Rizvi have decided against Justices Mazhar and Rizvi from last summer, and accepted a review of their own decision. The final tally stands at 10-2.
If there’s a silver lining, it comes from said two: Justices Ayesha and Abbasi, who threw out the review petitions upon arrival. Even amid the judiciary’s continuing debasement, Justice Ayesha has given cause for hope: prior to standing up for the reserved seats verdict, she struck down military trials of civilians and rejected each tier of the bogus Practice and Procedure Act.
And more hope will be required: per Sunni Ittehad’s counsel, “The journey from stealing the general election to stealing the reserved seats is complete”.
Which means more corrosion ahead: the 27th amendment is now on the horizon, its contents still in the dark. Until it is exposed, and it must be, Pakistanis wonder: what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p><small>2025-06-30 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6861d7e3e4bde.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921147/man-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>‘Man of peace’?</strong></a><br><p>PRESIDENT Donald Trump wants to be known and acknowledged as a ‘man of peace’. But his imperious conduct and record so far are at sharp variance with this.
True, his instincts are against war, and he vowed not to involve the US in foreign entanglements and what he called “endless stupid wars”. This is what he promised in his election campaign.
He also claimed he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. During the presidential campaign, JD Vance described Trump as the “candidate of peace”. In his victory speech, Trump declared, “I am not going to start wars. I am going to stop wars.”
 
 

But in his opening days in power, his aggressive statements sent a message that no ‘man of peace’ would be identified with. He threatened to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal, if necessary by military force, and turn Canada into the 51st state of the US by using “economic force”.
He also said the US would “take over Gaza” and relocate Palestinians outside their homeland. He unleashed a trade war by imposing sweeping tariffs against almost all countries in the world. His bullying approach and coercive methods prompted The Economist to describe him as a modern-day Don Corleone. Others likened his leadership style to mafia tactics both at home and abroad.
Despite Trump’s boastful claims of bringing a quick end to the Ukraine war, he has been unable to do that. He claims to have promoted peace in the Middle East by forging a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following their 12-day war.
But lighting a fire and then putting it out hardly makes him a peacemaker. Israel, the aggressor, would never have attacked Iran in the first place without a green light from Washington.
Trump acknowledged he had advance knowledge of Israel’s June 13 military assault. But he did nothing to stop Benjamin Netanyahu. Instead, he used nuclear talks with Iran as a smokescreen while the Israeli military was preparing to attack Iran.
Trump later described the attack as “excellent” and admitted he had coordinated closely with Netanyahu. Then, in flagrant violation of international law, he ordered US warplanes to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, declaring triumphantly this had “completely obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites and likening it to nuclear bombs dropped by the US on Japan in World War II. Is this what ‘men of peace’ do?

Trump’s imperious conduct and record so far contradict his claim of being a peacemaker.

Persuading Israel and Iran to agree to a ceasefire, which remains fragile, hardly supports Trump’s assertion to have established peace. Yes, the fighting has stopped for now, but peace is an altogether different matter.
Peace is established when disputes or issues are resolved. A ceasefire is what it says it is — a halt in active hostilities. Ceasefires can, of course, be a pathway to peace. But there is no chance of peace between Iran and Israel, who remain implacable enemies. Meanwhile, Trump declared he would bomb Iran again if the country was still able to enrich uranium to weapons-grade.
What contradicts Trump’s ‘peacemaker’ claim in the most barefaced way is his role in and support for Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Despite his earlier statements that he wanted an expeditious end to the war, his actions prove the contrary.
He has thus far shown no willingness to restrain or stop Netanyahu from raining death and destruction on Gaza. While Trump has been trumpeting his peacemaking ‘credentials’, Gaza has only seen more bloodshed, displacement, devastation, and now, starvation and famine.
Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s US-backed war, the majority of them women and children. In fact, since Trump’s assumption of power, Israel has expanded its military offensive in Gaza and threatened to occupy all of the territory.
It has blocked humanitarian aid and used starvation as a weapon. Has Trump intervened to prevent any of this or, for that matter, Israel’s increasing military assaults on the occupied West Bank?
Obviously not. Instead, the US has used its veto to block resolutions in the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The most recent veto was exercised earlier this month that opposed an “immediate and permanent ceasefire”; it was the sixth US veto since the war began.
This has given Israel carte blanche to continue its killing spree and create a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Trump administration has remained unmoved by scenes of desperate, starving Palestinians, including children, being shot in cold blood by Israeli forces as they queue up for food at controversial military-run aid distribution sites set up with US backing.
In one month alone, over 500 aid-seekers have been killed. Washington has also not denied Israeli leaders’ claims that they are implementing Trump’s plan of forcible displacement of Palestinians by pushing them out of Gaza.
Despite this grim record, Trump feels he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Although he has cited several reasons for this, his claim rests principally on brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after their four-day conflict.
For that, the government of Pakistan recommended him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This ill-conceived move, aimed at ingratiating itself with Trump, was justified by the government on the grounds that he had intervened to de-escalate “a rapidly deteriorating situation” and secure a ceasefire that averted “a broader conflict between the two nuclear states”.
It is disingenuous to argue Trump’s intervention was the decisive factor, when it was nuclear deterrence that prevented the outbreak of all-out war.
Defusing a crisis, which Washington did, is not the same thing as averting a full-blown conflict. If it took Trump to avert a “broader conflict”, that would make Pakistan’s nuclear capability irrelevant.
If that is what the government thinks, then it has no confidence in the country’s security guarantor. Moreover, a peace award should be in recognition of the establishment of peace, which happens when contentious issues are resolved between warring parties. Has that happened?
What is touted as Trump’s doctrine of ‘peace through strength’ is nothing other than the unilateral use of force and coercion in defiance of international law and global norms to impose US will. This is a recipe for chaos, not winning the peace.

According to information from Edhi and Rescue 1122, no casualties or injuries have been reported at the building, which is located near M Suleman Mithaiwala.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the bridge connecting two buildings at the sixth floor had collapsed, leaving residents on higher floors stranded.
He noted that the bridge was an old and dilapidated part of the building whose structure may have been weakened in the recent rains.
“The building has been vacated and declared unlivable because it might collapse any time,” Khan said.
“There were difficulties during the rescue operation as it was an old area of the city where it is difficult to commission snorkels due to the congested locality.
“Besides people living in adjoining residential buildings refused to vacate, claiming their building was safe and questioning why the need to leave,” he said.
He added that a huge crowd had gathered at the site of the incident and it was difficult to move machinery.
As soon as Rescue 1122 Central Command and Control received information of the incident, the Urban Search and Rescue Team, along with one ambulance and one disaster response vehicle reached the scene, Khan said.</p><small>2025-06-30 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/30112626a9352b2.png?r=113822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921189/over-230000-afghans-left-iran-in-june-ahead-of-return-deadline-un-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Over 230,000 Afghans left Iran in June ahead of return deadline: UN agency</strong></a><br><p>More than 230,000 Afghans left Iran in June, most of them deported, as returns surge ahead of a Tehran-set deadline, the United Nations migration agency said on Monday.
From June 1-28, 233,941 people returned from Iran to Afghanistan, International Organisation for Migration spokesman Avand Azeez Agha told AFP, with 131,912 returns recorded in the week of June 21-28 alone.
“In total, from 1 January to 28 June 2025, 691,049 people have returned, 70 percent of whom were forcibly sent back,” he said.
 
 

The number of returnees surged in recent weeks, as Afghans reported increased deportations and pressure to leave ahead of a July 6 deadline announced by Iran in May for Afghans without documents to leave the country.
For several days last week, the number reached 30,000 per day, the IOM said.
Figures have remained around 6-7,000 in recent days, Taliban border authorities and the UN said, with the numbers expected to increase ahead of the deadline.</p><small>2025-06-30 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6861d7261dcc4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921145/ties-that-bind' target='_blank'><strong>Ties that bind</strong></a><br><p>CLOSE to the end of the Israel-Iran war, and right after he had Iran’s Fordow enrichment centre bombed, the US president indulged in some unusual criticism of Israel. Granted, a day or so later, he was effusive in his praise for Israel’s prime minister and renowned war criminal Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu, but given the death grip that Israel has on US politics, the fact that any criticism was made in the open is interesting.
Now we know that many US presidents haven’t exactly gotten along with Israel’s leaders and have, in fact, taken issue with many of Israel’s actions, but this is usually done behind closed doors.
If I had a hundred dollars for every time I read a ‘leak’ or ‘insider scoop’ about how displeased, angry or even livid former president Joe Biden had been with Netanyahu during the ongoing Gaza genocide, I’d be able to retire a good chunk of Pakistan’s debt by now. Of course, US military, economic and diplomatic support for Israel reached new heights under Biden, so the private criticism, if any, really doesn’t matter.
 
 

Obama himself once pointedly avoided visiting Israel after his 2009 Cairo speech, and it is known that his own relations with Netanyahu were strained, but this had no real effect on the US-Israeli relationship.
Bill Clinton was much the same, with many insiders and journalists talking about his private frustration with Netanyahu over the so-called peace process, but the private opprobrium never translated into public action.
But the further back you go, you see that there was a time when words were matched by action, or at least by the threat of action. In this case, we can refer to when George H.W. Bush threatened to withhold loan guarantees worth $10 billion from Israel in 1992 if it persisted with building settlements in the occupied West Bank.
But it is Ronald Reagan who gets the most credit among the post-1973 presidents for slightly standing up to Israel after it bombed Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981. He suspended the delivery of F-16 jets and voted in favour of a Security Council resolution condemning Israel. A year later, when Israel invaded Lebanon, Reagan not only demanded an immediate withdrawal but also temporarily restricted military aid and assistance.
That aid had become crucial for Israel’s very existence; the 1973 Arab-Israeli war was an inflection point in the US-Israeli relationship, with Nixon launching Opera­tion Nickel Grass, an airlift of military supplies that perhaps exceeded the volume of the Berlin airlift itself. These supplies allowed Israel to continue waging war and marked the moment when the US fully committed itself to Israel’s protection.

Things haven’t always been smooth between Israel and the US.

Prior to this, there had been severe strains which came close to derailing, but never quite derailed, the core relationship. Such as when Kennedy took Israel to task over its nuclear programme, insisting that it allow inspections of its Dimona nuclear facility.
 
 

Whether this would have led to a serious dispute is now a purely academic question, as Kennedy was assassinated soon afterwards. Interestingly, Republican congresswoman and hardcore MAGA adherent Marjorie Taylor Greene recently alluded to that assassination in a tweet, writing: “There was once a great president that the American people loved. He opposed Israel’s nuclear programme. And then he was assassinated.”
A few years after that, during the 1967 war, the Israeli navy and air force attacked a US Navy ship, the USS Liberty, which was stationed north of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. In an assault that lasted over an hour, 34 crew members were killed and close to 200 injured. While Israel to this day claims that this was a case of mistaken identity, the survivors of the attack insist that it was deliberate, and that the ship was clearly marked as American. Compen­sa­tion was paid, and the matter effectively covered up.
 
 

But the lowest point in US-Israeli relations had already come and gone in the shape of the 1956 Suez crisis, when Israel teamed up with Britain and France to invade Egypt. The colonial-settler state had been hungry for land since its inception, and Britain and France wanted to hold on to their remaining colonial glory.
US president Eisenhower was having none of it, though, and issued marching orders to the triple invaders, forcing a withdrawal. Of course, the US was also motivated by its fear of being embroiled in a larger Cold War conflict at this stage.
At the same time, pro-Israel elements were working diligently to expand Israel’s influence in America, notably by founding AIPAC in 1954, in part to counter ‘negative reactions’ to Israel’s massacre of Palestinian villagers the same year.
Since then, AIPAC has grown into a formidable force but is in­­creasingly not immune to criticism, and we have seen hardcore MAGAists like the afo­rementioned Greene and Thomas Massie pu­­blic­­­ly criticise its influence and methods.

The global conference will bring together leaders, policymakers, and international development experts to explore innovative and sustainable financing strategies to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly for developing and emerging economies.
During the visit, Aurangzeb will represent Pakistan in the main conference sessions and a range of high-level side events. On July 1, he will co-chair the multi-stakeholder roundtable on “Leveraging Private Business and Finance”, and deliver a keynote address at the International Business Forum (IBF) Policy Dialogue on “Accelerating EMDEs (Emerging Market and Developing Economies) Investment: The Role of Credit Ratings”.
He is also scheduled to address the general debate of the conference and participate in the roundtable discussion on “Revitalising International Development Cooperation”.
As part of a side event hosted by Unicef, the minister will speak on “Driving Capital Towards Children and Young People: A Dialogue on Innovative and Sustainable Financing for Children”.
 
 

During the conference, Aurangzeb will also attend and speak as chief guest at a special session titled “Swapping Out Debt for Development: The DCS (Distributed Control System) Financing Approach”, where he will outline Pakistan’s perspectives on debt transformation and the potential of deposit protection mechanisms to support development finance.
He will also be a panelist at the IBF’s side event on “Scaling Up SME Finance”, focusing on enhanced financial inclusion for small and medium-sized enterprises.
In addition to his conference engagements, the finance minister will hold bilateral meetings with key international figures, including International Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General John WH Denton AO and Vice Minister for Development of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Steven Collet.
“The finance minister’s participation at FFD4 underscores Pakistan’s commitment to promoting innovative financing solutions, strengthening international cooperation, and enhancing the country’s voice in global development discourse,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-06-30 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301008365e441d9.png?r=100842' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921078/mepco-staffer-burnt-in-transformer-blast-dies' target='_blank'><strong>Mepco staffer  burnt in transformer blast dies</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A Mepco employee who sustained burns while working on a transformer in Gulberg Sub-Division in Multan died at the Nishtar Hospital on Sunday.

Sources said technicians were working on the 11kV transformer without safety gear including helmets, gloves or harness belts.
They said basic precautions like earthing lines and using protective equipment were routinely violated.
The explosion occurred during D-coil installation and boiling oil caused severe burns. Company CEO Jam Gull Muhammad Zahid told Dawn that an inquiry had been initiated and he could not say anything further before completion of the inquiry.
He said all the safety gadgets were being provided to the workers and he did not know yet why the incident took place or if any protocol was violated or not.

CHAUDHRY Nisar Ali Khan greets Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Rumours of a probable political rapproachment began swirling in the federal capital on Sunday, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his estranged former party colleague, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
Media reports said the PM arrived at Mr Nisar’s home with an offer to rejoin the PML-N. However, it could not be ascertained whether Mr Nisar accepted the offer or not.
It is believed the prime minister met Mr Nisar with the consent of his elder brother and PML-N president, Nawaz Sharif.
 






However, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said the PM only inquired about Mr Nisar’s health.
“They discussed the national and international situation during the meeting,” said the official press release about the meeting that took place in a “very pleasant atmosphere” where the two leaders “revived memories of the past”.

PML-N leader refutes reports, says party in no mood to bring estranged leader

Videos of the meeting showed Mr Nisar’s son also sitting with his father during the meeting.
A senior PML-N leader told Dawn the PM only met Mr Nisar to inquire about his health, as he had not been well for the past few days.
There was no truth in reports that Mr Nisar had been asked to rejoin the party and that he assured the PM he would consider the offer, said the PML-N leader, who wished not to be named. “It is just a storm in a teacup.”
The PML-N leader stated it has not been discussed at any party forum that the top leadership wanted to bring back Mr Nisar into the fold.
PM Shehbaz might have remained in touch with Mr Nisar, but the disgruntled PML-N leader has severed all connections with Mr Nawaz since a long time, said the party leader.
 
 

The PML-N leader said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif now has a significant role in the party’s decision-making and “Mr Nisar had never been in her good books”.
He said the party apparently doesn’t need Mr Nisar because another leader, Engineer Qamarul Islam, has already won the same National Assembly seat from Taxila, which was Mr Nisar’s constituency.
He said after departing PML-N, Mr Nisar had spoken harshly against the party.
“This cannot be forgotten by party leaders. Therefore, there is no desire in the party to bring Mr Nisar back,” he added.
Another source said the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere, where the PM complained to Mr Nisar in a lighter tone, saying, “You have forgotten us.”
Mr Nisar denied the impression, saying he had been ill lately.
Sources said the PM also condoled the death of Mr Nisar’s sister, who died recently.
Once considered a trusted aide of Nawaz Sharif, he remained associated with the PML-N for 34 years. He parted ways with the party just before the 2018 general elections, following differences with the elder Sharif.

The accused included Nawazish Ali Hanjra, who was wanted in 23 cases of terrorism, murder and kidnapping and Haroon Iqbal, in a separate serious case.
They were apprehended on the basis of Interpol Red Notices issued at Pakistan’s request.
Legal proceedings are now underway to extradite the two men to stand trial in Pakistan.
The arrests followed a recent visit by the minister of state for interior, Talal Chaudhry, to Spain.
He met with Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska and formally requested the arrest and extradition of the two fugitives.
Mr Chaudhry emphasised the importance of mutual cooperation in combating transnational crime and terrorism, the ministry’s statement added.
The Spanish Minister of Interior had issued urgent directives to relevant authorities to act on the red notices issued by Pakistan.
Pakistan has been seeking the arrest and extradition of 38 fugitives from Spain, most of whom are wanted in criminal and terrorism-related cases.
These individuals had managed to evade justice for years, exploiting legal loopholes and a lack of coordination between international enforcement agencies, the ministry added.

The Jamshed  Quarters police stated that seven boys were sitting at a restaurant  near the Kanzul Iman mosque when an argument broke out over a minor  issue.
During the altercation, Abdul Rehman was pushed by one of the  boys, causing his head to strike the handle of a parked motorcycle. He  sustained critical injuries and died on the spot.
The police arrived  at the scene upon receiving information and detained six suspects. They were identified as Talha  Mohammed, Hasan alias Arif (a cousin of the deceased), Abdullah, Faraz  Sattar, Manan Ali and Moiz Mohammed.
The body was taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for medico-legal procedures.
Area SHO Anser Ahmed Butt told Dawn  that the scuffle  began between Manan Ali and Abdullah over the profile picture of  the latter’s girlfriend being found on the former’s  mobile phone. When  Abdul Reh­man attempted to inte­rvene, Manan allegedly  pushed him. He  slipped and fell, hitting his head on the motorcycle,  which caused his  instant death.
Meanwhile, police on Sunday claimed to have arrested two suspects for allegedly murdering a police constable and setting his body on fire in his North Karachi home in order to conceal their crime. They reportedly killed the constable over some personal enmity.

As monsoon rains continue across the country, authorities issued an urban flooding warning for several cities on Sunday, while glacial melting across Gilgit-Baltistan is threatening residents of downstream areas.
According to the National Disa­ster Management Authority’s Nat­i­onal Emergencies Operation Cen­tre (NEOC), significant rainfall activity is anticipated in Azad Kashmir, northeast Punjab, the Potohar region, Islamabad and upper and central parts of KP between June 29 and July 3.
According to Rescue 1122, two people were killed and a dozen injured in rain-related incidents in Lahore.  Meanwhile, two people were killed when the roof of a mud house collapsed in Sharifpura.
In Karachi, three people were electrocuted, while two sisters died after being swept away by floodwaters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit-Baltistan.
 
 

The NEOC warned that significant rainfall may result in urban flooding in low-lying areas of central KP, the Potohar region and Islamabad.
NEOC has also cautioned against possible flash flooding in the northern parts, including the Hazara and Malakand Divisions, lower parts of Jhelum and Poonch Valleys in AJK, and the Pir Panjal range. Furthermore, heavy to very heavy rainfall was forecasted in southern Sindh, particularly affecting Hyderabad, Badin, Thatta, and Karachi from June 29 to July 5.
Glacier melting
In GB, rapidly melting glaciers pose a constant threat for residents living in downstream areas.
The local administration said that many households in Tokorkot village in Nagar district have been shifted to safer locations, as the melting glacier near the village has eroded land, damaged agricultural fields, trees, and transmission lines, and put more than 15 homes at risk.

They had two paths: either treat their project as a mere requirement to earn the degree, or turn it into something that a giant like Google may be interested in.
They opted for the latter path, which led to the development of Geo Gemma — an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with the Google Earth Engine, to analyse spatial data and satellite imagery without the need for lengthy codes.
 






Last week, GeoGemma won the ‘Best AI Use Case’ award at the Asia-Pacific (APAC) Solution Challenge, jointly organised by Google and the Asian Development Bank in Manila.

Team from Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad say their innovation can be used across several fields, such as oil and gas, real estate, supply chain etc.

Speaking to Dawn from Manila, Mr Iqbal said GeoGemma was created with the idea of automating geospatial analysis.
“[The] Google Earth Engine hosts updated satellite imagery from the entire planet. There is 80 petabytes of data there, and you can overlay your maps to analyse different geographical variables — from temperature on K2 to thermal imaging,” he explained.
 
 

But this engine has its limitations; the user has to have a certain level of programming and coding expertise to retrieve satellite data and analyse it.
GeoGemma intended to change this — make this data accessible to anyone who wants to analyse it by writing just a few prompts detailing what data they need. Mr Iqbal and his team were able to accomplish this with funding from Google.
Around June last year, he came across a research grant opportunity by Gemma Academic Programme, organised by Google DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet that works on AI development.
Mr Iqbal, Mr Hunzala and their supervisor Dr Sajid Ghaffar formed a GeoAI team and applied for the grant. “[We] pitched our idea of fusing Google Earth Engine with the open-source Gemma model.”
In September 2024, the team got a $10,000 research grant from Google DeepMind.
APAC Solution Challenge
GeoGemma was selected as one of the top 10 projects from a pool of 750 entries from over 200 universities. A team from Fast University — who developed a Gemini-powered document editor for neurodivergent users — was the second team from Pakistan to make it to the top 10.
For the big stage, the team of two needed more resources. They included Abdullah Asif and Khaleelullah, two undergrads studying Computer Science at the IST. Mr Asif joined as the Front-end Web Developer, while Mr Khaleelullah was the tech lead and AI engineer.
Simplifying geospatial analysis
Mr Iqbal said GeoGemma is a simplified spatial analysis tool, which can fetch satellite data by understanding prompts in a natural language.
“We are actually pushing boundaries by building a simple model that can even be loaded on computers without the need of servers,” he said, adding the total size of a model is less than 2GB and it can run on any laptop.
 
 

He believes satellite imagery and remote sensing are at the cross-sections of many industries — sustainability, oil and gas, real estate, supply chain, etc.
The team plans to release their software before the end of this year.
“Right now, we have a solid foundation. We have recognition. We have credibility. But moving forward, there is so much potential in terms of industries we can partner with and make custom modules that’d be proprietary tools,” Mr Iqbal said about the future of GeoGemma.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump branded him a “pure communist” in remarks that aired on Sunday, an epithet the progressive candidate dismissed as political theatrics.
In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mamdani said his agenda of raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and on corporations to pay for ambitious policies such as free buses, a $30 minimum hourly wage and a rent freeze was not only realistic but tailored to meet the needs of the city’s working residents.
“It’s the wealthiest city in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and yet one in four New Yorkers are living in poverty, and the rest are seemingly trapped in a state of anxiety,” he told NBC’s Kristen Welker.
Mamdani’s stunning victory over former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo in Tuesday’s primary election has some party figures worried that his democratic socialism could feed Republican attacks on Democrats as too far left ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Business leaders have also expressed concern about his policies.
 
 

Democrats have struggled to find a coherent message after their resounding loss in the November elections that saw President Donald Trump return to the White House and his Republicans win control of both chambers of Congress. A Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month showed that a majority of American Democrats believed their party needs new leadership and to be more focused on economic issues.
Earlier on Sunday, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who represents part of the city, told ABC’s “This Week” that he wasn’t ready to endorse Mamdani yet, saying that he needed to hear more about Mamdani’s vision.
Other prominent New York Democrats, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have also thus far declined to endorse Mamdani.
Trump, himself a native New Yorker, told Fox News that if Mamdani wins the mayoral race, “he’d better do the right thing” or the White House would withhold federal funds from the city.
“He’s a communist. I think it’s very bad for New York,” Trump said. Asked about Trump’s claim that he is a communist, Mamdani told NBC it was not true and accused the president of attempting to distract from the fact that “I’m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower that he has since then betrayed.”
He also voiced no concern that Jeffries and other Democrats have not yet endorsed his candidacy.

The bunker-bus­ter assault, launched under Trump’s direction, marked a rare instance of a direct US attack on Iranian soil.
Although the immediate result was a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, the strategic and ethical implications of the strike are far more disturbing than they first appeared.
Following the US strike, Iran launched only minimal retaliatory attacks before agreeing to what amounts to a ceasefire of near surrender. Israel, too, accepted this halt in hostilities. On the surface, it might appear that American power forced a pause in the conflict. But beneath that silence lies a storm: in Iran, anger and humiliation are growing — particularly among the youth — who might view this sequence of events not as fair but as public submission to Western aggression.
That sentiment raises a chilling historical parallel: the 9/11 attacks in 2001. At the time, many Ameri­cans saw the attacks as inexplicable acts of evil. However, later analyses revealed that the roots of such extremism lay in decades of unilateral, arrogant and often violent US interventions in the Middle East.
The young people in the Arab world or Islamic nations radicalised during those years saw the United States not as a beacon of freedom but as a hubristic superpower trampling their sovereignty. The fear now is that Trump’s latest strike may sow the seeds of yet another 9/11-style backlash — this time from another generation filled with rage and defiance.
 
 

The UN Security Council did not approve the military strike, nor was there any consensus among US allies. There is no clear evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring a preemptive US strike. In short, the action violated fundamental principles of international law — specifically, the prohibition against unilateral use of force without Security Council authorisation or a clear case of self-defence.
The alarming point is that the US is responsible for protecting the rule of no unilateral use of force. Even more concerning is the fact that Trump’s strike appeared to align with Israel’s aggressive posture toward Iran.
In recent months, Israel has conducted multiple attacks on Iranian targets, citing concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme. There are indeed reasons to be concerned about the programmes from an Israeli perspective. However, such doubt can not justify the preventive strike in any form.
Now, by acting in concert with — or perhaps on behalf of — Israel, the United States has compromised its traditional image as an objective mediator in the region. Instead, it has cast itself as a direct participant in the conflict, blurring the line between diplomacy and warfare.
This is not an isolated event. During his presidency, Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal.

Beijing rolled over $2.1bn, which has been in Pakistan’s central bank’s reserves for the last three years, and refinanced another $1.3bn commercial loan, which Islamabad had paid back two months ago, the sources said.
The officials asked not to be named as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly ahead of an official announcement.
Another $1bn from Middle Eastern commercial banks and $500 million from multilateral financing have also been received, one of the officials said.
“This brings our reserves in line with the IMF target,” he said.
The loans, especially those from China, are critical to shoring up Pakistan’s low foreign reserves, which the IMF required to be over $14bn at the end of the current fiscal year on June 30.

• Despite US strikes, Tehran can resume enrichment ‘in months’, IAEA warns
TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday expressed “serious doubts” that Israel will abide by a US-brokered ceasefire that ended their 12-day war, demanding that the United Nations hold Tel Aviv and Washington responsible for the conflict.
The conflict began on June 13, when Israel launched a bombing campaign targeting military commanders and scientists linked to Iran’s nuclear programme.
“We did not start the war, but we have responded to the aggressor with all our power,” Iran’s armed forces chief of staff, Abdolrahim Mousavi, was quoted as saying by state television.
“We have serious doubts over the enemy’s compliance with its commitments including the ceasefire, we are ready to respond with force.”
During the war, Iran say it arrested dozens of people it accused of spying for Israel, and also seized equipment including drones and weapons.
Iran’s parliament on Sunday voted to ban the unauthorised use of communications equipment, including tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service, according to the official news agency IRNA.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Tehran has formally requested that the Security Council blame its adversaries for the war and compel them to pay for damages.
 
 

“We officially request hereby that the Security Council recognise the Israeli regime and the United States as the initiators of the act of aggression and acknowledge their subsequent responsibility, including the payment of compensation and reparations,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote.
Enrichment resumption
Despite US assertions that its strikes obliterated key nuclear sites, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog cast doubt on how effective the campaign was in permanently halting Iran’s progress.
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran could be producing enriched uranium again within months.
“The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that,” Grossi told CBS News.
He noted that while strikes on facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan significantly set back Iran’s abilities, its nuclear knowledge is irreversible.
“You cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have,” Mr Grossi said.
Casualties and talks
The war killed at least 627 civilians in Iran and injured 4,900, according to Iran’s health ministry.
Retaliatory missile attacks by Iran killed 28 people in Israel, Israeli authorities said.
One of the deadliest single events of the war was an Israeli strike last Monday on Tehran’s Evin prison, which Iran’s judiciary said on Sunday killed at least 71 people.
The victims included staff, guards, prisoners, and visiting relatives.
The facility is known for holding political prisoners and foreign nationals.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called the strike “unacceptable” but said two detained French nationals held at Evin for three years were not believed to have been harmed.
Iran’s prison authority said it transferred an unspecified number of inmates out of the prison after the attack.
The fighting derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, a staunch ally of Israel. US president, who announced the ceasefire, has threatened further stri­kes if Iran enriches uranium to worrisome levels.
According to the IAEA, Iran enriched uranium to 60pc in 2021, far beyond the 3.67pc limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2018.
Uranium enriched to 90pc is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.

“Make the deal in Gaza, get the hostages back,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform early on Sunday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold talks later in the day on the progress of Israel’s offensive.
A senior security official said the military will tell him the campaign is close to reaching its objectives, and warn that expanding fighting to new areas in Gaza may endanger the remaining Israeli hostages.

Trump urges end to the war; Hamas signals readiness to resume talks

But in a statement posted on X and text messages sent to many residents, the military urged people in northern parts of the enclave to head south towards the Al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis.
 
 

“The (Israeli) Defence Forces is operating with extreme force in these areas, and these military operations will escalate, intensify, and extend westward to the city centre to destroy the capabilities of terrorist organisations,” the military said.
The evacuation order covered the Jabalia area and most Gaza City districts.
Ceasefire push
The escalation comes as Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, begin a new ceasefire effort to halt the 20-month-old conflict and secure the release of Israeli and foreign prisoners still being held by Hamas.
A Hamas official told Reuters the group had informed the mediators it was ready to resume ceasefire talks, but reaffirmed the group’s outstanding demands that any deal must end the war and secure an Israeli withdrawal from the coastal territory.
Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining prisoners in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, only in a deal that will end the war.
23 killed in strikes
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes and gunfire killed 23 people in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory on Sunday, including three children.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that his services “transported 23 martyrs, including several children and women” killed in various locations around the Gaza Strip.
Separately, the Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that a 20-year-old soldier was killed “during combat in the northern Gaza Strip”.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that the first tremor struck Musakhail, Rarashram, Kingri, and surrounding areas at 3:24am with a magnitude of 5.5 and a depth of 28km, while the second tremor, measuring 4.8, was recorded at 7:30am.
“Aftershocks continued for a brief period in the affected areas,” officials in Musakhail told Dawn, adding that residents were reluctant to re-enter their homes due to the tremors.
The epicenter of the moderate earthquake was located approximately 60 kilometres north-northeast of Barkhan, a mountainous district headquarters in Balochistan province bordering Punjab. There were also reports that tremors were felt in some bordering areas of Punjab.

Tremors also felt in Rarashram, Kingri and surrounding areas; hundreds of homes partially affected

“The tremors continued to jolt Musakhail, Rarashram, Kingri, and surrounding areas for around 30 seconds, causing many houses to collapse,” local administration officials said, adding that two houses were completely destroyed.
According to initial reports, five people, including a woman, were brought to the rural health centre with injuries sustained from collapsing houses.
“A couple was injured when the roof of their house was badly damaged during the earthquake,” levies officials said, adding that the condition of two injured individuals was serious, and they were shifted to District Hospital Loralai.
The officials added that over a hundred mud houses were partially damaged, rendering many residents homeless, who were being moved to safe locations. The boundary wall of the Government High School in the area also collapsed.
Musakhail Deputy Commissioner Bilal Shabbir confirmed that five people were injured in the quake-related incidents. “The rescue and relief teams reached the affected areas soon after the earthquake,” he told Dawn.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) stated that the district control room was activated immediately after the tremors were felt, and damage assessments are ongoing. Preliminary data indicates that hundreds of homes have been partially affected, and a detailed survey has been initiated.
Meanwhile, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement that initial relief operations have begun in Tehsil Kingri of Musakhail. He added that once the final report is compiled, complete details of the losses will be shared.
Tremors were also felt in nearby Barkhan district, adding to concerns in the region. Authorities continue to monitor the situation as aftershocks remain a possibility.

• Announces removal of PTV fee from utility bills
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday pledged that his government would never discourage the country’s solarisation boom, as he launched the ‘Power Smart’ mobile app to empower citizens and promote transparency in electricity billing under the ‘Apna Meter, Apni Reading’ initiative.
Addressing the launch ceremony in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz emphasised the government’s support for renewable energy, calling solar power a vital and growing resource for the nation.
“The government would not discourage the solarisation boom in the country, rather we welcomed the ongoing process, which is regarded as the most inexpensive way of producing electricity in the world,” the prime minister said.
He noted that the rapid adoption of solar energy is a key trend in the country.
“Pakistan is among the few countries where the solarisation process is rapidly taking place,” he added.
 
 

The premier identified the widening gap between high electricity production capacity and lower grid consumption due to solar adop­tion as a challenge the government is actively working to address.
Power Smart App
The ‘Power Smart’ app introduced under the ‘Apna Meter Apni Reading’ initiative is designed to empower consumers by allowing them to take a photograph of their electricity meter on a specified date and upload it to the app.
The monthly bill is then generated based on the uploaded image.
If a user provides a reading on the designated due date, that reading will be prioritised over any reading taken later by a utility employee, according to a statement from the Power Division.
“This is not just a technology feature but a solid reform in governance, which truly empowers consumers,” the Power Divi­sion said.
“With this system, consumers will not only be able to keep an eye on their bill, but now they will also be the guardians of the reading process.”
Officials highlighted that the system will particularly protect subsidy-eligible consumers.
A delay or error in meter reading can push a household’s consumption just over a subsidised slab, causing bills to spike dramatically.
For example, a bill for up to 200 units is approximately Rs 2,330, but if consumption rises even slightly above that, the bill can jump to over Rs 8,000 as the subsidy is removed.
“Through this app, it will be possible to ensure that the beneficiaries benefit from their subsidy by providing timely readings,” the Power Division said.
The application, available in five languages to improve accessibility across provinces, is intended to significantly reduce complaints related to over billing and unnecessary interference.
Federal Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari said the initiative aims to give the responsibility of meter reading to consumers themselves.
“Meter readers mechanism has now been handed over to consumers through the developed app,” he said, adding that overbilling had been a major issue and the government had reimbursed billions of rupees to consumers charged in this regard.
Consumers can download the app from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store, the Power Division announced on X.
 






PTV fee removal
The prime minister also announced the removal of the Pakistan Television (PTV) fee from electricity bills.
Currently, consumers are charged a Rs35 monthly PTV fee through their electricity bills.
The PTV fee was a required charge in monthly electricity bills for years, however the government decided to abolish it to help households facing rising utility costs.
Vital reforms
The prime minister also highlighted that merit-based appointments have been made in the boards of power distribution companies (Discos) and that effective steps have been taken against corruption.
“Throughout Pakistan, vital reforms are introduced in the Discos boards where merit-based appointments are made,” he said.
PM also pointed to tough negotiations with independent power producers (IPPs) that led to a reduction in electricity prices by Rs7.5 per unit.
“We implemented ref­or­ms in the power sector but have a long way to go. We brought merit-based appoi­ntments in the boards of Discos, and took strong action against the corrupt mafia,” he said.
“We settled circular debt after negotiations with banks. When global oil prices were falling, we took advantage and reduced electricity prices,” he added.
PM Shehbaz identified power theft as the biggest remaining challenge, costing the country an estimated Rs500 billion annually.
He said strong efforts are underway to curb the menace.
The prime minister concluded by emphasising the government’s commitment to further reducing power tariffs for both industrial and household consumers and called for increased public awareness about the new app.
“It is a revolutionary technology, it will benefit every consumer in every home,” he said, urging the Power Division to raise awareness among consumers about the app.

• Relief worked out based on Nepra’s tariff determination, power purchase price, reduced subsidies under IMF deal
• Regulator to hold public hearing on Tuesday to consider Centre’s application
ISLAMABAD: The government wants to reduce the electricity price for consumers across the country starting July 1, it emerged on Sunday.
The federal government has filed a petition with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), requesting a Rs1.15 per unit reduction in the tariff.
The change would be applicable to all but lifeline domestic consumers.
The power division has advised against any change in electricity rates for the first two lifeline slabs of domestic consumers, as they were already over-subsidised.
Nepra has called a public hearing on July 1 to complete the formality before notification and application of the revised tariff.
According to the petition, the per unit rate for lifeline consumers with up to 50 units per month would remain unchanged at Rs3.95, followed by Rs7.74 for those in the 50 to 100 units range.
For all other consumers and categories, the government has sought a flat Rs1.15 per unit reduction for FY2025-26, but the relief ranges between 3 to 10 per cent depending on their respective rates at present.
For example, protected consumers in the 1 to 100 units range would now be charged at Rs10.54 per unit, instead of Rs11.69 at present, a reduction of 9.8pc.
The subsequent slab — from 101 to 200 units — in the protected category would be charged at Rs13.01 per unit instead of Rs14.16 per unit, down 8pc.
The non-protected consumers — those consuming more than 200 units — will be charged Rs23.44 instead of Rs23.59 per unit for the first 100 units, down by almost 5pc.
The reduction in rates for all other categories, including commercial, industrial, agriculture and bulk consumers would vary from 3 to 4pc but flat Rs1.15 per unit.
The average rate would come at around Rs31.60 per unit, down from about Rs32.75 per unit at present.
These rates have been worked out on the basis of Nepra’s tariff determinations for all distribution companies to meet their revenue requirements, aggregate power purchase prices in FY2025-26 and reduced subsidy allocations in the federal budget under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Nepra had determined Rs34 per unit national average tariff for FY2025-26 against Rs35.50 per unit this year.
 
 

The proposed tariff has been worked out after incorporating about 12.9pc lower subsidy allocation in the budget at Rs1.04 trillion for FY 2025-26 against Rs1.19tr in FY2024-25.
This includes an inter-Disco tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249.14bn in FY2025-26 against Rs276bn in the outgoing year, down 10pc.
Subsidy for tariff differential to tubewells in Balochistan will be Rs4bn in 2025-26, down from Rs 9.5bn in 2024-25.
The amount of subsidies for merged districts of KP and former Fata has been reduced by over 38pc to Rs40bn for FY 2025-26 from Rs 65bn for FY2024-25.
On the other hand, subsidy allocation for K-Electric has also been scaled down by 28pc, from Rs174bn in the outgoing fiscal year to Rs125bn for next year.
Likewise, the TDS for Azad Jammu and Kashmir has also been slashed by 31.5pc from Rs108bn this year to Rs74bn.
The subsidy allocation for Pakistan Energy Resolving Fund — meant to ensure timely payments to Chin­ese investors — has been protected at Rs48bn while TDS for the tribal region has been cut by 39pc from Rs65bn to Rs40bn instead.
However, a subsidy allocation of Rs400bn has been made in the budget, slightly higher than Rs394bn in FY2025-26.
The power division said its petition was in line with the National Electricity Policy, 2021 which provided under Clause 5.6.1 that the “financial sustainability of the sector is premised on the recovery of full cost of service, to the extent feasible, through an efficient tariff structure, which ensures sufficient liquidity in the sector”.
It said the proposed tariff was in line with the Nepra-determined rates for all Discos, the socio-economic objectives and budgetary targets.
The latest uniform tariff for Discos was set by Nepra through its determination dated July 13, 2024 that had been notified on July 14.
The Power Division said it had submitted to the federal cabinet on Saturday (June 28) the proposed uniform tariff.
Accordingly, the uniform tariff, being reflective of the federal government’s economic and social policy and based on the consolidated revenue requirement approved and determined by the regulator, was anticipated to receive unchanged approval.
The Power Division said the government will also maintain a uniform consumer-end tariff for K-Electric and Discos, even after their privatisation, through direct or indirect subsidies.
Accordingly, KE applicable uniform variable charge is required to be modified to recover the revenue requirements of KE determined by the Nepra in view of the proposed targeted subsidy and cross subsidies.

“We are building a state-of-the-art highway that meets all standards of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative. Tunnels and arch bridges will keep it straight and free of dangerous curves,” Amir Shafique, general manager of the Dasu hydropower project, told reporters on Sunday. 
The construction of the alternative KKH section within the Upper Kohistan district stretching from Kamila Bazaar to Summer Nullah is progressing well and, according to Wapda, is expected to be completed by 2026. 
“As the existing KKH will be submerged by the Dasu dam reservoir, the new section will meet Chinese standards. Even in case of landslides or flooding, traffic will continue to flow smoothly at full speed,” Mr Shafique said. 
He said that the 62km alternative section was part of the proposed 279km Thakot-Raikot route under the CPEC initiative, already approved by the Chinese government. 
“On this 62km section, 15 tunnels and nine bridges will be constructed to bring it up to international standards,” Mr Shafique said. 
He added that the KKH, a symbol of Sino-Pak friendship, was previously built around mountains and streams, and the new dual carriageway section will accommodate all types of traffic with enhanced safety and efficiency. 
Mr Shafique said work was well underway on state-of-the-art centenary box arch bridges at Louter (113 metres), Ocher Nullah (362 metres), Barseen (225 metres) and Dogah (78 metres) and reached various stages of completion and were expected to be wound up next year. 
“Previously, landslides and floods used to block traffic at these points for days or even weeks, but with the new route, such disruptions will no longer hamper the smooth flow of traffic,” he added. 
“This alternative section, which will also connect to the Hazara Expressway at Thakot, will be completed in two phases,” he said.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. According to rescue officials, at least 32 people have been killed across four provinces over the last two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses. Meanwhile, some people lost their lives due to electrocution.
On Sunday, Rescue 1122 issued a statement outlining more deaths and injuries in Lahore as a result of rain-related incidents.
“Rescue 1122 received 10 emergency calls about collapsing walls in different parts of the city,” the statement read. “One woman was killed and 10 others were seriously injured. They were moved to different hospitals and received medical aid in Rescue Emergency ambulances.”
The statement added that there were also reports of falling trees across Lahore due to strong winds and rain, however, there were no fatalities or injuries.
“Rescue 1122 staff are present at the highways and are removing fallen trees from the roads,” the statement added.
However, in a separate report, Rescue 1122 said that a billboard fell due to the intense rain and wind and fell on a motorcyclist and his family in Lahore.
According to Rescue 1122, the 50-year-old motorcyclist was killed, while his 35-year-old wife and child were injured, bringing the overall death toll to eight. The injured were transported to Jinnah Hospital.

In Karachi, two people, including the younger brother of former lawmaker and PPP Karachi leader Javed Nagori, were electrocuted in rain-related incidents, according to officials and relatives.
City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz told Dawn.com that Abdullah Anwar, 41, was sitting at a meeting place in Khadda Market near Sumair Arcade in Lyari, where an electric wire had fallen.
He said Anwar attempted to plug something into a rainwater-drenched wall socket when he suffered an electric shock and died. The SSP said the victim was dead with the wire in his hand when the police arrived.
The body was moved to the Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors confirmed the cause of death as an electric shock, said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
Nagori, while speaking briefly to Dawn.com, confirmed that the victim was his younger brother.
In another incident, a young man was electrocuted in the metropolis’ Clifton area. Boat Basin Police Station House Officer Malik Riaz Niazi said the man, in his early 30s, was passing by the Parklane Hospital when he apparently touched a wet electric pole and suffered an electric shock.
The body was moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Earlier in the day, rescue official Sherbaz Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that two sisters died after being swept away by flood waters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit Baltistan.
Meanwhile, in Punjab’s Sharifpura, two people were killed and one injured when the roof of a mud house collapsed. The bodies and the injured were shifted to Services Hospital, according to Rescue 1122.
Heavy rains were recorded in various districts of Punjab over the past 24 hours, according to Irfan Ali Kathia, Director General of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Lahore Airport recorded 65 mm of rain, while 32mm was recorded in Chakwal and 14mm in Dera Ghazi Khan 14. Rain was also recorded in Attock, Noorpur, Thal, Narowal, Kasur, Jhang, Toba, Tek Singh, Bhakkar and Khanewal.
“This spell of monsoon rain will likely continue until July 1,” Kathia was quoted as saying.
“Monsoon rains are also expected across most districts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said.
The DG urged citizens to take precautionary measures and stay in safe places during thunderstorms.
“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a reasonable distance. In case of emergency, contact PDMA helpline 1129.”
Wasa Lahore instructed to be on full alert amid heavy rainfall
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the Water and Sewage Authority (Wasa) to remain on full alert in Lahore as heavy rains and strong winds began in various parts of the city.
Rain was recorded in Lakshmi Chowk, Qurtaba Chowk, Mazang, Data Nagar, Islampura, Shahdara, Ek Moria, Bhati Gate, Baghbanpura and Gulshan Ravi.
The Punjab CM directed senior Wasa officials to keep all main highways and underpasses clear, with pumps and staff ready at all underpasses.
Instructions were issued to keep all generators on standby with their fuel supply ensured, while field teams were instructed to remain active.
 






It was recommended that disposal stations be run on generators in areas with power outages, with the pumps of all disposal stations being kept clean and operational.
All town directors were directed to maintain complete monitoring of their towns.
Glof warning issued in Gilgit
The GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and flash floods.
“Due to intense heat and the western weather system, the ice in the glaciers of GB is melting rapidly, resulting in an increased risk of glacial floods and flash floods.
 
 

“This situation can pose a serious threat to communication roads, bridges, agricultural lands and human life and property,” the alert said.
The public and tourists were requested to ensure their safety and avoid unnecessary travel in extreme or uncertain weather conditions.
They were also advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
“The public is urged to avoid staying unnecessarily on glaciers, river banks or bridges, cross floodwaters on foot or any vehicle, and remember the instructions issued by rescue agencies.”
The district administration reiterated in its alert that natural disasters can strike at any time, and necessary precautions should be undertaken.  “In case of any emergency, immediately contact the district control room at 920724-05811.”</p><small>2025-06-29 19:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/292312275f910f6.png?r=231328' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921034/indian-defence-attache-claims-paf-downed-indian-fighter-jets-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints' target='_blank'><strong>Indian defence attache claims PAF downed Indian fighter jets because of ‘political leadership’s constraints’</strong></a><br><p>An Indian defence attache has claimed that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) shot down six Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter aircraft “only because of the constraint given by the political leadership to not attack the military establishment or their air defences”, Indian news outlet The Wire reported on Sunday.
Earlier this month, the PAF confirmed that six IAF jets were shot down late on the night of May 7, after India launched missiles at six Pakistani sites, including in Sialkot and Bahawalpur, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Three of the downed fighters were French-made Dassault Rafales.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam in April — an allegation that Islamabad denied.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in Indonesia last month, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
 


During his presentation at the event, Kumar acknowledged the loss of Indian planes, though he said he “may not agree [with an earlier Indonesian speaker’s claim] that we lost so many aircraft”.
“After the loss, we changed our tactics and we went for the military installations. So, we first achieved suppression of enemy air defences and then that’s why all our attacks could easily go through using Brahmos missiles,” the Indian defence attache added, referring to Indian missile strikes on Pakistani bases on the night of May 9 and 10.
According to Kumar, IAF fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer. “It was possibly based on the premise that the Pakistan military would not target Indian fighter aircraft flying in the Indian airspace, when India was not hitting any Pakistani military targets.”
Kumar inferred that the restrictions imposed by New Delhi led to the loss of IAF jets since Pakistan “refused to impose any such limitations”.
“The political directions had meant that IAF had to carry out their missions while deliberately avoiding the most threatening enemy assets, which are typically prioritised in air campaigns to secure air superiority,” The Wire reported.
The Wire also reported that the Indian Embassy in Jakarta said Captain Kumar’s remarks had been “taken out of context” in a statement.
“We have seen media reports regarding a presentation made by the defence attache at a seminar. His remarks have been quoted out of context and the media reports are a misrepresentation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker,” The Wire wrote.
“The presentation conveyed that the Indian Armed Forces serve under civilian political leadership, unlike some other countries in our neighbourhood,” the outlet continued. “It was also explained that the objective of Operation Sindoor was to target terrorist infrastructure, and the Indian response was non-escalatory.”</p><small>2025-06-29 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/292155509b9b3d4.png?r=215650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921029/11-year-old-madressah-student-allegedly-raped-in-kps-shangla-police' target='_blank'><strong>11-year-old madressah student allegedly raped in KP’s Shangla: police</strong></a><br><p>An 11-year-old madressah student was allegedly molested by his seminary teacher in the Bisham area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district on Sunday evening.
According to Station House Officer (SHO) Syed Khurshid Ali, a complaint was filed and the victim’s statement was recorded, in which he alleged that he was sexually assaulted by his teacher and was injured.
“The complaint was registered by the victim’s uncle, and the suspect was arrested,” the SHO told Dawn.com.
“A first information report will be lodged under Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the CPA (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection Act), and a medical report will be obtained,” he added. “However, the victim provided us with bloodstained clothes, which indicate that he was assaulted.”
The SHO said that further investigation was underway.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.

The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
Shahid Khan, a spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police, told Dawn.com that the head of the Shahab Khel peace committee was heading to Qabol Khel when he was attacked in the Kara Wanda area.
“The peace committee chief Ghulam Dastagir alias Fauji and his friends Saleem Khan and Salahuddin were killed,” Shahid told Dawn.com. “A search operation was launched in the area after the incident.”
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted in the past by terrorists. In April, there were two incidents targeting peace committees, one of which was in Lakki Marwat.
On April 29, a fierce gun battle was reported between members of a local peace committee and suspects — who allegedly killed an elderly man and wounded his relatives — in the district’s Begukhel area.
Earlier in April, a blast at a peace committee office in the South Waziristan district on Monday killed at least seven people, police and health officials said.
Wana City police Station House Officer (SHO) Usman Nazir told Dawn.com that seven people were killed and 16 others were also injured in the blast, which took place around 11am on April 26.
“Five of the injured were in critical condition,” he said. “The peace committee office was the target, as there was a meeting going on there at the time of the explosion.”
The SHO added that peace committee member Saifur Rehman was injured in the attack, “but his condition was not critical”.</p><small>2025-06-29 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29181921ecf7bea.jpg?r=182049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921016/50pc-increase-in-fixed-gas-charges-notified-for-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>50pc increase in fixed gas charges notified for domestic consumers</strong></a><br><p>The government on Sunday notified a 50 per cent increase in fixed gas charges for domestic consumers, according to a notification from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
On Friday, the federal cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1. The ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift the partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.
According to the Ogra notification,  seen by Dawn.com, fixed charges for domestic consumers in the Protected category have risen to Rs600 from Rs400, while those in the non-protected category have to pay Rs1,500 as opposed to the previous charge of Rs1,000.
For non-protected consumers exceeding consumption of 1.5 cubic hectometres (hm³), the price has risen to Rs3,000 from Rs2,000.
Though the fixed charges have been increased, the price of gas itself has not risen, according to the notification. The sale prices for both Protected and Non-protected consumers remain the same. Additionally, gas prices for tandoors, commercial units, compressed natural gas and ice factories remain unchanged.
However, gas prices for general industries, power stations and independent power producers have risen.
Last month, Ogra determined about 6.6pc (Rs117 per unit) increase in prescribed natural gas prices to meet about Rs890 billion revenue requirement of the two gas companies during 2025-26.
In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.</p><small>2025-06-29 13:37</small></div><hr>
