The case, registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), Makran, accuses a seven-year-old boy of sharing the video of a speech by human rights activist Gulzar Dost in Turbat.
The boy was presented in a court on Thursday.
Officials said the controversial speech delivered by Mr Dost was shared on TikTok by the minor, which was a crime under the Anti Terrorism Act, since the orator was placed in the Fourth Schedule by the provincial government.
Mr Dost has been in detention for the last two weeks.
HRCP ‘appalled’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the action.
In a statement, the commission said it was “appalled” by reports that a minor has been presented before an anti-terrorism court on charges of “terrorism” for allegedly sharing the speech of a rights activist on social media.
The “misuse” of anti-terror laws reflected a “gross violation of child rights and due process”.
“We demand the immediate withdrawal of charges, a thorough review of the FIR and accountability for the officials responsible for this alarming overreach,” the HRCP statement added.

The proportion of people living in extreme poverty has risen from 4.9pc to 16.5pc. This revision, based on revised threshold, does not take into account the fallouts from the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 floods, and recent years’ phenomenal spike in cost of living, that may have pushed more people into poverty.
Meanwhile, per capita income has increased to $1,824 in FY25. But this rise conceals worsening income disparity across the country. These aren’t just statistics; they are a reflection of policy choices and an indictment of the country’s economic direction. It shows that our economic model is broken, necessitating a complete rethink of our economic strategy to fighting poverty.
Successive governments have poured billions into subsidies and relief programmes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), while neglecting growth, job creation, human development, and rural development. Poverty in Pakistan is not simply rising; it is being manufactured and maintained through decisions that entrench inequality and suppress opportunity.
BISP has played a crucial role in Pakistan’s social safety net by providing financial assistance to low-income families and vulnerable groups since 2008. In FY26, BISP allocation has been increased by 20pc to Rs 722bn (0.5pc of GDP) to expand coverage to 10m families. The quarterly stipend will increase from Rs13,500 to Rs14,500. While the government is striving to expand beneficiary coverage and improve transparency in fund distribution, the overall poverty reduction strategy needs a serious rethink, given limited fiscal space and the low-growth, low-investment trap.

Poverty in this country is the outcome of deliberate policy choices, neglect and systemic flaws.

Broadly speaking, the government needs focused policies to address critical issues directly affecting the public. The FY26 budget was directed at the IMF, business elites and government employees. There was no vision, strategy, or action plan to address economic stagnation, unemployment, poverty, inequality, or the country’s dismal state of human development.
Poverty in Pakistan is not just accidental. It is a consequence of deliberate policy choices, neglect and systemic flaws. For example, our farmers incurred Rs2.2 trillion losses in wheat production alone this year, jeopardising food security and reducing rural incomes. Agriculture, which accounts for 23pc of GDP, employs 37pc of the labour force, and contributes 60pc to export earnings, has been hit hard by climate shocks, plummeting prices, policy missteps and state neglect. Crop production fell by 13.5pc in FY25: cotton by 30.7pc, maize by 14.7pc, and wheat by 8.9pc. Fertiliser shortages during sowing seasons, removal of wheat support prices under IMF pressure, and abandonment of commodity procurement left farmers exposed to market volatility and exploitation by middlemen. Instead of ensuring a smooth policy transition and putting in place an alternative market mechanism to protect farmers, the government simply backed off. This underscores the lack of planning and blind implementation of IMF advice.
In a painful example of fiscal irresponsibility, the government has been increasing salaries and benefits of ministers, legislators, judges and bureaucrats. In a country scrambling for aid and barely managing debt repayments, such extravagance reflects a shocking disregard for the hardships faced by ordinary Pakistanis.
Likewise, our tax system perpetuates inequality. Salaried individuals contributed around Rs555bn in FY25, 51pc more than last year. Meanwhile, large retailers, landlords, speculators and grey-market earners remain untouched. The FBR’s Tajir Dost Scheme raised a mere Rs4m, against a Rs50bn target. Eminent economist Dr Hafeez Pasha estimates that the average real income of salaried individuals has declined by 30pc due to inflation and aggressive taxation.
Beyond the cynicism, let’s look at the global efforts to end extreme poverty, and to understand what works, and what doesn’t. Africa’s reliance on foreign aid offers a cautionary tale. Despite receiving billions in development assistance annually over decades — $53.5bn in 2022 alone — African countries are home to three-quarters of the world’s poor. Sub-Saharan Africa still has the highest number of people living in extreme poverty: 411m in 2023, 45pc up from 1990. Foreign aid has failed to eradicate poverty, highlighting the limitations of externally funded relief without structural reforms. Instead, Africa is drowning in debt.
In contrast, China, India and many Latin American countries pulled hundreds of millions out of poverty through sustained economic growth, institutional reforms and targeted support. China combined broad-based economic transformation with targeted assistance to disadvantaged regions and households, starting with agricultural reforms and later developing labour-intensive industries. India, the world’s fastest growing major economy over the last decade, more than doubled its GDP from $2.1tr in 2015 to $4.3tr in 2025, while investing in basic infrastructure such as toilets, clean water and electricity to uplift rural communities. Latin American countries, too, made significant progress by strengthening institutions, reducing inequality, and adopting sound policy frameworks.
Meanwhile, during the last three years, Pakistan has experienced negative per capita growth with GDP growth rate of -0.5pc in FY23, 2.5pc in FY45, and an estimated 2.68pc in FY25. Stabilisation without growth is becoming the country’s new normal and we can no longer afford it. It only exacerbates unemployment, poverty and inequality. With inflation easing and commodity sectors underperforming, we must use both fiscal and monetary policies to boost private investment and stimulate growth.
The 2023 digital census has shown startling gaps in literacy in rural Sindh, Balochistan and KP. Likewise, healthcare lacks adequate infrastructure and resources. Within provinces, there are substantial disparities between urban and rural areas, and between different districts. The government must focus on improving development outcomes in the districts that have the lowest development indicators.
The nations that have seen the most dramatic improvements in poverty reduction and other measures of human well-being have all focused on growth, economic reforms and targeted social protection policies. Pakistan must learn from these lessons. This will require sincere political will, a strong policy focus and coordination amongst the different tiers of government.

• Islamabad says agreement includes reduction of tariffs; diplomatic circles believe US will charge 15-20pc on Pakistani goods
• Trump rails against India, Russia; many countries still in a lurch as tariff deadline expires
WASHINGTON: A day after signing an agreement with the United States to develop “massive oil deposits” in Pakistani territory, Pakistani officials said the two nations had concluded a trade deal on Thursday, establishing a uniform tariff rate for bilateral trade.
“The agreement will result in a reduction of reciprocal tariffs, especially on Pakistani exports to the United States,” said an official statement released by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington.
In a statement issued in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called it “a landmark deal, which will enhance our growing cooperation and expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in the days to come”.
 






He also thanked US President Donald Trump “for his leadership role in finalising this historic US-Pakistan trade agreement”.
The embassy noted that the deal would boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
The breakthrough was reached during a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, along with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, in Washington. Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present.
President Trump announced the trade deal via a post on Truth Social, though he only mentioned the agreement to explore oil deposits. Similarly, the Pakistani statement placed more emphasis on the oil arrangement.
While Pakistan is celebrating the deal, the United States has yet to make an official statement regarding the agreement.
Moreover, while President Trump has mentioned specific tariff rates in announcements with other countries, he did not provide such details regarding the agreement with Pakistan.
However, diplomatic sources said the United States has agreed to charge a 15 to 20 per cent tariff on goods from Pakistan. The sources noted that the deal gives Islamabad an edge over India, which has been slapped with a 25pc tariff rate and penalised for buying weapons and oil from Russia and Iran.
The embassy noted that the deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration, especially in energy, mining and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors.
It complements Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to broaden the scope of Pakistan-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US state level. The agreement enhances Pakistan’s access to the US market — and vice versa.
The deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure and development projects.
“This trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties,” the official statement added.
‘Changing attitude in Washington’
Hours after announcing the oil exploration deal, President Trump posted another message on his official site, clearly expressing his frustration with India.
“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he wrote. “We have done very little business with India. Their tariffs are too high — among the highest in the world.”
 

Screengrab from Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump

Dr Aparna Pande, the director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute in Washington, told the New York Times that “for the first time in 35 years, [India] is faced with an American administration that is not driven by strategic altruism”.
The nuance in the bilateral relationship embraced by US presidents since Bill Clinton — because of India’s rising importance to America’s national security — “appears to be fading”, Dr Pande said.
Analysts and officials in New Delhi told the Times that the changing attitude in Washington “has disrupted a relationship built painstakingly over decades, one that recognised India’s balancing act in a difficult region dominated by China and Russia”.
India had been allowed to grow closer to the United States on its own terms and had taken a firmer stance on China, the report added.
Christopher Clary, associate professor of Political Science at the University at Albany, said in a social media post that “if you were to summarise the history of US-India and US-Pakistan ties, it would go something like this: India sometimes refuses to make positive-sum compromises out of principle, and Pakistan has often compromised — or at least pretended to compromise — to ensure positive ties with Washington.”
Other analysts argued that the discovery of vast deposits of rare earth materials and oil also caused the change in Washington’s thinking.
Some analysts also draw a parallel between recent developments in Iran and the shift in Washington, pointing out that Pakistan borders two sensitive countries, Afghanistan and Iran.
‘New world trade order’
Meanwhile, Trump’s dream of a new world trade order faced a crucial test on Thursday, with dozens of economies — including key commercial partners like Canada — yet to secure US tariff deals ahead of a midnight deadline.
The last-gasp scramble to strike bilateral accords came as an appeals court in Washington considered the legality behind Trump’s strategy of invoking emergency economic powers to declare sweeping duties on imports.
The 79-year-old Republican doubled down on the wide-ranging levies, posting on Truth Social: “Tariffs are making America GREAT & RICH Again”.

He insisted in a separate post that the world’s biggest economy would have “no chance of survival or success” without protectionist measures.
However, in a sign of flexibility, he announced on Friday that he was delaying a tariff hike on Mexican products originally due on Friday for 90 days after talks with counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum.
So far, Washington has announced pacts with Britain, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and the European Union, with those new rates expected to take effect Friday.
South Korea squeezed in a last-minute agreement on a 15pc tariff, significantly below the 25pc that Trump threatened on its goods.
But Trump announced 50pc tariffs on Brazilian products — while postponing imposition and allowing key exemptions — as an effort to pressure the US ally to drop its prosecution of right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro on coup charges.
He also unveiled a 25pc levy on Indian imports, and warned Canada it would face trade repercussions for planning to recognise a Palestinian state.
And the details of the agreements that have been made remain vague. For example, the EU, while having reached a pact, continues pushing for a carve-out for its wine industry.

Both sides claimed on Thursday that they have reached a deal. American President Donald Trump said it will help the two allies tap Pakistan’s “massive oil reserves”.
“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership,” he announced on social media. While the US president did not mention tariffs, Islamabad said the agreement would lead to a reduction in the steep reciprocal import taxes Washington had slapped on its exports under the so-called Liberation Day duties announced in April but temporarily suspended for 90 days to give room for trade talks. Pakistan faces a potential tariff of 29pc.
The country’s finance ministry said this deal signals “the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors”. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb described it as a win-win situation for both nations. While neither side gave too many details, Pakistani authorities expect the pact to boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster strategic cooperation.
The minister said: “From our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand.” The announcement came a day after Mr Trump slapped 25pc tariffs on imports from India to punish it for its Russian oil purchases. Therefore, the ‘symbolism’ of the pact is likely to matter more than the sketchy specifics of the agreement — especially the tariff reductions which Islamabad claims to have secured.
That said, the deal reflects a willingness on the part of the leadership of the two countries to recalibrate their transactional security-focused relationship in favour of a greater focus on strategic trade and investment ties. This surprise turn in bilateral relations should send a positive signal to foreign investors, especially American firms, which have so far been reluctant to bring their capital to Pakistan due to the chill in relations for the last several years.
Whether or not Mr Trump plans to convert his energy cooperation rhetoric into action will only be known after a final tariff deal is announced. Islamabad is seeking a substantial reduction in reciprocal tariffs from 29pc to 15-20pc, on a par with other recent US trade agreements, particularly with Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. But Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar believes that Pakistan should be fine “as long as we are better than or equal to our peers”. A favourable tariff deal is critical for us as the US is our single largest export market. The deal will also determine the future direction of economic and investment cooperation between both states.

Clearly not. How do societies ensure that the people abide by the law when there is little fear of being caught in the absence of the law-enforcement officer? Through ethics, community standards and the fear of being thought ill of.
For instance, you are alone on a street where a fancy car is parked. You see a Rs5,000 note lying on the front seat of the car. Will you break the window of the car to get it? No one else is visible on the street and there are no video cameras either. So, the probability of being caught is zero. Would you break the window to get the note? Some might. Others might not. The reasons will vary.
Some might feel they have nothing to lose as they will not be caught and the broken window is not their problem, while they would gain Rs5,000. So, they may go ahead and break the window. If they are desperate for the money, it will add to their reasons for doing so. Others might feel that Rs5,000 is just too small an amount to justify the effort and perceived risk. But they could change their mind if the amount were Rs50,000. There would be others who would not take the money because of the fear of being caught, out of habit, or for religious and ethical reasons.
What sort of society should we aim for? A society that follows its self-interest and only deviates from it when there is fear of law or punishment? Everyone is ready to break the window; they only refrain if a policeman is present or if they fear being caught and punished. Clearly, such a society would be a terrible one to live in, even if it were possible to have a ‘society’ like this.

When norms are violated, the first response is to look towards strengthening the law.

Take the example of a society that has some focus on community and a sense of belonging; it is one in which individuals are brought up with a sense of citizenship and community rights and responsibilities. It does not mean this society would be without laws or their enforcement but that a lot of the societal interactions would be based on the norms of the community and the ways of doing things. The law would be enforced as a measure of last resort. The examples of how citizens behave in Japan, Europe or traditional societies and tribes can be taken from societies with strong norms, which are invested in seeing the latter internalised in their population — this may be implemented for the younger people through education systems and parental and community guidance.
In this country, over the last few decades, we have been sliding in the other direction. When norms are found to be inadequate for addressing certain issues, or when they are violated, the first response is to look towards strengthening the law or its enforcement. If people do not wear helmets when driving motorcycles, let us fine them. If they still do not comply, let us raise the fine and strictly enforce it. If it still does not work, how about lodging FIRs against them and locking up vehicles and so on? And all this is for what? For the protection of the person who is driving the motorcycle and the people around him or her. We might achieve compliance this way eventually, but will compliance then become the norm? The moment enforcement lags, and we have seen it happen a number of times, people start to ignore the law.
Take the example of speeding on the Motorway. Fines were imposed — the Motorway Police was quite good at this. But then, things became lax and many people started to drive fast. Fines were hiked, but that was found to be inadequate, so now, if you drive above a certain limit, an FIR is registered against you and you can be arrested and your car can be impounded.
We can see this in the realm of expression as well — in both physical space and online. Norms were not enough to deter excesses when protests took place and people let their views be known on online forums. What was the solution? The social media platform X was shut down for a long period. And laws were made stricter, with their enforcement now on steroids. This has, of course, not solved the issue; in fact, it cannot solve the issue.
Underlying issues need to be addressed and we have to learn how to disagree with each other and manage this disagreement. Every time a person expresses anger against the government, a department of the state, or individuals in the government or departments, it is not disloyalty, not grounds for persecution and definitely not a reason for a ‘software update’ — the ugly term we have coined for abduction, torture and destruction of an individual’s human dignity.
Where does society go from here? Once we have set off in the direction of invoking the law and ensuring its enforcement, the importance of norms is reduced. Thus norms become weaker. So, the use of the law is not norm-neutral. Escaping from the vicious cycle of infringements of norms, stricter law and enforcement, weaker norms, more infringements and even stricter laws, gets harder and harder. We are already caught in more than one cycle in some of the areas mentioned.
Can we reverse the trend? It will take a major social and political upheaval to change things. And the upheaval will have to dislodge beneficiaries of the current system to allow reconfiguration. The current beneficiaries will, of course, continue to resist. So, for the foreseeable future, we will see the continuation of a vicious cycle.

• NHA gets flak for awarding Carec project contract to joint venture led by ‘disqualified’ firm
ISLAMABAD: The top-priority Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway project will start in April next year, the National Highway Authority (NHA) informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Communications.
“We will start the project by April next year,” NHA Chairman Sheharyar Sikandar told the meeting, chaired by MNA Ijaz Jakhrani on Thursday.
In his briefing to the NA panel on Thursday, the NHA chairman said the project would be financed by the Islamic Development Bank, adding that the advance procurement approval from the bank had been requested, with land acquisition expected to commence within a month.
It may be noted that there is ambiguity about the timeline of this project, which has already faced delays.
In June this year, Communications Minister Aleem Khan said the much-needed road project would start this year but did not specify if he was referring to the financial year or the calendar year.
Similarly, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, acknowledging the importance of the vital artery, said the work on the top-priority project would “begin next year”. He made this statement in February, but did not specify whether he meant the fiscal year or calendar year.
Meanwhile, the committee expressed displeasure over the absence of the communications ministry’s secretary, warning that future instances of non-attendance would be brought before the house and the privilege committee for appropriate action.
Toll tax revisions
The committee also expressed concerns about the third revision in toll tax within a short period, which appeared to contravene its policy of revising the tax every three years. The committee deemed this repeated increase against the public interest and directed the NHA to submit a detailed justification at the next meeting.
The motorway police chief also briefed the committee on the legal framework under which FIRs were being registered against motorists exceeding the 150 km/h speed limit, saying the practice had the cover of Section 279 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) relating to fast and negligent driving. It was noted that since the enforcement of this law, the casualties on the motorway had significantly decreased over the past five months.
The committee asked for a review, suggesting the replacement of corporal punishment with stricter financial penalties and possible licence suspensions.
Meanwhile, a calling-attention notice, moved by a member regarding the presence of two toll plazas within a five-kilometre stretch on the M-9 Motorway, termed it contradictory to the existing policy that mandated a minimum distance of 35km between two toll plazas.
The NHA responded that a major bridge was located at that point, and under current policy, toll plazas were permitted at each major bridge regardless of the distance. The committee directed the NHA to submit a list of all bridges where toll plazas had been installed.
The committee was further informed that the Karachi Northern Bypass would be a part of the M-10 project, which would resolve the congestion issues faced by Karachi.
Carec project
The NA committee also discussed the issue of alleged wrongdoing in the bidding process of the Rs170 billion Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (Carec) Tranche-III corridor project, as all four contracts had been awarded to a firm previously disqualified by the NHA.
The committee members reprimanded the NHA for allegedly favouring a joint venture of the Chinese firm Ningxia Communication Construction (NXCC) and two local firms. The NXCC was disqualified in 2023 for allegedly failing to complete a previous project.
Since the matter is already being scrutinised by the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division, the body decided to write to the Senate committee to seek the findings of its sub-committee.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani satellite has been successfully launched from China’s Xichang Satellite Launch Center, the national space agency announced on Thursday.
The Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (PRSS-1), aboard a Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket, was launched at 10am (GMT+8) on Thursday.
It has successfully entered its preset orbit, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has said.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said the new Remote Sensing Satellite will be a major milestone in Pakistan’s space exploration efforts and strengthen its position in Earth observation capabilities.

Celestial object to help in urban planning, disaster management, food security, ecology protection

“The Remote Sensing Satellite will provide imaging capabilities to revolutionise urban planning, disaster management, food security, and environmental protection. It will also greatly aid in monitoring climate change, managing water resources, mapping agricultural patterns and tracking deforestation,” said the space agency.
 
 

The launch was a result of the collaboration between Suparco, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and MICROSAT China.
The satellite will support precision agriculture to boost crop yields, monitor infrastructure growth and urban expansion, and enable more effective regional planning.
It will also enhance disaster management efforts by providing timely warnings for floods, landslides, and earthquakes, while tracking glacier recession and deforestation.
Suparco Chairman Muhammad Yousaf Khan said the satellite would support national priorities across multiple sectors and will contribute towards sustainable socio-economic development.
It will contribute to national development initiatives such as CPEC by mapping transportation networks and identifying geohazard risks, Suparco said.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who witnessed the launch ceremony as the chief guest, said the event was not only a technological milestone, but a “moment that lifts our national spirit and elevates our friendship with China”.
The Chinese embassy in Pakistan congratulated the country on the satellite’s launch.
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Suparco on the successful launch and thanked Chinese partners for their contributions to the project.

GAZA: Palestinians rush towards aid packages being airdropped over the besieged enclave.—Reuters

• Portugal to also weigh recognition
• Trump’s envoy meets Netanyahu, will head to Gaza today
• US imposes sanctions on Palestinian Authority, PLO officials
OTTAWA: Canada plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September, Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Wednesday, a major policy shift that drew an angry response from US President Donald Trump and was rejected by Israel.
Meanwhile, Portugal will also consider whether to recognise the State of Palestine at the UN in September, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro’s office said on Thursday.
Carney said the move was necessary to preserve hopes of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a long-standing Canadian goal that was “being eroded before our eyes”.
“Canada intends to recognise the State of Palestine at the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025,” the prime minister said.
This makes Canada — a G7 nation — the third country, following recent announcements by France and the United Kingdom, to signal plans to recognise a Palestinian state in September.
Israel blasted Canada’s announcement as part of a “distorted campaign of international pressure”, while Trump warned that trade negotiations with Ottawa may not proceed smoothly.
“Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them.”

Asked by reporters if there was a scenario where Canada could change its position before the UN meeting, Carney said: “There’s a scenario (but) possibly one that I can’t imagine.”
Canada’s intention “is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to much-needed reforms,” Carney said, referring to the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which has civil authority in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Meanwhile, Portugal Prime Minister Montenegro’s office said in a statement that the country “is considering recognition of the Palestinian state, as part of a procedure that could be concluded during the high-level week of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, to be held in New York in September”,

Separately, Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff held talks in Israel on Thursday on ways to end the crisis in Gaza, where nearly 22 months of grinding war and dire shortages of food have drawn mounting international criticism.
Witkoff, who has been involved in months of stalled negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after his arrival, the Israeli leader’s office said.
Witkoff and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee will also enter Gaza on Friday (today) to inspect aid distribution and meet with residents of the war-wracked territory.
Sanctions on Palestinian Authority
The US imposed sanctions on Pales­tinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) on Thursday, accusing them of undermining peace efforts with Israel.
The State Department said it would deny visas for travel to the US by those it was targeting, although it did not name any specific individuals.
The PA and PLO serve as representatives for the Palestinian people and have long pushed for recognition of a Palestinian state by international organisations and foreign nations. The two groups had no immediate comment on the US move.

• Medvedev brushes aside Trump’s attack
NEW DELHI: By declaring the Indian economy as dead in the water on Thursday, President Donald Trump has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
 
 

The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Mr Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end. Encouraging words have come from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who poohpoohed Mr Trump’s vitriol and continued to see a world in good cheer despite the US president’s hissed warnings.
On the other hand, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was sanguine that Trump was right at least about the state of the Indian economy. “He [Trump] is right. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy, except the prime minister and the finance minister. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact.
“The whole world knows – India’s economy is a dead economy and the BJP has destroyed the economy. Why did they destroy it? To help Adani,” said Mr Gandhi while speaking to reporters outside the parliament on Thursday.
Mr Gandhi was carefully silent about India’s Russia ties. The reference to tycoon Gautam Adani seemed more severe as the billionaire businessman close to Mr Modi is facing a corruption case in the US.
Rahul Gandhi’s statement came hours after Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that a 25 per cent tariff, plus a penalty, will be imposed on India starting Aug 1. The Modi government has responded to it saying that it “will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest”.
Later on Wednesday, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Medvedev’s ‘unmoved’
In Moscow, Mr Medvedev responded to Trump’s comments with studied calm, saying they were “nervous reaction” and are evidence that Moscow is pursuing the right path.
The US president had described Medvedev as a “failed” former leader and warned him to “watch his words”, adding that Medvedev was “entering very dangerous territory”.
Medvedev was unmoved. “If some words from the former president of Russia trigger such a nervous reaction from the high-and-mighty president of the United States, then Russia is doing everything right and will continue to proceed along its own path,” Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, wrote on social media.
He also ridiculed Trump’s claim that the Russian and Indian economies were “dead” and going “down together” due to lack of cooperation with the US.
Medvedev had earlier dismissed Trump’s demands for Moscow to swiftly end its military campaign against Ukraine, calling the threats of secondary sanctions against Russian energy customers “theatrical” and ineffective.
Trump previously criticised the BRICS group of nations, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and several other states, for pursuing a new multipolar world order. The US president claimed proposed tariffs on countries doing business with BRICS members could cripple the organisation.
Trump’s statement regarding India and Medvedev followed New Delhi’s refusal to accommodate US demands on trade.
Mr Gandhi said that the Modi government had “destroyed India’s economic, defence and foreign policy. They are running this country into the ground”.

BANNU: Smoke billows from an alleged terrorist hideout, which was destroyed by security personnel during an intelligence-based operation.—Dawn

LAKKI MARWAT: At least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu district on Thursday amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area.
A police official said a joint intelligence-based operation was launched by police, security forces and Counter-Terrorism Depar­tment (CTD) commandos targeting terrorists in the Miryan police station area. The operation followed intelligence about the presence of “Fitna al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — in the region.
“During the aerial att­a­ck, a quadcopter dropped explosives on the police station, causing an explosion that left two army soldiers, three CTD personnel and one police constable inju­red,” the police official said.

The wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital and the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu.

Miryan police station targeted by aerial strike

The official said the ongoing security operation has resulted in the destruction of several terrorist hideouts. Law enforcement personnel have set up barriers and cordons at various points in the area, carrying out raids and strikes on terrorist hideouts.
The operation came after the presence of over 200 terrorists in the Miryan police station area had caused panic among residents of Nurar five days ago. Armed groups of Fitna al-Khawarij militants roamed the streets, forcing local businesses to shut down and prompting civilians to stay indoors, halting all business activity.
 
 

“The timely and effective actions of law enforcement have forced the terrorists to flee the area,” the police official said, adding that targeted operations continue to ensure the terrorists are arrested and eliminated.
Residents of the area described the situation as curfew-like, with business activities halted as a result of the security operation. Bazaars and markets were closed and many villagers stayed indoors.
Reports indicated that loudspeakers in local mosques issued warnings in the early hours of Thursday, urging residents to stay at home and cooperate with the security forces conducting the operation.
Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed that the region would be purged of terrorists at all costs. He emphasised the police’s commitment to taking firm action against anti-law elements to restore peace to the area. He said terrorists have suffered heavy casualties during ongoing operations.
RPO Khan also visited the hospital to check on the injured personnel and praised their bravery.
The RPO directed the hospital management to ensure high-standard treatment for the inju-red officers.

According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), the heavy rainfall led to flooding in Khatam village in Ghizer’s Gupis Valley, blocking the Ghizer-Shandur Road and damaging agricultural land and private properties.
The floodwaters also caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The Gilgit-Baltistan government has declared 37 villages across the region as calamity-hit areas. According to a notification issued by the GB Home and Prisons Department, the affected areas include 12 villages in Diamer, nine in Gilgit, five in Ghizer, four each in Skardu and Shigar, two in Ghanche, and one each in Nagar and Kharmang.
 
 

GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement that the recent floods across Gilgit-Baltistan have caused an estimated Rs20 billion in damages. The floods have destroyed infrastructure, homes, agricultural land and public utilities.
Mr Faraq added that 22 vehicles were swept away by the floods, while 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives. Four individuals have sustained injuries and between 10 and 15 tourists are still missing. Search operations are currently underway.
Over 500 homes and agricultural land, crops, roads, bridges and both public and private infrastructure have been significantly damaged.
The Gilgit-Baltistan government has initiated emergency and rehabilitation operations across the affected areas.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.

Judge Abual Hasanat Mohammad Zulqarnain expressed displeasure over the continued non-appearance of the accused despite repeated summons, expanding the list of warrants in a case registered at the Karachi Company Police Station on Nov 26, 2024.
The order added 41 PTI leaders to nine others already facing similar orders.
Among the prominent figures now liable to be arrested are KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur; Senators Shibli Faraz, Azam Khan Swati and Faisal Javed; and former National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser.
The list also includes senior lawyers Salman Akram Raja and Shoaib Shaheen; PTI Information Secretary Raoof Hassan; former federal ministers Murad Saeed and Hammad Azhar; MNA Omar Ayub Khan; and Aleema Khan, a sister of the party’s jailed founder, Imran Khan.
The development comes a week after a separate anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi issued arrest warrants for Alvi and other prominent figures, including Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, in multiple cases connected to the same Nov 26 protests.
Judge Amjad Shah of the Rawalpindi court also cited the repeated failure of the accused to appear before the court.
According to court documents, several individuals named in the cases have not been arrested.

• Committee discusses bill to establish legal, ethical framework for AI regulation
ISLAMABAD: A Senate standing committee on on Thursday questioned the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication over its apparent collaboration with a mobile service provider and a public sector university in a project that aims to develop an indigenous Large Language Model (LLM).
LLMs are trained on immense amount of data to make them capable of generating responses based on the input prompt. They are at the back of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek.
The IT ministry has collaborated with Jazz and the National University of Sciences and Technology to produce Pakistan’s first LLM.
Chaired by Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecommunication expressed concern that the ministry had apparently excluded other capable players from academia and industry.
 
 

Senator Humayun Mohmand took the lead in grilling ministry officials. “Why were other telecom companies and technical universities not invited to participate?” he asked.
Responding to the criticism, the IT secretary clarified they had not formally selected Jazz and Nust, rather both entities had independently launched the initiative and were self-financing it.
“No public funds are involved,” he assured the committee.
Nonetheless, Senator Mohmand recommended that the opportunity be publicly advertised to invite open participation from other stakeholders — a proposal the Secretary accepted, adding that universities across the country were now being invited to express interest.
![ .]https://www.dawn.com/news/1924070)
To justify their involvement in the venture, representatives from Jazz made a presentation before the committee, underscoring that many native languages in Pakistan are on the verge of extinction. They said the LLM initiative was aimed at preserving the country’s rich linguistic heritage, though they admitted data collection remains a significant hurdle.
The Jazz delegation subsequently left the meeting after cross-questioning from lawmakers.
Senator Mohmand also expressed the concern that the mobile company could have an unfair advantage in the field, given its association with the ministry.
Acknowledging these concerns, IT secretary assured the committee that future projects will ensure transparency and open participation for all stakeholders.
Regulation of AI bill
The committee also held detailed deliberations on the proposed ‘Regulation of Artificial Intelligence Bill, 2024,’ introduced by Senator Afnan Ullah Khan.
The legislation seeks to establish a legal and ethical framework for AI development in Pakistan amid growing global adoption of intelligent technologies. Committee members stressed the urgency of such regulation to ensure responsible and safe AI deployment.
The ministry also revealed that a newly established Emerging Technology Wing has been assigned the task of accelerating work in four high-priority domains: AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.
In response to a query from Senator Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee regarding financial feasibility, the IT secretary confirmed that Rs16 billion had been allocated under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for FY2024–25 to support these efforts.
The meeting also featured a briefing by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency on a sweeping crackdown on illegal call centers operating across the country.
The committee was informed that 54 call centers were raided, resulting in the arrest of 254 individuals, with Islamabad emerging as the hotspot.

• Opposition alliance TTAP condemns ‘kangaroo courts’
• Ministers call it ‘timely and commendable decision’
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The op­­­­­position PTI on Thursday rejec­ted the verdict of a special anti-terrorism court (ATC) as a politically-motivated “travesty of justi­­ce”, after several senior party lea­ders were sentenced to 10 years in prison for their role in the May 9 riots.
In a sharply-worded statement, a PTI spokesperson condemned the ruling, calling it “one of the darkest chapters in the country’s judicial history and nothing short of a judicial murder”.
He described the conviction of PTI leaders and workers as a “hasty, one-sided, and politically motivated trial—an utterly failed and desperate attempt to crush the unwavering resolve of PTI’s leadership and loyal workers”.
The party claimed the convictions were “acts of revenge” and said the timing was designed to stifle a nationwide protest plan­ned for 5 August. He added that this ‘sham decision’ sentenced six National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members, and one senator, calling it a grave violation of the Constitution and dark stain on the face of justice, as well as a global embarrassment.
“This is the first time opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced solely based on their loyalty to the unlawfully incarcerated PTI Patron-in-chief Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation and constitutional struggle,” the spokesperson said.
However, PTI spokesperson categorically said that these campaigns of oppression and suppression would neither intimidate nor weaken their resolve.
Instead, he added, such coercive and brutal tactics would only fuel their determination as they prepare for the nationwide protests scheduled for Aug 5.
Opposition alliance
The party’s condemnation was echoed at an All Parties Confere­nce convened by the Tehreek-i-Tah­af­fuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), a coalition of opposition groups.
In a joint statement, the TTAP called Thursday “another black day in the political and democra­tic history of Pakistan,” and appe­aled to the country’s chief justice to intervene, warning that the verdicts posed a “question mark on Pakistan’s judicial system”.
 
 

“We completely reject the verdicts of these kangaroo courts and condemn them,” the statement read. “This once again makes it clear that the government, which stan­­ds on the crutches of the establishment, and this hybrid system want the complete elimination of the opposition in the country,” it added.
In Lahore, PTI Punjab media head Shayan Bashir called the ruling a “massacre of law, justice, and the Constitution”, and vowed that the party’s protest would go ahead regardless of the government’s actions.
“Even if they arrest the party’s entire leadership, people will shut down Pakistan on August 5 and fight till the last drop of their blood for the true leader,” he said.
Ministers welcome verdict
The government, however, welcomed the sentences as a necessary step to uphold the rule of law.
Punjab’s information minister, Azma Bokhari, said the verdict sent a “clear and strong message to those with anti-state agendas that such actions will no longer be tolerated”.
She insisted that inciting atta­cks on state institutions was “an intolerable offence” and that “terrorism under the guise of political activism must come to an end”.
Federal information minister Attaullah Tarar, in a televised address, hailed the court’s decision as a “victory of the law” and accused PTI supporters of orchestrating attacks on military installations, government property, and law enforcement personnel.
“The trial that took place for this was a very fair trial,” Mr Tarar said, adding that the process included cross-examinations, witness testimonies, and the presentation of evidence.

The plan was approved at a meeting of the civil and military leadership on Thursday.
The meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. It was also attended by the chief of army staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn the prime minister addressed the meeting, which was covered by the media, and followed by a closed-door session.

High-level meeting finalises strategy to eliminate threat posed by terrorists

“The meeting decided how the next phase of the National Action Plan can be implemented,” the source said, while referring to the counterinsurgency plan made after the horrific attack on Peshawar’s Army Public School in 2014 in which over 140 children were killed.
Under the strategy, people from all segments of society will be taken on board to play their role in eradicating terrorism and extremism.
The meeting also discussed the repatriation plan for Afghan refugees and decided to expedite the process, the source added.
According to an official press release, PM Shehbaz said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the threat posed by menace posed by the proscribed Fitna al-Khawarij — the official term for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — and other militant outfits.
“Pakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate Fitna al-Hindustan, Fitna al-Khawarij and other such anti-social elements,” the prime minister said.
 
 

The prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” to use ground operations, legislation and meaningful public communication discouraging extremist thinking.
The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments and strictly implement the recommendations.
PM Shehbaz lauded the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies who have taken “very effective steps” in the war against terrorism.
“With the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,” he said.
The prime minister said only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level.

Puran Circle Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Usman Munir told Dawn.com: “The young girls had gone to the river to fetch water for domestic use, but suddenly, due to the fast flow of the river, the sand and mud collapsed and swept them away,” adding that the incident occurred in the Kamach area.
He said one of the girls was rescued by some residents present at the river’s bank in the area.
The SDPO said a search operation was launched in the area by Rescue 1122, but the flow of water in the river was too high.
Ibadullah Khan, a local activist, said that there was no Rescue 1122 outpost in the area. “Locals had no alternative source of potable water but to fetch it from the river and such accidents were common in the area”, he said.
On Wednesday, at least four people drowned, and one child went missing after a seven-seater van fell into a rain drain in Punjab’s Attock district, according to Rescue 1122.

Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
In a press release issued today, the Finance Division stated that the price of petrol was set at Rs264.61 per litre and that of HSD at Rs285.83 per litre.
It added that it decided on these new rates “following a review of prevailing international market trends” and upon the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
Sources had previously said that after four consecutive hikes, petrol and diesel prices were expected to fall by about Rs9 and Rs3.50 per litre, owing to lower international oil prices and reduced import premiums.
Based on prevailing tax rates, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to decline by around Rs9 per litre (3.3 per cent), while HSD was expected to see a reduction of Rs3.50 per litre (1.3pc), depending on final cost calculations.
According to informed sources, global oil prices softened slightly over the past fortnight, while the import premium on petrol dropped by nearly one-third — from about $9.70 to $6.75 per barrel — as regional tensions eased.
The government is currently collecting about Rs98 per litre on both petrol and diesel through various levies, despite maintaining a zero rate of general sales tax (GST) on all petroleum products. This includes Rs77.01 per litre on diesel and Rs78.02 per litre on petrol and high-octane products as petroleum levy and climate support levy (CSL), of which Rs2.25 per litre is attributed to CSL alone.
In addition, Rs20-21 per litre is being charged as customs duty on both fuels, regardless of whether they are imported or locally refined. Distribution and dealer margins account for another Rs17 per litre.
Petrol and HSD remain the government’s main petroleum revenue sources, with combined monthly sales of around 700,000-800,000 tonnes. In contrast, kerosene demand stands at just 10,000 tonnes per month. The government collected Rs1.161 trillion through petroleum levy in 2024-25 and projects a 27pc increase — reaching Rs1.470tr — in the current fiscal year.
Ogra slashes LPG price by Rs17.7 per kg
Earlier, Ogra reduced the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs17.7 per kilogramme.
Last month, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of LPG by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1 per cent for July. The new price for 11.8kg cylinder was Rs2,750.6 for July, against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said that the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.
In a notification from the regulator today, available with Dawn.com, Ogra set the new consumer price for an 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,541.36 for August, compared to Rs2,750.6 last month. The maximum consumer price for LPG per kg was set at Rs215.37.
These prices will go into effect on August 1 (Friday).
The prices “shall be regulated as the maximum LPG price at all levels of the supply chain for indigenous as well as imported LPG”, Ogra said.
The notification also showed that the new producer price for an 11.8kg cylinder stood at Rs2,054.02.
This is the third month in a row where LPG prices have fallen, with an 11.8kg cylinder costing Rs2,892.91 in May, Rs2,838.31 in June and Rs2,750.6 in July.
Earlier this month, a parliamentary panel expressed concern over the “poor regulatory environment” in the petroleum sector, observing that lives were in danger after an official disclosure that almost half of a total of 2,000 bowsers handling LPG have not been registered anywhere.
Of an estimated 2,000 bowsers in operation, only 800 are registered with the Department of Explosives and just 247 have licences issued by Ogra. This points to a significant oversight lapse, the participants observed.</p><small>2025-07-31 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/312301520230288.jpg?r=230546' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927843/indian-state-refiners-pause-russian-oil-purchases-in-wake-of-trump-warning' target='_blank'><strong>Indian state refiners pause Russian oil purchases in wake of Trump warning</strong></a><br><p>Indian state refiners have stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed this month and United States President Donald Trump warned countries not to purchase oil from Moscow, industry sources said.
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The country’s state refiners — Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Mangalore Refinery Petrochemical Ltd (MRPL)  — have not sought Russian crude in the past week or so, four sources familiar with the refiners’ purchase plans told Reuters.
IOC, BPCL, HPCL, MRPL and the federal oil ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The four refiners regularly buy Russian oil on a delivered basis and have turned to spot markets for replacement supply — mostly Middle Eastern grades such as Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude and West African oil, sources said.
Private refiners Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy, majority owned by Russian entities, including oil major Rosneft, have annual deals with Moscow and are the biggest Russian oil buyers in India.
On July 14, Trump threatened 100 per cent tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine.
Indian refiners are pulling back from Russian crude as discounts shrink to their lowest since 2022, when Western sanctions were first imposed on Moscow, due to lower Russian exports and steady demand, sources said.
Refiners fear the latest EU curbs could complicate overseas trade, including fundraising — even for buyers adhering to the price cap. India has reiterated its opposition to “unilateral sanctions”.
Trump on Wednesday announced a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India from August 1, but added that negotiations were ongoing. He also warned of potential penalties for the purchase of Russian arms and oil.
On Monday, Trump cut the deadline to impose secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian exports to 10-12 days from the previous 50-day period, if Moscow does not agree to a peace deal with Ukraine.
Russia is the top supplier to India, responsible for about 35pc of India’s overall supplies.
Private refiners bought nearly 60pc of India’s average 1.8 million barrels per day of Russian oil imports in the first half of 2025, while state refiners that control over 60pc of India’s overall 5.2m bpd refining capacity bought the remainder.

Dahlmeier was confirmed dead on Wednesday, having been hit by falling rocks while climbing at an altitude of 5,700 metres on Laila Peak in the Karakoram range.
Attempts to recover her body were abandoned due to “dangerous” conditions at the site, Dahlmeier’s management agency said on Thursday.
In consultation with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the agency said her relatives would “continue to monitor the situation … and are keeping the option of arranging a rescue at a later date”.
Several of Dahlmeier’s colleagues confirmed the two-time Olympic gold medallist had said she did not want her body recovered if it put any would-be rescuers at risk.
German mountaineer Thomas Huber was part of a team that had attempted a rescue but told reporters on Thursday: “We have decided she should stay, because that was her wish.”
Another member of the rescue team, American Jackson Marvell, told AFP it would be “disrespectful” to recover her body contrary to her wishes.
Marvell said, “The recovery of Laura’s body will be possible, but it involves incredible risks, both on foot and by helicopter.”
Dahlmeier’s climbing partner, Marina Krauss, who was with her at the time of the incident, said at a press conference on Thursday that the former Olympian did not move after being caught in a rockfall.
“I saw Laura being hit by a huge rock and then being thrown against the wall. And from that moment on, she didn’t move again,” Krauss told reporters.
Krauss said she was unable to reach Dahlmeier and called for outside support.
“It was impossible for me to get there safely.
“It was clear to me that the only way to help her was to call a helicopter. She didn’t move, she didn’t show any signs [of movement]. I called out to her, but there was no response.”
“She only had a chance if help arrived immediately,” she said.
Dahlmeier won seven world championship gold medals, and at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, she became the first woman biathlete to win both the sprint and the pursuit at the same Games.
Dahlmeier retired from professional competition in 2019 at the age of 25.</p><small>2025-07-31 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31204259f518929.jpg?r=213042' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927838/govt-acting-on-comprehensive-and-effective-strategy-to-completely-eliminate-terrorist-outfits-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Govt acting on comprehensive and effective strategy to completely eliminate terrorist outfits: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the menace posed by the proscribed Fitna-al-Hindustan, Fitna-al-Khawarij and other terrorist outfits to the country.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
In response, the government labelled the group as Fitna-al-Khawarij and directed use of the term khariji for attackers. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier chaired a meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) today at the PM House. The meeting was attended by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Muhammad Asim Malik, PM aide Rana Sanallah, the four provincial chief secretaries and police chief, ministers and officials.
“Pakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate Fitna al Hindustan, Fitna al Khawarij and other such anti-social elements,” the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
He said the state was determined to eradicate and uproot the scourge of terrorism, adding that even the world recognised Pakistan’s successful operations against terrorists.
 






The prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” in the war against terrorism and made “full and effective use” of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.
The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement the recommendations of the committee in this regard.
Lauding the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies, he said the provincial governments, Intelligence Bureau, Ministry of Interior and Counter-Terrorism Department had taken “very effective steps” in the war against terrorism.
“With the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,” he said, adding that preventing the issue had a positive impact on the economy.
The prime minister said that only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level, adding that the government had brought substantial changes, such as the digitisation of all systems and improvement in the tax system, for this end.
Pointing to the performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, he said the record increase in its index and the improvement in the country’s global ratings indicated the economy’s stability and would restore the confidence of foreign investors.
PM Shehbaz also said that the implementation of the repatriation programme for Afghans residing illegally in the country was also continuing effectively in accordance with international laws.
Field Marshal Munir had, similarly, a day ago reaffirmed the military’s resolve to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country, underscoring the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations, the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.
“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement had said.</p><small>2025-07-31 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3120113731166c2.jpg?r=201245' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927830/utility-stores-corporation-shutters-down-operations-at-all-outlets' target='_blank'><strong>Utility Stores Corporation shutters down operations at all outlets</strong></a><br><p>The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) on Thursday formally ceased operations, in compliance with the July 31 deadline established earlier this month to close the state-owned enterprise (SOE).
Established in 1971, USC was an SOE tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide.
According to a USC notification from the Ministry of Industries and Production, available with Dawn.com, the decision was taken in compliance with directives issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on June 28 and a meeting of the board of directors earlier this month.
“All the sales and purchases at utility stores have been closed with effect from July 31, except shifting of stock from stores to warehouses and returned to vendors and handing-taking of stores’ inventories,” the notification reads, instructing strict compliance with the order.
Additionally, sales through the business-management suite Odoo have been permanently discontinued as of today, a second USC notification read.
“All point of sale systems connected with Odoo will be rendered inactive across all stores effective July 31,” the notice read. “No store in charge or designated official is authorised to conduct any sales through the Odoo system after this date. Additionally, no procurement transactions shall be initiated through Odoo either.”
According to the notification, the Odoo system will only be utilised for inventory reconciliation and record maintenance and any attempt to carry out sales or purchase transactions after today will be treated as “a serious violation of official policy”.
It added that “any employee found conducting or facilitating sales or purchases through Odoo after July 31 shall be held personally responsible, and strict disciplinary action will be initiated under USC rules.”
According to the finance ministry’s Federal SOE Performance Overview for the first half of FY25, USC posted a loss of Rs4.1 billion over six months, with cumulative losses rising to Rs15.5bn — highlighting persistent structural and operational challenges.
In January, the federal cabinet formed a high-level committee to develop a comprehensive strategy for the prompt shutdown of USC operations nationwide. The committee was tasked with determining a plan for the immediate closure of the USC, as well as arrangements for placing permanent USC employees in the surplus pool or absorption against existing vacancies in other federal government organisations.
The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed in April that under the restructuring plan of USC, 1,203 Utility Stores were closed while 2,237 employees were laid off.</p><small>2025-07-31 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3114475449f73b5.jpg?r=145013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802/may-9-riots-faisalabad-atc-sentences-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-and-other-pti-leaders-to-10-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and other PTI leaders to 10 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI’s Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.
Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.
Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: “We will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.”
He said that the “political cases against PTI members were baseless”, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.
“We do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.”
According to a copy of the court order — available with Dawn.com — “the prosecution has successfully proved its case without any shadow of doubt” against 17 of the accused, including the opposition leaders and Zartaj Gul. They were sentenced to:


10 years rigorous imprisonment, Rs1 million fine under Section 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC)

Additionally, the 90 accused were sentenced under various sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (ATA).

According to the order, the 108 convicts will receive copies of the order and will be able to file an appeal within 15 days. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued for those convicted in absentia, including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Rai Murtaza Iqbal and Zartaj Gul.
Meanwhile, 77 accused were acquitted because the prosecution “miserably failed to prove the alleged offence”.
In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases “false, fabricated, and politically motivated”, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party’s mass mobilisation on August 5.
“Through this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,” the party stated. “This decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.
“The judiciary’s continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,” the statement added.
The PTI added that this is the “first time” opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced “solely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle”.
“The real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,” the party claimed.
 






“Today’s sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan’s peaceful public movement.”
Moreover, the party branded the sentences “part of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan’s leadership”.
However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.
“Imran Khan’s vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,” the statement read.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan deplored the mass sentencing.
“While those involved in violence must be held accountable, the use of anti-terror laws to try civilians raises serious due-process concerns and is symptomatic of the continued erosion of democratic values. We reiterate that all those accused must receive fair, transparent trials in civilian courts and urge the state to refrain from using draconian laws to stifle political dissent.”
 






In May, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.
In December 2024, military courts had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.

Edward Zakrzewski, 60, pleaded guilty to the June 1994 murders of his wife, Sylvia, son Edward, 7, and daughter, Anna, 5.
His wife was beaten with a crowbar, strangled with a rope and struck with a machete.
The two children were hacked to death with the machete, which Zakrzewski had purchased during his lunch break after being informed that his wife planned to divorce him.
Zakrzewski fled to Hawaii and changed his name following the murders, but turned himself in four months later after being identified by friends on a television show called “Unsolved Mysteries.” Zakrzewski is to be executed at 6:00pm (3:00am PKT) at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.
There have been 26 executions in the United States this year, the most since the 28 executions of 2015.
Twenty-one have been carried out by lethal injection, two have been by firing squad and three by nitrogen hypoxia, which involves pumping nitrogen gas into a face mask, causing the prisoner to suffocate.
The use of nitrogen gas as a method of capital punishment has been denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.
Florida has carried out the most executions in 2025 — eight.
The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others  California, Oregon and Pennsylvania — have moratoriums in place.

Bajaur police spokesperson Israr Salarzai told Dawn.com: “The house of a citizen in Gohati Mamond was struck by a mortar shell, due to which four men were injured.
“They were taken to the Lar Khalazo Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for medical assistance,” he said, adding that the condition of one of the injured people was critical.
Earlier in the week, the Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew at 16 places in the district and initiated an operation against militants in the areas.  Salarzai added that the curfew was lifted in the district after a two-day operation against the militants.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced on Wednesday that a series of jirgas will be convened from August 2 to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
Bajaur district, previously a hotspot during the peak of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan insurgency, is once again seeing a surge in militant violence.
On July 10, ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb and a police officer were killed there by unidentified gunmen. On July 2, a roadside bomb hit an official convoy in Sadiqabad, killing five, including an assistant commissioner and a tehsildar, and injuring 17 others, many of them police personnel.
On June 13, cross-border fire from Afghanistan killed a man and injured two women in Salarzai tehsil.

The 25pc rate would single out India more harshly than other major trading partners, and threatens to unravel months of talks, undermining one of Washington’s strategic partners in the region, viewed as a counterbalance to China.
Trump said the tariff on imports from India would start from Friday, in addition to an unspecified penalty for Russian dealings and involvement in the BRICS grouping of nations.
In response, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was studying the implications of Trump’s remarks and was dedicated to securing a fair trade deal.
“This development reflects a broader collapse of foreign policy under the Modi government,” a lawmaker of the main opposition Congress party said in a notice to the lower house of parliament, asking for a discussion on the matter.
The debate would focus on the “government’s economic and diplomatic failure in preventing the imposition of 25pc US tariffs plus penalties on Indian exports,” the notice added.
Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal was expected to brief the lower house later on Thursday, his office said.
“I don’t care what India does with Russia,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding, “They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Russia remained India’s top oil supplier during the first six months of 2025, accounting for 35pc of overall supplies.
Economists warned the steep tariff could hurt India’s manufacturing ambitions and trim up to 40 basis points off economic growth in the financial year to March 2026.
India’s benchmark equity indices, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex, fell as much as 0.9pc each in early trade before paring losses and trading flat.
The rupee was trading down 0.2pc at 87.6175 after touching its lowest in more than five months earlier in the day. The dollar’s rise gains momentum as the Fed signals patience on rate cuts.
‘Raw Deal’
India has received a “raw deal”, said Priyanka Kishore, an economist at Asia Decoded. “While further trade talks may bring the tariff rate down, it appears unlikely that India will secure a significantly better outcome than its eastern neighbours,” she added.
That would raise questions about India’s relative appeal as a China plus one destination, she said, referring to a strategy of diversifying supply chains through manufacturing outside China to reduce geopolitical and operational risks.
Trade talks continued, Trump said on social media, however, as nations face a Friday deadline to strike deals on reciprocal tariffs or have a US tariff slapped on their exports.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
On Wednesday, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports, but neither side has yet revealed the agreed rate.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the United States in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
“The government has destroyed our economic policy, has destroyed our defence policy, has destroyed our foreign policy,” opposition leader Rahul Gandhi told reporters.
The United States, the world’s largest economy, now has a trade deficit of $45.7 billion with India, the fifth largest.
Trump’s announcement and the lack of clarity on the penalty have created “considerable uncertainty”, said Krishan Arora, a partner at consultants Grant Thornton Bharat.
“India is also actively realigning its position in global supply chains through deeper trade and investment linkages with other countries - an effort that must now accelerate to reduce long-term vulnerabilities,” Arora said.</p><small>2025-07-31 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/311237028f521a2.png?r=144855' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927783/pakistan-says-deal-concluded-with-us-on-tariffs-trump-cites-oil-reserves-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says deal concluded with US on tariffs; Trump cites oil reserves agreement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the US finalised a trade deal on Wednesday night, expected to lower tariffs — although no figure was announced — while US President Donald Trump cited a pact aimed at helping develop Pakistan’s oil reserves.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is currently in Washington for negotiations on a tariff deal and also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.
“In a landmark development, Pakistan and the United States finalised a trade agreement today aimed at boosting bilateral trade, expanding market access, attracting investment, and fostering cooperation in areas of mutual interest,” the Pakistani embassy in the US posted on X on Thursday morning.
Trump announced the deal on his platform Truth Social early Thursday morning.
“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump wrote.
“We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India some day!”
There was no formal announcement from either side on what tariff rate was agreed upon, but the Pakistani embassy said the agreement “will result in reduction of reciprocal tariff especially on Pakistani exports to the United States.”
 






“This deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and mineral, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,” the embassy said.
“The deal complements Pakistan’s existing efforts of broadening the scope of Pak-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US states level. The agreement enhances Pakistan’s access to the US market and vice versa.”
The deal was reached during a meeting of Aurangzeb, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present during the meeting.
The Pakistan embassy said the deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure and development projects.
“This trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his leadership role in finalising the “historic US-Pakistan trade agreement”, saying in a post on X that  “this landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come.”
 






Early this morning, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also confirmed the trade deal but provided no details.
 






Aurangzeb called the deal a “win-win” for both countries.
“Today marks the culmination of the journey we started a few months back,” he said in a video message released by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday.
Aurangzeb reflected on the progress made since the talks related to the tariffs began, highlighting efforts to address non-tariff barriers, correct the trade imbalance, and review tariff lines on both sides.

“We had a very constructive final round of discussion which then lead to finalising the trade deal, which was later on announced by President Trump.
“From our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand,” the finance minister said.
He expressed his gratitude to several people and entities for their involvement in the process.
“The role of the private sector is prominent, because when we were trying to figure out how to reduce or end the trade imbalance, the private sector was the first constituent who came up and said they will help,” Aurangzeb said.
He thanked the commerce secretary and Ambassador Sheikh, and their respective teams, saying, “Where we stand today is because of our teamwork.”
While reiterating Trump’s message in his post, Aurangzeb called it a “real win-win situation for Pakistan and the United States”
“We are in a good place today in Pakistan in terms of where we have arrived before August 1, and for that, I congratulate everyone.
“I think we have come a long way from where we were to where we are today in terms of our overall strategic partnership between Pakistan and the US. It will, God willing, go from strength to strength as we go forward.”
Pakistan, which Washington has designated a “major non-NATO ally” in its effort to counter China’s influence in the region, faced a potential tariff of 29 per cent declared in April that was later suspended for 90 days to allow trade talks.
Last week, Dar said both nations were “very close” to a trade deal that could come within days, after he met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday.
They discussed expanding trade and ties in critical minerals and mining, the two sides said afterwards. Other Pakistani officials have also visited for talks in recent weeks.
Under Trump, Washington has sought to renegotiate trade deals with many countries, which he threatened with tariffs for trade relations he calls unfair, a characterisation many economists dispute.
US total goods trade with Pakistan was an estimated $7.3 billion in 2024, the office of the US trade representative says on its website, up from about $6.9bn in 2023.
In 2024, its goods trade deficit with Pakistan was $3bn, up 5.2pc from 2023.
Rabbani demands govt take Parliament into confidence
Meanwhile, former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani criticised the development, saying that it was “a sad day for transparency and good governance, when the people of Pakistan come to know through a tweet of the US President that an oil exploration deal has been finalised.”
He said the government must realise that such deals and projects were governed under Article 172 of the Constitution and the provinces had 50 per cent ownership of all lands, minerals and other things of value.
“The federal government should immediately take Parliament into confidence on the new Western-oriented initiatives.
“It should call a meeting of the Council of Common Interests and take provinces into confidence on such and other projects,” he said in a statement.

Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, said the order issued by provincial ombudsman Justice (R) Shahnawaz Tariq.
In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security Col (R) Wahid Asghar, and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.
The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.
Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which shall be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.
It said that if he failed to pay the fine amount within the stipulated period, it would be recovered as land revenue in terms of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, through the concerned deputy commissioner from Alvi’s moveable and immoveable properties, including bank accounts.
It also said that his CNIC and passport would be be blocked through Nadra and the Ministry of Interior till recovery of the fine. The order said it was self-executory and in case of its non-compliance, contempt proceedings under Section 10(1)(vi) of the act would be initiated against the concerned delinquent officers.
The order can be appealed in the high court.
Regarding the three others accused, the order said: “There is no direct evidence for committing harassment to the complainant; therefore, they are discharged from the allegations of harassment as alleged by the complainant.”
Alvi responded to the development in a series of posts on X.
“I have always upheld the values of integrity and dignity in professional interactions, and I deeply believe in fostering safe and inclusive workplaces for all.
“The recent verdict is deeply distressing to me,” he said.
 






“While I respect the legal process and the institutions that uphold it, I must, in good conscience, state that the findings do not reflect the truth of the situation as I experienced it.
He added: “This has been a painful journey — not just professionally, but personally.”
Alvi said he was currently reviewing the decision with his legal counsel and would be exercising his right to appeal.
“It is for anyone who feels wronged to be heard. I remain committed to ensuring that the truth is fully brought to light, through all lawful means available,” he said on X.
Meanwhile, Khan’s legal adviser, Barrister Talal Wasif Qavi, released a statement on her behalf.
“This judgment affirms that no one who disrespects the daughters of this nation deserves to hold any office — public or private. It is a clear message that power cannot shield misconduct.
“Across Pakistan, working women face harassment in silence. This case proves they no longer need to be afraid. Justice is possible,” the statement read.
“This decision serves as a beacon of hope for every working woman who has been forced into silence. We stand with all women who speak out — and will continue to fight until dignity and safety are guaranteed in every workplace.”
Alvi was reappointed as the CEO by KE’s board of directors on July 7.
In 2020, he and other senior KE officials were booked after another citizen died from electrocution in Karachi. Following the incident, the government formed a special committee to streamline KE operations and called for the removal of its top leadership over poor service during the monsoon.
Sources said government board members had pushed to replace Alvi and the distribution head with professionals capable of handling crises and ensuring efficient service.</p><small>2025-07-31 12:09</small></div><hr>
