<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11075857a2d6e27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960446/punjab-police-suggest-legal-cover-for-teen-motorcyclists' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Police suggest legal cover for teen motorcyclists</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab police department has suggested amendments to the Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965, and Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969, for the introduction and operationalisation of a proposed Juvenile Driving Permit (JDP) for motorcyclists aged 16 to 18 years, a move that may render an estimated seven million teens eligible to drive.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar has forwarded two summaries through the Home Department to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for final approval.
He also proposed amendments to the Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965, for the rationalisation of Section 89-B, which makes it mandatory for drivers of motor cars, cabs, and transport vehicles to wear a fastened seat belt, by omitting the requirement of ‘notified roads’.
The move was taken as a major development in the wake of recent crackdown on the underage drivers, including students, and arrested many of them under criminal offences.

Changes to law proposed to introduce juvenile driving permit, make seat belts mandatory for all roads

The CM had taken notice of some disturbing viral video clips when several hand-cuffed students in school uniform were presented in courts and the reports that the police tarnished the careers of a large number of them by preparing their crime profile.
Giving some justifications for these amendments, the IGP pointed out that the existing regulatory gap resulted in unlicenced juvenile riding and associated safety risks, necessitating a need to introduce a juvenile driving permit for motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years.
“The amendment establishes a structured, lawful, and monitored framework enabling juveniles to operate motorcycles under prescribed conditions, thereby promoting responsible mobility, enhancing road safety, strengthening enforcement, and supporting the vision of a safe, modern, and inclusive youth mobility system,” reads one of the summary documents.
Global practices
The respective summaries were drafted and sent to the Punjab police chief by Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed who referred to some models/practices adopted by many advanced countries to address the serious issue of ‘the youth mobility on the roads’.
Mr Athar was of the opinion that the introduction of a formal juvenile driving permit would provide a structured, lawful and enforceable pathway for regulated youth mobility.
“A comparative review of international licensing standards shows that many jurisdictions, including India, Malaysia, New Zealand, several EU states, and the US, allow supervised or restricted motorcycle or learner permits between 16 and 17 years of age,” states the CTO.
About the background perspective, the police department says that no person is permitted to ride a motorcycle in any public place unless he/she attained the age of 18 years under the existing legal framework, specifically section 4 of the motor vehicle ordinance.
The absence of a clear statutory mechanism for regulating juvenile motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years had resulted in persistent enforcement challenges and an incre­asing number of unlicenced young riders on the roads.
The introduction of juvenile driving permit for juvenile motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years would address this regulatory gap besides providing a structured, legally recognised, and enforceable framework for youth mobility within this age bracket, as per the documents. Another primary objective of the proposed amendment was to allow individuals aged 16 to 18 years to legally ply motorcycles under regulated and clearly defined conditions.
The department also argued that section 89-B currently restricts mandatory seat belt use to “notified roads”, creating ambiguity and limiting enforcement, despite the fact that road-safety risks are present on all public roads across the province.
“To address this critical safety concern and ensure uniform compliance, it is proposed that the phrase ‘on notified roads’ be removed, making seat belt use compulsory on all public roads and strengthening protection for every road user,” reads the summary.

The proposal, laid out in a notice published on Tuesday in the Federal Register, would apply to visitors from 42 countries, including Britain, France, Australia and Japan, who do not need a visa to enter the United States.
Currently, those travellers only need to apply for a waiver known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA), which still requires them to provide certain personal details.
Under the proposed new rules, the collection of social media data would become a “mandatory” part of ESTA applications. Applicants would need to provide their social media histories from the last five years, according to the notice.
They would also have to submit other “high-value data fields” including phone numbers from the last five years, email addresses from the past decade, personal details of family members and biometric information.
The public has 60 days to comment on the proposal.
The Trump administration has tightened curbs on entering the United States, part of a sweeping crackdown on migration.
Along with Mexico and Canada, the US will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is certain to attract large numbers of football fans from across the world.</p><small>2025-12-11 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11075952afbaa4e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960450/british-lawmakers-press-for-action-on-kashmir-freedom' target='_blank'><strong>British lawmakers press for action on Kashmir freedom</strong></a><br><p>• Highlight ‘urgent’ crisis following India’s revocation of disputed region’s special status; call for self-determination vote as per UN’s 1948 resolution• Hamish Falconer insists lasting resolution rests solely with India and Pakistan
LONDON: British lawmakers on Wednesday urged their government to support self-determination for the disputed region of Ja­m­­mu and Kashmir, and called on it to press India on human rights.
However, a minister reaffirmed the UK’s long-standing policy on the decades-old dispute during a parliamentary debate by saying “we believe in diplomacy”, with a renewed push for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan.
The debate “Kashmir: Self-determination”, in Westminster Hall, saw several members of parliament calling for a more active British role, citing concerns from their large British-Kashmiri constituencies.

 

The session was led by Labour MP Imran Hussain, who described the situation as an urgent human rights issue.
For the people of [India-held] Kashmir, this is not a distant foreign-policy issue, Mr Hussain said.
“This is about families torn apart, homes bulldozed, voices sile­nced, human rights abused. The right to choose their own destiny has been denied for generations.”
He criticised India’s revocation of the region’s special status in 2019. “Since the removal of Articles 370 and 35A, we have seen communication blackouts, curfews, mass detentions and attempts to alter the demographics of the region,” he said.
He also referenced a 1948 United Nations resolution calling for a vote on the disputed territory’s future.
The promise of a free and fair plebiscite made in 1948 remains unfulfilled, Mr Hussain added.
Decades later, the international community and successive UK governments have failed to ensure that Kashmiris can exercise their right to self-determination, he added.
Other MPs echoed his concerns. Jim Shannon of Strangford highlighted the humanitarian situation in occupied Kashmir, highlighting “repressive policies” including the use of arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings and other most serious abuses, including sexual abuse.
Gareth Snell of Labour from Stoke-on-Trent Central highlighted the large British-Kashmiri population and the enduring lack of political attention to the issue.
Labour MP Andy McDonald of Middlesbrough and Thornaby East raised concerns over reports of arbitrary detention, suppression of free speech and restrictions on journalists.
Responding for the government, Hamish Falconer, who is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, emphasised that the UK’s position has not changed.
“It is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting resolut­­­ion to the situation in Kashmir, which must take into ac­­count the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he said, stressing that both sides are friends. Mr Falconer also said the UK regularly raises human rights with both nations. “The UK takes human rights seriously,” he said. “We continue to raise concerns with both India and Pakistan regarding restrictions, the detention of political leaders, and the protection of minorities. We welcome any steps to lift remaining restrictions and release political detainees,” he added.
He also addressed the UK diaspora, saying the UK recognises the strength of feeling among the British-Kashmiri community and remains open to engagement with community representatives, adding, “I do not wish to take a view about whether a further reference to the United Nations is useful at this time, but it is critical in 2025 and into 2026 that there is dialogue between India and Pakistan. We have seen the extent of the pressure when dialogue breaks down.” While ministers acknowledged the plight of Kashmiris and the UK’s role in raising concerns, they stopped short of committing to any UK-led mediation or a UN-backed plebiscite.
The session marks the latest in a series of parliamentary debates on the disputed Himalayan region, including discussions in March 2025 and January 2021, reflecting the ongoing concern among MPs, constituents, and diaspora communities about human rights and political representation in the region.

The policy aims to facilitate litigants and improve efficiency in the top court amid complaints that petitioners, who have to travel long distances to reach the apex court, sometimes return empty-handed due to this practice. In some instances, their cases are taken up after inordinate delays following their de-listing.
A few years ago, a litigant who was suffering from cardiac problems visited Islamabad from Lahore to attend his case, but it was delisted and then fixed for hearing at a time when the court’s timing was already over.
When he came to attend to his case for the third time, the bench, which was supposed to hear the matter, simply adjourned it without assigning a reason or fixing a new date.

CJP Afridi vows to safeguard dignity, liberty, and equality of people

The Wednesday circular, however, said whenever cases are required to be delisted due to non-availability of the requisite bench or a judge, they shall, so far as practicable, be redistributed among available benches for hearing on the same day after 11:30am. If redistribution on the same day is not practicable, the cases will automatically be fixed for hearing in the following week.
The policy represents the apex court’s commitment to strengthening case management, enhancing judicial accessibility and promoting a litigant-friendly environment, the handout said.
International Human Rights Day
Meanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, in his message on International Human Rights Day, said the judiciary rene­wed its constitutional and moral commitment to safeguard the dignity, liberty, and equality of all people.
This day commemorates the ad­­option of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) — a transformative global pledge that continues to inspire national constitutions, public institutions, and development strategies, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In an era of rapid social, economic and technological change, the judiciary of Pakistan remains firmly focused on strengthening the rule of law and ensuring that justice is accessible and responsive to the needs of every citizen, the message said.
The statement added that the ongoing reform initiatives aimed to modernise judicial processes, promote transparency and meaningfully reduce the barriers that prevent people, especially the marginalised, from securing their rights.
From improving court procedures and embracing technology to enhancing judicial training and strengthening institutional coordination, each step of reform reflects our commitment to a citizen-centric justice system — one that tre­­ats every individual with respect, ensures timely remedies, and uph­olds fairness without fear or favour.

RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Politi­cal temperatures rose further on Wedne­sday, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison.
The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil.

 

After entering a report in its daily police diary (roznamcha) on the PTI sit-in outside Adiala jail on the previous night, Rawalpindi police termed the demonstration a “violent protest by a political party with the intention of attacking Adiala jail” in a statement issued on Wednesday.
It noted that Section 144 was in force in the city and that it was the police’s respo­n­sibility to ensure its implementation.
A police spokesperson said Adiala jail was a sensitive and densely populated area where maintaining security and traffic order was crucial. He added that there was no visiting time at night and no one could be allowed to meet an inmate without a court order.
The spokesperson claimed that the po­lice had “shown extreme patience” du­r­ing the sit-in despite “attempts to vandalise and resist the police” by protesters.

 

“Members of the political party pelted stones and attacked the police, on which the law had to take its course. Water cannon had to be used, with extreme patience and strategy, to prevent malicious activity and an attack,” he said, adding that violation of the law would not be tolerated “under any circumstances” in such a sensitive area.
In a post on X at 3:58am, the party had claimed that authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
The party said Mr Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi, along with party leaders and workers, had spent the entire day peacefully waiting outside the prison to exercise their “constitutional and legal right” to meet their incarcerated leader on a court-mandated visitation day.







“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.
A police source said a report on Tuesday night’s incident had already been recorded and could be converted into a formal FIR, in which the accused would be nominated and booked under the relevant sections of the law.
Privilege motion
On the other hand, PTI MNAs on Wednesday submitted a complaint for a “privilege motion” in the National Assembly against Rawalpindi police.
At a subsequent presser, opposition leaders claimed that PTI parliamentary leader Shahid Khattak’s “leg had been broken” in the melee.
The motion claimed that police had used force against PTI leaders and workers who were present outside the jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder imprisoned there.
The party also expressed grave concern over reports that the former prime minister might be transferred to another jail, calling such a move a blatant display of “fear, political desperation and weakness” on the part of the government.
The party said its founding chairman could neither be “minused” nor removed from the political arena, nor could his voice be sile­nced behind prison walls.
In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party condemned remarks by federal ministers suggesting that Mr Khan may be mov­ed to another facility, saying the government “continued to tremble at his very name” despite keeping him incarcerated for over two and a half years.
The party also condemned what it described as a police “assault” on Mr Khan’s sisters, female workers and party leaders outside Adiala Jail.
It said the episode once again exposed the “stark reality” that the incumbent government had abandoned “moral boundaries, constitutional principles and basic human values” in its use of force against political opponents.
War of words
Meanwhile, the war of words between the opposition and the ruling coalition continued on Wed­nesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in rec­ent days after the spok­esperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on Dec 6, in response to Imran Kha­n’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Addressing a press conference, Mr Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance. All doors to talks are now closed.”
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what else can be done”.
‘Common sense’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then … We sat in parliament, believing that our voices would be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties would be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. However, “at some point, common sense should prevail”, he said
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.”
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
Achakzai on dialogue
Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. How can we negotiate without his permission?”
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “nati­onal conference” on Dec 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.”
Mr Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adiala jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addressed a press conference, assailing the PTI and its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said.
“It is the same Khan who was willing to give Gen Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakist­anis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these gro­ups,” Mr Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong.”

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Pakis­tan could not achieve sustainable economic development without the complete elimination of terro­rism, extremism and se­­­­ctaria­n­ism from the country.
Addressing the National Ulema Conference, the prime minister urged religious scholars to play a proactive role in discouraging sectarianism and promoting unity, harmony and brotherhood among all schools of thought. “Creating an atmosphere of national cohesion is esse­­ntial for ensuring the country’s prosperity and future progress,” he added.
The convention was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mi­­nister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, ministers, parliamentarians, and a large number of religious scholars from various schools of thoughts.
“With the blessings of Almighty Allah, Pakistan achieved a great victory in Marka-i-Haq against India,” the premier said, also lauding the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces.
‘Unwavering resolve’
He said Field Marshal Munir had led the war with courage and unwavering resolve, while all services — the army, air force and navy — contributed equally to the victory.
The world, he added, was acknowledging Pakis­tan’s performance, and Muslim countries were expressing pride over the historic victory. Despite this, he noted, certain elements continued to spread propaganda against the armed forces. Calling out the menace of terrorism, he said the Khawarij (a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) were carrying out attacks and targeting innocent citizens and security personnel.
He said the country’s po­litical and military lea­dership had worked tirelessly to steer the nation away from the risk of default.
The prime minister re­­affirmed the governm­e­nt’s resolve to place Pakistan on the path to economic prosperity. “By implementing austerity measures and working collectively, the nation can fulfill the dreams of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” he added.
‘Broadening vision’
Speaking at the event, CDF Field Marshal Munir urged the ulema to play their role in fostering na­­tional unity and broadening the vision of the pe­­o­p­­le, the state-run APP reported.
He added that in an Is­­lamic state, no one exc­ept the state could declare jihad.
Terming the defence ag­­reement with Saudi Arabia a historic development, the CDF said there was a deep connection between the Kingdom and Pakistan.
“Terrorism is not Pakistan’s way, but India’s practice. Pakistan does not strike the enemy from hiding; rather, it challenges and eliminates them openly,” he said.
Underscoring the impo­rtance of education, Field Marshal Munir said the pen became vulnerable to chaos in a nation, which abandoned knowledge.

The state-owned Bang­ladesh Sangbad Sangstha news agency quoted Dha­ka’s Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain as saying: “It is possible for us (Bang­ladesh) strategically … (but) it is not possible for Nepal or Bhutan to form a grouping with Pakistan excluding India”.
His remarks are being interpreted as a response to a statement by Pakis­tan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar at the recent ‘Islamabad Conclave’, where he had said a trilateral initiative involving Bangladesh, China and Pakistan had begun and may expand to include countries within and beyond the region.
According to the Bang­ladeshi outlet, Mr Hossain said Mr Dar “has said something, and perhaps at some point this could see some progress”.
In August, Foreign Minister Dar visited Bangladesh for the first time in 13 years.
PM Shehbaz Sharif and Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus have also held a couple of cordial meetings in recent months.
There has been a thaw in ties between the two nations ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year.

The package includes Link–16 systems, cryptographic equipment, avionics updates, training, and comprehensive logistical support.
The DSCA letter makes clear the rationale for the sale, stating that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.”
The proposed sale is also aimed at modernising Pakistan’s F-16 fleet and addressing operational safety concerns. The letter notes that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
These updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns,” the letter adds.
The letter also emphasises Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addresses regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”

 

Lockheed Martin Company of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the sale. The US defence agency pointed out that “implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional US Government or contractor representatives to Pakistan” and that there will be “no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale.”
The total estimated value of the sale is $686 million, with major defence equipment valued at $37 million and other items at $649 million. The major defence equipment (MDE) component includes 92 Link–16 data link systems and six inert Mk–82 500-lb general purpose bomb bodies; the latter will have no explosive payload and will be used for weapons integration testing.
Link-16 is an advanced command, control, communications and intelligence system. It is a secure, real-time communication network that shares tactical data among allied forces and is used by US and allied Nato forces. The system is also resistant to electronic jamming from enemy air and ground assets.
“It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter read.
The rest of the deal consists of $649m worth of non-MDE equipment, including the AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loaders and AN/APX–126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system — used to identify hostile and allied aircraft.
It also includes hardware and software modifications to support the Operational Flight Program and mandated avionics updates, as well as KY–58M and KIV–78 cryptographic appliqués, which are National Security Agency (NSA)-certified modules used in military aircraft and other tactical systems for secure communications and identification.
The equipment also covers additional secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic devices, Joint Mission Planning Systems and support, Common Munitions Built-in-test Reprogramming Equipment, and ADU–981 missile adaptor units.
Other weapons integration, test and support equipment, spare and repair parts, software delivery and support, publications and technical documentation, full motion simulators, personnel training, and training equipment are also included.
The package will also provide Pakistan with US government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services, studies and surveys, and other related elements of logistical and program support.
Pakistan had requested upgrades to its F-16 fleet in 2021 amid strained relations, but Washington delayed its response. The country is now less dependent on the F-16s, having acquired and jointly developed other platforms, which proved their worth during the May 2025 air war by inflicting significant damage on the Indian fleet.
“Pakistan still welcomes the US offer, as it will enhance the shelf life of its F-16s until 2040,” a diplomatic source said.
The DSCA letter, sent to the Speaker of the House and the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, concludes that the sale “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States” while ensuring that Pakistan can continue to operate its F-16 fleet safely and effectively.</p><small>2025-12-11 02:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1100534978f95e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960347/hamza-the-rocket-fires-into-swimming-record-books-at-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Hamza ‘The Rocket’ fires into swimming record books at National Games</strong></a><br><p>It takes a village to raise a child, and, in the case of Hamza Asif, it took a village to raise a national record holder.

When he began swimming at the age of six, it was his mother who would pace the edge of the pool teaching him the basics of the sport, much to the disapproval of conservative men who were uncomfortable by her presence. It did not faze her.
The country’s textile hub does not have a 50m pool, whose single lap he completed in historic fashion on Wednesday afternoon to set a new national record in the men’s 50m breaststroke.
He became the first Pakistani ever to swim the event under 30 seconds as he clocked 29.99.
If you froze the moment in time and examined it, you could see exactly where and how this monumental feat materialised. His mother bent down in prostration immediately after to offer thanks for her son’s victory. She has devoutly prayed for him always, “but Hamza has the prayers of so many people,” she told Dawn after his triumph.

Well before the well-wishes drenched the happy parents and sister at the KMC Swimming Pool, snide parents offered a cold shoulder when Hamza’s mother reached out for contact information of a coach for him when he was younger. “He’s from Faisalabad” was said with snarky undercurrents.
His younger sister and mother ping-ponged the exact defining moments in his career so far.
“He wrote in a school essay once that he wanted to be Pakistan’s fastest swimmer,” the proud mother said with teary eyes.
“I had to convince my parents to let me come to Karachi to watch Hamza bhai’s race!” his sister chuckled. She even wrote about his early sporting victories for a magazine once.

It was as though the universe had convinced the family that Hamza was on the cusp of sporting excellence, and everyone must be there to witness it. Both sets of maternal and paternal grandparents were immediately video called to be given the good news and digitally bring them into the moment. The tech-savvy grandparents are also swimming-savvy, understanding the technicalities of the sport and following Hamza every step of the way.
Hamza’s mother credited her super sports star father with being Hamza’s inspiration for continuously pushing the boundaries of greatness.
He pushed the boundaries and knocked on the door of Bard Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to financially supporting athletes throughout their journey with strict selection criteria. While the organisation typically has focused on squash and tennis players and mountaineers, it took a chance on the aquatic species and welcomed Hamza to the family.
“Thank you for trusting me,” 19-year-old Hamza said to Mehreen Dawood when he finally emerged in the audience stands to thunderous applause and “shabbash shabbash!” from teammates. He melted into the arms of his mother when he finally met her and his father, then going straight to childhood coach Imran for another bearhug.
Mehreen, member of the board of governors of the foundation, was largely speechless when asked how she felt about taking a chance on him.
“Ecstatic,” she told Dawn before adding that Hamza was a wonderful person overall. His meticulous attention to detail while training, the way he conducted himself, the way he straddled the line between humility and confidence was what convinced Mehreen that he was a semi-cut diamond in need of the highest-grade polishing.
The Bard Foundation’s support sent Hamza to Thailand for training, which he credited as being foundational to his initial improvement, which later opened the doors of University of Tennessee, Southern as the university offered him a scholarship to study and swim with them.
“My coach has worked hard on me in these past few months,” Hamza told Dawn after the day concluded.
“We’ve been training for this very event, and I was expecting the record,” he said with quiet confidence.
Mehreen, the Bard Foundation and Activit were the latest to join Hamza’s village of support, all of whom Hamza expressed gratitude to.
“Behind my journey are my parents, and I cannot thank them enough,” the teenager said, his words loaded with a love you can tell he’s carried all his life. He looked something like a powerful Greek god with his curly hair and the afternoon sun shining down on him like a spotlight for his unthinkable moment.
“Special thanks to my team, my coach, and everyone who believed in me, and thank you so much everyone.” Hamza’s gratitude to his university was equally magnanimous as their adoration of him.
“We are so proud of Hamza and proud to call him a FireHawk,” the varsity wrote for him on social media after he claimed gold in the 100m freestyle on Tuesday.

In an earlier post this summer on Hamza’s arrival in the fall class, the varsity said he will “make an immediate impact to our men’s team, and will primarily swim sprint [freestyle] for the FireHawks”.
And yet, his first individual national record was in the breaststroke sprint. He lived up to the university’s hype and immediately stormed to gold in the men’s 50m freestyle just minutes later in 23.66, a full second faster than the second place finisher. He had single-handedly won all of Wapda’s gold medals thus far.

“I’m aiming for more records in the future, this event was a benchmark for me.

“This is just the start — I’m coming for more,” he grinned with authoritative confidence and faith in himself.
Just as Mehreen had put his faith in him, Hamza had put his faith in Allah, first and foremost.
“We do the best we can, and the rest, we leave to Him,” his father said as he pointed a finger and looked up to the sky.</p><small>2025-12-10 20:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10233608a9354fb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960343/record-setting-hamza-asif-treble-winner-faiqa-riaz-steal-national-games-spotlight' target='_blank'><strong>Record-setting Hamza Asif, treble winner Faiqa Riaz steal National Games spotlight</strong></a><br><p>At the 35th National Games, the story of sport has so often been of sheer will against long odds.
But on Wednesday, the narrative splintered into two distinct, dazzling truths: one written in the chronometric perfection of chlorinated water, the other etched in the sun-baked sand of the long jump pit.
In the pool, a digital clock froze at a number never before seen in Pakistan: 29.99 seconds.
On the track, a measuring tape confirmed a distance of 5.52 metres, sealing a historic triple crown.
The fourth day of the competitions belonged to 19-year-old swimmer Hamza Asif, who shattered a time barrier and a 26-year-old Olympian who shattered expectations, proving that national sporting history can be made in parallel universes.
The sun played the role of spotlight over the swimming arena, its zenith aligning with the men’s 50m breaststroke final.
The audience was on its feet, phone cameras held horizontally. In lane six was Rayan Awan, the national record holder in the event.
The buzzer sounded. Seven swimmers flew off the blocks, emerging from shadow into liquid light. It was not Rayan, but Wapda’s Hamza who touched first.
After a wait of several seconds, a cluster of red numbers appeared. A voice screamed from the stands: “National record! National record!” Hamza had done the unthinkable — he became the first Pakistani to swim the event in under 30 seconds.
Rayan, in a gracious twist of fate, also improved his personal time (30.55) for silver. But this was Hamza’s moment.
Race-mates reached over lane lines to high-five the teenager, who trains at the University of Tennessee. His father was hugged tight by proud men; his mother bent down in prostration.
“My coach has worked hard on me, we’ve been training for this very event and I was expecting the record,” a remarkably composed Hamza, who would later top off his day with another gold in the 50m freestyle, told Dawn.
As the aquatic celebrations subsided, the searing Karachi sun refocused its attention on the track and field stadium.
Here, Faiqa Riaz, the Wapda sprinter and Pakistan’s representative at the Paris 2024 Olympics, was chasing a different kind of immortality.
She had already secured the 100m and 200m golds. Now, she stood at the long jump runway for her final attempt.
A brief, taut silence followed her leap. She locked eyes with the technical official.
The winning distance was announced. A yell of pure, unfiltered joy erupted.
Faiqa put her hands on her head, knowing the gold — and a historic third individual title — was hers. When the last competitor failed to match it, she collapsed into the arms of her coaches.
“I thought I had to settle for a silver today,” Faiqa confessed to Dawn. “But on my last attempt, I was like it’s do or die and I ran with my full strength for the jump.”
Her main target had always been the 100m, the event she trained for most intensely. The 200m and long jump were audacious, successful experiments.
Her triumph, however, is framed by the stark realities of Pakistani sport. Managing two distinct disciplines is a complex science.
“For jumps, training for explosive [power] I do with sprint. But run-up is the main issue… in sprint you need speed while in long jump you need more control with speed,” she explained, noting she doesn’t train specifically for jumps to protect her sprinting prowess.
THE SUPPORTING CAST
The day’s drama was not confined to these twin peaks. The penultimate day of the athletic meet began in the pre-dawn dark at Mazar-e-Quaid, with the marathoners setting off on their 42.195km odyssey, where Navy’s Shahbaz Masih claimed marathon gold in 2:25:23.6 — almost four minutes ahead of his nearest rival Wapda’s Sher Khan.
Elsewhere on the track and field of the NPT&SC, Army’s Mohammad Akhtar executed a perfectly timed final burst in the men’s 10,000m, roaring past Wapda’s Mohammad Irfan in the last 150 metres to claim gold.
The women’s 100m hurdles saw a thrilling mid-race shift, as Wapda’s Ghazala Ramzan edged ahead of her department-mate Amina Saeed to secure the top spot.
The men’s 4x100m relay provided a thrilling finale, with Wapda clinging to a razor-thin lead against a charging Army team in a photo finish.
The event, however, was marred by controversy as the Sindh team failed to field a squad, citing a lack of communication from their absent manager and grievances over unpaid daily allowances.
In the field, Uzma Azan (Wapda) added to her department’s gold haul in the hammer throw, while Army’s Waqas Akbar cruised to victory in a tactical men’s 1500m.
Over in the pool, 13-year-old Riah Mirza won her first national medal —gold— in the women’s 100m backstroke in 1:16.50, a personal record for the teenager.
Watching, with pride in her eyes, was her mother Shaan Kandawalla, who swam at the first national women’s championships 30 years ago.
“My mom’s my inspiration,” Riah said. “And she’s mine,” Shaan replied, kissing her forehead. “I hope she now gets a chance to swim internationally, which I never got a chance to do.”
The waves of victory kept coming. Jehanara Nabi and Ahmed Durrani (800m and 200m freestyle) added multiple individual golds for Army.
Mishael Hayat Ayub won Wapda’s first aquatics gold medal in the women’s 100m butterfly in 1:11.12.
Ayesha Zeeshan followed it up with a gold in 50m freestyle (28.69), while earlier in the day Hareem Malik won Sindh’s second gold in the 50m breaststroke, coming moderately close to breaking her own national record in the event.
Ali Mitha won Sindh’s first gold on the men’s side in 1:01.64 in 100m backstroke.
Army’s other individual gold was won by Syed Daniyal Hatim in the 100m butterfly, where he’s the record holder, with 57.72.
FOOTBALL FRACAS
Aside from the sporting glories, the men’s football event descended into a farce after a violent brawl during a heated semi-final clash between Army and Wapda at the KPT Sports Complex.
A heated exchange, after Army won 4-3, flared into a full-scale brawl, culminating in players allegedly forcing their way into the officials’ room and assaulting the referee. A detailed report is being prepared, with disciplinary action expected against both sides.
In judo, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) emerged as the leading force, with Mohammad Saleem (-50kg), Olympian Shah Hussain Shah (-110kg) and Sadaqat Ali (-66kg) all securing gold, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Syed Faisal Shah (-55kg) and Navy’s Akhas (-60kg) also topped their categories.
In the women’s events, PAF continued their strong showing through Naseema (-40kg) and Iram Shahzadi (-48kg), with Wapda’s Fozia Yasir (+70kg) and Navy’s Areeba Ameer (-44kg) claiming titles.
Taekwondo kyorugi saw Army dominate the mats, with Haroon (U-58kg), Arbaz Khan (U-68kg) and Ikhtasham-ul-Haq (U-87kg) winning the men’s titles, while Fateema (U-49kg) and Sarah (U-67kg) claimed gold for Army in the women’s events.
Badminton belonged emphatically to Wapda, who swept both the men’s and women’s team event finals.
In the men’s final, Wapda outclassed Army 3-1 with standout performances from Mohammad Ali Larosh and Irfan Saeed. The women’s final was even more one-sided, as Mahoor Shahzad led Wapda to a clinical 3-0 victory.
In softball, Pakistan Army edged Wapda 9-6 to secure the gold medal, while Wapda were crowned overall bodybuilding champions, claiming eight gold medals to continue their dominance in strength sports.
In tug of war, Pakistan Railways claimed gold in the men’s category, while Wapda secured the women’s title.
At the PNS Karsaz range, Navy’s shooters shone brightly. Hadiqa Iqbal took gold in the women’s 50m rifle event, while Navy swept the team category as well.
Abdul Qudoos also delivered gold in the 25m standard pistol, with the Navy team repeating that success. Army’s Colonel Farrukh Nadeem topped the individual trap event.
In wrestling, Wapda extended their grip on the medals table with gold medals for Hammad Butt (61kg) and Inayatullah (74kg), while Army’s Haider Ali delivered a strong performance to win the 86kg title.</p><small>2025-12-10 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10230525284de93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960341/meta-services-will-suffer-slow-performance-for-36-hours-says-ptcl' target='_blank'><strong>Meta services will suffer slow performance for 36 hours, says PTCL</strong></a><br><p>In a strange development, the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) announced on Wednesday that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and other Meta services will experience slow performance for 36 hours starting after midnight on December 11.
The company stated in a customer advisory that due to maintenance activity from 1am on Thursday till 1pm on Friday, Meta services will face degradation as engineers carry out planned technical upgrades.
Meanwhile, an official representing PTCL said that, as the country’s key internet and backend service provider, the company has received user complaints about slower performance or intermittent outages of these services.
Meta has not provided any details regarding the nature of the maintenance or whether it would affect all regions uniformly.
The ‘Meta AI’ tool has disowned any maintenance notice and information regarding service degradation on Facebook, Instagram or other Meta services.
It added, “Meta (formerly Facebook) does perform scheduled maintenance, but check official Meta or Facebook Business channels for confirmation of specific dates and details”.
Incidentally, regarding the notice circulating on social media, ‘Meta AI’ said that it resembled a common tactic in phishing or scam messages that try to appear official.
The AI tool suggested looking for the announcement on Meta’s official status page or news releases, and be cautious about SMS instructions unrelated to the maintenance notice itself, especially those asking to text specific numbers to block messages.
Meta has said that maintenance is routinely conducted and such activities are needed to update backend systems, enhance security layers and improve service efficiency.</p><small>2025-12-10 19:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/102359472b733f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960338/pti-cannot-differentiate-between-anti-establishment-and-anti-army-politics-says-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI cannot ‘differentiate between anti-establishment and anti-army politics,’ says Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday said the PTI cannot differentiate between “anti-establishment and anti-army” politics, highlighting that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif always engaged in the former and not the latter.
Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”.
Last week, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
“People hate the establishment, but they love Pakistan and its army. The PTI’s narrative against the army and its leadership is creating political damage for them and could cause the party irreparable harm,” said Sanaullah while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’.
He added that MQM founder Altaf Hussain’s hours-long speeches against the establishment continued for years, but once he said “Pakistan Murdabad” (death to Pakistan), his politics ended.
Referring to the martyrdom of army and officials in terrorism incidents, the PML-N leader said, “PTI delegation doesn’t attend funerals of martyrs and they don’t console their families”.
Their narrative on social media also “aligns with Indian media”, added the prime minister’s adviser.
“The appearance of PTI leaders on Indian media and interviews on it has caused them major political harm,” Sanaullah maintained.
However, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar disagreed with Sanaullah. “No Pakistani leader is anti-state. It is regrettable when people accuse someone of being so. However, it is easy to label anyone anti-state, and people have been labelled so in the past.”
In response to the interviews of Noreen Niazi and Aleema Khanum - Imran’s sisters - to separate Indian news channels, Zafar said, “I am no one’s spokesperson. There is no harm in giving one’s opinion to any news channel, but this is my personal opinion.”
“In my capacity, I might not opt to give an interview to any [Indian] news channel that generates anti-Pakistan news. But this doesn’t mean I condemn their [Imran’s sisters] choices. It is a personal choice.”
The PTI, earlier this week, stated that “further attempts to malign” party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in a bid to diminish his popularity would only cause his popularity to rise with each narrative orchestrated against him.
The party presented its stance during a rally held at Peshawar’s Sports Complex, where its leadership was joined by its political ally, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). Both parties expressed their solidarity with Imran as they took exception to the recent remarks made against him, urging that “those responsible be held to account” to prevent similar remarks in the future.</p><small>2025-12-10 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1016294163663c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960320/ppp-alleges-pml-n-pti-colluding-after-na-proceedings-end-early-during-ppp-led-agenda-item' target='_blank'><strong>PPP alleges PML-N, PTI ‘colluding’ after NA proceedings end early during PPP-led agenda item</strong></a><br><p>The PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings on Wednesday, after the speaker ended the session early when PTI’s Iqbal Afridi pointed out a “lack of quorum” ahead of an agenda item regarding the renaming of Islamabad International Airport.
The last item on the day’s agenda was a calling-attention notice from First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and other PPP lawmakers, intended to draw the defence minister’s attention to the delay in naming the New Islamabad International Airport after former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in recognition of her services to democracy and the country.
However, as the day’s proceedings continued, presiding officer Ali Zahid, who belongs to the PML-N, ended the session abruptly during the question hour while PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel was speaking.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi pointed out the lack of quorum while Patel spoke, prompting the speaker to have the members counted.
“63 members are present, the house is not in order,” Zahid said, ending the session early.
With their mics switched off, PPP lawmakers staged a noisy protest on the floor of the house.
Addressing the media after the session’s abrupt end, PPP MNA Shazia Marri termed the move “a conspiracy” against the PPP, alleging that “it appeared as if the PML-N and PTI were colluding.”
“This reeks of a conspiracy […] the session ended at 11-11:15, not even an hour had passed, and we are now standing here holding a press conference.”
Addressing the media, she said, “Qadir Patel also went to the speaker and spoke to him,” she said, adding that “now that we are standing here with you, it does feel like a conspiracy and intentional”.
“PTI is already quite non-serious[…]however, we were not expecting this from PML-N,” the PPP leader lamented.
The PPP leader, in a veiled warning to the coalition partner, said that “given the state of the country, […] the PML-N ought to be more careful”.
“Meting out such treatment to a party that is mature and sensible is unacceptable,” she said.
Separately, Patel, while speaking to the media afterwards, alleged that PML-N leaders were “sitting in the lobby” while the quorum was called, also terming it a “well-thought-out conspiracy.”
“My question had not yet been completed during the question hour, so how was a member allowed to point out a lack of quorum?” he asked.
“If the location of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Airport has been changed, then why can the name not be changed?”
“Shaheed Benazir does not need any praise; these people are small-minded, and they will remain as such,” Patel said.
Patel vowed that, in case the government does not respond, “the party will decide its future course of action during its next meeting”.
‘Petty tactic’
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Aseefa expressed disappointment “at the behaviour of acting NA speaker,” terming the move a “petty tactic.”
“It has become a mockery to constantly suspend the session despite having quorum. Many had heard the speaker was given instructions to avoid my calling attention notice. A very petty tactic,” the first lady said.







The New Islamabad International Airport (IIAP) was inaugurated by then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on May 2, 2018.
In February this year, PPP leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor, Faisal Karim Kundi, in a letter to the prime minister, had requested that the airport be renamed to honour the former prime minister, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Governor Kundi emphasised that the old Islamabad airport was originally named Benazir Bhutto International Airport on June 21, 2008, following her assassination in December 2007,” the report said.
“However, in April 2018, the Aviation Division renamed the newly constructed airport as New Islamabad International Airport, removing Bhutto’s name,” it added.</p><small>2025-12-10 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10214243b347aa8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960339/bilawal-says-ptis-extreme-politics-is-putting-the-party-in-jeopardy-opposes-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal says PTI’s ‘extreme politics’ is ‘putting the party in jeopardy’, opposes ban</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday warned that a political party, in an apparent reference to the PTI, risks being banned due to its deliberate targeting of state institutions on social media, and urged it to “abandon such politics.”
A day earlier, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban the incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”, following remarks by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric and stated that such narratives were now beyond politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Speaking to the media after visiting the residence of a late senior party worker in Lahore’s Baghbanpura neighbourhood, Bilawal said that the PTI is “targeting” the military leadership through social media and “concocting political conspiracies”.
“They attack institutions when Pakistan is passing through a critical phase,” he said. “I urge them to abandon these politics immediately. They have not only put their own party in jeopardy, but they have also left the political system and the people of Pakistan in a difficult spot.”
In response to a question about whether the PTI should be banned, the PPP chairman said that no political power wants conditions to become so bad that political voices are silenced.
“This will not be my preference or my choice, but what can I do when they continue to pursue extreme politics?” Bilawal asked. “Protest is your right, not entering and attacking military installations.”







The PPP chief also noted that amid a spike in terrorism, the PTI is attacking the institution combating militancy.
“We do not want a ban on any political party, but political forces must adopt a democratic attitude,” he said, adding that it was the government’s responsibility to provide political space to the opposition.
“They (PTI) are creating an environment in which bans could be imposed, what I want is irrelevant,” he said. “Someone needs to tell that man (Imran) to come to his senses and engage in politics. If he wants to do that, political doors will open, but if he wants to lead his party like an army, then he will be dealt with accordingly.”
Bilawal also demanded that the PTI focus on the problems of the people rather than “attacking our national heroes”.
“We will not stand silent while these people abuse our armed forces. We believe that this party is doing the work of the political antichrist,” Bilawal said.
He noted that the PTI’s behaviour amid a deteriorating security landscape in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may even trigger discussions of governor’s rule, although he had not seen the KP governor’s statement on the matter.
“Governor’s rule is an extreme proposition, but if the political parties and leadership there (KP) weaken the nation and create conditions where it becomes difficult to fight terrorism, then we have the constitutional and legal obligation to impose it.
“The PPP is not demanding it, but the PTI’s actions and choices may lead to governor’s rule or a ban. Neither of those things are good.”
Referring to the brief war with India in May, the PPP chief claimed that Pakistan had responded firmly to Indian aggression, but noted that threats from New Delhi remain present, while terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is an alarming reality.
Bilawal stressed that internal challenges were also being addressed, and at such a time, “It is the responsibility of every patriotic citizen to stand with the country and its armed forces.”
Earlier in 2024, the federal government decided to ban the PTI and sought Article 6 proceedings against Imran, ex-president Dr Arif Alvi, and former National Assembly (NA) deputy speaker Qasim Suri.
The move appeared to be an attempt to prevent the PTI from becoming the single largest party in the NA, following the apex court’s ruling in the reserved seats case. However, the government did not follow through with the ban.
In October, the federal government approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests.
However, banning political groups is not a new practice in Pakistan. It has followed the country across decades — from martial laws to seemingly democratic setups.</p><small>2025-12-10 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/102117155ac766b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959717/wide-angle-the-other-problem-with-crying-wolf' target='_blank'><strong>WIDE ANGLE: THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH CRYING WOLF</strong></a><br><p>Wolves are returning across Europe — but not to the UK and Ireland, where public support is lukewarm at best. Ecologists point out their benefits, while farmers worry about their livestock. But another influence on public opinion is rarely discussed: Hollywood’s obsession with the wolf as a monster.
​This is a particular issue in places where wolves are native yet have been extinct for centuries. Though wolves once roamed across Britain and Ireland, for most people there today, they exist only in stories or on screen. The tropes we absorb through entertainment can carry far more weight than scientific facts and have an outsized impact on how we think and feel about these animals.
Think of the Big Bad Wolf or Little Red Riding Hood. Nearly every child in the English-speaking world is introduced to the villainous wolf from a young age. They’re cunning, cruel and ravenous.
However, we don’t leave that imagery behind us in childhood. Horror cinema keeps our nightmares full of wolves, drawing on familiar — and often entirely false — tropes. Recent films offer some particularly clear examples.

Hollywood horror’s ‘killer wolf’ trope is sabotaging rewilding efforts…

In Guillermo del Toro’s recent adaptation of Frankenstein, wolves are depicted as villains. After escaping Dr Frankenstein, the monster takes refuge in an isolated farmstead and tries to help its residents. Twice, wolves descend on the farmstead — not only taking sheep but breaking into the house and attacking humans.
During the first attack, the monster muses that “the hunter did not hate the wolf. The wolf did not hate the sheep. But violence felt inevitable between them. This was the way of the world. It would hunt you and kill you, just for being who you are.”
Del Toro uses wolves as a metaphor for the world’s brutality. To make that connection, he depicts conflict between wolf and human as “inevitable”, along with portraying wolves — very inaccurately — as determined home invaders. This negative portrayal is not drawn from Mary Shelley’s novel, which contains no such scenes. Del Toro appears to have inserted it to heighten tension and scare viewers.
​Metaphors and monsters
Robert Eggers’s Nosferatu offers another recent big-budget example. When Nicholas Hoult’s character tries to escape the vampire Count Orlok’s castle, he is pursued by a pack of wolves. This is very close to older fairytale wolf characters, depicted as overtly evil or demonic.
This was reinforced by the film’s promotional campaign. In a widely reported interview, Hoult claimed he was “nearly attacked” by “real wolves.” In fact, the animals involved were Czech shepherd dogs who played their roles a little too convincingly — not wolves at all. Horror producers sometimes play up events like this to heighten the sense of threat and drum up ticket sales, in this case using an erroneous wolf attack to do so.
​This isn’t limited to big-budget cinema. A recent independent horror, Out Come The Wolves, shows two men and a woman who are attacked by wolves during a weekend getaway. Meanwhile, a menacing love triangle plot plays out, in which a jealous would-be lover abandons his competition to a wolf attack.
​The behaviour of wild predators is presented as an allegory for an opportunistic approach to romance. All’s fair in love and wolves. The film also contains an explicit reference to wolf reintroduction: when hearing about the wolf attack, one character is sceptical, saying, “There haven’t been wolves in this area for years!” The message here is clear: as wolves come back to a landscape, so does the danger of attack.
​Each of these films draws on existing tropes and fears in slightly different ways. This is what horror does as a genre: it works with what scares us already and amplifies it for entertainment. But, in doing so, as high profile cinema events, they risk playing into inaccurate public perceptions. And because most people in Britain and Ireland will never encounter a wolf in the wild, these fictional wolves become their reference points.
On screen versus reality
​There are valid concerns around wolves preying on sheep, calves or other livestock, but attacks on humans are extremely rare. A pack of wolves surrounding and repeatedly terrorising a home simply doesn’t happen.
There is a strong ecological case for reintroducing wolves where they once lived. As apex predators, they reduce populations of deer and other animals, which can otherwise damage the environment, often by overgrazing. In Yellowstone National Park in the US, grey wolf reintroductions triggered a cascade of unexpected biodiversity benefits, as overgrazing elk were forced on the move, trees recovered, rivers stabilised, and beaver populations grew.
​The same is happening in Europe as wolves spread back into their original range. But to reintroduce wolves to the UK or Ireland, conservationists would have to physically transport them there. Opinion polls show approval rates of 52 percent in Ireland and just 36 percent in the UK.
​It’s hard to extract these numbers from the cumulative effect of centuries of storytelling, from ancient folklore through Victorian Gothic novels to modern Hollywood horror. They all contribute to the idea that wolves are dangerous and unpredictable and should be nowhere near humans.
It’s meant as entertainment. But horror’s ongoing reliance on the wolf as a symbol of evil or violence may be damaging efforts to promote coexistence with healthy wild populations. Our natural landscapes need wolves. And right now, wolves need all the good PR they can get.

The development comes days after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Since then, a war of words continued between the leaders of the ruling PML-N and PTI over the presser, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition. He insisted that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman, while the opposition party emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”.
The PTI has also faced restrictions in meeting the party’s incarcerated founder, with authorities using water cannons earlier today to disperse protesters, including Imran’s sisters, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier.
The announcement was made by PTI leader Asad Qaiser after a meeting of the party’s parliamentary group at the Parliament House.
Speaking to the media outside Parliament, he said the conference was scheduled for December 20-21.
When asked about the conference’s agenda, the former speaker said the country was “facing serious issues” of instability and uncertainty.
“Being an opposition alliance, it is the responsibility of the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to invite political parties, bar associations, civil society, media and other stakeholders to get together for brainstorming and finding a way forward,” said Qaiser while speaking to Dawn.
Elaborating further, the senior PTI leader said the situation was tense on the country’s international borders and commercial activity, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had declined.
“Multinational companies have been leaving Pakistan. TTAP is the only platform from which a message can be given that things can be streamlined. In the conference, we will provide a solution for ongoing issues and outline the way forward,” he added.
The PTI, earlier this week, said that excluding the party founder from politics would only weaken the political system. Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock.
However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran.
Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply, marked by protests that frequently escalated into violence amid state repression.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10202641b0ff78e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960334/uae-cracks-down-on-visa-abuse-with-new-penalties-for-sheltering-infiltrators' target='_blank'><strong>UAE cracks down on visa abuse with new penalties for ‘sheltering infiltrators’</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced harsh penalties for residents sheltering or employing “infiltrators”, as the presence of unidentified or unregistered individuals can lead to security threats, UAE-based Gulf News reported.
The paper reported that harbouring or employing undocumented and illegal migrants carries significant risks, as “infiltrators may engage in illegal activities that threaten public security or help circumvent regulatory authorities”.
“Federal Law No 29 of 2021 on the Entry and Residence of Foreigners imposes strict penalties for this crime, setting fines starting from Dh100,000 and reaching up to Dh5 million in cases involving multiple offenders or organised networks, in addition to a minimum imprisonment term of two months,” Gulf News reported.
It added that legal liability extends to those who offer work, accommodation or support of any kind that enables them to stay in the country illegally.
Per the publication, Emirati law emphasises the importance of complying with the purpose for which a visa is issued — for tourism, work and others.
“Using a visa for purposes other than those intended — such as working while holding a visit or tourist visa — is considered a serious violation that disrupts public order and exposes the offender to legal accountability,” Gulf News reported, adding that this offence is punishable by a Dh10,000 fine.
The report added that enforcing immigration law extends beyond restrictions on entry and exit and covers the forgery of documents and “misuse” of residency credentials. Forgery, according to Gulf News, carries a punishment of 10 years’ imprisonment.
“These penalties reflect the state’s deep understanding of the dangers posed by individuals entering the UAE without completing legal procedures,” Gulf News reported.
“The presence of unidentified or unregistered individuals can lead to security threats that are difficult to detect, in addition to the risk of involvement in unlawful activities. Strict enforcement is therefore essential to ensuring societal stability and protecting both residents and citizens.”
On November 27, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
The additional secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” he warned.
The official said that currently, the UAE was only issuing visas to blue and diplomatic passport holders.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/102030001b419a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960333/australia-begins-enforcing-world-first-teen-social-media-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Australia begins enforcing world-first teen social media ban</strong></a><br><p>Australia on Wednesday became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticised by major technology companies and free-speech advocates.
Starting at midnight (1300 GMT on Tuesday), 10 of the largest platforms including TikTok, Alphabet’s YouTube and Meta’s Instagram and Facebook were ordered to block children or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($33 million) under the new law, which is being closely watched by regulators worldwide.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it “a proud day” for families and cast the law as proof that policymakers can curb online harms that have outpaced traditional safeguards.
“This will make an enormous difference. It is one of the biggest social and cultural changes that our nation has faced,” Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday.
“It’s a profound reform which will continue to reverberate around the world.”
Read a book instead, PM tells youngsters
In a video message, Albanese urged children to “start a new sport, new instrument, or read that book that has been sitting there for some time on your shelf,” ahead of Australia’s summer school break starting later this month.
Some of those below the cut-off age of 16 were anxious about adjusting to life without social media, but others were less concerned.
“I’m not really that emotional about it,” said 14-year-old Claire Ni. “I’m kind of just, like, neutral.” Luna Dizon, 15, said she still had access to her TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat accounts, but worried about “culture shock” once the ban took full effect.
“I think eventually, without (social media), we’ll learn how to adapt to it,” she added.
Teenager signs off with ‘see you when I’m 16’
While the government has said the ban would not be perfect in its operation, about 200,000 accounts were deactivated by Wednesday on TikTok alone, with “hundreds of thousands” more to be blocked in the next few days.
Many of the estimated 1 million children affected by the legislation also posted goodbye messages on social media.
“No more social media … no more contact with the rest of the world,” one teen wrote on TikTok.
“#seeyouwhenim16,” said another.
Others said they would learn how to get round the ban.
“It’s just kind of pointless, we’re just going to create new ways to get on these platforms, so what’s the point,” said 14-year-old Claire Ni.
Ban has global implications
The rollout caps a year of debate over whether any country could practically stop children from using platforms embedded in daily life, and begins a live test for governments frustrated that social media firms have been slow to implement harm-reduction measures.
“I’m happy that they want to protect kids, and I’m happy that we have a chance to see how they do it and see if we can learn from them,” said European Union lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, who wants to see greater protection for the bloc’s children.
Albanese’s centre-left government proposed the landmark law citing research showing harms to mental health from the overuse of social media among young teens, including misinformation, bullying and harmful depictions of body image. Several countries from Denmark to New Zealand to Malaysia have signalled they may study or emulate Australia’s model.
At a school in the German city of Bonn, students spoke favourably of a ban.
“Social media is highly addictive and doesn’t really have any real advantages. I mean, there are advantages, such as being able to spread your opinion, but I think the disadvantages, especially the addiction, are much worse,” said 15-year-old pupil Arian Klaar.
Julie Inman Grant, the US-born eSafety Commissioner who is overseeing the ban, told Reuters on Wednesday a groundswell of American parents wanted similar measures.
“I hear from the parents and the activists and everyday people in America, ‘we wish we had an eSafety commissioner like you in America, we wish we had a government that was going to put tween and teen safety before technology profits,’” she said in an interview at her office in Sydney.
‘Not our choice’: X says will comply
Elon Musk’s X became the last of the 10 major platforms to take measures to cut off access to underage teens after publicly acknowledging on Wednesday that it would comply.
“It’s not our choice - it’s what the Australian law requires,” X said on its website.
Australia has said the initial list of covered platforms would change as new products emerge and young users migrate.
Companies have told Canberra they will deploy a mix of age inference - estimating a user’s age from their behaviour - and age estimation based on a selfie, alongside checks that could include uploaded identification documents.
For social media businesses, the implementation marks a new era of structural stagnation as user numbers flatline and time spent on platforms shrinks, studies show.
Platforms say they earn little from advertising to under-16s, but warn the ban disrupts a pipeline of future users. Just before the ban took effect, 86% of Australians aged eight to 15 used social media, the government said.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10181844be9ac76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960329/collapse-of-two-buildings-in-moroccos-fez-kills-19' target='_blank'><strong>Collapse of two buildings in Morocco’s Fez kills 19</strong></a><br><p>Two four-storey buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez, killing at least 19 people, according to a provisional toll reported by the country’s official news agency on Wednesday.
“Sixteen other people were wounded, with varying degrees of severity,” the Maghreb Arabe Press (MAP) agency reported, adding that search operations were still ongoing to “save other people who may be buried under the rubble”.
The two adjacent structures, which housed eight families, collapsed overnight in the major northern city’s Al-Moustakbal neighbourhood, in the Al-Massira area, according to MAP.
Images from the pre-dawn scene showed first responders carrying a corpse in a grey body bag to waiting emergency vehicles, as residents gathered to watch the rescue efforts.
Other workers, using jackhammers and pickaxes, tried to dig through the rubble, occasionally assisted by mechanical excavators. Local authorities have indicated that the toll could rise in the coming hours.
MAP reported that safety officials had conducted “necessary preventative measures”, including securing the surrounding area and evacuating neighbouring buildings. The agency added that the injured were taken to Fez’s University Hospital Centre.

The accident was one of the deadliest of its kind in recent years. In February last year, five people died in the collapse of a house in Fez’s old city.
Nearly a decade ago, in 2016, there were two deadly building collapses within the span of a week. One was a home in the western city of Marrakech that killed two children, while the other was a four-storey building that killed four people and injured two dozen more.
In 2014, three buildings in the western city of Casablanca collapsed, killing 23 people.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1019520980c55a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960312/war-of-words-between-pti-and-ruling-coaltion-continues-pml-ns-ikhtiar-wali-says-things-have-reached-point-of-no-return' target='_blank'><strong>War of words between PTI and ruling coaltion continues; PML-N’s Ikhtiar Wali says ‘things have reached point of no return’</strong></a><br><p>The war of words between members of the PTI and ruling coalition continued on Wednesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in recent days after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6, in response to Imran’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Politicians from various parties have rallied behind the armed forces since, chastising the PTI. Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution calling for a ban on Imran and his party, terming them “anti-state”.
‘Things have reached a point of no return’
Earlier today, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that “things have reached a point of no return”.
Addressing a press conference, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.”
“All doors to talks are now closed,” Wali said.
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour, and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what [else] can be done”.
Wali alleged that “PTI, in its four years in power, had done nothing,” challenging the party to “show at least one university, hospital or dam” they built.
“It was a blessing from God that the Centre, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan have remained safe from the PTI’s dirty politics,” he remarked, warning that the government “will now set KP free as well.”
‘Common sense should prevail’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then […] We sat in Parliament, believing that our voices will be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties will be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years.
But, he continued, “at some point, common sense should prevail”.
Seemingly referring to the bar on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he added: “If you keep parents in jail, […] how can the children sit together with you? And if you don’t understand this, then probably the public will make you understand.”
He again stressed that the use of force would not yield any results. “Common sense should prevail.”
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” In this connection, he also claimed that Imran had the support of at least 70 per cent people in the country.
“Don’t enrage the people of Pakistan,” he warned, adding that “we haven’t done anything in violation of the Constitution”.
He emphasised that meetings with Imran should be allowed, pointing out that the high court had also issued an order, directing that meetings with the former prime minister be permitted.
“If you create hurdles [in this regard], then we don’t know what your intentions are. But if you get a response from the other side, the country and democracy would suffer a loss,” he warned, adding that whether the government did not want the PTI to sit in Parliament.
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
‘Meeting necessary for dialogue’
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside Parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan.
“How can we negotiate without his permission?”
Referring to the PTI’s sit-in outside the Adiala jail the previous night for Imran’s visitation rights and the alleged use of force by authorities to disperse the protesters, he said the leg of PTI parliamentary leader in the National Assembly Shahid Khattak “had been broken”.
He warned, “If the public rises, everything will burn down. Before destruction strikes, we should move towards dialogue.” And for that, he reiterated, meetings with the PTI founder should be allowed.
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “national conference” on December 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.“
Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adialia jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
Moreover, he demanded that merit should be considered in cases concerning Imran, further stating: “We are united; we will not be afraid.”
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addresses a press conference, assailing the PTI its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give General Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?”
The senior minister stressed that PTI’s narrative “hinged only on the release of Imran and the party coming back into power,” adding that “they did not care about the common people.”
PTI’s ‘venomous rhetoric should be recognised abroad’: Aun Chaudhry
Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakistanis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these groups,” Chaudhry said.
“I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong,” he urged.
“Our country is progressing towards success, but this group is creating such an environment,” the minister said.
He continued: “It’s tweeting against the military leadership, sometimes against the government, who is getting it done? Who is the mastermind behind it? Whoever is behind it does not want peace in this country. They don’t want this country to progress.”
“Don’t you think about the martyred soldier and his orphaned kids? Don’t you pay heed that the soldier sacrifices his life and leaves his own kids as orphans so that other kids don’t become orphans? So that we can enjoy a sound sleep?” the minister questioned.
“We have a secure border and a secure future because our armed forces are backing us,” Chaudhry added.

Qureshi was hospitalised last month at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute for gallbladder stone complications, where he underwent a successful procedure to remove the stone.
Umer said he was discharged from the hospital after his condition improved, while tests were conducted, and their reports would be released in 15 days.
The PTI leader has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023, riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023.
In July 2024, the PTI leader was indicted by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.
The same month, he was transferred from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi to Kot Lakhpat on a police request. It had stated that frequent transportation of the PTI leader from Rawalpindi to Lahore was not feasible for the authorities as well as for the jailed ex-minister.</p><small>2025-12-10 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10172717da931a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960324/controversial-social-media-posts-case-sc-to-hear-imaans-plea-on-ihcs-denial-of-relief-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial social media posts case: SC to hear Imaan’s plea on IHC’s denial of relief tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court (SC) will take up on Thursday (December 11) the application of lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, seeking an early hearing of her plea for a stay in the trial of the controversial social media post case.
On December 4, Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were facing trial before the additional sessions judge and Peca (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016) special judge in the controversial tweets case. On December 1, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) denied the couple ad-interim relief of staying the trial. They appealed the IHC order before the SC through their counsel, Faisal Siddiqi.
In their subsequent application from December 4, the petitioners pleaded that the criminal trial against them was at its concluding stage and therefore, extreme urgency in the matter was required. The application also pleaded that the petitioners filed a criminal revision before the IHC to question the trial proceedings in view of violations of due process as prescribed under CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in the absence of the petitioners.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge SC bench also consisting of Justices Salahuddin Panwhar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim will hear the plea.
The application argued that the petitioners have a clear prima facie case because the recording of evidence in their absence was not only a violation of Section 353 (evidence to be taken in the presence of the accused) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), but also their due process and fair trial rights under Article 10A of the Constitution.
“As the criminal trial is at its concluding stage, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioners because the prosecution would not be prejudiced if the trial is delayed for two weeks,” the application argued.
However, the criminal revision application filed by the couple before the IHC would be rendered unnecessary, due to the lack of ad-interim relief to stay the trial.
Mazari and Chatha would suffer irreparable loss, not only because the criminal revision application would become infructuous, but because of the violations of due process and principles of fair trial in the trial proceedings.
“It is obvious and apparent that this unfair trial is leading to a criminal conviction of the petitioners,” the application stated.
“The November 29 order of the additional sessions judge and Peca special judge clearly showed that the trial was at the stage of recording a statement under Section 342 (power to examine the accused) of the CrPC, and there was a clear and present danger that this trial would lead to the criminal conviction of the petitioners. Thus, the present criminal appeal will become infructuous,” the application argued.
“In terms of Section 7 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, it is expressly stated that any application pleading urgency will be fixed for hearing within a period of 14 days,” the application pleaded.
It further argued that this is a criminal appeal involving the liberty of the petitioners and therefore should be treated urgently as per the SC’s policy on urgent applications, the application pleaded.
“Failing an urgency being allowed by this court, the interest of justice will seriously be prejudiced and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioners in the form of possible criminal convictions,” the application argued.
The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chatha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case, in which both denied the charges.
The complaint had accused Mazari of having disseminated and “propagated narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for re-posting some posts of his wife.
According to the appeal, the complainants disclosed no specific allegations and cherry-picked a few posts made by the petitioners on social media platform X, as far back as 2021.</p><small>2025-12-10 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10130334680927a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960310/russian-bombers-join-chinese-air-patrol-near-japan-as-tokyo-beijing-ties-strain' target='_blank'><strong>Russian bombers join Chinese air patrol near Japan as Tokyo-Beijing ties strain</strong></a><br><p>Japan has scrambled jets to monitor Russian and Chinese air forces conducting joint patrols around the country, the Japanese defence ministry said late Tuesday, amid rising tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.
Two Russian Tu-95 nuclear-capable strategic bombers flew from the Sea of Japan toward the East China Sea to rendezvous with two Chinese H-6 bombers, and performed a “long-distance joint flight” in the Pacific, the ministry said.
Four Chinese J-16 fighter jets joined the bombers as they made a round-trip flight between Japan’s Okinawa and Miyako islands, it added. The Miyako Strait between the two islands is classified as international waters.
Japan also detected simultaneous Russian air force activity in the Sea of Japan, consisting of one early-warning aircraft A-50 and two Su-30 fighters, the ministry said.
Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said in a post on X on Wednesday that the Russian and Chinese joint operations were “clearly intended as a show of force against our nation, which is a serious concern for our national security.” 
Japan’s fighter jets “strictly implemented air defence identification measures,” Koizumi added.
Russian news agencies reported that the Russian-Chinese joint flight near Japan lasted for eight hours, citing Moscow’s defence ministry.
South Korea’s military also said on Tuesday that seven Russian planes and two Chinese planes had entered its air defence zone.
Japan said on Sunday that Chinese carrier-launched fighter jets aimed radar at Japanese military aircraft a day earlier, an claim Beijing disputed.
Beijing’s rising military actions near Japan follow Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comment last month that Tokyo could respond to any Chinese military action against Taiwan that also threatened Japan’s security.
China and Russia have been ramping up military cooperation in recent years elsewhere, conducting joint operations such as an anti-missile training on Russian territory and live-fire naval exercises in the South China Sea.</p><small>2025-12-10 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10160331e5cb47d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960318/3-day-basant-festival-to-kick-off-from-feb-6-2026-in-lahore-azma' target='_blank'><strong>3-day Basant festival to kick off from Feb 6, 2026, in Lahore: Azma</strong></a><br><p>A three-day Basant festival would kick off in Lahore from February 6, 2026, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event of celebration, colours, and kite-flying after 18 years, with strict regulations.
The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
“The Basant festival will be held in Lahore from Feb 6 to 8, 2026,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told Dawn on Wednesday.
The festival would be “completely safe, regulated, and strictly monitored,” she added.
In a post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said, “CM Punjab Maryam Nawaz has approved the revival of our beloved Heritage Basant Festival on February 6th, 7th and 8th, celebrated across Lahore after 25 years, a tradition rooted in history and admired worldwide.“
On CM Punjab’s directions, a city-wide campaign to install safety antennas on all motorbikes would start tomorrow, she said, adding that “every motorbike in Lahore will have an antenna for safety before and during Basant.”
“Spring returns to the city of heritage and festivals. Lahore’s skies will speak in colour again, reclaiming our glory for the world,“ she added.







Bokhari said, “Strict conditions have been imposed to prevent any potential loss of life during the three-day Basant festival.”
Last week, the Punjab government lifted the ban on Basant celebration thro­ugh an ordinance — the Punjab Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025.
Under the ordinance, police officers of the rank of sub-inspector were empowered to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants on credible information.
The ordinance has been submitted to the Punjab Assembly for enactment.
Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Historically, in the 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh held an annual Basant fair and introduced kite flying as a regular feature. The association of kite flying with Basant soon became a tradition centred in Lahore, which remains the regional hub of the festival throughout Punjab even today. However, the festival has also traditionally been celebrated in other parts of Punjab, including Indian Punjab. Over time, the festival began to be celebrated across the country.
During the festival, the city sky is filled with colourful kites of all shapes and sizes flown from rooftops. The kites are controlled with strings usually embedded with thin shards of glass, which help cut the threads of competing kites more effectively.</p><small>2025-12-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10160900cc242aa.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960316/machado-will-be-in-oslo-for-nobel-peace-prize-nobel-institute-says' target='_blank'><strong>Machado will be in Oslo for Nobel Peace Prize, Nobel institute says</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela’s Maria Corina Machado is safe and will be in Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in a statement on Wednesday.
Earlier, the organisers said the Venezuelan opposition leader, who lives in hiding, will not attend Wednesday’s Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and the award will be accepted by her daughter.
Machado has only been seen once in public since going underground in August last year, amidst a tense showdown with President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuela’s attorney general has said the 58-year-old would be considered a “fugitive” if she left the country to accept the award.
It was not known in the hours before the ceremony whether Machado was in Norway for the event due to start at 1pm (5pm PKT). The Nobel Institute finally confirmed that she would not be there.
“It will be her daughter Ana Corina Machado who will receive the prize in her mother’s name,” Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken told Norway’s NRK radio. “Her daughter will give the speech that Maria Corina herself wrote.” Harpviken said he “simply” did not know where Machado was.
Few people were informed of Machado’s movements because of the nature of Maduro’s “repressive regime, which is willing to use absolutely all means against the opposition”, he said, noting that she “lives under a death threat from the regime”.
Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, are in Norway for the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.
‘Fugitive’ laureate
While organisers said Machado had previously indicated she would attend, suspicions had already been raised when a traditional press conference with the award winner on Tuesday was first postponed and then cancelled.
Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, which she was banned from. Her claim is backed by much of the international community.
Machado has been hailed for her efforts in favour of democracy, but she has also been criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel Prize.
The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug smuggling boats.
Maduro insists that the goal of the US operations —  which Machado has said are justified —  is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.
Since going into hiding, her only public appearance was on January 9 in Caracas, where she protested against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.
The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.
Machado was awarded the Nobel on October 10 for her efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, challenging Maduro’s iron-fisted rule since 2013.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said last month the opposition leader would be considered a “fugitive” if she travelled to Norway to accept the prize.
“By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,” Saab told AFP, adding that she is accused of “acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism”.
“It has happened multiple times in the history of the Peace Prize that the laureate has been prevented from attending the ceremony, and on those occasions it’s always been the case that close family members of the laureate will receive the prize and give the lecture in the place of the laureate,” Harpviken explained this week.
Doubts had been raised about how Machado would return to Venezuela.“She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialised in Latin America at the University of Oslo.
On the other hand, “she is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change, and she would gradually lose political influence,” she added.
Both pro- and anti-Machado protests are expected in Oslo on Wednesday.
The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics will receive their prizes at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-12-10 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/101049117339d9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960297/pakistans-population-challenge-deepens-as-growth-slows-but-numbers-keep-rising-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s population challenge deepens as growth slows but numbers keep rising: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s population has crossed an estimated 257 million at midyear, placing it among the world’s most populous nations even as its fertility and growth rates continue to decline, according to a report released by the US Census Bureau on Tuesday.
Demographic databases, including projections by the US Census Bureau and the United Nations, show Pakistan’s population density at 333 persons per square kilometre, underscoring the scale of pressure on land and public services.
The data depict a country facing one of the most complex population transitions in South Asia — caught between rapid numerical expansion and slow human-development gains.

 

Despite decades of policy debate, Pakistan is still adding millions of people each year. Its annual population growth rate stands at 1.82 per cent, lower than in previous decades but high enough to keep total numbers rising steeply for at least another generation, the report said,
It added that the total fertility rate (TFR) — the average number of births per woman — has fallen to 3.25, yet remains well above the replacement level of 2.1, ensuring continued expansion through what demographers describe as population momentum.

 

At the same time, social indicators remain weak. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 60.5 years, among the lowest in the region, while the under-five mortality rate stands at nearly 65 deaths per 1,000 live births, reflecting persistent shortcomings in maternal health, child nutrition, disease prevention and primary healthcare access, per the report.
Together, these figures underline the uneven nature of Pakistan’s demographic transition, in which family size is shrinking faster than improvements in health and longevity.
How Pakistan compares with its neighbours
A regional comparison highlights the scale of Pakistan’s challenge. India, now the world’s most populous country with about 1.46–1.47 billion people, has already crossed below replacement fertility, with a TFR of around 1.9.
While India’s absolute numbers will continue to rise for several decades due to its large youth cohort, its growth rate is slowing rapidly, and attention is shifting toward labour-force ageing, pension systems and productivity.
Bangladesh, often cited as a demographic success story, has pushed fertility down to around replacement level despite extreme land pressure. With a population of about 175–176m packed into one of the world’s highest population densities, Bangladesh has achieved sharp declines in child mortality and steady gains in life expectancy, largely through female education, family planning outreach and primary healthcare investments.
In contrast, Pakistan, with far more land per person, continues to lag on several of these indicators.
Afghanistan, at the other extreme, remains trapped in a high-growth, high-mortality cycle. With a population now estimated at over 44m, fertility remains above four births per woman, while child mortality and life expectancy are among the worst in the region.
Afghanistan’s demographic trajectory resembles Pakistan’s own profile from several decades ago, reinforcing how conflict and weak state institutions delay demographic transition.
A young country under immediate strain
Pakistan’s population structure remains heavily weighted toward the young. A broad base of children and working-age youth means that pressure on schools, universities, housing, transport and employment will intensify through the 2030s and 2040s. Even as fertility declines, the large size of today’s child and teenage population guarantees continued high demand for jobs and public services for decades.
Economists warn that without sustained economic growth and large-scale job creation, this youth bulge could become a source of long-term instability rather than a demographic dividend. Urban centres are already showing the strain through informal housing expansion, transport congestion and widening access gaps in health and education.
The global backdrop: growth slows everywhere
Globally, the world’s population continues to grow, but at its slowest pace in modern history. With the global total now exceeding eight billion, projections suggest that the world population will approach nine billion by the late 2030s and may peak near the end of the century before stabilising or declining.
This slowdown is being driven by sharp fertility declines across East Asia, Europe and much of Latin America, with even South Asia now firmly on the same downward path.
An unfinished transition
Demographers note that Pakistan is now at a critical midpoint of its demographic transition. Fertility is declining, but not fast enough to reduce near-term population stress. Mortality is falling, but not fast enough to lift life expectancy to regional standards. Meanwhile, urbanisation is accelerating without the infrastructure needed to support it.
Without major gains in girls’ education, reproductive healthcare, nutrition, clean water, and employment, Pakistan risks entering the second half of the century with both an ageing population and weak human capital — a combination that could severely strain public finances, pension systems and healthcare services.
Experts argue that the coming two decades will be decisive. If investments in health, education and economic productivity accelerate, Pakistan could still convert its youth bulge into sustained growth. If not, the same numbers could amplify unemployment, migration pressures and fiscal strain well into the latter half of the century.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1012061053eef9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960305/ecp-rejects-cm-bugtis-plea-for-postponement-of-local-govt-polls-in-quetta-elections-to-be-held-on-dec-28' target='_blank'><strong>ECP rejects CM Bugti’s plea for postponement of local govt polls in Quetta; elections to be held on Dec 28</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) rejected on Wednesday Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti’s petition seeking the postponement of local government elections in Quetta that were scheduled to be held on December 28.
Bugti had filed the petition on Monday, and informed sources told Dawn that he cited the precarious law and order situation in the provincial capital and the suspension of internet services as reasons for postponing the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) elections.
In its written order today, seen by Dawn, the ECP said the plea was being rejected for “being devoid of force” and that the electoral body had decided to hold local government elections in Quetta on the already scheduled date of Dec 28.
However, in the majority decision, one of the six members of the commission that considered the plea was in favour of the postponement of local government elections.
In its order, the ECP directed the Balochistan government to assist the commission and “all other functionaries who have been entrusted responsibilities for the conduct of local government elections in District Quetta in every possible manner”.
It also instructed that “foolproof security arrangements” be made for the safety and security of voters, contesting candidates, the general public and polling staff, as well as to ensure the smooth conduct of polls in Quetta.
ECP, in its order, noted that the chief minister had filed an appeal on Dec 8 seeking the postponement of elections, stating that elections should be rescheduled to a time when “when weather, security, administrative preparedness, constituency demarcation & voter rolls accuracy are ensured.”
The commission took up the matter on Dec 9 for a review, it said.
Addressing “irregularities” regarding constituency demarcation, ECP clarified that, “the process of delimitation of constituencies was completed after observing all legal processes, i.e. publication of preliminary list of constituencies for inviting proposals, objections on preliminary lists and the same was finalised after hearing and deciding the objections/representations.”
It also recalled a Balochistan High Court (BHC) order, which on October 10, had dismissed petitions filed on the same ground and directed the commission to hold elections “as soon as possible.”
ECP further maintained that “the appellant has wrongly calculated the term of expiry of local government elections in Balochistan”.
“As per Section 26 of the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, the term of local government election is for four [years]. In the present case, the members and chairman/vice chairman of union councils, municipal committees and municipal corporations took oath on February 9, 2023, for which the expiry of term is February 9, 2027.
“However, the members and chairman/ vice chairman of district councils took oath on July 6, 2023, for which the term of expiry is July 5, 2027.”
The order added that the commission had “carried out the process of reconciliation of electoral rolls wherever required to adjust voters in accordance with census blocks, wards and delimitation through door-to-door verifications”.
“For the purpose, vide publicity was given to facilitate the voters and inspiring contesting candidates for registration and transfer of their votes,” it said, adding that the election schedule was issued after the completion of this process.
The order noted that ECP had completed the delimitation process “twice” and “after a number of meetings with the provincial government of Balochistan, issued the election programs twice”.
However, the elections could not be held despite “efforts” of the commission, the order noted.
On the matter of law and order situation and harsh weather, the ECP recalled a request made by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government in Oct 2021 — on the same grounds — where the Supreme Court (SC) had upheld the electoral body’s decision to proceed with the elections.
The SC directed the provincial government to proceed with the local government elections in the case.
It also noted that the “process of printing of ballot papers has been already started, and [the] maximum number of ballot papers have been printed out.”
In his dissenting note, ECP member Shah Muhammad Jatoi, while agreeing with the commission’s decision on delimitation, electoral rolls and term, maintained that harsh weather conditions could lead to a “low” voter turnout as most residents during December “migrate from the district (Quetta) to [other] districts”.
He further noted: “I am also of the considered view that the law and order situation in the province of Balochistan is not conducive for [the] conduct of local government elections in the present scenario.”
Quetta local polls
The Balochistan government had previously requested the election commission on November 2 as well to postpone the polls in Quetta, citing similar reasons. However, the request was turned down a day later.
Prior to that on Oct 6, a bench of the BHC had rejected constitutional petitions filed by numerous individuals regarding the postponement of the elections and directed the election commissioner of Balochistan to hold the local government elections as soon as possible.
In view of the BHC orders, the election commission had started preparation for holding elections in Quetta and announced the schedule for it on November 13.
Elections will now be held in 172 union councils and 641 wards, with 2,710 candidates contesting the elections in Quetta district.
The previous local bodies, elected in 2015, had completed their tenure on January 27, 2019.
Under the Elections Act 2017, local body elections should be held within 120 days after the expiry of the term. However, the polls were held in May 2022, more than three years after the expiry of the previous term.
The delay primarily resulted from a lack of consensus among political parties over proposed amendments to the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, and issues concerning the delimitation of constituencies.
The LG elections in two major districts with sizeable urban populations in the province, Quetta and Lasbela, were delayed because of issues with the delimitation of wards.
While the LG elections in Lasbela were held at the end of 2022, the elections in Quetta could not be held due to pending litigation in the BHC over the delimitation of wards in the district.</p><small>2025-12-10 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10111559561ef9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960300/mob-torches-water-tanker-after-collision-leaves-motorcyclist-dead-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Mob torches water tanker after collision leaves motorcyclist dead in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>A man riding a motorcycle was killed on Wednesday morning after a water tanker collided with his vehicle in Karachi, prompting a mob to torch the tanker.
According to a statement by Khawaja Ajmer Nagri police, the incident took place near 4k Chowrangi in North Karachi.
The statement said the motorcyclist sustained severe injuries in the accident, following which he was rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
The tanker’s driver managed to escape, leaving his vehicle. The tanker was then set on fire by a mob, the statement added.
Separately, a bus ran over a 45-year-old woman in the Baldia-8 area of Karachi on Wednesday morning, a statement by Saeedabad police said.
The body was rushed to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, it said, adding that the driver and conductor of the bus managed to escape.
Today’s incidents come two days after a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi.
Last month, angered citizens also set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it met with an accident, resulting in the death of a man. His wife was injured in the incident.</p><small>2025-12-10 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10113152b6e2ad0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960301/ihc-grants-10-day-protective-bail-to-youtuber-rajab-butt-tiktoker-nadeem-nani-wala-after-they-surrender-in-court' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants 10-day protective bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt, TikToker Nadeem Nani Wala after they surrender in court</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt and TikToker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, on Wednesday in multiple cases related to gambling apps, cybercrime and other allegations after they surrendered before the court.
Justice Raja Inam Ameen Minhas approved the bail after the social media influencers appeared before the IHC after reaching Pakistan from the United Kingdom.
The development comes a day after the IHC granted protective bail to the two till December 10 (today), in response to a petition filed by Butt and Mubarak’s relatives, to ensure the content creators were not arrested upon their arrival in Pakistan.
Their counsel informed the court yesterday that Butt and Mubarak had been abroad for several months and feared arrest upon landing at Islamabad International Airport.
He argued that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other departments had registered several cases against them, but under the law the petitioners were entitled to seek relief from the relevant forum before any arrest.
After hearing the arguments, the court approved one-day protective bail and restrained the authorities from arresting the petitioners at the airport. The judge further directed both influencers to appear before the IHC today to mark their presence so that proceedings in the pending cases could move forward.
Meanwhile, it was also reported that Butt was being deported from the UK after British authorities cancelled his visa. However, his lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq said in a post on social media platform X that the YouTuber had not been deported from the UK and was returning to Pakistan of his own free will.







Cases against social media influencers
According to official records, the two are nominated in several FIRs registered under various cybercrime provisions, including allegations related to operating or promoting gambling applications, misuse of digital platforms and online harassment. The FIA had earlier issued multiple notices, but their stay abroad meant no substantial progress could be made in the investigations.
In September this year, Butt was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for allegedly promoting online gambling apps on social media.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car.
On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, IK-804, which is said to be the prisoner number allotted to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, in March, Butt was also booked under blasphemy and cybercrime laws due to a “religious stir” caused by the launch of his perfume brand that allegedly mocked Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Butt launched his “295” perfume, which refers to the namesake blasphemy law in the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last December, the YouTuber found himself in legal trouble when he was arrested for illegally keeping a lion cub and weapons at his residence. He pleaded guilty in January this year to owning an undocumented wild animal after accepting the cub as a wedding gift.
He avoided jail by promising a judge to post animal rights videos for a year.</p><small>2025-12-10 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10092833377e6d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960239/na-body-orders-review-of-mobile-phone-taxes' target='_blank'><strong>NA body orders review of mobile phone taxes</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Tuesday directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to prepare a report on tax rates for mobile phones, covering policy options, economic impact, international comparisons, and proposed revisions.
The directive came from the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, who expressed displeasure over rising taxes on mobile phones, noting that these institutions have wrongly classified mobile phones as luxury items.
The chairman urged both the FBR and Tax Policy Office to review current tax rates on mobile phone imports under the personal baggage and registration schemes. Mr Qamar said the report should be prepared by March 2026, enabling the committee to examine the matter comprehensively ahead of the next budget.

 

MNA Qasim Gilani criticised the heavy taxes on mobile phones, noting that consumers are forced to pay taxes again if their phones are lost or stolen. He highlighted that smartphones are already very expensive, citing a tax of Rs35,000 on older iPhone 6 models and Rs100,000 on iPhone 12 imports. “People are using smartphones for content creation, video sharing, and e-commerce,” he said, stressing their role in livelihoods.

FBR chairman claims smartphone taxes, prices have declined overall

MNA Sharmila Faruqi pointed out that the latest iPhone costs Rs350,000, with an additional tax burden of Rs190,000. FBR officials clarified that levies are applied on the price of devices rather than on specific models.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig said that a clear mechanism for taxation is essential, rejecting the notion that smartphones are exclusively for the wealthy.
The PTA chairman informed the committee that only six per cent of high-end phones are imported, while the majority are locally manufactured. He also announced that 5G licences are expected to be issued by February-March next year.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that smartphone prices and taxes have declined overall, except for a few major brands. He reported that Rs82 billion in tax revenue was generated from mobile phones in the last fiscal year.
The committee suggested placing smartphones under the Eighth Schedule to provide relief to consumers. Tax officials explained that the Ninth Schedule currently applies to telecom, while the Eighth Schedule offers concessions. They added that, apart from Apple, most smartphones are now manufactured domestically.
