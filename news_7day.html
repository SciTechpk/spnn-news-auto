After KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur led a multi-party conference, attended by the leaders of Jamat-i-Islami, Qaumi Watan Party, JUI-S, PML-N and PTI-Parliamentarian, a delegation of tribal leaders also met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The meeting between the PM and tribal elders was also attended by JUI-F emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman and KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
 
 

“The meeting was aimed at countering the surge of terrorism with the help of tribal elders,” a participant of the meeting told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.

In meeting with jirga, premier restores admission quota of students from ex-Fata

The prime minister announced a number of incentives for the merged tribal areas, but the meeting categorically ruled out the reversal of the former Fata’s merger with KP.
During the meeting, Federal Minister for Safron and Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam reiterated the federal government had no intention to roll back the merger or alter the existing constitutional arrangement.
 
 

It is important to note the tribal elders have expressed grievances over the mer­ger and Mr Rehman, the JUI-F leader, had called the move “a big mistake”.
Mr Muqam, who heads the committee to revive the jirga system in tribal areas, said the body will make recommendations within the existing constitutional framework on matters concerning justice, development and security.
“There is no plan to withdraw [the merger] or amend the Constitution”, Mr Muqam told the jirga members who had voiced concerns over the committee’s mandate.
The PM also assured the tribal elders the committee’s TORs will be enhanced and they will be given representation in it.
“The committee will now include representation from tribal elders to ensure inclusive decision-making,” said a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
Admission quota
The PM also announced the admission quota for students from tribal areas in the federal government’s universities will be restored.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that tribespeople have rendered “immense sacrifices for the peace and security of Pakistan”.
He reaffirmed that ensuring law and order in the merged areas was among the government’s top priorities.
The PM paid tribute to the armed forces, police and other law enforcement personnel for their bravery in fighting terrorism, and urged unity among all communities.
Highlighting the government’s commitment to the socio-economic uplift of the region, the PM said his government was investing heavily in education, healthcare, skills training, and employment opportunities for the youth of the merged districts.
He said substantial funds have been allocated for improving infrastructure, including the Fata University and police.
The PM directed an expansion in the scope of the federal committee working on the issues of merged districts, chaired by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam.
The tribal delegation appreciated the restoration of educational quotas, inclusion in the federal committee, and overall developmental initiatives.
The premier assured the participants that such consultative sessions would be held regularly to ensure that the voices of the tribal people are heard and their issues addressed effectively.
Meeting with Gilani
Earlier, the 90-member tribal jirga, led by Governor Kundi, met Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani.
The Jirga included prominent tribal elders, including Dr Alamzeb Mohmand, Malik Khan Marjan Wazir, and Bismillah Khan Afridi.
Mr Gilani said cooperation from tribal elders was vital to achieve lasting peace.
He announced the issues of the merged districts will be discussed in the Senate to formulate a clear and comprehensive national policy.
Governor Kundi highlighted the merged districts were assured a three per cent share in the NFC Award under the Accelerated Implementation Programme.
However, the commitment has not been fully implemented and the federal government has often allocated amounts lower than originally pledged.

NEWLY elected PTI senators Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Noor ul Haq Qadri and Faisal Javed take oath.—White Star

• Resolution rejects justification for such crimes on cultural grounds
• House passes Whistleblower Protection Commission Bill, okays 20pc reward for exposing corruption
• Navy Ordinance amended with stricter penalties for misconduct
• Eight new senators sworn in
ISLAMABAD: Alarmed by a brutal act of vigilante justice in Balochistan, where a man and woman were executed in broad daylight under a jirga verdict in the name of “honour”, the Senate on Thursday called for an immediate and transparent investigation to bring all perpetrators — inclu­ding those who convened or sanctioned the jirga — to justice.
In a resolution adopted almost unanimously, the Senate declared that so-called honour killings were not “honourable”, rather constituted murder under the law and must be prosecuted as such.
The resolution, tabled by PPP parliamentary leader Senator Sherry Rehman, was supported by all parties across the aisle except JUI-F, which refused to sign.
 
 

Lawmakers stressed that the rule of law could not be selectively applied and that tribal or informal justice systems must not override constitutional protections and due process.
The resolution rejected any justification of such crimes on cultural, tribal or traditional grounds and condemned attempts to legitimise them under the guise of “ghairat” (honour), describing them as victim-blaming.
The resolution recalled previous legislative reforms aimed at curbing honour crimes, particularly by disallowing compoundability or conciliation in such cases. However, it expressed concern that despite these legal safeguards, implementation remains weak and justice is often subverted, especially in high-profile cases targeting women.
The House stressed that law enforcement agencies must treat such cases strictly under the relevant provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, without compromise or discretion.
It also urged the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Mini­stry of Human Rights to conduct a thorough review of the enforcement gaps in existing laws dealing with the so-called honour crimes and reco­­mm­end actionable reforms.
 
 

“This premeditated act of vigilante murders constitutes an abhorrent crime; it is a gross violation of human rights, the Constitution and the laws of Pakistan,” it said.
Whistleblower commission
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was the passage of a bill to establish an independent Whistleblower Protection and Vigilance Commission, aiming to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, promising a reward for those exposing corruption in public institutions.
As per the bill, the Commission will have civil court powers to assess complaints and conduct judicial proceedings. Whistle­blowers will be entitled to 20 per cent of any recovered amount and a certificate of appreciation.
However, submitting false or frivolous information will carry a penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs200,000, which will be paid to the falsely accused. Those facing retaliation can seek redressal from the Commission, whose orders will be binding.
The whistleblower’s identity will remain confidential unless disclosed with written consent. Violators will face fines of up to Rs500,000 and imprisonment of up to two years.
Law ministry officials noted that the existing 2017 law lacked effective enforcement mechanisms. The new Commission, headquartered in Islamabad, will operate autonomously and may set up offices across Pakistan if needed. It will consist of at least three members, including a chairperson, with the government authorised to expand membership when required.
Navy Ordinance amendments
The Senate also passed the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, allowing the Navy to engage in activities linked to national development or strategic interests with federal or provincial consent.
The relevant naval authority may retire or discharge any individual and has the right to accept or reject resignations. In times of war, individuals over 60 years of age may be retained in service upon the recommendation of the naval chief.
According to the bill, officers who fail to defend ships and other assets may face the death penalty or long-term imprisonment. Refusal to fight in the event of an attack, cowardice or abandoning a ship in danger may also lead to similar punishments.
Naval personnel involved in extortion or corruption will face lengthy jail terms, as will those who accept bribes, agree to bribery or cause harm or favouritism.
Disclosing official information could lead to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment, and if the information harms national security or the armed forces, the individual will be tried under the Official Secrets Act.
One of the amendments reads, “A person who is or has been subject to this Ordinance commits an offence under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Act XL of 2016) or relevant electronic, digital, social media laws, with the mala fide intention to undermine, ridicule, or scandalise, the armed forces of Pakistan, may be proceeded under this Ordinance and on conviction by a court constituted under this Ordinance, shall be punished in the prescribed manner with the same punishments as provided for in the said Act XL of 2016 or such other laws, as the case may be.”
Meanwhile, Minister for Power Awais Leghari dismissed reports that Nepra had approved a multi-year tariff for K-Electric to recover its losses from consumers. Responding to a calling-attention notice by Senator Faisal Sabzwari, he explained that the reports related to the 2023-24 financial year, when the current government was not in power.
Sworn in
In a separate development, eight of the 11 recently elected senators from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took the oath of office on Thursday, hours after the ECP issued their victory notifications. Those who were sworn in on Thursday included Noorul Haq Qadri, Faisal Javed Khan, Rubina Khalid, Talha Mehmood, Niaz Ahmed, Dilawar Khan, Attaul Haq and Mirza Muhammad Afridi.

• Salman Akram Raja asks people to express discontent on Aug 5 as per law, says Imran being denied legal help
• MWM chief warns govt against obstructing protest, says will not stay silent in face of injustice
ISLAMABAD: Almost a week after finalising its formal structure, a six-party opposition alliance — including the PTI —said it will organise a multi-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and Aug 1 to discuss the “deepening constitutional and political crises” and restore “true democratic representation”.
In a press conference held in the federal capital on Thursday, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, flanked by other alliance leaders, said it was time for a “serious” national dialogue to steer the country out of the troubled waters.
Mr Achakzai emphasised the conference would not be “symbolic”, saying it would bring together political parties, civil society and even “representatives from institutions” to find a lasting and durable solution to the problems facing the country. “From Gilgit-Baltistan to Gwadar, we will mobilise, street by street, door to door — but without violence and abuse because this struggle is principled and constitutional,” he added.
He said the opposition alliance was not formed for “political theatrics” but to restore true democratic representation through a neutral election commission, adding that it was the ‘first alliance’ not manufactured by the intelligence agencies.
Mr Achakzai criticised the ruling coalition for using force to suppress political opponents.
He demanded a neutral election watchdog to ensure fair representation, saying Pakistan must be governed by the ballot, not force. According to Mr Achakzai, the Shehbaz-led government has imposed control through force, which is undemocratic and unacceptable.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI Secre­tary General Salman Akram Raja said that as per PTI founder Imran Khan’s instructions, it was not just PTI’s movement but a movement representing every oppressed voice in Pakistan. “Today, we speak for all those denied justice and silenced by fear,” he said, adding that the TTAP was a “peaceful, constitutional and ideological” movement.
He asserted that Pakistan could not be run by force, as the only way forward was constitutionalism, democracy, and justice. “We urge the people to peacefully express their discontent on August 5, within constitutional bounds. This is a lawful call — no one should exploit it to justify state repression,” he said while referring to the PTI’s planned protest on Aug 5 marking the second anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment.
 
 

Mr Raja claimed that Imran Khan was being subjected to a jail trial without access to his legal team. “I, as his lawyer, was deliberately prevented from participating in the proceedings which was a gross violation of due process and judicial transparency,” he maintained.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Nasir Abbas said if democracy truly existed in Pakistan, the controversial decision regarding the reserved seats would not have been made.
He said he was disappointed that no other political party had condemned these decisions, as he accused the ‘system’ of playing a vile game with the public.
The MWM chief stressed that although the alliance did not believe in armed struggle, it would not remain silent in the face of injustice.
He announced plans for a countrywide protest on August 5, warning the government against any attempts to obstruct their demonstration.
Furthermore, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram denounced the government’s approach ahead of the party’s planned protest movement on August 5.
He condemned the issuance of warrants for the arrest of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, former president Dr Arif Alvi and other key opposition figures, including Omar Ayub Khan, Asad Qaiser, Hammad Azhar, and Khalid Khurshid.
He also denounced the sentencing of the PTI protesters for their involvement in the November 26 demonstration, calling these actions a blatant attempt to suppress dissent and undermine peaceful political mobilisation.
Speaking on the occasion, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that the first step of the movement was a multi-party conference, and all those who feel oppressed under the current government would be invited to participate in the moot.
On the occasion, PTI senior leader Babar Awan claimed that Imran Khan was a prisoner of conscience, who was allegedly being held in a solitary cell, denied basic human rights, medical care, and even clean water, which was a clear violation of international law and the Nelson Mandela prison rules.
“The PTI founder is not only Pakistan’s most popular leader, but he is the hope of the people. Yet he is being treated worse than a prisoner of war. Even his lawyers and family were barred from meeting him on Thursday,” he lamented.
“This is not justice — this is humiliation of democracy. If justice is denied, protest remains the only path,” Mr Awan added.

A leading global real estate services firm, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), acting as financial adviser for the hotel’s privatisation, has cited a “potential conflict of interest” for its decision.
 
 

JLL, which had recommended the joint venture model for the Roosevelt, a 1,015-room historic hotel in Midtown Manhattan, has conveyed its decision to the Privatisation Commission.
Announcing the resignation, the Privatisation Commission said on Thursday it was initiating the process to hire a new financial adviser on a fast-track basis to ensure that the privatisation of Roosevelt Hotel proceeds “in a transparent and competitive manner”.
JLL has cited “hei­ghtened interest” in the hotel from many of its own clients and cancellation of its lease agreement with New York City as reasons for the decision to withdr­­aw from the assignment.
 
 

JLL said these issues had put the company in a “compromising position” and it was resigning “to avoid any perceived or act­ual conflict of interest”.
JLL was appointed as financial adviser in Janu­ary 2024 to advise the government on the privatisation of the hotel.
The company has alrea­­dy conducted due dilige­n­­ce on the property and sub­­mitted transaction str­ucture reports, analysing a range of options in line with international best practices.
Business at the hotel was suspended in 2020 following financial losses incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic.

• UK PM terms situation ‘unspeakable & indefensible’ humanitarian catastrophe
• UN says it can’t verify aid delivery due to lack of access as mass starvation haunts Palestinians
JERUSALEM: Israel and the United States recalled their delegations from Gaza ceasefire talks for consultations on Thur­s­­day, as Hamas blamed Tel Aviv’s “stalling” for the delay in securing peace in the besieged enclave.
A senior Hamas source told Reuters that there was still a chance of reaching a Gaza cea­sefire agreement, but it would take a few days because of what he called Israeli stalling.
The source said Hamas’ response to the latest ceasefire proposal included requesting a clause that would prevent Israel from resuming the war if an agreement was not reached within the 60-day truce period.
A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters the latest Hamas position was “flexible, positive and took into consideration the growing suffering in Gaza and the need to stop the starvation”.
But even as Israel said it was reviewing a revised response from Hamas to a proposed cea­­sefire and prisoner-release deal, US and Israeli delegations withdrew from the talks, accusing Hamas of failing to act in good faith.
“While the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas does not appear to be coordinated or acting in good faith. We will now consider alternative options to bring the [prisoners] home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said in a statement on X.
According to Reuters, the latest draft proposed by Hamas calls for a return to protocol agreed on Jan 19 to allow aid entry to Gaza, seeks return to old mechanism of its distribution, and includes modified maps for Israeli military deployment in the strip.
European ‘emergency call’
UK PM Keir Starmer has offered an uncharacteristically sympathetic account of the situation in Gaza, terming the starvation unfolding in the besieged enclave a “unspeakable and indefensible” humanitarian catastrophe, while calling on Israel to urgently allow in aid.
While the situation has been grave for some time, it has rea­ched new depths and continues to worsen, he said in a statement.
“I will hold an emergency call with E3 partners tomorrow, where we will discuss what we can do urgently to stop the killing and get people the food they desperately need while pulling toge­ther all the steps necessary to build a lasting peace.”
 
 

UN unable to verify aid
Meanwhile, two different arms of the United Nations expressed frustration over Israel’s continued denial of access for aid to Gaza.
The UNRWA has “the equivalent of 6,000 loaded trucks of food and medical supplies” waiting in Jordan and Egypt, its commissioner Philippe Laz­za­ri­­ni said on Thursday.
Meanwhile, UN-OCHA spok­esp­er­son Jens Laerke maintai­ned that des­pite repeated req­uests, Israel has not allowed its staff to be present at the crossings.
Laerke explained that the UN needed multiple approvals from the Israeli authorities: firstly to get aid across the border from Israel into the Gaza Strip, where it is dropped off — the trucks returning to Israel — followed by another approval to drive trucks from inside Gaza to collect it.
“We therefore cannot verify the amount of supplies curren­tly at the crossing,” he told AFP.
According to the health ministry in Gaza, of the 113 people who died from malnutrition since October 2023, 81 were children and 32 were adults, BBC News reported.
Aid groups say there is no shortage in the supply of food, but Israel is obstructing it and making it virtually impossible for humanitarian assistance to reach millions of people who desperately need it.

• Committee agrees seeking amendments in Finance Bill so soon after its passage would be imprudent
ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday reported more than Rs2.2 trillion worth of tax evasion through ‘fake’ and ‘flying’ invoices over the past two fiscal years, highlighting the massive scale of loss of public monies due to weak enforcement.
Testifying before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Federal Board Of Revenue (FBR) Member Hamid Atique Sarwar said that more than Rs873bn in ‘fake’ and ‘flying’ invoices had been unearthed last year, on top of Rs1.37 trillion a year earlier, taking the total to Rs2.25tr in two years.
“This is almost one-third of the total” tax collected on the customs side, he said in response to calls from the business community for a relaxation in tax laws under the Finance Bill 2025-26.
 
 

Mr Sarwar said such massive loss of revenue could not be allowed to continue, adding that taxmen misusing their powers had been proceeded against.
He said no other department at the federal or provincial level had taken punitive action against its own workforce like FBR had.
He said the law in place since 1996 envisaged arrest if an assistant commissioner had reasons to believe that tax evasion was taking place, record was being tampered or suspects were fleeing abroad. But the latest Finance Bill provided multiple safeguards to avoid harassment of businessmen and taxpayers.
The committee held an extensive discussion on several anomalies in the Budget 2025–26, including briefings from members of the chambers of commerce, with a specific focus on clauses granting powers of arrest to the FBR on the basis of mere suspicion.
State Minister for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kiyani said the prime minister had constituted a committee to redress the grievances of the chambers.
Moreover, a review and redressal committee had also been constituted for a periodic review of the business community’s issues.
Mr Kiyani said a circular would be issued soon to clarify the lacunae highlighted by the chambers, following detailed discussions with business community.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, who chaired the meeting, and the other members agreed with the state minister that it would not be good optics to seek amendments to the finance bill just a month after its passage, with the consent of the International Monetary Fund .
Another FBR member, Dr Najeeb, said the government had diluted the taxpayers powers following pushback from coalition partners, parliamentarians and others and there had been a lot of difference between the finance bill originally introduced in the parliament and later passed by the parliament.
He said conceded that the extensive deliberations over the finance bill with the standing committees of the National Assembly and the Senate did not leave them enough time for the usual anomaly committees to address all concerns, leaving some room for misunderstandings.
However, he maintained that the “element of fear” was being unnecessarily overblown.
While discussing software exports over the last 15 years, the committee recommended the State Bank of Pakistan to submit data with the clear categorisation of freelancers share in software exports.
The committee also recommended the removal of periodical and journal subscriptions from the IT services list.

Chairing a meeting on civil service reforms, the PM directed the committee to submit comprehensive, reform-oriented proposals within one month after detailed consultations.
He directed the committee to develop recommendations regarding the merit-based recruitment of top talent, the development of key performance indicator or KPI-based performance targets for promotions, and the improvement of the Annual Confidential Report system, as well as suggestions for effective alternatives.
 
 

The recommendations should also include a plan to enhance officers’ capacity through modern technology and systems, he said, stressing that the recommendations must aim to lay the foundation for a sustainable system, ensure improved governance and establish a continuous mechanism to align the civil services with contemporary demands.

Meets World Bank VP, reaffirms commitment to strengthening development cooperation

During the briefing on civil service reforms, it was stated that suggestions were being developed following consultation on recruitment, training, performance evaluation, salary impro­vement and promotions in the civil service.
A comparative analysis of civil service reforms in other countries in the region, including Pakistan, was also presented.
The meeting was informed that the final recommendations will focus on improving governance, enhancing the quality of life for ordinary citizens, and ensuring a merit-based recruitment of top talent at the core of civil service reforms.
Meeting with World Bank VP
Later in the day, PM Shehbaz met with Ousmane Dione, the regional vice president of the World Bank for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to reaffirm mutual commitment to strengthening development cooperation.
The prime minister thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their key role in advancing the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Pakistan.
He appreciated the CPF’s strategic role in supporting Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change and governance reforms.
He also acknowledged the World Bank’s principled support for Pakistan’s legitimate position, in light of India’s unilateral and unlawful actions that undermine important international agreements, such as the Indus Waters Treaty.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to upholding international law, regional peace and resolving disputes through dialogue. He also thanked the World Bank for its timely support following the devastating 2022 floods, which helped the government initiate relief and reconstruction efforts.
Mr Dione reaffirmed the World Bank’s commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan.

A young student was allegedly beaten to death by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat’s Chaliyar village. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival. Police announced the arrest of 11 individuals a day ago, including the administrator of the unregistered seminary, in connection with the brutal killing.
The police presented the 11 suspects before the Khwazakhela judicial magistrate today — the administrator of the madressah and another key individual.
Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Omar Khan told Dawn.com that the police had formed special teams and a search operation was underway to apprehend the remaining two suspects.
“We have some key leads to locate the main suspects and will reach them soon,” he said.
Meanwhile, the provincial head of Wifaqul Madaris Al-Arabia, Maulana Hussain Ahmad, strongly condemned the brutal beating and killing of the student. He called the incident “a deeply tragic and painful event” for the entire community.
“It is unfortunate that in the aftermath of this incident, a targeted propaganda campaign has been launched against Islamic seminaries, ignoring their decades of collective service to society,” Ahmad said at a press conference, where multiple other religious leaders and scholars expressed their condolences.
A day earlier, authorities said that the madressah where the incident occurred had been sealed, adding that police detained all madressah staff, with nine more taken into custody. A case was registered on the police’s complaint under the Child Protection Act.
Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.
In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a notification, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.
Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.
In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was arrested for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.
Cleric arrested in Swabi for torturing minor at mosque
Separately, a cleric was arrested in the Swabi district for “torturing” a six-year-old child in a local mosque in Swabi’s Chota Lahor area, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Muhammad Noman said.
He said, “The cleric tortured the child for not remembering his lesson,” adding that a case was registered against the suspect under Section 44 of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010.
According to a first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com, the incident occurred a day ago at 6pm.
According to a press release issued by the DPO office, the father of the child informed the police that his son was acquiring religious education at the Jamia Masjid in Meera Dhok, Mohalla, near Chota Lahor.
The father said his son went to the mosque as per his normal routine, but red marks were clearly visible on his son’s back and he was in pain when he returned home, adding that his teacher had beaten the child with a stick for being late.
The statement said a police team immediately reached the spot and arrested the suspect, registering a case against him.
DSP Noman said that such incidents should be reported to the local police immediately and they were bound to take prompt and result-oriented steps.
“The children of this society are the children of all of us,” he said in a press conference.</p><small>2025-07-24 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2422001441fb898.jpg?r=220023' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926327/imran-decries-lack-of-meaningful-momentum-for-aug-5-protest-orders-pti-to-shun-all-differences' target='_blank'><strong>Imran decries lack of ‘meaningful momentum’ for Aug 5 protest, orders PTI to shun all differences</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan has decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned August 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.
However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to disrupt the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‘a final push’. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.
The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters.
In a post today on his X account — which is not operated by Imran himself — a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: “Let me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.”
The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.
“After such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.
“Anyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,” the message warned.
 






Lashing out at the government, the message said it had “crippled the judiciary” through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
 
 

“The way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.”
The message claimed “inhumane conditions” were being imposed upon Imran’s spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder’s conditions were themselves not good.
“I am enduring the harshest prison term in the country’s history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.”
Separately, a post from PTI’s central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).
“All provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.”
 






Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.
Imran’s sons continue US engagements
Meanwhile, Imran’s sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.
They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the “persecution” of their father.
 






They also met US Congressman Brad Sherman.
“I am concerned to hear that Khan remains isolated from his family, friends, attorneys and doctors. His sons also shared that his physical health may be deteriorating. The people of Pakistan deserve to have their leaders be treated fairly under the law,” he said in a post on X about the meeting.

Blasphemy is an incendiary charge in Pakistan, where even unsubstantiated accusations can incite public outrage and lead to lynchings.
Last week, the IHC gave the federal government 30 days to constitute a commission to investigate misuse of blasphemy law, giving the order during the hearing of a case seeking such a commission’s formation. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan ordered that the commission should complete its work within four months, while allowing the possibility for an extension.
Rao Abdur Rahim, a lawyer from the Legal Commission on Blasphemy Pakistan, and others had filed an intra-court appeal against Justice Khan’s verdict. The case was heard today by Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Azam Khan.
Advocate Kamran Murtaza and others appeared before the court on behalf of Rahim. Asked how they felt about the decision, Murtaza argued that they had not been given a full hearing.
“There are four hundred cases and some cases are beyond the jurisdiction of this court,” Murtaza said. “Can a commission be formed in this case?”
He added that the court was giving orders “as though it was above the Supreme Court”.
The bench subsequently suspended last week’s order and issued notices to the parties.
 
 

During last week’s hearing, Justice Ishaq expressed concern over the disappearance of a woman named Komal Ismail, the elusive central figure linked to an ongoing blasphemy-related case.
During the proceedings of this case, Ismail had been identified as ‘Iman’, a shadowy figure who was allegedly involved in ‘trapping’ a number of those accused of blasphemy.
Earlier this month, the judge had ordered her CNIC to be blocked over her failure to appear before the court.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24145233fe33da6.jpg?r=145411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926261/deaths-from-gb-flash-floods-rise-to-6-as-search-for-missing-tourists-continues-official' target='_blank'><strong>Deaths from GB flash floods rise to 6 as search for missing tourists continues: official</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district rose to six on Thursday as a search for missing visitors was underway after heavy rains battered the region, an official said.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing on Monday.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.
According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.
Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.
Retired colonel’s body found in Rawalpindi
Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who went missing after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.
Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.
District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”
Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.
“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement had said.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Last week, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.
Residents block GT Road protesting failure to recover teenager’s body
On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.
On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.
Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told Dawn.com that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.
Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.
40 people trapped in Attock canal rescued
Separately, Rescue 1122 said its personnel safely evacuated 40 people trapped in a canal at Shinka in Punjab’s Attock district.

“According to details, 40 people were trapped in a canal due to high water level in the Indus River at Shinka in Hazro Tehsil,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement.
“All people were safely evacuated in a rescue operation that lasted for five hours,” it added, noting that teams reached the spot under DEO Ali Hussain’s supervision.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241915335dfbcc1.jpg?r=191607' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926272/islamabad-courts-sentence-13-pti-supporters-to-6-months-in-jail-over-nov-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad courts sentence 13 PTI supporters to 6 months in jail over Nov protests</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad district and sessions courts on Thursday sentenced 13 PTI supporters to six months in jail in cases pertaining to last year’s November “Final Call” protests, while acquitting one person.
Meanwhile, 12 of the convicts, along with one other person, were discharged by an Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) in a separate protest case from October 2024.
Ex-premier Imran Khan had called for nationwide protests on November 24, demanding the “restoration” of the PTI’s electoral mandate and the reversal of the 26th Amendment.
Following a state crackdown, the party claimed a dozen deaths of its supporters, which the government officially denied, while four Rangers personnel and a cop were martyred during the protests.
Judicial Magistrates Ahmad Shahzad Gondal and Mureed Abbas today heard three separate cases filed under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order (Papo) Act, which had been passed just two months prior to the protests.
 
 

One first information report (FIR) was registered at Islamabad’s Tarnol police station on November 24, while two were filed at the Ramna station on November 26 (FIRs 976 and 977). All 12 convicts were ordered to be sent to Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, according to the court orders, which are available with Dawn.com.
Three people — Banaras Khan, Hazratullah Saeed and Irfanullah Shahwali — were sentenced to six months of “simple imprisonment” in FIR 976 case heard by Judge Gondal. The case was registered under Section 8 (conditions for assembly) of the Papo Act and Section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The convicts were already in custody, had pleaded not guilty to the charges and had not produced any witnesses in their defence, according to the order.
“The object of this protest was against the law and Constitution of Pakistan,” the judgement observed, noting PTI’s “deliberate choice of prohibited venues and its defiance of administrative directives”.
A similarly worded judgement was issued in the FIR 977 case, in which Banaras and five others — Waheedullah Zahid, Fazalur Rehman, Ibrahim Bakhtiar, Khurram Shahzad and Rafiullah Darwash — were handed six months of “simple imprisonment” under the Papo Act and PPC’s Section 188.
Hammad Aziz, who was on bail, was acquitted.
 
 

“This protest involve [sic] incitement, disruption of public life and unlawful conduct,” both court orders by Judge Gondal noted.
In the Tarnol police station case, Judge Abbas sentenced Muhammad Danish, Muhammad Essa, Ijaz Hussain, Muhammad Ishaq and Shahab Khan to six months in prison under Section 8 of the Papo Act.
Other offences they were convicted for and handed down six months of imprisonment were Sections 148 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from duty) of the PPC. The sentences were to run concurrently.
However, the judge ruled that the complainant police was not empowered to add Sections 186 (obstructing public servant) and 188 of the PPC, hence they were not convicted under those.
ATC discharges 13 men from Sangjani protest case
Separately, Islamabad ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain discharged 13 people from a case filed at the Sangjani police station over the Oct 5, 2024 protest for allegedly attacking the police.
A dozen of the individuals were those convicted in the November cases today while Asad Khan was the 13th person.
The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, noted: “Nothing incriminating could be collected against accused persons present before the court that could even remotely connect them with the instant occurrence.”
 
 

The suspects were presented before the court upon the completion of their four-day physical remand, the order noted, with Judge Zulqarnain dismissing the police’s request for further 15 days of custody.
During the hearing, the judge questioned the police’s lack of progress, saying: “I cannot comprehend what the police is doing? What is the Islamabad IG doing?”
Islamabad ATC suspends arrest warrant for Omar Ayub
Separately, an Islamabad ATC suspended a bailable arrest warrant for National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub in a case related to a protest in October last year.
PTI protesters and the Islamabad police clashed on Oct 4, 2024, as hundreds of party activists defied security measures and road blockades to gather at multiple locations days before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. Over 100 PTI supporters, along with ex-premier Imran Khan’s two sisters, were taken into custody.’
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra had issued the arrest warrant earlier today as he heard a case filed at the Shahzad Town police station last year.
Advocates Sardar Masroof Khan, Zahid Bashir Dar, Murtaza Toori and Mirza Asim were among the lawyers present on the PTI leaders’ behalf.
During the hearing, Judge Sipra issued a bailable arrest warrant for Ayub and ordered that any previous bail granted to suspects who were absent today be cancelled.
 
 

However, the judge accepted Senator Azam Swati’s plea seeking exemption from attendance, which was filed yesterday, according to Masroof. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till July 30.
Later in the day, former law minister Babar Awan appeared as Ayub’s counsel and submitted an application seeking exemption from attendance, along with a medical report.
Awan contended that his client had not received a notice of summons from the court.
The application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said the PTI lawmaker was unable to appear in court due to “ill health” and was advised bed rest.
“The non-appearance of the applicant is neither deliberate nor intentional,” the application stated.
Subsequently, Judge Sipra suspended Ayub’s arrest warrant.
In a video statement yesterday, Advocate Masroof lamented the “speed with which these cases are being heard”.
He noted that some suspects had come from faraway areas such as Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan, having no place to stay overnight in Islamabad to attend today’s hearing.
“If these trials will be bulldozed in such a manner and you won’t give them a fair trial, then it will become very difficult for you to fulfil the requirements of justice,” the lawyer said, requesting courts to punish those guilty but not convict those who were not involved.
Today’s development comes within days of two ATCs sentencing PTI bigwigs to as many as 10 years in jail in cases related to the violent May 9, 2023 countrywide riots.
A Lahore ATC handed down at least eight leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment, while acquitting six others. A Sargodha ATC also convicted as many as 32 accused, including MNA Ahmad Chattha and Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.
In May, the Islamabad police’s prosecution nominated the PTI’s top leadership — including Ayub, Chairman Gohar Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Barris­ter Muhammad Ali Saif — in another case over the October 4 protests filed at the Koral police station.
 
 

Earlier this month, a Lahore ATC also declared PTI’s Hammad Azhar and Rana Shahbaz Ahmed as proclaimed offenders in two cases related to an alleged attack on Punjab police during a simultaneous protest as party workers reached Minar-i-Pakistan despite the government’s security measures.
Other cases over the clashes had also been registered at the Noon and Ramna police stations in the federal capital.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2412581446b8648.jpg?r=130024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926266/plane-crash-in-russias-far-east-kills-nearly-50-people' target='_blank'><strong>Plane crash in Russia’s far east kills nearly 50 people</strong></a><br><p>A passenger plane carrying nearly 50 people crashed in a remote area of Russia’s far eastern Amur region on Thursday, killing all on board, authorities said.
The plane, a Soviet-made twin-propeller Antonov-24, went down in remote, thickly forested terrain, leaving a column of smoke pouring from the crash site and no signs of survivors, according to state media and videos published by investigators.
The Angara Airlines flight was headed to the town of Tynda from the city of Blagoveshchensk when it disappeared from radar at around 1pm local time (0400 GMT).
A rescue helicopter later spotted the burning fuselage of the plane on a forested mountain slope about 15 kilometres south of Tynda’s airport.
 






Videos published by Russian investigators showed smoke rising from the crash site and what appeared to be fragments of the plane strewn across the forest floor.
A search and rescue team arrived only hours after the crash at the remote, hard-to-reach site and found no evidence of survivors, according to the state news agency TASS.
Investigators did not say what caused the crash.
Weather conditions at the time of the incident were poor, Angara Airlines CEO Sergei Salamanov told Russia’s REN TV channel.
“The commander made the decision to carry out the flight,” he was quoted as saying.
Tynda, home to around 30,000 people, lies in an area of thick taiga forest about 200km from the Chinese border.
At least one Chinese national was on the flight, state media in China reported.
Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolence to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
“I would like to express my deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the families of the victims,” Xi said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
The plane dropped from radar while attempting a second approach to land at Tynda, regional prosecutors said.
The forest terrain complicated search efforts, a rescuer told the TASS agency.
“The main search operations are being conducted from the air,” it said.
Angara Airlines, a small regional carrier based in the Russian city of Irkutsk, did not immediately release a statement on the crash.
Five children
Russia’s aviation watchdog has not yet given a definitive number of people on board.
The Amur region’s governor, Vasily Orlov, said the plane was carrying 43 passengers and six crew members.
Among the passengers were five children, he said.
The TASS agency cited emergency services as saying the plane was carrying 40 passengers and six crew.
Aviation authorities have opened an investigation.
The plane appeared to have been manufactured almost 50 years ago, during the Soviet era, according to civil aviation database Russianplanes.net.
In 2021, the aircraft’s airworthiness certificate was extended until 2036, data from the site showed.
AFP was not able to immediately verify this information.
The Antonov-24 is a popular, Soviet-designed turboprop plane that first entered into service in 1959.
Russia has taken steps to switch from Soviet aircraft to modern jets in recent years, but ageing light aircraft are still widely used in far-flung regions, with accidents frequent.
The incident comes just days after a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital, Dhaka, on Monday, killing 31 and injuring more than 170 people.</p><small>2025-07-24 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2413561135d4e2b.png?r=135959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926262/at-least-11-civilians-killed-as-thailand-f-16-jet-bombs-cambodian-targets-after-border-clash-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 civilians killed as Thailand F-16 jet bombs Cambodian targets after border clash escalates</strong></a><br><p>Thailand scrambled an F-16 fighter jet to bomb targets in Cambodia on Thursday after artillery volleys from both sides killed at least 11 civilians, as border tension boiled over into rare armed conflict between the Southeast Asian countries.
Both blamed each other for starting a morning clash at a disputed area of the border, which quickly escalated from small arms fire to heavy shelling in at least six locations 209 kilometres apart along a frontier where sovereignty has been disputed for more than a century.
Thailand positioned six F-16 fighter jets in an uncommon combat deployment, one of which was mobilised to strike a Cambodian military target, among measures Cambodia’s foreign ministry called “reckless and brutal military aggression”.
Thailand’s military said the use of air power was to strike with precision.
The worst fighting between the countries in 13 years came after Thailand on Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Phnom Penh and expelled Cambodia’s envoy, in response to a second Thai soldier losing a limb to a landmine that Bangkok alleged had been laid recently by rival troops.
The two countries have been braced for conflict since the killing of a Cambodian soldier late in May during a brief skirmish, with troops reinforced on both sides of the border amid a full-blown diplomatic crisis that brought Thailand’s fragile coalition government to the brink of collapse.
Thailand said there were 12 fatalities in three Thai provinces, 11 of them civilians, including an eight-year-old boy. Authorities said 31 people were injured on Thursday. The number of Cambodian casualties was unclear.
“We condemn this — using heavy weapons without a clear target, outside of conflict zones … the use of force and did not adhere to international law,” Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters.
“We remain committed to peaceful means and there should be discussions, but what happened was a provocation and we had to defend ourselves.”
‘Premeditated military aggression’
Thailand’s Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin told reporters a hospital was hit by shelling in Surin province, an attack he said should be considered “a war crime”.
Cambodian government, defence and foreign ministry officials at a press conference gave no indication of fatalities sustained or any estimate of the number of people evacuated.
In a letter to Pakistan, the current president of the United Nations Security Council, Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet urged the body to convene a meeting to stop what he called “unprovoked and premeditated military aggression” by Thailand in violation of international law.
As clashes spread to different border areas, Thai villagers, including children and the elderly, fled to concrete shelters fortified with sandbags and car tires.
“How many rounds have been fired? It’s countless,” an unidentified woman in Surin province told the Thai Public Broadcasting Service while hiding in the shelter as gunfire and explosions were heard in the background.

Video footage showed a plume of thick black smoke rising from a gas station in the neighbouring Sisaket province, as firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze.
 


Thailand has evacuated more than 40,000 people from border areas, moving many to temporary shelters, where elderly people and small children gathered on floor mats as authorities prepared meals and unloaded food and bottled water from trucks.
“I’m worried about my children,” said Suphap Wongwai, an evacuee in Surin province. “My children are scared and crying.”
Decades of disputes
Thailand and Cambodia have bickered for decades over jurisdiction of various undemarcated points along their 817km land border, with ownership of the ancient Hindu temples Ta Moan Thom and the 11th century Preah Vihear central to the disputes.
Preah Vihear was awarded to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1962 but tension escalated in 2008 after Cambodia attempted to list it as a Unesco World Heritage site.
That led to skirmishes over several years and at least a dozen deaths.
Cambodia in June said it had asked the ICJ to resolve its disputes with Thailand, which says it has never recognised the court’s jurisdiction and prefers a bilateral approach.
Thailand’s use of a fighter jet underlines its military advantage over Cambodia in terms of size and range of defence hardware.
The clashes have caused jitters in the region, with the Philippines and Vietnam calling for restraint and China expressing willingness to play a role in promoting de-escalation.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Thailand and Cambodia are members, said he would speak to leaders of both countries.
“The least we can expect from them is to just stand down and hopefully to try and enter into negotiations,” Anwar said.
The clashes erupted hours after a downgrade in diplomatic relations between the two countries following a series of landmine injuries to Thai soldiers patrolling border areas.
Thailand accused Cambodia of placing the mines recently, which Phnom Penh dismissed as baseless.
De-mining groups estimate as many as 4-6 million landmines remain in Cambodia following years of civil war.
Landmines
The clashes began early on Thursday near the disputed Ta Moan Thom temple along the eastern border between Cambodia and Thailand, around 360km from the Thai capital Bangkok.
“Artillery shell fell on people’s homes,” Sutthirot Charoenthanasak, district chief of Kabcheing in Surin province, told Reuters, describing the firing by the Cambodian side.
“Two people have died,” he said, adding that district authorities had evacuated 40,000 civilians from 86 villages near the border to safer locations.
Thailand’s military said Cambodia deployed a surveillance drone before sending troops with heavy weapons to an area near the temple.
Cambodian troops opened fire and two Thai soldiers were wounded, a Thai army spokesperson said, adding that Cambodia had used multiple weapons, including rocket launchers.
A spokesperson for Cambodia’s defence ministry, however, said there had been an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops and Cambodian forces had responded in self-defence.
Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said the situation was delicate. “We have to be careful,” he told reporters. “We will follow international law.”
An attempt by Thai premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra to resolve the recent tensions via a call with Cambodia’s influential former prime minister Hun Sen, the contents of which were leaked, kicked off a political storm in Thailand, leading to her suspension by a court.
Hun Sen said in a Facebook post that two Cambodian provinces had come under shelling from the Thai military.</p><small>2025-07-24 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241842113bed5e1.jpg?r=184223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926314/pakistan-to-play-three-test-matches-against-england-next-year' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play three Test matches against England next year</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Thursday that the national team will face England in a three-match Test series next year during the World Test Championship.

Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting that the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.
In a meeting with the WB’s regional vice president for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP), Ousmane Dione, in Islamabad, the premier acknowledged the institution’s principled support for Pakistan’s legitimate position on India’s “unilateral and unlawful actions”, which undermined “important international agreements” such as the IWT.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to upholding international law, achieving prosperity, maintaining regional peace and reiterated the country’s resolve to resolve all issues through dialogue.
 






The prime minister further thanked the WB for its timely and generous assistance during the devastating floods of 2022, which helped Pakistan initiate immediate relief efforts and begin reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.
He especially thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new country partnership framework (CPF) for Pakistan.
In January, Pakistan became the first country to launch a longer-term CPF with the WB, after the bank’s board of directors approved the 10-year programme and pledged to provide $20 billion to Pakistan.
 
 

According to a World Bank statement, the new framework for the country aimed to “support inclusive and sustainable development through a strong focus on building human capital”, in addition to fostering durable private sector growth.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the strategic role of the CPF in supporting Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change, and governance reforms.
Dione expressed gratitude to the premier for the warm hospitality extended during his visit to Pakistan.
 






He reaffirmed the WB’s commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan and enhancing collaboration in key sectors of the economy.
Dione appreciated Pakistan’s ongoing macroeconomic recovery and praised the prime minister’s government for steering the country toward financial stability and sustainable growth.
He particularly commended the current administration’s reform agenda, noting the premier’s strong leadership in advancing institutional reforms, restoring investor confidence, and promoting inclusive economic development.
PM Shehbaz and Dione expressed a shared commitment to further strengthening cooperation in the coming years, to achieve long-term development goals and build a prosperous future for the people of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-24 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24190327d793ff2.jpg?r=190858' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926320/sampp-global-lifts-pakistans-credit-rating-b-from-ccc-outlook-stable' target='_blank'><strong>S&P Global lifts Pakistan’s credit rating ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’, outlook stable</strong></a><br><p>Ratings agency S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ and placed it on a ‘stable’ outlook on Thursday, saying the country’s finances and reserves had been stabilised by International Monetary Fund (IMF) support.
“The stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilise fiscal and debt metrics,” S&P said in a statement on the move.
“We also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.”
Pakistan’s longer-dated international bonds rallied after the upgrade, with the 2051 maturity gaining 1.6 cents to be bid at 84.85 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.
The 2031 and 2036 maturities also gained around 1 cent, while shorter-dated maturities posted smaller gains.
Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb urged the leading US rating agency — Moody’s — to improve Pakistan’s credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions.
Moody’s had upgraded Paki­stan’s credit rating by one notch in August 2024 to Caa2 from Caa3 (downgraded in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.
Global ratings agency Fitch had upgraded Pakistan’s foreign currency credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ in April, citing increased confidence in the country’s progress on narrowing its budget deficits.</p><small>2025-07-24 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241631494f88865.jpg?r=163715' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926312/australian-women-win-right-to-sue-qatar-airways-over-forced-strip-searches' target='_blank'><strong>Australian women win right to sue Qatar Airways over forced strip searches</strong></a><br><p>Five Australian women who say they were pulled from a Qatar Airways flight by armed guards and strip-searched have won the right to sue the airline, after a court on Thursday overturned an earlier decision to throw out the case.
Women on 10 Qatar Airways flights, including 13 Australians, were subjected to invasive examinations to see if they had recently given birth after a newborn baby was found abandoned at Doha’s Hamad Airport in October 2020.
The incident made headlines around the world, sparked outrage in Australia and strained diplomatic ties with Qatar.
A group of five women on a Sydney-bound flight launched legal proceedings in 2022 against Qatar Airways, the operator of Doha Airport Matar, and Qatar’s Civil Aviation Authority.
They brought claims under the Montreal Convention, which covers airline liability, as well as negligence, assault and false imprisonment.
The women sought damages for the impact on their mental health, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from the “unlawful physical contact”.
After being escorted off their flight by armed Qatari authorities, some women claimed they were made to take off their underwear and subjected to non-consensual gynaecological inspections by a nurse in ambulances on the tarmac.
Federal Court Justice John Halley dismissed the claims against Qatar Airways last year, finding they had no reasonable prospect of success, and that Qatar’s Civil Aviation Authority amounted to a foreign state immune from Australian law.
On Thursday, the full federal court overturned the ruling on Qatar Airways saying the issue was too complex to be dismissed summarily.
“Whether or not the claims come within the scope of [the Montreal Convention] is a matter of some complexity,” the summary judgment said.
“It is therefore not an issue apt to be decided at the stage of summary dismissal.”
The judgement allows the women to continue their lawsuit against Qatar Airways and Matar. Both companies were ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.
“Our clients endured a traumatic experience on that night in Doha, and they deserve to have their day in court and compensation for their suffering,” said Damian Sturzaker, the lawyer from Marque Lawyers representing the women.</p><small>2025-07-24 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24180931d32e630.jpg?r=184406' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926256/pcb-chief-naqvi-hails-positive-acc-agm-says-asia-cup-fate-to-be-announced-soon' target='_blank'><strong>PCB chief Naqvi hails positive ACC AGM, says Asia Cup fate to be announced soon</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday hailed the positive environment in which the council’s annual general meeting (AGM) was held and said the fate of the upcoming Asia Cup would be announced soon.
The meeting, hosted by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), comes ahead of the Asia Cup tournament, scheduled to be hosted by India in September.  The tournament remains in limbo amid strained India-Pakistan ties following a military encounter in May.
On Wednesday, Hindustan Times reported that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), reversing an earlier decision, would attend the Asian Cricket Council’s annual meeting virtually. The BCCI had previously declined to travel to Dhaka, citing tensions with Bangladesh and threatening to boycott the meeting.
The AGM was held in Dhaka today with 24 other members in attendance.
 






Addressing the media after the meeting, Naqvi said: “The meeting went very well. We have 25 ACC members and all of them participated in this meeting”
He thanked all members who attended the meeting in person and those who attended it virtually. “We have all decided to work for cricket. None of us wants politics inside any of our organisations and it was a very good meeting in a very good atmosphere,” he added, expressing hope that such meetings would continue in the future as well.
Regarding the upcoming Asia Cup’s schedule and its fate, he said: “That will be announced soon. We are in consultation with the BCCI and we will resolve [that matter] very soon.”
Questioned about India’s lack of participation in person, Naqvi downplayed the matter, saying: “Several countries were not able to come to Dhaka. It happens every time whenever you have meetings. I was not able to go to Singapore because I was stuck so this is a normal thing.”
He said that all members participated in the meeting. He reiterated that he was hopeful of the ACC and BCCI resolving their pending issues “and we will have the Asia Cup also”.
A press release issued by the ACC said the meeting was with “100 per cent” attendance.
It said the meeting approved the comprehensive tournament calendar for 2025–2026, in line with the ACC’s sustained commitment to delivering structured development and high-quality cricketing opportunities across its member countries.
It also announced the inclusion of cricket in the upcoming Asian Games 2026 to be held in
Japan, which would see the participation of 10 men’s and eight)women’s teams from across the
continent, to be chosen based on their rankings.
The organisation also welcomed three new nations, Mongolia, Uzbekistan and the
Philippines, as members, “extending the reach of the sport into new and emerging cricket
regions”.
The council and members also reaffirmed their support for the development and promotion of Asian
cricket “whilst always putting cricket first”.
The meeting was adjourned with members “reiterating their joint commitment to a forward-looking vision; one that nurtures excellence, inclusion and broadens the game’s reach across the continent”.
 






Naqvi calls on Asian nations to ‘put aside political differences’ for sake of cricket
Addressing a reception hosted by the BCB earlier, Naqvi said in an apparent reference to the ongoing situation: “It’s not just that you’re here; it’s about a team, as we discussed, that we need to work as a team. We need to put aside all our political differences and work just for cricket.”
The PCB chairman added: “It is a family of cricketing nations, where we all need to support and strengthen each other. The most important thing is, whoever wins means we all will win; so, let’s get together and discuss how we can strengthen the ACC and how we can help our associate members.”
 






He stressed that he wanted all member teams to have stronger players to put up a stronger competition, paving the way for a stronger market for cricketing events in Asia.
“As the president of ACC, I can assure you that we will do whatever is required to make this body the strongest body for Asian games,” he said, adding that it was important to expand cricket in other countries.
Whether Pakistan visit India for the Asia Cup or a hybrid model will be followed — similar to the one adopted for the International Cricket Council events — is yet to be decided.
However, considering that the BCCI and the PCB are not keen on playing on each other’s venues, particularly after the 2024 hybrid model, the UAE has emerged as a frontrunner to host the latest edition of the Asia Cup.
Last night, the BCB also hosted a dinner for ACC delegations and the Pakistani team. The PCB chairman thanked the associate members of the council and BCB President Aminul Islam for his hospitality during his speech at the meeting.
“He worked day and night to make this happen,” Naqvi said. “I am really looking forward to receiving him in Pakistan.”
 






 






Pakistan, Bangladesh team up to boost cricket, umpiring and youth development
Naqvi also met Bangladesh’s Minister for Youth and Sports, Local Government and Rural Development Asif Mahmood for a friendly and forward-looking discussion.
 






The two leaders talked about working together to promote cricket, train umpires and create more opportunities for young people in both countries.
The talks resulted in a broad agreement to strengthen bilateral cooperation in sports, particularly cricket, and the development of umpiring and youth engagement programmes.
The two sides agreed to sign a formal memorandum of understanding between the PCB and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to promote cricket and institutionalise training programmes.
Naqvi invited Bangladeshi umpires to Pakistan for professional training, underscoring Pakistan’s willingness to share technical expertise and resources for regional sporting development.
Special focus was placed on enhancing women’s cricket, with both ministers agreeing to develop joint initiatives aimed at nurturing female athletes across both countries.
In addition to sports, the agenda extended to youth skill-building, employment generation and educational cooperation. Discussions included scholarship opportunities, higher education exchange programmes, and experience-sharing in educational reforms.
The ministers also explored collaboration in renewable energy, particularly solar energy innovation, marking a growing interest in sustainable technology exchanges.
Naqvi also introduced Pakistan’s secure identity infrastructure, highlighting the success and technological advancement of the National Database and Registration Authority.
Mahmood expressed a strong interest in Pakistan’s identity management systems and welcomed an invitation for a Bangladeshi delegation to visit Nadra. A high-level Bangladeshi delegation is expected to visit Pakistan in the near future to pursue this collaboration further.
Emphasising the demographic parallels between the two nations, Naqvi stated that youth made up the majority of both populations. “By investing in sports, skills, and education, we can create lasting opportunities for our young people,” he said.
The meeting signalled a shared commitment to deepening multifaceted ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, particularly in sports diplomacy and youth development.</p><small>2025-07-24 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24163447804bbf7.jpg?r=163636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926311/britain-and-india-sign-free-trade-pact-during-modi-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Britain and India sign free trade pact during Modi visit</strong></a><br><p>Britain and India signed a free trade agreement on Thursday during a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sealing a deal to cut tariffs on goods from textiles to whisky and cars and allow more market access for businesses.
The two countries concluded talks on the trade pact in May after three years of stop-start negotiations, with both sides hastening efforts to clinch a deal in the shadow of tariff turmoil unleashed by United States President Donald Trump.
The agreement between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies aims to increase bilateral trade by a further 25.5 billion pounds ($34bn) by 2040.
It is Britain’s biggest trade deal since it left the European Union in 2020, although its impact will be a fraction of the effect of leaving the orbit of its closest trading partner.
For India, it represents its biggest strategic partnership with an advanced economy, and one which could provide a template for a long-mooted deal with the EU as well as talks with other regions.
It will take effect after a ratification process, likely within a year.
 






British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would bring “huge benefits” for both countries, making trade cheaper, quicker and easier.
“We’ve entered a new global era, and that is one that requires us to step up, not to stand aside … by building deeper partnerships and alliances,” Starmer said.
Modi said the visit would “go a long way in advancing the economic partnership between our nations”.
They also agreed a partnership covering areas such as defence and climate, and said they would strengthen co-operation on tackling crime.
Whisky, cars
Under the trade agreement, tariffs on Scotch whisky will drop to 75 per cent from 150pc immediately, and then slide to 40pc over the next decade, according to the British government. On cars, India will cut duties to 10pc from over 100pc under a quota system that will be gradually liberalised.
In return, Indian manufacturers will gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles, also under a quota system.
The ministry has said 99pc of Indian exports to Britain would benefit from zero duties under the deal, including textiles, while Britain will see reductions on 90pc of its tariff lines, with the average tariff UK firms face dropping to 3pc from 15pc.
While it is Britain’s biggest deal since Brexit, the projected boost to British economic output, of 4.8bn pounds a year by 2040, is small compared to the country’s gross domestic product of 2.6 trillion pounds in 2024.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that UK exports and imports will be about 15pc lower in the long run compared with if Britain had stayed in the EU.
In its first year in power, Britain’s Labour government has launched a reset of ties with the EU in order to smooth trade friction, while also clinching some tariff relief from the US and the India trade deal.
“In an era of rising protectionism, today’s announcement sends a powerful signal that the UK is open for business,” said Rain Newton-Smith, the chief executive of the Confederation of British Industry.
 
 

The India deal will also facilitate easier access for temporary business visitors, though visas are not covered. Britain and India also agreed to ensure workers no longer have to make social security contributions in both India and Britain during temporary postings in the other country.
Under the trade deal, British firms will be able to access India’s procurement market for projects in sectors such as clean energy, and it also covers services sectors such as insurance.
India didn’t succeed in its efforts to get an exemption from Britain’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) — which could levy higher taxes on polluters from 2027 — as part of the deal. Meanwhile, talks over a separate bilateral investment treaty are continuing.</p><small>2025-07-24 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24165513279cfe2.jpg?r=165618' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs maritime MoU with Chinese shipping giant to boost collaboration</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, on Thursday in a move that is set to bring about a “major transformation” in the shipping sector.
PNSC, headquartered in Karachi, is Pakistan’s premier national flag carrier, operating under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.  The Shandong Xinxu Group Corporation, based in Zibo City, Shandong Province, is a leading Chinese enterprise engaged in international trade and shipping.
A statement from the Press Information Department said the MoU signing ceremony took place between the PNSC CEO and the chairman of Shandong Xinxu Group Corporation in Islamabad with Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry present.
 






“The Pakistani shipping sector is set for a major transformation following the signing of a MoU,” he was quoted as saying by the statement.
Addressing the signing ceremony, he said the development symbolised a “growing partnership” between Pakistan and China in the maritime domain that would pave the way for “future cooperation, investment, and development” in Pakistan’s shipping industry.
He emphasised that the collaboration would boost regional trade, enhance connectivity and strengthen Pakistan’s role in the global maritime industry through cooperation and shared economic goals.
“This MoU establishes a framework of mutual trust and cooperation between the two entities, aimed at pursuing commercial benefits and creating favourable conditions for investment in Pakistan’s maritime sector,” the statement quoted him as saying.
“The understanding primarily focuses on collaborative efforts in several key areas. These include the sale and purchase of merchant cargo vessels such as liquid bulk tankers, dry bulk carriers, and containerised ships under joint or individual ownership, as well as through profit and loss sharing arrangements.”
The MoU also encompassed the leasing of such vessels by Xinxu to PNSC through various charter mechanisms, including time, spot and bare boat charters.
Another major component of the MoU involved the PNSC offering commercial, technical, and administrative management services for vessels as mutually agreed, covering areas such as chartering, marketing, revenue optimisation, maintenance, dry-docking, crewing and regulatory compliance.
“The MoU includes provisions for financing arrangements by Xinxu to PNSC for investments in ships and other floating platforms. These arrangements will be governed by commercially competitive terms, ensuring mutual benefit and financial viability,” the statement said.
In June, PNSC aimed to generate an estimated $700 million in freight earnings by expanding its cargo fleet to 34 vessels over the next three years as part of a broad strategy to revitalise the country’s maritime and logistics sectors.</p><small>2025-07-24 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24161954ab76977.jpg?r=162826' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926307/arshad-nadeem-focused-on-world-championships-as-post-surgery-rehab-mars-upcoming-competitions' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem focused on World Championships as post-surgery rehab mars upcoming competitions</strong></a><br><p>Javelin ace Arshad Nadeem could miss two upcoming Diamond League championships next month as he undergoes post-surgery rehabilitation in London, in the hopes of a full recovery ahead of the Tokyo World Athletic Championships this September.
The Olympic champion was set to travel to England this month to prepare for the World Championships, ahead of the Diamond League meet in Silesia, Poland on August 16 and Zurich, Switzerland on Aug 27-28.
Last week, however, he underwent surgery on his calf muscle to address a recurring injury. The interventional procedure was done by Dr Ali Bajwa at Spire Hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“We are now doing rehab work with a physiotherapist in London,” Arshad Nadeem’s coach, Salman Butt, told Dawn.com.
“This is a two-week plan before we test ourselves for going back to regular workouts,” Butt added.
“We are trying to achieve good form for the World Championship in Tokyo and maybe compete in one competition before Tokyo if Arshad regains good form by then.”
It was after his fifth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics that Butt began coaching Arshad. A gold medal at the World Championships will complete his trifecta after he won gold at last year’s Paris Olympics and the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.
He won a silver medal at the previous edition of the World Championships in Budapest in 2023, behind Indian rival Neeraj Chopra.
In an earlier conversation with Dawn.com, Butt had noted that the rehabilitation process would take about two weeks. Ahead of the surgery, he said that Arshad was pain-free and his team had adopted a quick remedy.
“We contacted our doctor at Cambridge, got an appointment within three days, and had an MRI done,” Butt had said, adding that he was grateful for the expedited process. At the time, it was unclear whether Arshad would recover in time for the Diamond League championships in Poland and Switzerland.
Arshad made this year’s international debut in style when he won gold with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, in May. A month later, he was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia List for what they called a “stunning show” at the Olympics.
Despite his mammoth successes, Arshad has maintained a relatively low profile at international meets compared to competitors like Julian Weber and Neeraj Chopra, particularly owing to injury.
Last June, he pulled out of the Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland due to a mild calf muscle injury, but returned to competition in July at the Paris Diamond League ahead of the Olympics.
The Asian Athletics Championship in May is his first and only competition of the year so far. He has not competed at a Diamond League yet, putting him out of the league’s standings topped by Weber and Chopra with 15 points each.</p><small>2025-07-24 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24122245c9c2584.jpg?r=134444' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926263/india-expulsions-to-bangladesh-unlawful-target-muslims-hrw' target='_blank'><strong>India expulsions to Bangladesh unlawful, target Muslims: HRW</strong></a><br><p>India has pushed hundreds of ethnic Bengali-speaking Muslims into Bangladesh without due process, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday, accusing the government of flouting rules and fuelling bias on religious lines.
The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long taken a hardline stance on immigration — particularly from Muslim-majority Bangladesh — with top authorities referring to them as “termites” and “infiltrators”.
Critics also accuse the government of sparking fear among India’s estimated 200 million Muslims, especially among speakers of Bengali, which is widely spoken in both eastern India and Bangladesh.
HRW, a New York-based nonprofit, said that India forcibly expelled more than 1,500 Muslim men, women, and children to Bangladesh between May 7 and June 15, quoting Bangladeshi authorities.
“India’s ruling BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is fuelling discrimination by arbitrarily expelling Bengali Muslims from the country, including Indian citizens,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at the nonprofit, said.
“The Indian government is putting thousands of vulnerable people at risk in apparent pursuit of unauthorised immigrants, but their actions reflect broader discriminatory policies against Muslims.”
New Delhi insists that the people deported are undocumented migrants.
 
 

However, claims by authorities that the expulsions were to manage illegal immigration were “unconvincing”, Pearson added, because of “their disregard for due process rights, domestic guarantees, and international human rights standards”.
‘They were holding guns’
HRW said that it had sent the report’s findings and questions to the country’s home ministry but had received no response.
The report documented the experiences of 18 people.
A 51-year-old daily wage worker told HRW that he “walked into Bangladesh like a dead body” after India’s Border Security Force (BSF) took him to the border after midnight.
“I thought they (the BSF) would kill me because they were holding guns and no one from my family would know,” the report quotes the worker as saying.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Dhaka’s government, an ally of India.
India also ramped up operations against migrants in the wake of the attack in India-occupied Kashmir in April that killed 26 people, mainly Hindu tourists.
New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of supporting the attack, an allegation denied by Islamabad.
In an unprecedented countrywide security drive, Indian authorities detained thousands, with many of them being eventually pushed across the border to Bangladesh.
“The government is undercutting India’s long history of providing refuge to the persecuted as it tries to generate political support,” Pearson said.
India has also been accused of forcibly deporting Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with navy ships dropping them off the coast of the war-torn nation.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24092938e089d74.png?r=093240' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926220/columbia-university-to-pay-over-200m-to-resolve-trump-probes' target='_blank'><strong>Columbia University to pay over $200m to resolve Trump probes</strong></a><br><p>Columbia University said on Wednesday it will pay $200 million to the US government after President Donald Trump threatened to pull federal funding over what he said was its unwillingness to protect Jewish students.
In a sweeping deal that will restore the prestigious New York institution’s federal monies, Columbia has pledged to obey rules that bar it from taking race into consideration in admissions or hiring, among other concessions.
“Columbia University has reached an agreement with the United States government to resolve multiple federal agency investigations into alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws,” a statement said, adding that the $200m would be paid over three years.
The university will also pay $21m to settle investigations brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it said.
“Under today’s agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 will be reinstated and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,” the statement said.
The promise of the federal funding spigot reopening offers relief for the university, which was under growing financial pressure, despite a comfortable endowment and a reputation it can bank on.
The agreement also represents a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly claimed elite universities brainwash students against his nationalist ideas with left-wing bias.
Thanking Columbia for “agreeing to do what is right,” Trump warned in a social media post that “numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust… are upcoming.”
The centuries-old Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is also in a fight with the administration over Trump’s threats to rip away federal funding, and Wednesday’s carefully worded agreement — in which Columbia admitted no wrongdoing — could offer a framework for future deals.
“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said.
“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.
“Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”
Disciplinary actions
Under the settlement, Columbia will maintain a security force to prevent demonstrations in academic spaces, such as those that rocked the campus last year when pro-Palestinian protestors clashed with law enforcement and occupied university buildings.
The school also agreed to “promptly provide” federal authorities with any requested information on “disciplinary actions involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia is aware of for criminal activity, including trespass or other violation of law.”
Columbia found itself at the centre of a firestorm last year over claims of anti-Semitism triggered by campus protests against Israel’s conflict in Gaza.
Some Jewish students claimed they were intimidated and that authorities did not act to protect them.
The school announced a wave of various student punishments on Tuesday, including expulsions and degree revocations, against nearly 80 students involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement that has called on the university to divest from Israel.
“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community,” Columbia said in a statement about student protests on its campus.
“Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”
While the university appears to be acquiescing to the Trump administration’s demands to quash student protest, one of the most prominent leaders of the US pro-Palestinian campus protests is still raising his voice.
Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate active in campus demonstrations, has sued the Trump administration for $20m over his arrest and detention by immigration agents.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who is married to a US citizen, missed the birth of his son while being held in a federal immigration detention centre in Louisiana.
He called the lawsuit a “first step towards accountability.”</p><small>2025-07-24 04:39</small></div><hr>
