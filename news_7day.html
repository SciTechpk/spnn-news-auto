On Thursday, Maryam, in a post on X, had extended a “warm welcome” to Bilawal, who is currently visiting the province.
“Punjab is your home, and you will always find a place of respect here,” she said.
“Thank you for your gracious remarks. You have my heartfelt good wishes and prayers,” she added.







In response, Bilawal on Friday said, “Thank you, madam chief inister for the warm welcome and positive gesture.”







Bilawal has had an interesting visit to Punjab thus far. During his visit to Lahore, a woman had interrupted his talk in the city’s Baghbanpura area, shouting from the rooftop of her home, “Talk about us, not politics.”
Bilawal had taken the interruption in stride, smiling up at the woman and breaking into laughter.
“Tell me what I should talk about,” he asked the lady, who then asked about how he was doing.
“I am good, thank you,” he responded.

He made the remarks while addressing an international forum hosted in Ashgabat to mark the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality, which global leaders, including heads of state from Russia, Turkiye, attended.
Talking about the “scourge” of terrorism, the premier called on the international community and said, “We need the international community to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to fulfil its international obligations and commitments and rein in terrorists operating from its territory.”
PM Shehbaz also expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul.
The premier noted that while the ceasefire still stood, it remained “fragile”.
He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to “peaceful dispute resolution”.
“The UN Security Council’s (UNSC) adoption of resolution 2788 earlier this year was a strong endorsement of Pakistan’s vision for the peaceful settlement of disputes,” he said.
In July, the UNSC had unanimously adopted a resolution sponsored by Pakistan, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
In his remarks, PM Shehbaz also talked about Gaza and expressed the hoped that ongoing peace efforts would “ultimately protect and save the lives of innocent Palestinians, ensuring a lasting and permanent ceasefire, [and] allow the flow of critical humanitarian aid”.
“Pakistan has been and shall continue to support all efforts aimed at upholding the inalienable right to self-defence for the Palestinian people as well as the brave and resilient Kashmiri people,” he went on to say.
The premier noted that “the pursuit of lasting peace is intrinsically linked to the path of sustainable development”.
“In this regard, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development presents a universal blueprint for a better and peaceful world.
“Socio-economic development and the welfare of our people are my government’s foremost priority,” he said.
PM Shehbaz told the conference that Pakistan was making “significant strides in several key areas, including advancing financial inclusion, bringing women and marginalised into the economic mainstream”.
Shifting his attention to climate, the premier said that Pakistan had demonstrated its commitment to undertaking cleaner and greener solutions, “transforming our landscape and setting a global example in ecosystem restoration”.
The premier, however, pointed out that similar to many developing nations, Pakistan’s “quest” for sustainable development was “facing the headwinds of climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations”.
He also highlighted the “catastrophic impact” of floods in recent years. The prime minister told the gathering that “climate change, poverty, and inequality are not isolated challenges”.
“These are transnational threats,” he said, adding that resolving them required “solutions built on a foundation of shared responsibility and unity of purpose, and access to advanced technology, especially digital technology”.
He insisted that “it must also be equitable and without any kind of discrimination”.
In his concluding remarks, PM Shehbaz thanked the Turk­menistan leadership for hosting the forum.
“I appeal to all of you ladies and gentlemen to let this forum serve as a genuine call to action and urgent action for a new paradigm of international relations where we move from zero-sum mindsets to purposeful cooperation,” the premier said.
“Let us invest in connectivity, not just as conduits for transportation of goods but as bridges for people, ideas and prosperity. Let us commit to [resolving] disputes peacefully through dialogue and diplomacy and reaffirm our earnest commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, and let us together chart a common course towards a future defined by peace, mutual trust and shared prosperity.
“For far too long, the seeds of hatred and conflict have overshadowed our world,” PM Shehbaz noted, calling on the world to “let the dove of peace take flight once more”.
Dar meets Iranian, Kyrgyz foreign ministers
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is accompanying the premier to Turkmenistan, held a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
In a post on X, Dar said that the pair discussed “bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on regional developments”.
“We agreed to further deepen collaboration in trade, connectivity and people-to-people ties, and reaffirmed our commitment to working together for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” he added.







In a separate post, Dar said that he also met with Kyrgyzstan Foreign Minister Zheenbek Kulubeav, and the pair “reviewed progress” on Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan’s bilateral relations.
“Following the recent visit of the president of Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan, we reviewed the progress of our bilateral relations, discussed regional developments, and agreed to work together to further enhance cooperation for the mutual benefit of our peoples,” Dar added.







During the Turkmenistan visit, PM Shehbaz will also hold meetings with global leaders on the sidelines of an international conference being hosted in Ashgabat, Radio Pakistan reported earlier today.
The report said that the premier will attend the forum marking the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality, and the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality.
The report did not mention which leaders PM Shehbaz would be meeting. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are among those attending the gathering.
The report also added that PM Shehbaz, and other leaders attending the international forum, also visited the Monument of Neutrality in Ashgabat earlier in the day, where a floral wreath laying ceremony was held.














A day earlier, PM Shehbaz had met Turk­menistan President Serdar Berdimuhamedov and congratulated him on the 30th anniversary of Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan and on the UN designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
While underscoring the importance of the historic and fraternal relations between Pakistan and Turkmenistan, the PM expressed his resolve to further strengthen ties between the two countries, partic­ularly through enh­anced trade and economic engagement.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s desire to enhance connectivity with Turkmenistan through land and sea routes.
In a subsequent post on X, the premier said he looked forward to welcoming President Berdimuhamedov and politician Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov to Pakistan next year.







United Nations had granted Turkmenistan the status of a neutral country in 1995. UN defines neutrality as “the legal status arising from the abstention of a state from all participation in a war between other states, the maintenance of an attitude of impartiality toward the belligerents, and the recognition by the belligerents of this abstention and impartiality”.
The premier had arrived in Turkmenistan on Thursday. The Foreign Office said PM Shehbaz was undertaking the visit at the invitation of the Turkmenistan president
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi, a key aide to the PM, and Special Assistant to the PM Talha Burki are part of the delegation accompanying the premier.</p><small>2025-12-12 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121317484c0a893.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960695/india-frees-up-visas-for-chinese-professionals-in-key-step-to-boost-ties' target='_blank'><strong>India frees up visas for Chinese professionals in key step to boost ties</strong></a><br><p>India has cut red tape to speed business visas for Chinese professionals, two officials said, a major step to boost ties between the Asian giants and end chronic delays that cost output worth billions of dollars because of scarce technicians.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautiously rekindles ties with Beijing in the face of punishing US tariffs, the officials said New Delhi dropped a layer of bureaucratic scrutiny and shortened visa approval times to less than a month.
Both officials who confirmed the development to Reuters spoke on condition of anonymity.
India had blocked virtually all Chinese visits after the nuclear-armed neighbours clashed on their Himalayan frontier in mid-2020, widening its vetting of business visas beyond the home and foreign ministries.

 

The issues around securing visas have now been completely resolved, said one of the officials with knowledge of the matter.
“We have removed the layer of administrative vetting and are processing the business visas within four weeks,” the official added.
India’s ministries of external affairs, home and trade, as well as the prime minister’s office and the top think tank on policy, did not respond to email requests for comment.
Following the news, China’s foreign ministry said it had noticed “positive action” from India to facilitate people-to-people exchanges in the common interest.
“China is willing to maintain communication and consultation with India to continuously enhance the level of facilitation of exchanges,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun added.
Think tank Observer Research Foundation estimates that tougher scrutiny led to production losses of $15 billion over four years to Indian electronics makers, which import key machinery from China to make mobile telephones.
Major Chinese electronics companies, such as Xiaomi, struggled to get visas, Reuters reported last year.
Industry executives have said such curbs hit their plans to expand in India, while the solar industry was also hit by shortages of skilled labour.
The removal of red tape comes after Modi visited China this year for the first time in seven years, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and discussing ways to improve ties.
Subsequently, both countries resumed direct flights, for the first time since 2020.
The easing of curbs was prompted by a high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, now a member of the top government think tank, which also aims to ease investment curbs on China that hurt foreign investor sentiment.
“We welcome the government’s decision to expedite skilled-visa approvals for professionals from land-bordering countries,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, head of industry body the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association.
“This reflects a collaborative approach and the government’s acceptance of our recommendations.”
The changes come at a crucial time for India, which is scaling up production across categories from finished goods to components and sub-assemblies, he added.
Warming China ties follow us tariffs
India’s warmer ties with China follow the surprise levy of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods by US President Donald Trump, including a penal tariff of 25pc for buying Russian oil.
That prompted India to reshape its diplomatic calculus, reworking ties with China and strengthening ties with Russia, while continuing to negotiate a trade deal with Washington.
In this effort, Modi has doubled down on focusing measures to boost growth by improving the environment for foreign investment, including business with China.
India also recently cut consumption tax and eased labour laws to lure foreign investors.
“We are cautiously easing some rules around restriction on China, which, we hope, will improve the overall business environment,” the second official said.</p><small>2025-12-12 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121007156e17c0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960682/central-bank-likely-to-hold-interest-rate-at-11pc-as-imf-flags-inflation-risks' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank likely to hold interest rate at 11pc as IMF flags inflation risks</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to retain interest rates at 11 per cent on Monday, a Reuters poll showed, as analysts push back rate-cut forecasts to late 2026 after the International Monetary Fund warned inflation risks persist and policy must stay “appropriately tight”.
All 12 analysts surveyed expect no cut in the policy meeting scheduled for Monday.
A majority of them see inflation hovering at 6pc–8pc in the coming months before rising again towards the end of fiscal 2026 as base effects fade and food and transport prices stay volatile after flood-related supply disruptions.
Most respondents now believe the SBP will not begin easing until the closing months of FY26, which ends in June 2026, with some analysts pushing forecasts for the first cut into fiscal year 2027, beginning July 2026.
IMF warns against premature easing
The IMF, in a second review released on Thursday, said monetary policy needs to remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep expectations anchored and noted that the SBP had maintained positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis.
It said the tight stance had been pivotal in reducing inflation and should be maintained to ensure price stability and support the rebuilding of external buffers.
Analysts said these risks, along with the SBP’s preference for maintaining positive real interest rates, would keep policymakers cautious.
The SBP has held its policy rate at 11pc since September, after cutting it by 1,100 basis points between June 2024 and May 2025 as inflation fell sharply from highs near 40pc in 2023.
Price, external pressures edge up
Inflation has started to accelerate after months of decline, driven by food and transport costs and fading base effects.
Headline inflation eased to 6.1pc in November from 6.2pc in October but remained above the SBP’s 5–7pc target. The IMF expects inflation to temporarily accelerate to 8–10pc this fiscal year before stabilising.
While Pakistan’s macroeconomic backdrop has stabilised somewhat, analysts said the recovery remains sensitive to external pressures.
Premature rate cuts could pressure the rupee even with anticipated IMF inflows, including a $1.2 billion disbursement this week to bolster reserves and support climate-resilience reforms.
Any demand-driven uptick, said Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Ltd, “will have an adverse impact on the external front”.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/120851152c9261f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960677/5-cops-injured-in-late-night-terrorist-attack-on-police-checkpost-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>5 cops injured in late-night terrorist attack on police checkpost in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>Five cops were injured after terrorists launched a late-night attack on a police checkpost in Shaikh Landak area located within the Havaid police jurisdiction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, it emerged on Friday.
A statement released by the spokesperson for the regional police officer, Kashif Nawaz, said Fitna al Khawarij terrorists attacked the post late on Thursday night.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement said that police personnel showed courage, bravery and acted in a timely manner, managing to repel the attack.
“As a result of the effective and vigorous retaliatory fire by the police, the terrorists suffered heavy casualties,” the statement said. It said that the exchange of fire continued for three hours, adding that reports suggested that several terrorists had been killed and injured.
It added that armed tribesmen and members of the peace committee backed police personnel in the gunfight with the terrorists.
It added that during this process, five cops sustained “minor injuries” and were taken to the hospital for medical treatment.
The statement said that on the instructions of Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan, additional personnel reached the scene and surrounded the area.
It said that the Bannu DIG and District Police Office (DPO) Yasir Afridi praised the efforts of the police, and the courage and bravery of the people in the area.
The statement went on to say that the Bannu DPO later visited the injured cops at the hospital.
“Bannu police have once again proven that it stands as a strong wall in front of the enemies of peace. The war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The development came as the situation remained tense in the area on Thursday after at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground during a football match.
Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
In October, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12123317ee5a2af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960691/japan-lifts-tsunami-warning-after-67-magnitude-earthquake' target='_blank'><strong>Japan lifts tsunami warning after 6.7-magnitude earthquake</strong></a><br><p>A powerful earthquake struck off the coast of northern Japan on Friday, the weather office said, days after an even larger tremor shook the region and injured at least 50.
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded Friday’s quake to magnitude 6.7 and warned that tsunami waves of up to one metre (three feet) could hit the northern Pacific coastline.
In the end, waves of up to 20 centimetres were recorded on the main northern island of Hokkaido and in the Aomori region, the JMA said, before the tsunami advisory was lifted.
Broadcaster NHK said there was no obvious change at either of the ports where the waves hit.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) also said that the quake measured 6.7 and was 130 kilometres (81 miles) off the city of Kuji in Iwate prefecture on the main island of Honshu.
NHK said that the level of shaking was less than the bigger 7.5 tremor late on Monday, which knocked items off shelves, tore apart roads, smashed windows and triggered tsunami waves of up to 70 centimetres.
In the wake of that quake, an evacuation order was issued on Thursday for residents living near a damaged 70-metre-high steel tower in Aomori, local media said, with authorities citing the risk of collapse.
The Nuclear Regulation Authority said on Friday there were no immediate signs of abnormalities at the region’s nuclear facilities.
Following Monday’s tremor, the JMA published a rare special advisory warning that another quake of similar or greater size was possible for another week.
The advisory covered the Sanriku area on the northeastern tip of Japan’s main island of Honshu and the northern island of Hokkaido, facing the Pacific.
The region is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake in 2011, which triggered a tsunami that killed around 18,500 people.
In August 2024, the JMA issued its first special advisory, for the southern half of Japan’s Pacific coast warning of a possible “megaquake” along the Nankai Trough.
The 800-kilometre undersea trench is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is “subducting” — or slowly slipping — underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
The government has said a quake in the Nankai Trough and subsequent tsunami could kill as many as 298,000 people and cause up to $2 trillion in damages.
The JMA lifted last year’s advisory after a week but it led to panic-buying of staples like rice and prompted holidaymakers to cancel hotel reservations.
Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is one of the world’s most seismically active countries.
The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year.
The vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and depth below the Earth’s surface.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1211363435cb08b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960687/absence-of-political-trust-between-india-and-us-highlighted-at-congress-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Absence of political trust between India and US highlighted at Congress hearing</strong></a><br><p>A US congressional hearing this week noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly described Pakistan as a “key regional partner” even as his administration seeks to further strengthen ties with India.
The hearing — held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia — also exposed sharp disagreements among lawmakers and analysts over the direction of Washington’s India policy. Witnesses warned during the hearing that tariff battles, visa restrictions and political mistrust had pushed the relationship into what several described as a “political standstill”.
Jeff Smith of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, long considered sympathetic to New Delhi, acknowledged that the partnership had entered “choppy waters”, attributing the downturn to Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between India and Pakistan.
The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire.
Smith noted that the Trump administration’s messaging during the ceasefire between India and Pakistan had placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a “difficult position at home”, with critics accusing him of “bending to the will of the US”.
Republican scepticism
Republican scepticism — usually muted when it comes to India — was unusually sharp. Congressman Mike Baumgartner of Washington state questioned whether India was genuinely committed to deepening defence cooperation with the United States. He recounted browsing a book on the Indian Army during a recent visit to India and finding a full-page photograph of Indian troops training with Russians while US-India exercises appeared only as a small boxed image. “The next time I go to India,” he said, “I’d like to see those pages reversed.”
His comments reflected a wider concern in Washington that despite two decades of US outreach, India continues to hedge strategically — maintaining close ties with Russia and participating actively in China-led forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Committee Chairman Bill Huizenga opened the session by calling India a “defining partner for the 21st century”, praising its expanding naval posture in the Indo-Pacific, its role in the Quad, and cooperation in technology, counter-terrorism and energy. Yet he also acknowledged “understandable concerns” over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to New Delhi and India’s involvement in multilateral platforms shaped by China. Huizenga accused Beijing of pursuing a “string of pearls” strategy to militarise ports across the Indian Ocean.
‘Frozen high-level engagement’
Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove issued the strongest warning, cautioning that Trump risked becoming “the president who lost India” because of escalating disputes over trade and immigration. She revealed that a US-India trade agreement had been on track for signature in July but was abruptly withdrawn by the White House. Instead, India was hit with 50pc tariffs — among the steepest applied to any US partner — and a 25pc tariff on India-linked Russian oil imports.
She criticised the newly announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee, noting that Indians hold nearly 70pc of such visas and form a crucial segment of the US technology and medical workforce. The combined effect of these decisions, she said, had frozen high-level engagement and forced the postponement of the Quad Leaders Summit.
Yet the hearing also underscored a growing divergence between congressional rhetoric and Trump’s own public posture. While several lawmakers focused sharply on allegations of militancy in occupied Kashmir and criticised Pakistan, others noted that Trump had maintained a strikingly different tone throughout the year. He has issued more than 30 public statements praising Pakistan for its cooperation, calling Islamabad a “key regional partner”, and emphasising the need for balanced engagement with both South Asian nuclear powers.
Following the India-Pakistan May conflict, Trump declined to assign blame and instead praised Pakistan’s role in helping defuse tensions.
Analysts at the hearing indirectly acknowledged that such statements had complicated New Delhi’s domestic political narrative.
In multiple statements, Trump has reaffirmed that eight jets were downed during the military escalation. For its part, Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.
Initially, New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Later in October, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class”.
‘Second-most significant challenge’
Dhruva Jaishankar of the Observer Research Foundation America told lawmakers that India viewed recent US engagement with Pakistan’s military leadership as “unsettling”, particularly after India’s air strikes inside Pakistan in May. Repeating India’s longstanding allegation of Pakistani support for terrorism — a claim Pakistan rejects — he warned that unresolved tariffs would increasingly be perceived in India as “acts of political hostility”.
Jaishankar, who is son of the Indian external affairs minister, described Washington’s growing relationship with Pakistan as the “second-most significant challenge” to India-US ties, after trade and tariff disputes. Responding to Trump’s assertion that he personally negotiated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Jaishankar said: “India’s experience is that third-party mediation has often contributed to Pakistan’s adventurism.”
He argued that the United States had long pursued a policy of “de-hyphenation”, engaging both India and Pakistan while avoiding involvement in their disputes, and urged Washington to maintain that approach. He noted that “considerable progress” in the relationship remained possible if disagreements over trade and Pakistan were managed.
At the same time, he acknowledged that defence cooperation continues to expand — including through a new 10-year Defence Framework Agreement, joint production initiatives, the impending launch of the NISAR satellite, and ongoing US support for India’s human spaceflight programme.
Sameer Lalwani of the German Marshall Fund said India remained “poised to become a pole in the international system”, but stressed that New Delhi seeks autonomy, not alignment — a reminder that US expectations often exceed India’s willingness to commit.
Jeff Smith also noted that Washington’s outreach to Pakistan’s military leadership — particularly meetings with Chief of Defence Forces and Cheif of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir — had generated political unease in India, contributing to the perception that the United States was recalibrating its regional priorities.
The overarching message from the hearing was clear: political trust — the element that has long held the US-India partnership together — is now under visible strain. And as Washington reassesses its strategic options in South Asia, Pakistan’s role as a stabilising partner is once again part of the conversation, even if not always acknowledged openly.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12082611054d637.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960623/fomenting-political-agitation-whats-next-for-embattled-former-spymaster' target='_blank'><strong>‘Fomenting political agitation’: what’s next for embattled former spymaster?</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The announcement of a 14-year sentence for ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed has reignited speculation about his alleged role in fomenting unrest in the country, especially after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) hinted at a broader and more serious plot, involving unnamed political actors.
While the ISPR statement focused on his conviction under military laws, it was the final paragraph that drew the most attention.
“Involvement of the convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with,” the statement said, offering no details.
The language implied linking Faiz Hameed and unnamed politicians to a wider effort to engineer unrest.

 

The reference marked the latest in a series of military statements since last year, signalling suspicion and hinting at an alleged nexus between him and political elements, opposed to the government.
In a statement issued on Aug 15, 2024, the ISPR noted that “further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing.”
A separate statement released at the time of Hameed’s detention alleged that “multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post retirement have also been established,” though it did not elaborate.
Days later, the ISPR disclosed that Hameed was being investigated for alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots, during which military buildings and monuments were vandalised.
“During the process, involvement of Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed (retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,” the statement had then said.
Accusations and suspicions
This is certainly not the first time that Hameed has been accused of political maneuvering, both pre and post-retirement. He came into the limelight for his role as a guarantor in the 2017 Faizabad agreement, a controversial deal betw­een the government and TLP protesters that ended a weeks-long sit-in.
While the PTI was in power, Hameed quickly made room for himself in the then-PM’s kitchen cabinet. By some accounts, he became quite close to both Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

 

Then, in 2020, ex-PM Nawaz Sharif had publicly accused Hameed and his former boss, Gen Qamar Bajwa, of orchestrating the three-time premier’s ouster.
The most direct accusation came during a rally in Gujranwala: “Gen Faiz, this is done with your hands and you need to answer,” Mr Sharif had roared.
Although speculation was rife about his influence on the PTI and its political machinations, there was no direct evidence to substantiate this.
Subsequently, in late 2022, a viral video showed the now-retired Faiz Hameed at an event, with a PTI leader praising him and inviting him to enter politics.
The former general, however, had denied having any plans to enter politics, saying on TV, “I will not join politics before the two-year bar nor afterward.”
Then came the case of his brother Najaf Hameed, who was arrested on corruption and bribery charges in March 2024 after a court rejected his request for bail.
Anti-corruption officials apprehended the former naib tehsildar from court premises in Rawalpindi and sent him to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
The case against him, registered with the Anti-Corruption Establishment in Chakwal, includes charges of bribery, misuse of authority, and causing losses to the national exchequer.
Many alleged that he had became a powerful figure in the region during his brother’s tenure as the ISI chief.
May 9 role?
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking in a television interview soon after Hameed’s arrest last year, said he remained “deeply involved” in political developments after leaving service in November 2022.
“After his retirement, the political events that unfolded had Faiz’s involvement. Knowing him, he never hesitates to stir things up, especially someone like him who wielded immense power and then had to step back,” Mr Asif then said.
About his potential involvement in the May 9 riots, Mr Asif had then said the “evidence and circumstances” pointed toward his participation, possibly as a “strategic adviser.”
“He might have provided logistics and used his experience to guide actions aimed at causing greater damage,” Mr Asif then said, adding, “While I can’t say this with absolute certainty, the evidence and circumstances suggest his involvement.”
Although the ISPR has avoided naming any political party or leader, its repeated references to actions taken “at the behest of and in collusion with political elements” have been widely interpreted as alluding to jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.
The military has not said when the separate investigations mentioned in the statement would conclude, nor whether additional charges will be brought against the former intelligence chief.

“We reviewed the progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments,” Modi said in a post on X.







A White House official confirmed the call took place, but gave no details about what was discussed.
Modi and Trump have spoken three times since Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50pc, hitting exports of textiles, chemicals and food items such as shrimp.
Modi described his conversation with Trump as “warm and engaging” and said their countries would continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity.
Trade negotiations between the two sides collapsed in late July, after India resisted opening its market for US farm products and declined to acknowledge Trump’s role in mediating during a conflict between India and Pakistan in May.
Talks have continued since then, amid signs Indian refiners are cutting Russian oil purchases after the US imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, to pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
US Deputy Trade Representative Rick Switzer met with Indian officials during a two-day visit to New Delhi this week, as New Delhi seeks relief from punitive tariffs imposed by Washington over its Russian oil purchases.
The US Trade Representative’s office had no immediate comment on those meetings.
It was unclear if a trade deal could be hammered out before the end of the year, said one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ryan Majerus, a former senior US Commerce Department official now with the King & Spalding law firm, said he expected a deal to be reached with India at some point given its importance in the global economy.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was in New Delhi on a state visit last week. He offered India uninterrupted fuel supplies and challenged US pressure on India to not buy Russian fuel.
Indian exports to the US fell nearly 9pc year-on-year in October to $6.31 billion from $6.91bn a year ago, though they were higher than $5.47bn in September, Indian government data showed.
Washington is also pushing India to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US goods and open its market to American farm products, including soybean and grain sorghum.</p><small>2025-12-12 05:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/693b5ee6791f6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960588/the-dichotomies' target='_blank'><strong>The dichotomies</strong></a><br><p>A BATTLE can be won or lost on how the issue in a dispute is framed. In the aftermath of the 26th and 27th Amendments to the Constitution, different concepts can be invoked to make sense of the reality around us.
The challenge, however, is that in framing an issue, one ought to be able to grasp the core of what is at stake. Otherwise, it can be that the two sides take positions and dig in their heels, without coming close to addressing the central issue. There is a need, therefore, to explore the dichotomy that best explains and captures the essence of what exactly it is that divides the proponents (or apologists) of the amendments from those who bemoan them.
Military vs civilians: Who gets to decide the important questions of policy — the military or the civilians? — remains a central issue of governance in Pakistan. There has been and remains a disbalance. No one disputes it. The civilians who enjoy marginal powers, and momentary protections, boastfully see themselves as ‘realists’, presenting the governance structure as a ‘hybrid regime’, and adding alongside, with much emphasis, that there is nothing wrong with it.
Most say that this is how things are, which is hard to dispute. A few go further, and say that this is how it should be. Civilians are riven with factions; the military has discipline. If a top-down strictly regimented governance structure is put in place, orders are executed in a timely fashion, efficiency increases and policies are given effect. Or so the fiction goes.
Pushing back on this narrative does not attain much. Those who are committed to their belief in the inherent superiority of the military as an institution best placed to govern, will, time and again, find scapegoats in civilians. It is because of the latter, the thinking goes, that the establishment’s rule does not translate into the success it promises, notwithstanding repeated experiments on this front.

The elite have always ruled the roost. What is actually different after the amendments?

Elite vs the many: In recent times, phrases like ‘elite capture’ are liberally thrown around, and rightly so. It has been an ongoing debate since at least Plato: whether to place a premium on the expertise of the few, or on the wisdom of the crowd? Pakistan has repeatedly erred on the side of the few.

 

In Pakistan, the elite are those who rise in the defence and civilian bureaucracies, using the archaic and abusive structures of governance to exert influence and power. The former of the two bureaucracies also co-opts politicians, who are already influential and affluent, often due to their lineage. They have landholdings or otherwise operate as local hegemons. Some of them may also have credentials to showcase.
The framework gives us a truism that the elite are in control in Pakistan, much like the truism that the civilian-military relationship is far from balanced — but nothing more. What is missing is the framework through which we can answer why this is wrong. The elite have always ruled the roost. What is actually different after the amendments?
Venerating men vs protection from those with a need to be venerated: Over time, there has been a realisation that we need a system of governance where one man or a few men do not usurp decision-making. That efforts have to be made actively to disperse power, to protect the people from the whims of a few; and to also be able to benefit from the minds and experiences of the many.
As apologists of the amendments rightly point out, this is not, or has not been, a default position through history. The default has been that the highly ambitious or a lucky few, or both, have governed, in their absolute discretion, deciding the fate of the many, often on the basis of whim.
To be able to live a life of dignity, where one is not at the mercy of those who find themselves in power, people came up with a concept that there ought to be a rule of law and not of men. By ‘rule of law’ is meant neutrality, impartiality and fairness in treatment; that, certain rights, in most situations, are to be enjoyed by all, without it being a charity, concession or a favour from the one in power. With the recent amendments, however, we can sense that the rule of men can be through laws.
What is of essence, then, is that the law has to protect the many from those who seek to be above the law, who, by virtue of their accomplishments, self-belief or just mere delusion consider themselves as deserving of a status not to be accorded to any other. With that higher status comes the hubris to unilaterally decide who amongst the people is to be blessed while others are shunned. But for the rest of us, not so inclined or lucky, there has to be an opportunity still to live a life of dignity, without needing to bow before any man, whatever his claim to fame.
In other words, the laws which had been conceptualised as a shield for the people — even if highly deficient and ineffective — are now wielded as a sword by those in power. With these amendments, the casualty is the aspiration that we were to work out a system that allowed us not to bow before another man. That we were to move towards making available to us forums where, when our dignity is trampled upon, we can claim that we are being wronged, and hope that in this world too, there would be recourse. And this is, essentially, the primary issue at stake, that bowing before power has now been mandated by law.

“Basant festivities are officially scheduled for Feb 6, 7, and 8 in Lahore alone and kite flying on any other dates will not be permitted under any circumstances,” she said on Thursday.
“If Lahorites demonstrate responsibility this year, the festival could potentially be celebrated across Punjab next year,” she added.
Last week, the Punjab government lifted the ban on Basant celebrations thro­ugh an ordinance — the Punjab Kite Flying Ordinance 2025.

May be extended across Punjab next year if Lahorites show responsible behaviour: Azma

The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
Azma Bokhari said Basant would be celebrated strictly under rules and regulations, and every kite and string used during the festival would be officially registered.
“Kites will carry QR codes, while manufacturers, string makers, and sellers will also be registered and licensed. Only licensed individuals will be authorised to sell kites.”
The minister said the purpose of this system was to ensure that substandard and metallic strings were completely eliminated, as unsafe strings in the past turned this beautiful festival into a dangerous one and caused loss of life.
She emphasised that the Punjab government would not allow anyone to put lives at risk.
“In connection with Basant, free safety antennas are being provided by the traffic police for motorcyclists to prevent accidents during the festival days.”
Azma said on the direction of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz this vibrant cultural festival was being revived responsibly so that Lahore could once again reclaim its cultural and traditional identity.
She said the information and culture department was also organising special cultural programmes for Basant, featuring music, food, kite flying, and a variety of other activities.

Fixing governance issues in the health system has its limits. Still, one should not give up and be mindful of the larger context. One cannot build an island of good governance in the health sector alone when it is surrounded by an ocean of bad governance on a high tide where undressed big boys are ski boarding. The IMF’s recent damning report, Pakistan: Governance and Corrup­tion Diagnostic Assessment, explains the high tide.
Apart from giving staggering numbers for the termite of corruption, which has built its mounds and subterranean nests in our society, it also raises a shrill cry over the absence of any meaningful reforms, which each of the four IMF programmes in the last 10 years have flagged.
Let’s first talk about the scale of corruption. The IMF analysis shows that Pakistan is losing between a five to 6.5 per cent of GDP to corruption which is a direct consequence of weak governance. In other words, Pakistan could have generated a GDP increase of between 5pc and 6.5pc by implementing governance reforms.
Let’s see what a 5pc to 6.5pc increase in GDP would mean in real terms. Pakistan’s GDP is around $400 billion; 5pc to 6.5pc of this figure would be $20bn to $ 26bn, equivalent to Rs5,600bn to Rs7,280bn. To bring in perspective, the total health expenditure of Pakistan, which means government health expenditure plus what people spend out of their pocket, is equal to approximately $11bn (Rs2,000bn). So, the level of corruption in Pakistan is 2.5 times more than the total health expenditure in the country. If through a magic wand all this corruption could be stopped and the amount saved spent on health, government spending on health could be increased almost five times, since the government health expenditure is around 1pc of GDP. Ah! If only wishes were horses!

Without understanding the macro, the micro cannot be fixed.

Another way of understanding 5pc to 6.5pc of GDP is that it is equivalent to 30pc of Pakistan’s annual budget, 65pc of the value of our exports and 60pc of our total remittances. And, by the way, the IMF assesses the scale of corruption at only the federal level. Imagine if the figures from the provinces were to be added!
The government’s role in the economy, weak checks and balances on the bureaucracy, serious issues of capacity, the “interplay of political patronage and public policymaking” and “concerns over vulnerabilities to corruption of judicial institutions” are serious underlying issues of governance in Pakistan, which erode investors’ (foreign and local) confidence and diminish public trust in the system.
At the end of the day, the cumulative effect of these factors is that “citizens are regularly required to pay officials for access to services”. And at a “higher level, official policies and practices have been shaped by economic and political elites to make use of public authority to enrich themselves at the cost of greater societal well-being and economic growth”. State capture takes place through politics which eases the unchecked elite capture of the economy.

 

The nature of corruption is also evident from the report’s 15 recommendations. Governance-related recommendations that constrain private sector development include improvement in public procurement contracts; transparency in the SIFC; streamlining SECP regulations; digitising regulations; and accelerating the resolution of the backlog of economic disputes lying in the courts. Recommendations related to governance weaknesses that act as barriers to fulfilling public sector functions involve: rationalising and simplifying the taxation system; strengthening the FBR; improving the budgeting process; enhancing PSDP efficiency and integrating parliamentarians’ projects into the PSDP process; and developing action plans for the top 10 federal agencies with corruption vulnerabilities.
Lastly, there are four recommendations for addressing governance weaknesses that directly reduce accountability/ oversight. These include: ensuring independence of the auditor general of Pakistan; enhancing the investigation and prosecution of money-laundering offences; publication of asset declarations of high-level federal civil servants; and developing a merit-based system for appointments to the key federal oversight bodies — CCP; SECP and NAB.
Readers must be asking what all this has to do with the governance of the health system. Governance weaknesses and the consequent corruption in the country is the sum total of governance problems and ongoing corruption in all sectors. No sector can be singled out and improved entirely and sustainably in isolation. All sectors are intertwined and interdependent.

 

Take public procurement in the health sector. Who doesn’t know of the level of corruption in public medical procurement and the low quality of medicines supplied by companies through government tenders? Public sector health managers and professionals benefit through commissions from suppliers of medical equipment and expensive machinery, pharmacies and diagnostic labs. These are open secrets of day-to-day life at public sector hospitals. And, there is hardly any regulation of these practices in the private sector.
At the macro level, health governance is marred by unclear federal and provincial functions and lack of coordination on important public health issues of national concern. There is a general lack of transparency and accountability, as in all other sectors. The issue of lack of administrative and managerial capacity cuts across the sector. There is also the issue of generalist civil servants making big technical decisions with far-reaching economic and health implications, and technical people not understanding the rules of business of government. Lack of coordination between the health and population sectors has affected both for too long and merging them has been a political issue. The list goes on and on.
As citizens of the state, health professionals or otherwise, it is imperative to understand the larger extractive political system, the issues of governance and corruption, develop a collective consciousness and take action. Without understanding the macro, the micro cannot be fixed. Before this IMF report fades away, society and citizen groups in all sectors need to read it and relate to it through their own lives and the sectors in which they work.

These rumours have gained traction following claims by MQM-P leaders that the PML-N intends to introduce another constitutional amendment aimed at empowering local governments. That suggestion has triggered a wider debate, fuelled largely by political anxieties, over the possibility of creating smaller provinces across the country, especially a Karachi province.
Speaking to the media recently, Mr Bhutto-Zardari pointed to a Punjab Assembly resolution calling for a South Punjab province, noting that there is also cross-party agreement in the National Assembly on aspects of the matter. He argued that the consensus achieved on a South Punjab province should first be focused on before moving forward. “Before talking about 20 new provinces, let’s start where everyone already agrees,” he said. Yet he appeared to rule out the possibility of that happening soon.
The demand for multiple smaller provinces is not new; it stems from public frustration with the unwillingness of the existing provinces to establish effective LG systems that can address citizens’ problems. This is in spite of constitutional directives to create LGs and devolve political, administrative and financial power to them. Rhetoric aside, there seems to be an unspoken consensus among political parties that LGs must remain weak and ineffective. Meanwhile, the PPP chairman’s contention that Sindh’s LG structure is more robust than the newly passed LG law in Punjab may represent an accurate comparison between the two provinces, but it does not mean that the system of local governance in Sindh is very effective, or that it reflects the true spirit of the relevant constitutional provision.

 

However, it must be stressed that the division of provinces as smaller administrative units will not solve our governance woes; and may, in fact, exacerbate the problem. Not just that. Changing the historical boundaries of the federating units, when there is no credible demand for it, except for some calls for a South Punjab and a Hazara province, can be politically explosive. The solution to public problems and poor service delivery lies in strengthening local democracy by devolving powers to LGs as the Constitution requires.
That said, no matter how misplaced the present focus on creating new provinces for administrative efficiency is, any credible and popular demand for further units that comes from the people should not be dismissed. Such proposals must be debated and the will of the people determined before they are put before the legislature, as constitutionally required, to ascertain the level of consensus.

Although the move is being described as temporary, it ends weeks of speculation about the relocation of the IHC to its former building in Sector G-10. It also dims the hopes of FSC judges to retain their coveted spot on Constitution Avenue, opposite the Supreme Court.
The decision to relocate the two courts was taken by the federal government, followed by the issuance of a notification on Thursday.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 175B(2) of the Constitution, the President is pleased to temporarily house the Federal Constitutional Court in the Federal Shariat Court building situated on Constitution Avenue, Islamabad, and the Federal Shariat Court in the Islamabad High Court building,” reads government notification No. F.14(7)/2025-A.II.
Copies of the notification have also been sent to the Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, and the registrars of the FCC, Supreme Court, IHC, FSC, as well as to the Secretary to the Attorney General for Pakistan and the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice.

The displaced forum will be shifted into premises of Islamabad High Court

Last month, the government had decided to set up offices for FCC judges within the IHC despite space constraints, as FSC judges had reportedly refused to vacate their building for the newly established constitutional court.
Consequently, FCC was temporarily set up inside the IHC after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

 

A senior FCC official, who requested anonymity, told Dawn that the shifting of the FCC to the FSC building would begin as soon as possible and could be completed by the end of the current week.
The present FSC building contains seven courtrooms with seven judges’ chambers. The FCC currently has seven judges, with the strength expected to gradually increase to 13 in due course.
While FCC judges have been holding court inside the IHC, some of them were using the spacious chambers designated for judges in the Supreme Court building.
Since the FCC’s administrative arrangements were incomplete at its inception, IHC courtroom No.2 was converted into the main courtroom of the FCC chief justice. Meanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muha­mmad Sarfraz Dogar continues to sit in his original courtroom No. 1, located above the FCC’s main courtroom.
With the FSC reportedly unwilling to hand over its building and the FCC facing multiple teething problems while sharing space with the IHC, the FCC had effectively become the only court in the country without a proper building of its own.
Earlier, rumours were making rounds that the IHC might return to its old G-10 premises early next year may – possibly in January – given the difficulties faced by litigants entering the Red Zone.
Speculation dies
However, speculation started to die down when IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar visited the G-10 building earlier this month to evaluate its suitability by inspecting several renovated sections, including the Chief Justice Block.

KARACHI: The Trump administration is planning to appoint an Amer­ican two-star general to command the proposed International Stabi­li­sation Force (ISF) for Gaza, US outlet Axios reported on Thursday, citing two US officials and two Israeli officials.
A United Nations Security Council resolution, adopted on Nov 17, authorised a Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish a temporary ISF for Gaza.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz, who visited Israel this week, told PM Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials that the Trump administration is going to lead the ISF and appoint a two-star general as its commander, Axios said.
The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, and the news agency could not independently verify the report.
President Donald Trump told rep­o­rters on Wednesday that an annou­ncement about which world leaders will serve on the Gaza Board of Peace should be made early next year.
The resolution, drafted by the US, described the Board of Peace as a transitional administration “that will set the framework, and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza in line with Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the war with Hamas.
Israel and Hamas agreed in October to the first phase of a Trump-brokered hostage and ceasefire deal.
The agreement marked a major step forward for efforts to end the two-year war in Gaza in which more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed. Under the deal, Hamas handed over prisoners seized in the deadly attacks that started the assault. Both, however, have repeatedly accused each other of violating the truce.
Both sides remain far apart on major issues, including Hamas’ disarmament, the governance of post-war Gaza and the composition and mandate of an international security force in the enclave.
The US president has also been working to expand the Abraham Accords, an initiative from his first term that aims to normalize diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab nations.
Trump initially pursued talks with Iran over its nuclear programme. Israel had launched an aerial war on Iran on June 13 and pressed Trump to join in. He did on June 22, bombing Iranian nuclear sites. He then pressed Israel and Iran to join a ceasefire that Qatar mediated.
Pakistan’s stance
Separately, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also addressed the creation of the ISF.
During his weekly press briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that while the situation in Gaza was a key topic of discussion during a recent visit by the President of Indonesia, Pakistan had made no commitment to join the ISF so far.
“This is a sovereign decision of any country,” the spokesperson said. “As far as Pakistan is concerned, such a decision has not been taken as yet.”
The spokesperson also recalled a recent conversation between Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, where Gaza was a primary topic.
The two had strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, deeming it a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access,the spoksperson said.
Members of the eight-nation Muslim bloc have already expressed “deep concern” over Israeli statements about opening the Rafah Crossing in only one direction.

MOHMAND/NORTH WAZIR­ISTAN: At least eight suspected militants were killed and four others injured in two drone strikes carried out by the security forces in Mohmand district, while a school was blown up by unidentified militants in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil on Wednesday night.
The drone strikes occurred at night on December 10, targeting Alingar, a remote village of Mohmand district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. No police posts or government installations are present in the area.
However, a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the intelligence-based operation involved two separate drone attacks that killed over eight militants.
“The strikes were precise and aimed at a gathering of militants,” the source said, adding that surveillance and verification efforts were ongoing to ascertain the exact number of casualties and identities of those killed.

Primary school blown up in Mir Ali; major portion of building destroyed

The area remains under heightened security, with forces conducting searches to prevent any retaliatory actions.
There was no official word, either from the district administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), about the incident.
School blown up
Separately, in North Waziristan, unidentified attackers blew up a government primary school in the Khushali area in Mir Ali, putting the education of more than 600 children in jeopardy and spreading fear across the locality.
Officials said that unknown attackers had planted explosives inside the school building and detonated them at night.
The blast, which was heard miles away, destroyed a significant portion of the school building.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.
Education department officials confirmed that more than 600 students were enrolled in the institution, which served as the only functional primary school in the area.
Authorities said the remaining sections of the building had been cordoned off, while an emergency plan for alternate learning arrangements was under consideration.
Local elders and parents expressed deep concern, calling attacks on educational institutions “a direct assault on the future of children”.
“This school was the only beacon of hope for our children. Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said.
The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana in the Lower South Waziristan district came under a terrorist attack.
In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat partially damaged the building.
Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district.

Federal Secretary of Energy (Power Division) Muhammad Fakhre Alam Irfan told the committee that Discos repeatedly submitted files that did not meet the audit department’s requirements. He noted that audit objections dating back 30 to 40 years remained unresolved for the same reason, as documents provided were consistently incomplete or below required standards.
The PAC meeting was convened to review audit paras related to the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). In the absence of Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan, members agreed to nominate a chairperson from among themselves on rotational basis for this and all future requisitioned meetings. Thursday’s session was presided over by Shahida Begum.
The PAC expressed strong dismay over audit of Discos, revealing that a huge amount of Rs10.256 billion was credited to consumers in different types of adjustments. The committee learnt that while relief was only allowed to new connections, huge amounts were credited to consumers on bills of already running consumers on their accumulated units of more than two months without taking actions against meter readers, meter inspectors and SDOs who were responsible to record and charge the units to consumers on their actual monthly consumption.
Of all Discos, the total amount credited without units by Lesco was the highest, Rs7.94bn. The total amount credited without units by Gepco was the second highest, Rs916 million.
Members were particularly perturbed over the fact that despite directions from the committee over a year ago to fix responsibility, Discos failed to take action and hand down punishments.
Secretary of power division attributed the undue generation of revenue through overbilling amounting to Rs8.44 billion to dereliction of duty and inefficiency of Discos to provide quality records to the audit department.

 

In another audit para, the meeting observed that 7, 694 consumers of different categories extended the load of their energy connections illegally without approval of competent authority. Losses incurred following the unauthorised extension of load by consumers stood at Rs2.51bn. The field formations neither disconnected the energy connections nor regularised the un-authorised extended load in violation of rules.
Further losses incurred included non-recovery of energy charges from unregistered/kunda connections which stood at Rs1.25bn.
The amount was debited against 7,510 unregistered/kunda connections.
The meeting observed that these unregistered connections were neither regularised and brought into billing cycle, nor outstanding energy charges from both categories were recovered.

The website Trumpcard.gov, complete with an “apply now” button, allows interested applicants to pay a $15,000 fee to the Department of Homeland Security for speedy processing.
After going through a background check or vetting process, applicants must then make a “contribution” — the website also calls it a “gift” — of $1 million to get the visa, similar to a “Green Card,” which allows them to live and work in the United States.
“Basically, it’s a Green Card, but much better. Much more powerful, a much stronger path,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “A path is a big deal. Have to be great people.”
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said some 10,000 people have already signed up for the gold card during a pre-registration period, and he expected many more to do so.
“I would expect over time that we’d sell, you know, thousands of these cards and raise, you know, billions, billions of dollars,” Lutnick said.

ISLAMABAD: Having missed a total of 11 performance indicators under its IMF programme, the government has agreed to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
Commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn, reveal fresh documents released by the Fund on Thursday.
The government confirmed at the outset that it estimated a shortfall from the underperformance of the captive power levy of Rs104bn, which it said would be covered by a reduction in power subsidies made possible through lower circular debt accumulation relative to budget estimates.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has already missed its collection target by about Rs430bn in the first five months of FY26.
“Should FBR’s revenues continue to fall short of expectations in the second quarter of FY26 (end of current month), and if other tax revenues are insufficient to bridge the gap, we will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the 8th GST schedule to the general GST regime,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb assured the Fund, implying full 18pc GST on those items.
He further committed that “if by the end of the second quarter of FY26 there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26”.
Pakistan has also sought waivers for already missed targets in terms of performance criteria, str­u­ctural benchmarks and indicators. The documents confirm that publication of a governance and corruption assessment report was set as a “prior action” for the latest $1.2bn disbursement to the State Bank of Pakistan, while an­­other prior action related to recapitalisation measures for a weak bank.
In all, the authorities missed one out of six qualitative performance criteria, five structural benchmarks and four indicative targets — some of which were subsequently met after the original deadlines or extended.
The waivers pertain to non-ob­servance of the end-June quantitative performance criterion (QPC) on Benazir Income Support Prog­r­amme (BISP) spending, and a mo­­dification of three end-December QPCs: the ceiling on the general government primary budget deficit, the floor on the number of new tax returns (to account for seasonality) in line with the agreed FY26 primary surplus, and the BISP floor on targeted cash transfers.
Under the roadmap agreed with the Fund, the FBR will complete all actions required to fully implement at least three priority areas by the end of March 2026, including any necessary subordinate legislation, staff hiring and allocation, and initial KPI reporting.
The government has also committed to publish an initial study by the end of June 2026 assessing the fiscal costs and effectiveness of incentives for all existing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and to phase out all such incentives by 2035.
A Tax Policy Office has been created and will now handle all tax policy functions, including the development and publication of a medium-term tax reform strategy by the end of December 2026. The new strategy is intended to reduce reliance on ad hoc revenue measures and ensure revenue-neutral reforms that deliver sustained growth in tax receipts over the medium term.
Provinces have pledged to realise the full potential of agriculture income tax by fully operationalising information-sharing between the FBR and provincial tax auth­o­rities, and by ensuring that all services — except for a limited list of exemptions — are subject to GST.
The authorities will also conduct a comprehensive study of bottlenecks in the local currency bond market and publish an action plan to address identified weaknesses by the end of September 2026. They have further undertak­­en to strengthen efforts to make formal channels more attractive than the hawala market, without resorting to fiscal incentives. To this end, the SBP plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of remittance costs by the end of May 2026 to improve cross-border payments.
At the same time, the authorities will seek to deepen the foreign exchange market, including through greater reliance on interbank trading and exchange rate flexibility, to support external sustainability.
On the power sector, the government has promised to complete the bidding process for the first round of privatisation of three distribution companies (Dis­c­­os) early in 2026 and to move ahead with the rest.
It has committed to completing the preconditions for the privatisation of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) by the end of December 2026. The authorities also plan to advance the privatisation of public generation companies, finalise transmission network restructuring and launch a wholesale electricity market.
Following amendments to the asset declaration framework, pre­p­­arations are underway to publish, by the end of December 2026, the asset declarations of high-lev­­el federal civil servants on a government website. The framework will also extend to high-level provincial officials and allow banks full access to their declarations.
Based on an institutional-level risk assessment, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) will lead and coordinate action plans to mitigate vulnerabilities in the 10 agencies identified as having the highest risks by the end of October 2026.
Amendments to most of the nine statutory state-owned enterprise (SOE) laws are expected to be submitted to the National Asse­mbly before the end of August 2026. In parallel, the government is moving to amend the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) law by the end of March 2026 to clarify its mandate, ensure transparent and competitive divestment and procurement procedures, introduce fiscal safeguards, and subject SWF-owned SOEs to the SOE law. Operationalisation of the SWF will remain on hold until these amendments are adopted.

ISLAMABAD: Amid concerns by Pakistan regarding the use of Afghan soil by militants to launch attacks inside the country, over 1,000 Afghan clerics recently passed a resolution apparently aimed at discouraging the flow of militancy from its territory to neighbouring states.
The resolution, adopted by leading Afghan clerics, pledges that their country’s soil will not be used against other countries.
In case of violations, the “Islamic Emirate has the right to take necessary measures against them”, it said, noting that Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had not permitted any Afghan national “to travel abroad for military activity, so if anyone violates this… The Islamic Emirate must take necessary measures to prevent such people”.
The resolution, though welcomed by Pakistan, elicited only cautious optimism, given the Taliban’s track record on militant groups. Terming it a “positive development”, the Foreign Office reiterated its demand for written assurances from the interim Afghan government that its soil would not be used against Pakistan.
The document, described as a significant development by experts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, comes from independent clerics, without any formal endorsement from the Taliban government, nor does it explicitly name Pakistan.
However, it does say that whoever would “conduct military operations beyond Afghanistan’s borders would be considered a rebel against the state”. This would also be considered “as a violation of the emir’s orders” and would be a punishable offence, the resolution said.
But it remains unclear who would enforce such a punishment, as the group of religious scholars who have issued it have no legally binding authority.
However, the timing of the declaration seems significant, coming at a time when Islamabad is asking Kabul to rein in militants, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who it blames for perpetrating terror attacks in the country.
Pakistan has asked Kabul to issue a decree — in the name of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada — to stop such incursions; a demand that was reiterated during a series of negotiations in Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia over the past few months.
However, according to officials privy to the meetings, the Taliban had asked Pakistan to approach their own scholars for such an edict.
Afghan religious scholar Sheikh Faqirullah Faeq, who was present at the Kabul University gathering, termed the resolution “very significant” and appeared hopeful about its outcome.
He said all senior clerics of major religious schools participated in the day-long meeting of the clerics, adding that there were 34 major jihadi seminaries in Afghanistan and all participated in the event.
“Teachers have influence on those Taliban who go outside the country to fight. Some people say certain circles go to Pakistan or Gaza and other areas.
The supreme leader does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us, and I hope this resolution will work,” Sheikh Faeq told Dawn.
FO’s ‘cautious optimism’
In the absence of official backing, it is unclear how it will be enforced — a concern also echoed by the Foreign Office.
“If the leadership of the Afghan Taliban regime or certain segments of Afghan society realise the gravity of the matter that their soil is being used not just by the banned TTP/FAK/FAH but also by their own nationals to perpetrate terrorism in Pakistan, such realisation is positive,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during his weekly briefing.
“One important aspect is that commitments made in the past by the Afghan Taliban regime have not been fulfilled. This is exactly why, during the talks held with the mediation efforts of our brotherly countries, Pakistan insisted on written assurances from the Afghan side,” the spokesperson said.
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, however, told the clerics’ gathering in Kabul on Thursday that the interim government had the right to stop anyone using Afghan soil for militant activities in other countries. “If anyone violates this, ulema favour action against them,” he said while alluding to the resolution. He said it was obligatory for all Muslims in Afghanistan to obey the resolution.
‘Positive development’
Despite expressing concern about its impact, the resolution is being seen as a positive development by observers in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan Asif Durrani, in a brief message sent to Dawn, said the timing of the resolution was important.
“One has to look at the timing of the resolution when everything seems to be frozen,” he said, adding that the document was “clearly intended” to convey a message to Pakistan regarding reconciliation.
“Hopefully, the TTP, which owes allegiance to the Taliban supreme leader…will now submit to the collective wisdom of the Afghan Taliban ulema and surrender arms,” he said, asking the government of Pakistan to welcome the resolution.
Analyst and journalist Sami Yousafzai said the move would be a positive one for Pakistan, which has repeatedly asked for an Afghan ‘fatwa’ or edict.
“Implementation would be a little difficult. But it would work if the Taliban leaders opt for punishment, arrest and jail those Afghans who join the Pakistani groups,” he told Dawn.
He said Afghans’ participation in attacks in Pakistan has increased, especially of the Afghans from Logar and Maidan Wardak provinces — both provinces are located near the capital Kabul.
“So, the Taliban are also worried over the growing number of Afghans participating. This is a good beginning and a positive message to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the Afghan Taliban’s intelligence can monitor the movement of their own people.
According to the FO spokesperson, Pakistan will adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ policy to evaluate this document, since the Taliban had failed to live up to their promises in the past.

The social media platform X, which around 4.5 million people in Pakistan use, was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections.
Speaking on Dawn News programme “Doosra Rukh,” Barrister Malik, responding to a question about a possible ban on incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s X account, said “investigations are ongoing.”
He added that while the government has contacted X, the platform has shown the least cooperation compared to other social media networks.
Criticising X, the minister said the platform should not operate with double standards. “Posts related to Palestine are removed, and accounts blocked, within 24 hours. Here, we are talking about a matter of terrorism,” he said.
He further noted that the government has issued reminders to social media platforms and warned that those that fail to cooperate or coordinate could face a ban, similar to actions taken by Brazil.
“Brazil’s courts had issued orders, which were then accepted, and a fine of $5.2 million was paid. All content taken out of context was removed,” Barrister Malik said.
X had 22 million users in Brazil before it was blocked on August 30 by Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes for failing to comply with a series of court orders aimed at combatting disinformation.
Barrister Malik said that today the government again issued a reminder, emphasising that it had already warned that these platforms are being used for terrorism, misinformation, and disinformation.
“We have asked them to open offices here in Pakistan, but there has been no response. Some social media platforms are cooperating well, but X is cooperating the least,” he added.
Earlier, on October 4, the minister said that investigations regarding Imran’s X account were ongoing and that contact with the platform was underway.
He had said that any measures regarding a potential block of Imran’s account would be disclosed once further evidence comes to light.
According to an October post on his official X account, Imran was also quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics.
A month before that, in September, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p><small>2025-12-11 22:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11230658ed8643d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960529/pti-led-kp-headed-toward-governors-rule-warns-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-led KP headed toward governor’s rule, warns Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Thursday that although there had been no discussion with the PML-N about imposing governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI-led government in the province was heading in a direction that could create conditions for such an option.
The federal government is seriously considering imposing governor’s rule in KP, citing “security and governance issues” in the province as the reason for this potential move.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier said “governor’s rule is not the face of any martial law” and added that if the conditions merit it, then it was within the Constitution to implement it.
Bilawal was speaking to the media during a visit to the Rajoa House residence of Syed Hassan Murtaza, the PPP’s central Punjab general secretary, in Chiniot to offer condolences on the death of his father.
He said the PTI’s politics was creating conditions for governor’s rule in KP. “The PTI is forcing the federal government to take strict action against it … and it’s an option in the province,” he added.
“Constitutional options exist for imposing governor’s rule,” he noted.







The PPP chief also chided PTI founder Imran Khan. “He [Khan] is now being held accountable for his crimes. Intoxicated by power, he had threatened to send everyone to jail. Imran Khan is now facing the consequences of his own conduct.”
On Wednesday, the PPP chairman had urged his party’s coalition partner, the PML-N, to give political space to the PTI. “It is the responsibility of the government to give space to the opposition in politics, and all political forces must play a serious role for the betterment of the country,” he told reporters after visiting the house of late senior party worker Zubaida Jafri in Baghbanpura.
27th Amendment lauded
To a question about the 27th Amendment on Thursday, the PPP chairman said its passage paved the way for the establishment of a constitutional court, which had been a long-standing dream of his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto.
“The constitutional court gives equal representation to all provinces, and its chief justice belongs to South Punjab,” he said.
“This is a victory for the PPP’s political manifesto and ideology.
“He added that another achievement in the amendment was the protection of the NFC award granted under the 18th Amendment, which ensured that the provincial share remained unchanged.
Speaking about the proposed 28th Amendment, he said the federal government had held no discussions with the PPP on the matter. He said the 27th Amendment fulfilled a key promise in the Charter of Democracy and reflected the PPP’s political vision.
The protections given to the provinces under the 18th Amendment, he added, had been preserved.
He attributed the government’s financial difficulties to bureaucratic inefficiency, especially the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) failure to collect adequate revenue.
The PPP chairman criticised the FBR, questioning why the public should suffer for the institution’s weaknesses. “We [the PPP] will work together with government to remove their difficulties and I have suggested reforms in tax collection to overcome financial vows.”
Economy
The PPP chairman said the government had improved the country’s economy.
“When the PDM [Pakistan Democratic Movement] came to power, the country was on the verge of default, but the financial condition is much better now,” he noted.
However, he added that the government should focus on increasing productivity and exports as well as providing relief to the common man.
“The Sindh government is providing fertiliser to small farmers free of cost to increase the per acre productivity and increase their incomes,” he said.
“We can achieve the target of food security by providing incentives to the agriculture sector of the country.”
Bhutto-Zardari said his three-day organisational tour of Punjab had been very successful and gave him the chance to meet party workers.</p><small>2025-12-11 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1123135467df40d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960509/pm-meets-turkmen-president-vows-to-strengthen-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>PM meets Turkmen president, vows to strengthen bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday met Serdar Berdimuhamedov, President of Turkmenistan, in Ashgabat.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister congratulated the Turkmen president on the 30th anniversary of Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan and on the UN designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
While underscoring the importance of the historic and fraternal relations between Pakistan and Turkmenistan, the PM expressed his resolve to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries, particularly through enhanced trade and economic engagement.
He conveyed his deepest gratitude to the Turkmen leadership and government for the support extended to safely evacuate Pakistani nationals from Iran during the Iran-Israel war earlier this year.
The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s desire to enhance connectivity with Turkmenistan through land and sea routes and said that Karachi and Gwadar ports were ideally located to be utilised by the Turkmen side to enhance their outreach to South Asia and beyond.
While thanking the Turkmen president for the hospitality extended to him and his delegation by the Turkmen side, the PM conveyed his warm wishes for H.E. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, National Leader of the Turkmen People, and reiterated his invitation to him as well as to President Serdar Berdimuhamedov to undertake official visits to Pakistan next year, on mutually convenient dates, to be worked out by the two sides.
The Turkmen president thanked the prime minister for his visit and participating in the International Forum on Peace and Trust and assured that Turkmenistan was also keen to enhance its bilateral cooperation with Pakistan across multiple areas of mutual interest.
Premier arrives in Turkmenistan
The premier arrived in Turkmenistan on a two-day official visit, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
It added that the premier was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov, with whom he would hold a bilateral meeting today.
PM Shehbaz and the delegation accompanying him were welcomed by Mammetkhan Chakyev, Turkmenistan’s deputy chairman of cabinet ministers, the PMO statement added.
It said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi, a key aid to the PM, and Special Assistant to the PM Talha Burki were part of the delegation accompanying the premier.







Moreover, the PM would also attend during his trip a “forum organised in Ashgabat to mark the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality, and the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality”.
United Nations had granted Turkmenistan the status of a neutral country in 1995. UN defines neutrality as “the legal status arising from the abstention of a state from all participation in a war between other states, the maintenance of an attitude of impartiality toward the belligerents, and the recognition by the belligerents of this abstention and impartiality”.
Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported that PM Shehbaz would also hold bilateral meetings with other world leaders attending the forum in Ashgabat.</p><small>2025-12-11 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11224110dec3fbf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960530/pti-divided-over-sit-ins-outside-adiala-jail-kp-cm-again-denied-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>PTI divided over sit-ins outside Adiala jail; KP CM again denied meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for the 10th time on Thursday by the Adiala jail administration, while party leaders remain divided over the continuation of prolonged sit-ins outside the jail, warning that they could adversely affect the incarcerated leader.
Politi­cal temperatures rose further a day earlier, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison.
The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil.
Some party leaders believe token protests should continue outside Adiala jail, warning that a halt could give the “powers that be” an excuse to create a “scene” and potentially transfer Imran to another facility.
A senior party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were differing opinions within the party. “One group favors prolonged sit-ins, believing they will put pressure on the government and the powers that be. The other group believes a token protest outside the jail should be held before dispersing,” he added.
When asked about the rationale behind the token protest, a PTI MNA said there were concerns that the “powers that be” might create a scene outside Adiala Jail, such as orchestrating a blast or staging a false-flag operation, to allege that an attempt had been made to break into the facility and free Imran Khan.
“After that, the government will be able to convince the international community that it was necessary to shift Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to somewhere else. We don’t want to give the government any such excuse,” he explained.
Another leader who belongs to Punjab said that for the last three months, workers and leaders from Punjab were regularly reaching the prison.
“Our attendance is marked in Lahore and sometimes in Kallar Kahar. Each MPA or leader who brings four people with him in a car spends Rs50,000 to Rs60,000, as they usually reach Lahore or other parts of Punjab the next day. Peshawar, however, is less than two hours away, so leaders and workers can easily travel from there and return. Despite this, people from Punjab have dominated the crowds every time. The KP chief minister arrives at Adiala Jail with only a few people; he does not even bother to bring his full cabinet,” he claimed.
He added that in several meetings of the parliamentary party, some members suggested that workers should stage a token protest outside Adiala Jail and then disperse.
“Everyone knows that we will not be allowed to meet Khan sahab, so we should record the protest and save our energies for the right time,” he suggested.
Another MNA claimed that ever since Aleema Khanum took control of the party’s social media operations, online trolling targets anyone who speaks with logic or suggests a practical approach to securing Imran’s release.
“On the other hand, it is also a fact that our workers are arrested while Aleema is not, despite non-bailable warrants having been issued for her. We have received messages from certain quarters that if we ‘calm down’, meetings with Khan sahib may be allowed in a few weeks. However, some individuals appear more interested in self-projection,” he claimed.
“It is a fact that earlier this week, while Aleema Khanum was holding a sit-in, around 20 of our vehicles were damaged, and police seized the keys of several others. As a result, even those cars that were not damaged could not be driven away by party leaders,” he claimed.
“There are some people who reach the sit-in for ratings as they are active on social media,” he added.
He further said that in the past, Mashal Yousafzai, after meeting Imran and Bushra Bibi, had conveyed that they had instructed her to end the protests outside Adiala jail and stage demonstrations outside the Islamabad High Court instead.
“A written directive was also issued in this regard, but later Aleema Khanum met Khan sahab and claimed he had not given any such instructions, after which the protests outside Adiala jail resumed,” he added.
Central Information Secretary PTI Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn, admitted that the decision was made to stop protests outside the prison.
“However, when Aleema Khanum announced that she would hold the protest outside Adiala jail, the party decided to stand along with her. She is the sister of Imran Khan, and we will stand by her,” Waqas explained.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, dismissed reports of internal rifts within the party as “disinformation.”
“There can be differences of opinion, that is the beauty of a political party. In the last parliamentary party meeting, it was unanimously decided that all decisions will be taken by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and the entire party will follow his lead,” he said.
CM KP Sohail Afridi again barred from meeting Imran
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet Imran for the 10th time on Thursday. Although he arrived at Adiala Jail, the police informed him that the meeting could not be allowed.
Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi said that it was strange that an elected CM was not being allowed to meet his party’s founding chairman despite court orders to the contrary.
He questioned the state on the message being sent to PTI and Imran Khan’s sisters, who were peacefully protesting but were dispersed using water cannons. He asked whether the intention was to suggest that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was not considered part of Pakistan.
He warned that both the federal and Punjab government leadership would face consequences once the PTI returned to power at the Centre.
Afridi said that efforts had been underway for the past three years to “minus Imran” , but all such attempts had failed. He added that the government and the “powers that be” should engage in talks with Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, as Imran had authorised them to represent him in negotiations.
Replying to a question about Faiz Hameed’s sentencing, Afridi said it was an “internal matter of the institution”.
Early on Wednesday morning, authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of the PTI founder, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier.
The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration.
The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.</p><small>2025-12-11 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11214910c186c9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960526/time-magazine-names-architects-of-ai-as-person-of-the-year' target='_blank'><strong>Time magazine names ‘Architects of AI’ as Person of the Year</strong></a><br><p>Time magazine named the “Architects of AI” as its Person of the Year on Thursday, highlighting the US tech titans whose work on cutting-edge artificial intelligence is transforming humanity.
Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and xAI’s Elon Musk are among the innovators who have “grabbed the wheel of history, developing technology and making decisions that are reshaping the information landscape, the climate, and our livelihoods,” Time wrote.
One of two covers of the magazine is a homage to the famous 1932 photograph of ironworkers casually eating lunch on a steel beam above New York City.







In the Time illustration, sitting astride the city are Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, AMD chief Lisa Su, Musk, Huang, Altman as well as Google’s AI boss Demis Hassabis, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li.
“Racing both beside and against each other, they placed multibillion-dollar bets on one of the biggest physical infrastructure projects of all time,” the magazine said of the group.
“They reoriented government policy, altered geopolitical rivalries, and brought robots into homes. AI emerged as arguably the most consequential tool in great-power competition since the advent of nuclear weapons.” Alongside popular AI models like ChatGPT and Claude, Time credited investors like SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has plunged billions of dollars into the technology.
Time’s Person of the Year selection is an acknowledgement of the year’s most influential figure.
The title last year went to president-elect Donald Trump. Others have included singer Taylor Swift and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.
‘Gravitational center of 2025’
According to the magazine, which is owned by Silicon Valley billionaire Marc Benioff, 2025 was the year AI shifted from promise to reality and when ChatGPT usage more than doubled to 10 percent of the world’s population.
“This is the single most impactful technology of our time,” Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia – the most valuable company in the world – told Time.
He predicted that AI will eventually grow the global economy from $100 trillion to $500 trillion.
But the magazine also pointed to AI’s darker side.
Lawsuits have alleged that chatbots contributed to suicides and mental health crises, sparking debates about “chatbot psychosis,” where users may devolve into delusions and paranoia.
In one case, the California parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine are suing OpenAI after he took his own life. They claim that ChatGPT provided information about suicide methods.
Time noted too looming job displacement as more companies race to replace workers with AI models.
Yet the magazine notably steered away from using AI to generate its cover art, opting instead for human artists.
Thomas Hudson, chief analyst at US research firm Forrester, said the Person of the Year choice rightly reflected AI’s heavy influence this year.
“AI has been the gravitational center of 2025 for the economy and the source of endless discussions on how it will shape the future of our societies,” he said in a statement.</p><small>2025-12-11 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11205508d3ef50f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960524/afghan-deportation-likely-to-pick-up-pace-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan deportation likely to pick up pace in KP</strong></a><br><p>The deportation of Afghan refugees from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is likely to pick up pace as authorities are moving to push out those staying in refugee camps across the province after the Centre criticised the KP government’s response to the issue.
In October, the federal government denotified 28 refugee camps across the province during a drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards — the last category of refugees legally living in Pakistan without visas. The process was underway since September 1.
A senior government official told Dawn that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had accused the KP government of “going soft on Afghan refugees.”
“While all refugee camps across the province had been denotified, a soft drive was ongoing in KP to send them to Afghanistan,” he said.
The official said the Pak-Afghan border was closed for new arrivals and trade, while it was only open for deportation and repatriation of Afghan refugees.
In a presser last week, the interior minister had pointed out that refugee camps had been shut down across the country except KP, where they were still operational, he said, adding the refugees had been receiving health and educational facilities.
“Following the interior minister’s presser, the provincial authorities conveyed a message to the district administration to go hard on refugees,” he said.
According to the official, the KP authorities had been directed to return refugees to their country and discontinue facilities of health, education, electricity, drinking water and psycho-social support to the camps.
Some of the facilities had been discontinued, while the process for others was underway, the official said, adding the district authorities had actively been working to take over camps’ infrastructure and other facilities.
“They are being pushed out of refugee camps.”
A large number of Afghan refugees were living in urban areas as well, but they had yet to see a concerted effort to be sent back, he said.
About the repatriation of illegal Afghan nationals, Naqvi, in the press conference last week, had said the authorities were facing difficulties in KP about sending Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan.
“This is not the case in the three other provinces. Afghan migrants are being protected in the KP. The federal government had denotified camps of Afghan refugees, but several of them are still operational in KP,” Naqvi alleged. He warned the Afghans who had been repatriated that they would be arrested if they tried to return.
A total of 43 Afghan refugee camps were operational in the province before the denotification orders. On October 15, the authorities ordered the immediate shutdown of the 28 last remaining camps in the province.
A senior KP government official told Dawn that they had asked districts to hold jirgas with the refugees and facilitate those who wanted to go back to their homeland.
According to the UN refugee agency data released on Tuesday, a population count of Afghans living in Pakistan revealed that they number over 2.18 million, out of whom 1.22m are registered, with only 35pc of registered Afghans living in refugee villages.
In 2023, the government set a deadline of Nov 1 for all illegal immigrants to leave Pakistan, otherwise, all law enforcement agencies would deport them. The government, then, initiated a nationwide operation to deport illegal foreign nationals, the majority of whom were Afghans.
Key findings of a UN refugee agency report stated cumulatively, from September 15, 2023, to November 8, 2025, 1,723,481 individuals have returned to Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-12-11 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11200219057b37c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960523/pakistan-summons-norwegian-envoy-over-unwarranted-presence-at-court-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan summons Norwegian envoy over ‘unwarranted’ presence at court hearing</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday summoned the Norwegian ambassador to Pakistan and urged him to “adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement” after his “unwarranted” attendance at a court hearing today.
Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas attended the Supreme Court hearing of rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The diplomat’s presence during the court proceedings generated a lot of chatter on social media.
The ministry, in its statement, said the Scandinavian country’s top representative was summoned by the additional foreign secretary (Europe). He was informed that his presence breached “diplomatic protocol and relevant international law”.







“Noting that his actions amount to interference in the internal affairs of the country, the Ambassador was urged to adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement, as outlined in the relevant articles of the Vienna Convention,” said the statement.
However, Imaan defended the envoy’s presence during the court hearing today on social media.
Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case.
“This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said.







Imaan and her husband are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief.
The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca.
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The two have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.</p><small>2025-12-11 16:20</small></div><hr>
