The SCO summit, to be held in the northern port city of China’s Tianjin on Sunday and Monday, will gather more than 20 world leaders in a powerful show of Global South solidarity, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and India’s PM Narendra Modi.
Terming his visit “historic”, PM Shehbaz said on X today: “I look forward to meeting H.E. President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to further build upon our bilateral ties with China, our All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner, as well as with other key countries of the region […]”
The premier expressed his aim to “enhance regional cooperation, strengthen multilateralism, and advance shared goals for peace and prosperity”.
 






According to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa), the prime minister would hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang, “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”.
“He would also attend the military parade with President Xi and other world leaders being held in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World’s Anti-Fascist War,” the Mofa added.
PM Shehbaz, as per the statement, would “interact with reputed Chinese businessmen and corporate executives to discuss bilateral trade, economic and investment ties”. He would also address a Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference in Beijing.
The statement highlighted that the visit was a part of leadership-level exchanges between the two countries.
“It manifests the importance attached by the two countries to further deepen their All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, reaffirm support on issues of respective core interests, advance Phase-II of CPEC and maintain regular communication on important regional and global developments,” Mofa said.
 






Leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the 25th SCO Heads of State Council.
The summit will also feature Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years as the two neighbours work on further defusing tensions roiled by deadly border clashes in 2020.
Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.
“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” an official announcement had said, quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative.
In July, the two countries decided to form technical working groups to explore and implement projects focusing on high-yield cotton seed development, advanced water-saving irrigation technologies, and modern farming techniques.</p><small>2025-08-30 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/301202572fd0408.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938305/modi-hedges-bets-as-trump-thumbs-nose-at-decades-of-courtship' target='_blank'><strong>Modi hedges bets as Trump thumbs nose at decades of courtship</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: For nearly three decades, US presidents — both Democrat and Republican — courted New Delhi as an emerging ally, politely overlooking disagreements for the sake of larger goals.
Donald Trump has abruptly changed that, slapping 50 per cent tariffs on many Indian products as he seeks to punish it for buying oil from Russia.
India was a Cold War partner of Moscow, but since the 1990s US leaders have hoped for a joint front with fellow democracy India in the face of the rise of China.
In striking timing, Indian PM Narendra Modi heads to China this weekend, the latest meeting bet­ween the world’s two most populous nations as they explore areas of common ground.

The Modi-Trump bromance has faltered after the latter started taking credit for the ceasefire with Pakistan

Trump has accused India of fueling Moscow’s deadly attacks on Ukraine by purchasing Russian oil. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro even called Ukraine “Modi’s war” in a Bloomberg TV interview.
Yet Trump has refrained from tougher US sanctions on Russia itself, saying he still hopes for a negotiated settlement.
“This is not just about tariffs, not just about Russia, not just about oil,” said Tanvi Madan of the Broo­k­ings Institution.
“There seems to be something broader going on here — personal on Trump’s side, piqued as he may be at India,” she said.
“And then on the Indian side, for Modi, it becomes a political issue.”
Faltering bromance
Trump and Modi appeared to forge a strong bond during Trump’s first term.
In 2020, Trump rejoiced as Modi invited him to inaugurate the world’s largest cricket stadium in front more than 120,000 people.
But Trump has since appeared irritated as he seeks credit for what he said was Nobel Prize-worthy diplomacy between Pakistan and India in May.
India, which adamantly rejects any third-party mediation on held Kashmir, has since given the cold shoulder to Trump as he muses of brokering between New Delhi and Islamabad.
Pakistan, by contrast, has emb­raced Trump’s attention, with its army chief meeting him at the White House.
US policymakers have long ski­rted around India’s sensitivities on Kashmir and sought to contain fallout from disagreements on other issues.
 
 

Jake Sullivan, national security adviser under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, said that Trump had broken a bipartisan consensus with his “massive trade offensive” against India.
India is now thinking “I guess maybe we have to go show up in Beijing and sit with the Chinese because we’ve got to hedge against America,” Sullivan told The Bulwark.
Madan said that for the Indian establishment, the tariffs contradicted US assurances that unlike China, Washington would not use “economic ties to coerce India.” “If you’re India, even if you sort this particular issue out, you’re now saying, we used to see this increasing interaction with the US across many domains as an opportunity,” she said.
“And now Trump has made us realise that we should also see that integration or dependence as a vulnerability.”
Chance for China
For China, Modi’s trip is an opportunity “to drive a wedge between India and the US,” said William Yang, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.
“Beijing won’t miss the opportunity to present itself as a ‘reliable partner’ that is interested in deepening relations with New Delhi,” he said.
But he noted that India and China still had fundamental differences.
China is the key partner and military supplier of Pakistan and has sought to ramp up influence in the Indian Ocean.

Right-handed Salman hit a 36-ball 53 not out with three sixes and as many boundaries which lifted Pakistan to a solid 182-7 in their 20 overs.
Haris took 4-31 while fellow pacer Shaheen Afridi claimed 2-21, while spinners Mohammad Nawaz (2-23) and Sufiyan Muq­eem (2-25) dismissed Afghanistan for 143 in 19.5 overs before a noisy capacity 16,000 crowd at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
 






Afghanistan matched Pakistan with opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 27-ball 38 with a six and three boundaries, adding 51 for the second wicket with Sediqullah Atal, who made 23.
It was right-armer Haris who changed the game with a two-wicket 12th over sending Atal and Karim Janat back without conceding a run.
Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan smashed five sixes and a four in his whirlwind 16-ball 39 but fell to Haris to end his team’s fight.
Salman, who was named man-of-the-match for his fighting knock, said staying at the wicket helped him score solidly later on.
 






“I saw the first seven-eight overs, it was holding [for the spinners when they bowled slow and for the change-ups of pacers]. I knew that if I could get in, I could hit sixes against any bowlers, and that is what I did,” Salman said in his post-match talk.
Commenting on Pakistan’s batting against spin bowling, the skipper said that the team were ready for the challenge.
“I am not as good as I used to be, but we came here ten days early, and we know there is going to be a lot of spin and we are up to that challenge,” he said.
On his team bowlers’ show, he said, “[Our] bowling was outstanding. Whoever came in, they bowled hard lengths. We knew there were going to be lot of slower balls. They [Haris and Shaheen] are some of the best fast bowlers in the world.
“Even [Sufiyan] Muqeem as well was impressive. The pick of the bowlers for me was [Mohammad] Nawaz. He always bowls difficult overs. It is not easy for a finger-spinner and he is doing so well - I am so happy for him. Scoring above par [today], it was a 150-160 kind of wicket, we scored 180-odd and we knew it would be challenging for them [Afghanistan].”
Earlier, Pakistan elected to bat first and were lifted by Salman’s fourth T20I half-century.
He anchored the innings admirably well after opener Sahibzada Farhan smashed two sixes and a boundary in his 10-ball 21 as Pakistan ended the batting powerplay at 54-1.
Salman added 53 for the fifth wicket with left-handed Mohammad Nawaz whose 11-ball 21 had two sixes and a boundary as the duo helped Pakistan get 51 runs in the last five overs.
Rashid, on his rearguard action with the bat, said, “It was needed at the end. We had it in our mind…that run-rate is something that matters. As long as I can try my best to get close to the target, and luckily we got some runs there.
“I feel this is a wicket of 190-200.”
Pakistan in their next tri-series match face hosts United Arab Emirates on Saturday.
All three teams face other each other twice with the top two playing the Sept 7 final.
The event is a build-up to the Asia Cup that starts on Sept 9.

A meeting, chaired by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to review the flood situation in the province, was informed by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the irrigation department that a high flood was expected to hit Guddu Barrage between Sept 3 and 4, potentially displacing over 52,000 families.
The CM instructed the PDMA and district administrations to get ready to establish more than 500 camps along river embankments to protect affected communities and livestock. “In case of a major flood wave, not a single life, human or animal, should be lost,” he stressed.
He also directed the deployment of over 30,000 personnel of Rescue-1122 and 178 boats — 72 in northern districts and 106 in southern districts — to respond to potential emergencies and support relocation efforts.

A press statement said that the meeting at the CM House was attended among others by provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon and Makhdoom Mahboob Zaman, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, PDMA Director General Salman Shah and others, while commissioners and DIGs participated in the meeting through a video link.
In view of the likely displacement of people, the chief minister directed to send boats in six vulnerable areas in Sukkur, four each in Ghotki, Khairpur, Shikarpur, Naushahro Feroze and Dadu, and three vulnerable areas in Shaheed Benazirabad.
The CM was informed that the Pakistan Navy had kept 26 boats on standby to support relief operations.
As for PDMA’s stock position, he was told that ample relief supplies — including mosquito nets, blankets, first-aid kits, kitchen sets, mattresses, plastic mats, portable toilets, quilts, jerry cans, sleeping mats, tents, de-watering pumps, and generators — were available for deployment.
Later, the chief minister, taking into account the vulnerability of the situation, decided to visit Guddu Barrage and Sukkur Barrage to assess preparedness and conducted an aerial survey of the vulnerable Indus embankments.
Water level being monitored: Sharjeel
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government has taken comprehensive emergency measures at all levels to deal with the possible flood situation.
He said that water levels at Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages are being continuously monitored and the situation was currently under control, but alternative plans were in place to respond to any emergency, said a press release.

This is the story of how we got those pictures, and what I saw along the way.
The first images from Kartarpur appeared on social and mainstream media on Wednesday. These were filmed by rescue officials during efforts to evacuate households on the premises — the families of the shrine’s caretakers and others.
They were all evacuated by boat, as the water level inside the Kartarpur complex was too high to venture in any other way.
 






We arrived in Narowal after nightfall on Thurs­d­­ay, and despite requests from our newsroom, we were unable to immediately secure any usable photographs.
Although Narowal city was spared, its suburbs and the villages and tehsils on its outskirts bore the brunt of the waters that came pouring out of the Ravi and the half a dozen rainwater drains (nullahs) that flow into the district from India. These inc­lude Nullah Dek, Basanter, Baen and Auj.
Abid Mehmood, our correspondent in the area, described their flow thus: “Auj and Baen enter the Ravi in Shakargarh tehsil before Kartarpur, while Basanter enters the river after Kartarpur. But this time, the force of the floodwater in the Ravi pushed back the water in these drains. This caused more damage.”
At this point, he says, the river has the capacity of around 150,000 cusecs, but it overflowed its banks upon receiving around 250,000 cusecs.
Getting to the gurdwara was no easy task. Drenched from the chest down, I held my camera aloft above my head as we hung onto a tractor trolley that was ferrying locals to and from the flooded villages around Kartarpur.
The trolley was filled to the brim, but I managed to find a foothold and hung on for dear life. Along the way, locals trying to escape the waters would call out to me: “Don’t go, you’ll fall,” or “watch yourself” are the most printable of the refrains yelled my way as we trundled towards the gurdwara.
Along the way, the tractor trolley picked up more and more marooned folk. Although authorities had mandated evacuation, there were still some holdouts who refused to leave their homes.
It was only after their houses were submerged that these people realised their mistake; I heard many a cry of “we’re doomed” and “everything is gone” from the roadsides.

In the morning, when we finally made it to Kartarpur complex, the only way to approach was by boat. We abandoned our vehicle around 1.5km away on Shakargarh Road and boarded a rescue boat, which took us to the gurdwara itself.
By this time, the structure had been evacuated; even the security check posts were submerged and empty. The main darbar on the ground floor was completely inundated, with only the upper storey untouched by the floodwaters.
On our way back, the daylight offered some sobering perspective. There was only water all around as far as the eye could see, submerging fields and villages alike.
But there was still hope. Hiace vans were now ferrying stranded people to and fro along with their belongings. These were being operated by singer Abrarul Haq’s charity — the Sahara Trust — which also runs a hospital in the district.
According to our correspondent, Abid, the floodwaters hadn’t affected Narowal city as badly; it was the suburbs and villages on the outskirts that bore the brunt of the damage. According to one estimate, at least 145 villages were impacted, and their crops destroyed.
 
 

Abid says that water is now slowly receding from the rural tehsils, but it has already caused significant damage to agriculture, especially rice and fodder crops, as well as infrastructure, including the roads. “Narowal-Shakargarh road was closed while Narowal-Zafarwal road was submerged in the floodwater making travel on either impossible.”
In his words, locals know that if there is more heavy rainfall in the Ravi’s catchment areas (in India-held Kashmir), it could prove dangerous for Narowal. But if the downpour isn’t torrential, things would be fine.
Saba Chaudhry, a freelance journalist based in Narowal, told Dawn she was in Noorpur village near Shakargarh when the flood from Nullah Dek hit the area. Her village remained safe as it was located on higher ground, but there was floodwater all around.
“The main road on Manzoorpura Plot was completely submerged in two to three feet deep water.”
Noorpur and its surrounding villages become disconnected from the district headquarters, making travel in and out impossible.
On Friday, three days after Kartarpur and her village were submerged, she visited the gurdwara.
“The authorities had managed to drain the water from the complex, but floodwater still surrounds the building,” she says, adding that at least the roads have now reopened.

This alarming situation has exposed serious lapses on the part of the Prisons Department and the Punjab Aids Control Programme (PACP).
Adiala has been in the headlines lately as former PM Imran Khan is also incarcerated there. However, it must be kept in mind that Mr Khan is kept in isolation and is not allowed to mingle with other inmates.
The prison is currently very overcrowded as well, housing 4,337 prisoners against its authorised capacity of 1,994.

PACP report reveals there are 645 infected individuals in Punjab’s 43 prisons; some of them are already receiving anti-retroviral therapy

The presence of such a large number of HIV-infected prisoners poses a grave risk to the health and lives of other inmates if immediate measures are not taken to curb the transmission of the virus.
 
 

Medical experts explain that HIV attacks the body’s immune system, and remains incurable.
“Once you contract the infection, your body cannot get rid of it. However, there are medicines that can control HIV and prevent complications. Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be placed on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART),” one medical expert said.
They expressed serious concern that if a high-profile prison like Adiala is struggling to contain the rapid spread of HIV/Aids, the situation in other jails could be even worse.
Numbers
The PACP report sheds light on the number of prisoners suffering from HIV/Aids across the province. It reveals that the number of HIV-positive inmates in all of Punjab’s 43 prisons has reached 645, with the highest number of cases being reported from Adiala Jail, where 148 inmates have tested positive for HIV.
According to official figures, 83 inmates were tested positive for the HIV/Aids in District Jail Lahore (also known as Camp Jail), followed by 37 in Central Jail Faisalabad, and 27 each in Central Jail Lahore (also known as Kot Lakhpat prison) and Central Jail Gujranwala.
 
 

In the remaining 38 prisons of Punjab, the combined number of HIV-positive inmates stands at 323. An official privy to the development claimed that several HIV-positive inmates were facing an interruption in the provision of medicines in the jails.
As per the PACP protocols, after screening process, jail authorities shift the suspected HIV patient to the ART centre of the district concerned, where the inmate undergoes further testing to confirmation the diagnosis.
It repeats tests using elaborate methods, and after confirmation that the inmate has tested positive, it shifts them back to prison, where the programme provides them with medicines for a three-month period.
PACP teams normally visit jails and perform screening of all inmates every six months or so.
Alarming situation
The HIV/Aids outbreak in the jails of Punjab, particularly, in Adiala, has caused alarm among PACP authorities.
This was evident from an official correspondence, wherein the PACP head immediately activated all the ART Centres established under the programme.
“All ART Centres shall undertake fortnightly visits to jails within their respective districts to ascertain the total number of HIV-positive patients registered from the jail and the number of those presently receiving Anti-Retroviral Therapy,” reads a letter issued by PACP Project Director Dr Summaira Ashraf.
She emphasised that the centres must ensure all registered jail patients continue to receive treatment without interruption and any gaps, deficiencies or challenges observed during the visit must be clearly identified and reported.
Talking to Dawn, Punjab Inspector General (Prisons) Mian Farooq Nazeer said the PACP had taken over responsibility of screening all new inmates for various diseases, including HIV/Aids and hepatitis B and C, a couple of years ago.
Following the guidelines, the programme was to provide kits at the health facilities of each jail where the prisoners were tested for chronic diseases, adding that jail doctors would then perform tests on the patients under the programme’s guidelines. However, he maintained that his department had nothing to do with the screening of inmates entering or leaving prisons.

He added that a National Industrial Policy was also in the works to strengthen long-term export prospects and position Pakistan’s manufacturing sector for global integration. Both initiatives are designed to enhance competitiveness and address longstanding inefficiencies.
The minister was speaking at a meeting with leading industrialists, including Kohinoor Mills CEO Aamir Fayyaz Sheikh, Aptma Chairman Kamran Ars­had, Fazal Cloth CEO Rehman Naseem, and Aptma Executive Director Shahid Sattar. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan also attended.
According to an official statement, the commerce minister said the Textiles and Apparel Policy will focus on reducing manufacturing costs, improving productivity, promoting research and development, diversifying markets and products, and increasing Pakistan’s share in global trade.
He stressed that export growth must be Pakistan’s priority and assured stakeholders that policy decisions would be made in consultation with industry representatives. For the first time, he said, the government and industry were aligned in their determination to revive and expand exports.
Mr Jam also welcomed Aptma’s proposal to study the policies of regional competitors. Sharing insights from his recent visit to Dhaka, he noted Bangladesh’s success in industrial growth and readymade garment exports.
Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar said the National Industrial Policy would go beyond a few sectors to cover the entire industrial landscape. It would address energy, tariffs and taxation, financing, and economic zones, while also facilitating Greenfield projects, introducing land-lease models under public-private partnerships, and establishing a one-window facility for investors.
He added that under the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the new policy would inject momentum into industrial growth nationwide.
Industry’s concerns
The Aptma delegation urged the government to eliminate structural inefficiencies and create an enabling environment to boost competitiveness of export sectors.
The meeting concluded on a note of optimism, with both sides expressing confidence in boosting exports through sustainable policy support and collaborative efforts.

ISLAMABAD: The government has restricted financing for new projects under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) to just two per cent for the current year, in line with conditions of the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
This was disclosed by Planning and Development Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra while briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, which met under the chairmanship of Senator Quratulain Marri.
Mr Sumra said the IMF had demanded that new development projects be limited to 10pc of the PSDP to maintain fiscal discipline, given the already large and longstanding project portfolio.
Accordingly, the government decided to prioritise ongoing projects of national importance for early completion, allocating only 2pc of PSDP funds for new schemes in the current budget. He said 2,518 projects worth Rs344 billion were completed or closed down in this process.
The secretary informed the committee that the IMF had also sent a questionnaire covering multiple areas, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Public Investment Management (PIM), which were directly linked to the Planning Commission. Pakistan submitted the completed questionnaire on March 20, 2025.
While discussing the IMF’s Diagnosis Report, it was revealed that the lender had pointed out weak project prioritisation, frequent delays, cost overruns, and inadequate protection of funds for approved projects as major shortcomings. The committee chair stressed that, in line with its earlier recommendations, ongoing projects should be completed before new ones are taken up.
On the panel’s previous recommendations, Mr Sumra said the standing committee had made 22 proposals, some of which had been implemented while others remained under consideration. The committee demanded a detailed compliance report on projects recommended by senators, but the ministry sought more time. The chair directed that the relevant ministries be called to the next meeting to present their reports.
 
 

Mr Sumra also briefed the committee on the Intelligent Project Automation System (iPAS), designed to streamline development processes by integrating systems, improving budget detail, and automating budget releases.
Two major projects
The National Highway Authority (NHA) presented updates on two major projects — the Sukkur-Hyderabad-Karachi Motorway (M-6) and Karachi-Quetta-Chaman Road (N-25).
The committee members were informed that the M-6 comprises five sections between Hyderabad and Sukkur. In the first phase, the Noushehroferoz-Ranipur and Ranipur-Sukkur sections were being prioritised, with formal approvals expected in September 2025.
The committee was told that the Islamic Development Bank would fund two sections of M-6, while negotiations with the Saudi Development Fund and Opec Fund for International Development were underway. A delegation from the Saudi Development Fund is scheduled to visit Pakistan in October.
On the Karachi-Hyderabad (M-10) Motorway, the committee was informed that the six-lane, 168km-long project had a preliminary estimated cost of Rs254bn, with final estimates to be determined after detailed design and commercial feasibility. It will be included in next year’s PSDP.
The committee chairperson expressed strong concern over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project, noting that the authority had already lost four months and was now seeking another four to finalise decisions under the PPP model. She directed the NHA to ensure work on the project begins by October 2025, warning that if the deadline was missed, the matter would be referred to the upper house of parliament for intervention.
She also instructed that the Economic Affairs Division and other relevant departments be called to the next meeting to brief the committee on measures for timely implementation.

• Iranian president offers condolences and assistance
• Army chief visits Sialkot, Shakargarh, Narowal and Kartarpur flood-hit areas; assures Sikh community of Darbar Sahib’s restoration
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Friday announced that the federal government was preparing a comprehensive strategy with consultation of all federating units for the construction of water reservoirs and impro­ved water management across the country, as devastating floods continued to wreak havoc.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister said that water reservoirs would be built through consultation and complete coordination with the provinces. “Climate change is a reality, and only through effective preparedness can the damages of natural disasters be minimised,” he was quoted as saying.
 






The PM underlined that all provinces, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the centre must work together to safeguard people from the adverse impacts of climate change, terming it a national issue that requires collective effort.
Relevant quarters are already working on his directives to formulate an effective policy for timely response to the impacts of climate change and the monsoon. The working paper of this policy will be shared with all provincial governments to devise a joint course of action.
 
 

The statement added that once the emergency situation subsides, the prime minister will convene a high-level meeting with the chief ministers of all four provinces, along with the heads of relevant institutions. The prime minister of AJ&K and the chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan will also be invited to the session.
At the same time, the premier appreciated the gesture of Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) employees for donating their one-day salary, amounting to Rs20 million, to support flood victims.
Iran offers help
Also on Friday, the prime minister received a telephone call from the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, who conveyed his condolences and solidarity with the people of Pakistan over the devastation caused by the ongoing floods in various parts of the country.
Expressing sympathy with the bereaved families who lost loved ones and property in the calamity, President Pezeshkian assured that Iran stood by Pakistan in this difficult time and offered whatever assistance his country could extend to the flood-affected population.
 






The prime minister thanked President Pezeshkian for his thoughtful gesture and Iran’s expression of support, terming it a reflection of the deep fraternal ties between the two nations. He also requested that his warm regards and good wishes be conveyed to the Supreme Leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei.
Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and expressed keen anticipation of their interaction at the upcoming SCO Summit in Tianjin, China, reports APP.
COAS visits flood-hit areas
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited flood-affected areas of Punjab, including the Sialkot
Sector, Shakargarh, Narowal, and Kartarpur, to review the situation and ongoing rescue and relief efforts.
During his visit, the COAS interacted with the affected Sikh community and assured them that all religious sites damaged during the floods, including Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, would be fully restored to their original condition on priority.
 


He reiterated that it is the responsibility of the state and its institutions to protect the minorities and their religious sites and the state of Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to uphold its responsibility towards the minorities.
The Sikh community warmly welcomed the army chief at the flood-affected areas of Sialkot Sector and thanked the army and civil administration for their services during the calamity.
Gen Asim Munir also conducted an aerial survey of Durbar Sahib Kartarpur. While interacting with representatives of civil administration, he appreciated their proactive response, which helped minimise the loss of lives and property.

The middle section of Madhopur barra­­ge, which spans the Ravi River in India, was washed away by surging water, the Reu­ters news agency reported, referring to video broadcast by Indian media a day earlier.
Pakistani officials said that this damage unleashed an uncontrolled flow across the border, flooding some parts of Lahore on Friday.
 
 

An Indian government source, while confirming that two gates of Madhopur barrage had broken, denied there had been any deliberate attempt to flood Pakistan.
Indian authorities say they are trying to stem the flow on the Ravi, despite the damage to the barrage, and the flow was being controlled by the Ranjit Sagar Dam upst­ream, Reuters quoted a source as saying.
The official claimed that India was doing whatever it could, blaming incessant rain for causing the flood.
Published in Dawn, August 30th, 2025</p><small>2025-08-30 04:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68b2424e4e012.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938348/provinces-or-local-government' target='_blank'><strong>Provinces or local government?</strong></a><br><p>RECENT media reports indicate that the ‘27th constitutional amendment’ is likely to divide the existing four federating units into 12 provinces.
Before finalising such a decision, parliamentarians must consider a superior alternative — to use this amendment to delineate local government (LGs) responsibilities and functions in Article 140-A of the Constitution and insert an additional list in the Fourth Schedule supplementing the federal and provincial lists.
There are compelling arguments why the division may not achieve the intended goal of providing public services to citizens. The timing is not ideal, as it could hinder the economy’s transition from stabilisation to sustained inclusive growth. Article 239(4) requires the provincial assemblies to pass a resolution to create new provinces. Achieving a two-thirds majority for these resolutions is unlikely, and political tension could increase at a time when stability is needed for economic reform.

There are compelling arguments why more provinces may not achieve the intended goal.

Second, even if this happens, dividing assets and liabilities, handling legal disputes, restructuring administrations, reassigning civil servants, delimiting constituencies and redrawing boundaries would distract policymakers from their focus on economic recovery.
 
 

A third aspect is the potential for significant increases in public expenditure due to additional offices, residences, vehicles, equipment, benefits, protocol, and operating costs for numerous ministers, legislators and bureaucrats, affecting fiscal consolidation efforts.
Fourth, decision-making and dispute resolution at the CCI, NFC and NEC may be delayed as provinces extend negotiations to support their respective claims. Fifth, citizens’ access to ministers and legislators would remain restricted compared to that of nazims and councillors also residing in the same villages and cities.
Sixth, business costs would escalate as companies operating nationwide would fall under 12 jurisdictions and file separate tax returns with different rates. Seventh, intra-regional inequalities would become sharper as relatively well-endowed areas such as Peshawar and Hazara in KP, Quetta in Balochistan, central and western Punjab and southern Sindh would do well compared to other provinces in the same region.
What should Article 140-A and the new Fourth Schedule list prescribe for LGs?
a) LGs would have complete control over education in primary and secondary schools up to Matric, healthcare up to district hospitals, water supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal, population planning, sports, mass transit, roads, bridges within district limits, prosecution, social welfare, and community and women’s development. All staff up to Grade 16 would be transferred along with their salary and allowance budgets.
 
 

b) Nazims would be directly elected on a party basis and half the seats of various corporations and councils allocated on through proportional representation,  reserved for women, technocrats, minorities, peasants and labourers. Large urban areas would have metropolitan corporations with the mayor heading the district government.
For example, the Lahore Metropolitan Corporation nazim would supervise and oversee agencies such as LDA, WASA, the waste management company, the Mass Transit Authority, and the Lahore Industrial Estates Development Company in addition to devolved departments. For other districts, there would be a mix of district councils and municipal corporations/committees. In predominantly rural areas, the district council nazim would head the district government. Each province would design its own configuration of union, town, tehsil, municipal and district councils depending on population, area and density. What Punjab may choose may not fit the needs of Balochistan with its small population and larger area.
c) In the context of fiscal decentralisation, the Provincial Finance Commission will allocate a minimum of 30 to 40 per cent of the provincial share from the divisible tax pool (without disturbing the existing NFC award allocation to the provinces) to LGs, granting them autonomy in budget formulation and implementation. The PFC would give preference in allocation to backward districts as advanced districts can mobilise revenues from their own sources, incentivised by matching grants.
 
 

The LG would assess and collect urban immovable property tax, capital gains tax, agricultural tax, cesses, user charges and fees, and spend these resources in their respective jurisdictions. Evidence shows that raising taxes or charging user fees for services at the local level is relatively easy. The district accounts officer would report administratively to the district nazim, but be professionally supervised by the province’s accountant general.
Audit of accounts at all tiers of government would be done by the auditor general of Pakistan. CEOs of corporations and district councils would act as principal accounting officers for issues under their control, head the district development working party (for approval of ADP projects), and district accounts committees.
d) Administratively, current LG and local council service staff should be replaced with experts, professional managers and specialists recruited by the Public Service Commission at market-based salaries. Citizen-facing roles should be filled by young, qualified, courteous and capable officers. Devolved departments’ district executive officers must have the legal powers to resolve citizens’ issues without referring the matter to provincial secretariats.
e) A subsection defining province-LG relations must be inserted and include performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation, audits, etc. Provision for suspending or superseding LGs should not be at the discretion of the chief ministers. Deputy commissioners can assist LGs but not interfere in their daily affairs.
If effectively implemented, strengthening LGs may offer substantial advantages relative to the creation of new provinces. First, it would minimise dissatisfaction with the government as citizens would be able to access basic services at the grassroots level.
 
 

Second, they would have a say in setting priorities and decision-making, leading to efficient resource allocation and cost-effectiveness.
Third, it would enable political parties to become training grounds for a critical mass of young leaders to gain hands-on experience for shouldering responsibilities as future provincial and federal ministers.
Fourth, it would promote political inclusion and deter dynastic politics by giving representation to marginalised and excluded groups — women, minorities, peasants and labour, professionals, and experts — in the governance structure.
Fifth, people may be more willing to pay taxes when collected by their local representatives instead of distant central authorities, as they would directly observe the benefits. Finally, there would be no large increase in unproductive expenditure as elected LG officials live in their own residences within the community, while their offices and facilities are already in place.

• Calls for revised Afghan refugee policy that balances humanitarian obligations and national security
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Friday expressed concern over the lack of preparedness of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) governments and their failure to act on early warnings issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions, presided over by Senator Asad Qasim at the Parliament House, voiced displeasure over the absence of the GB chief secretary, stressing that the participation of senior officials was vital for effective parliamentary deliberations and meaningful decision-making.
The committee decided to defer the agenda pertaining to Gilgit-Baltistan and directed that senior GB officers must ensure their presence at future meetings.
Senators Faisal Saleem Rehman, Attaul Haq and Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, the ministry’s additional secretary and senior officials from relevant departments attended the meeting. The committee members were briefed on monsoon-induced damage, relief operations, and tourism-related challenges in Azad Kashmir.
 






The State Disaster Management Authority secretary informed the meeting that since June 26, AJK had faced nine spells of monsoon rains following a May cloudburst. These disasters claimed 28 lives, damaged over 2,100 houses and caused extensive destruction of public infrastructure, including roads, water supply schemes, schools and electricity networks.
Committee Chairman Asad Qasim observed that despite NDMA alerts, tourists were not restricted from entering vulnerable areas, which was the responsibility of the local administration. He also noted the absence of early warning systems in disaster-prone zones and suggested installing such systems at 100-kilometre intervals across AJK.
On financial matters, the chairman raised concerns over the monitoring of relief funds, including Rs3 billion provided by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet. He suggested setting up an ad hoc oversight mechanism comprising parliamentarians, the judiciary and other stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.
Mr Qasim also questioned the accuracy of official data, warning that incomplete surveys and underreporting undermined public trust.
 
 

About communication infrastructure, the senators regretted that private operators had failed to provide services in remote areas, leaving the Special Communication Organ­isation (SCO) as the only functioning network during calamities.
The committee recommended that the Universal Services Fund be used to expand coverage, particularly in tourist areas, as required by the law.
Refugee policy
The committee also called for a revised and coordinated policy on Afghan refugees that balances humanitarian obligations with national security needs.
Phase III of the deportation plan will begin on September 1, targeting Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards. The committee was briefed on the role and scope of the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CCAR).
The CCAR chief commissioner informed the committee that, following the expiry of the voluntary repatriation deadline, Afghan refugees’ status had been changed to “aliens”.
 
 

The government’s “Illegal Foreigners Repa­triation Plan”, announced in October 2023, required all undocumented migr­ants to leave under a three-phase regime. Phase I, launched in October 2023, covered the return of all illegal foreigners. Phase II, beginning April 1, 2025, included the deportation of illegal foreigners along with Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders. Since then, about 48,000 ACC holders have been deported. Phase III, starting September 1, will focus on POR card holders.
CCAR officials said that around 300,000 Afghans had voluntarily returned so far, with Sindh hosting nearly 80,000 refugees, and significant numbers residing in KP and Balochistan.
The committee members observed that undocumented refugees remained undercounted, while international funding for refugee management had largely dried up.
The officials said cooperation with the UNHCR was limited to humanitarian support, as agreements last revised in 2009 had expired.
The committee also sought clarity on the ownership of 54 refugee camps and their associated land assets.
“You know the numbers, you know the funds received, now we must ensure accountability, inter-ministerial cooperation, and clarity on the way forward,” the committee chairman said.

Officials report nearly 300,000 displaced from the province alone and more than a million affected as the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab overflowed their banks. This latest emergency comes while the country is still reeling from lethal flash floods in KP and as a 7-km-long lake formed after a landslide blocked a river in Gilgit-Baltistan, forcing precautionary evacuations. It has been a season of peril, from the mountains to the plains.
Following the cataclysmic floods of 2022 that put a third of the country under water, affected 33m and displaced nearly 8m, the government and international donors produced a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment and launched the Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework (4RF). Donors pledged over $9bn at Geneva to ‘build back better’ in housing, livelihoods and public services. The commitments set a bar we have yet to meet.
 
 

Progress has been slow and uneven. Rights monitors have flagged gaps in beneficiary lists and basic amenities in government housing schemes. Even this April, tens of thousands of schools in Sindh hit by the 2022 floods were struggling to function. Three years later, the response still leans heavily on evacuation, camps and compensation. While such measures save lives, they do not necessarily restore them.
Punjab’s set-up of hundreds of relief and medical sites demonstrates mobilisation capacity, yet there is still no published nationwide rehabilitation blueprint for this year comparable to 4RF: no clear calendar for resilient housing grants, no transparent, countrywide registry of climate-displaced households, no public dashboard tracking delivery by district.
What must be done is no rocket science. The state must treat displacement as a policy priority, not an after-event improvisation. It must legislate a climate-displacement framework that guarantees registration, interim shelter, core-housing grants tied to resilient designs, and portable access to health, education and social protection (through BISP) for uprooted families. Second, set aside and fast-track rehabilitation finance — including Geneva pledges — with independent audits and open data, so money reaches the last mile.
 
 

Third, rebuild in ways that can withstand climate risks: multi-purpose elevated shelters across riverine belts; enforceable zoning to keep construction off floodplains; city drainage upgrades; and accelerated glacial-lake early-warning and downstream evacuation routes in the north. Finally, make communities co-designers: women, sharecroppers and landless labourers must be at the centre of relocation and livelihood plans.
The latest devastation in Punjab should not become another chapter in our cycle of disaster, ‘relief’ and neglect. The state has planned before. It must deliver now so that those repeatedly uprooted by a changing climate can rebuild lives rather than wait for the next siren.

Monsoon rains this week swelled three transboundary rivers that cut through Punjab, the country’s agricultural heartland and home to nearly half of its 255 million people.
Bano moved to Shahdara town last year, on the outskirts of Lahore, to avoid the choking smog pollution of Pakistan’s second-largest city, only to have her new beginning overturned by raging floods.
“My husband had started coughing blood and his condition just kept getting worse when the smog hit,” Bano told AFP, walking through muddy streets.

Pakistan regularly ranks among the world’s most polluted countries, with Lahore often the most polluted megacity between November and February.
“I thought the smog was bad enough – I never thought it could be worse with the floods,” she said.
Her impoverished neighbourhood is home to thousands of low-lying homes crammed together on narrow streets.
The nearby overflowing Ravi river flooded many of them, forcing dozens of families to take refuge in an elementary school on higher ground, where doctors were treating people for skin infections linked to the floodwater.
More heavy rain is predicted over the weekend, including warnings of increased urban flooding in Lahore.
With her husband bedridden from tuberculosis, worsened by the relentless smog, Bano became the sole provider in a household struggling to breathe, survive, and endure the floods.
“I ate today after two days. There is no clean water to drink. I left my daughter at a relative’s place and stayed back, hoping the water recedes,” she said.
No time to pack
Landslides and floods triggered by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains have killed more than 800 people nationwide since June this year.
While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, unpredictable and deadly across the region.

More than 1.4 million people living near the rivers have been affected by the floods, with over 265,000 evacuated, said Azma Bukhari, the provincial information minister.
“We just can’t get a break,” Amir Mehmood, a 32-year-old shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood as Bano, told AFP.
“Children fall ill in the smog because of the extreme cold. Some become sick due to the (everyday) unsanitary conditions,” he said, referring to piles of waste that routinely line the streets.
“And now there’s a flood. Our homes have collapsed, the walls have fallen, and everything is damaged.”
He moved his family to a relative’s home on the other side of the town along with his 10 cows and two goats as the water crept closer.
More than 300 relief camps have been set up across the province to shelter those displaced with no family to turn to.
“The women you see here, and me, we had to run for our lives… we did not even get the time to get clothes for our kids,” 40-year-old widow Tabassum Suleman told AFP from the school camp.
“We do not know when we will be going back home,” she said, looking up at the dark skies. “But the worst is yet to come.”

The US Customs and Border Protection agency began collecting normal duty rates on all global parcel imports, regardless of value, country of origin, or mode of transportation at 12:01am (0401 GMT) on Friday.
It offered a flat-rate duty option of $80 to $200 per package shipped from foreign postal agencies for six months.
The change broadens the Trump administration’s cancellation of the de minimis exemption for packages from China and Hong Kong in May as part of an effort to halt shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the US.

Move disrupts supply chain models for e-commerce companies and small businesses

The de minimis tax exemption is a law that Congress passed on a bipartisan basis that allows shipments bound for American businesses and consumers valued under $800 (per person, per day) to enter the US free of duty and taxes. As it allows goods to be shipped quickly and affordably, it benefitted every American for decades though it gained much appreciation during the pandemic.
 
 

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said, “President Trump’s ending of the deadly de minimis loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury.”
A senior administration official said the change was permanent, adding that any push to restore the exemptions for trusted trading partner countries was “dead on arrival”.
The de minimis exemption has been in place since 1938, starting at $5 for gift imports and was raised from $200 to $800 in 2015 to foster small business growth on e-commerce marketplaces.
But direct shipments from China surged after President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term, creating a new direct-to-consumer business model for e-commerce firms Shein and Temu.
The National Coalition of Textile Organisations hailed a “historic win” for US manufacturing following the closing of a loophole that allowed foreign fast-fashion firms to avoid tariffs and import apparel sometimes made with forced labor, undercutting American jobs.
“The administrations executive action closes this channel and delivers long overdue relief to the US textile industry and its workers,” the group said. CBP has estimated that the number of packages claiming the de minimis exemption jumped nearly 10-fold from 139 million in fiscal 2015 to 1.36 billion in fiscal 2024, a rate of nearly four million per day.
Higher costs, more paperwork
However, retail analysts say that the end of de minimis is likely to raise prices for many goods sold through e-commerce companies as those that previously avoided tariffs because of the exemption will ultimately be charged duties.
This may put such firms on a par with costs for more established retailers like Walmart that tend to import merchandise in bulk containers that are subject to tariffs.
It is also likely to curb trade on peer-to-peer platforms, such as eBay and Etsy, used by small businesses to sell secondhand, vintage or handmade items. CBP has collected more than $492 million in additional duties on packages shipped from China and Hong Kong since their exemptions were eliminated on May 2, another Trump administration official said.
The official said that full tariff rates will apply to all packages shipped by express carriers such as FedEx, United Parcel Service and DHL. These companies are better set up to collect duties and process customs data than traditional postal agencies.
Foreign postal agencies can opt to collect and process the duties based on the value of the package contents, or opt for the flat rate method by collecting a flat tax based on Trump’s tariff rates currently in place on goods from the country of origin.
 
 

Based on latest CBP guidance, parcels would be charged $80 from countries with Trump-imposed duty rates below 16pc, such as Britain and the European Union, $160 from countries between 16pc and 25pc, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, and $200 from countries above 25pc, including Brazil, Canada, China and India.
But postal services must shift to full “ad valorem” duty collection based on the value of the shipments by Feb 28, 2026, the second official said. This official said some foreign postal services have suspended mail to the US but that the administration was working with foreign partners and the US Postal Service to minimize disruptions.
European postal groups, including Germany’s DHL and Norway’s Posten Bring, on Friday were seeking ways to handle the new fees and extra paperwork.
DHL has suspended shipments of standard parcels for businesses and Posten Bring paused shipments of packages under $800.

GAZA CITY: UN Secretary-Ge­neral Antonio Guterres has condemned the “endless catalogue of horrors” in Gaza, as the ter­ritory’s civil defence reported at least 31 killed by Israeli forces since dawn.
Israel, whose military is preparing to conquer Gaza City, is under mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its offensive in the Palestinian territory, where the UN has declared a famine.
“Gaza is piled with rubble, piled with bodies and piled with examples of what may be serious violations of international law,” Guter­res told journalists, calling for accountability.
Aya Daher, who was displaced from Gaza City’s Zeitoun district, said she had no shelter and was sitting outside a local hospital “just waiting for God’s mercy”.
“There were explosions all night. I was injured, my husband was injured by shrapnel, and my son was also wounded in the head. Thank God we survived, but there were martyrs,” she said.
AFP photos from the centre of Gaza showed lines of Palestinians fleeing south in vans and cars piled high with mattresses and bags.

Palestinians waiting for aid shot
Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli strikes and fire killed at least 31 more people across the Palestinian territory, including six shot while waiting for aid in the south.
The Israeli military said it was preparing to “expand operations against Hamas in Gaza City”.
Asked for comment, the Israeli military said it needed precise times and coordinates to look into the latest reports of 31 deaths.
 
 

The UN estimates that nearly a million people currently live in Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City and its surroundings in the north of the territory.
On Wednesday, the military’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avic­hay Adraee, said on X that Gaza City’s evacuation was “inevitable”.
 






UN seeks food points’ revival
The head of the UN’s World Food Programme, meanwhile, warned that Gaza was “at breaking point” and appealed for the urgent revival of its network of 200 food distribution points.
After a visit to the territory, the WFP’s executive director Cindy McCain said she saw first-hand that “desperation is soaring”.
The UN declared a famine in Gaza last week, blaming systematic obstruction by Israel of humanitarian aid deliveries.
Israel has severely restricted the aid allowed into Gaza. Distribution has been marred by chaotic scenes, with frequent reports of starving Palestinians being shot while waiting to collect aid at one of its four distribution sites. UN rights experts voiced alarm on Thursday at reports of “enforced disappearances” at aid sites.
Visa refusal
Meanwhile, the United States said on Friday it will refuse visas to members of the Palestinian Authority to attend next month’s UN General Assembly, where France is leading a push to recognise a Palestinian state.
“Secretary of State Marco Rubio is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the upcoming UN General Assembly,” the State Department said in a statement.

LAHORE: In an unprecedented flood crisis, the Punjab government has initiated controlled breaches of key flood bunds to divert surging waters from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, as all three major rivers overflowed simultaneously for the first time in the country’s history.
With 855,000 cusecs expected to reach Head Trimmu within 24 hours, authorities have evacuated over 429,000 residents, deploying explosives and breaching embankments to protect urban centres from catastrophic flooding.
Torrential monsoon rains ravaged both Pakistan and India this week, with further heavy downpours forecast for this weekend.
Bunds near Athara Hazari in Jhang district were breached to relieve pressure on Head Trimmu, situated downstream of the confluence of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.
To prevent inundation of Jhang city, the Rivaz Bridge flood bund was breached, and residents from adjacent villages were evacuated. Explosives were deployed near Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to divert water away from Head Muhammad Wala, where a surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is anticipated.
“There was no other way to drain the water,” Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed said, defending the drastic measures. “We are deploying all available resources and machinery to protect lives and infrastructure.”
Explosives were also deployed, with dynamite installed near the Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to strategically divert water from Head Muhammad Wala.
Data released by Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday revealed that flows were predominantly steady with a notable improvement at Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River, where the water level is now holding steady at 521.9 feet against the critical gauge of 526 feet.
However, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a flood warning for the Chenab River at Head Marala. As a precautionary measure, the NDMA sent out alerts via SMS to mobile phone users. The authority warned of a high flood risk at Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad headworks, urging residents in these areas to remain prepared for any emergency situation.
 






Water flow
On Friday, Marala and Khanki headworks were steady at 109,540 and 174,472 cusecs, respectively, while Qadirabad Headworks was at 175,272 cusecs and falling.
Chiniot Bridge remained at a very high but steady 855,000 cusecs, and Trimmu Headworks was steady at 128,215 cusecs.
Conditions on the Ravi River were mixed; Head Jassar was steady at 82,140 cusecs, and Ravi Syphon was falling at 160,515 cusecs. Shahdara was steady at 159,847 cusecs; however, Balloki Headworks continued to rise, reaching 180,520 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks remained steady at 29,278 cusecs.
The Sutlej River was showing incre­a­sed activity at its upstream point, with Ganda Singh Wala rising at 385,569 cus­ecs. Downstream, Sule­­manki Headworks was steady at 138,058 cusecs, and Islam Headworks was steady at 60,814 cusecs.

20 lives lost, millions affected
According to PDMA data, over 1.46 million people in 1,769 mouzas have been affected due to extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers, with a total of 20 lives lost.
The government has evacuated over 429,177 people, of whom 3,565 were living in 365 relief camps, and 300,174 cattle were transported to safety.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the Sutlej River is facing the worst flooding since 1955. He said that the catastrophic inflow of water is a result of a dam breach in India, and it is increasing the threat to Kasur.
 


In 1955, more than 2,000 people lost their lives and crops were devastated in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) due to heavy floods caused by monsoon rains. Those floods also impacted 15 million people in Sindh and parts of India.
“We have been compelled to deliberately breach the embankment to save Ka­­s­ur city from devastation due to unprecedented water flow,” Mr Kathia said.
He said the crisis is widespread and evolving rapidly. “The Sutlej is not the only concern; the Chenab and Ravi rivers are also overflowing, marking the first time in Pakistan’s history that three major rivers have flooded simultaneously,” he added.
The PDMA chief termed it a “historic flood situation”, particularly noting the severe impact at Qadirabad Headworks.
Communities living downstream were bracing for impact, and water is expected to reach Sidhnai Headworks within 36 hours, while Okara, Sahiwal and Pakpattan remain on high alert.
Around 40 to 45 villages were already inundated in Mandi Bahauddin before the water receded back into the river. He said that 28 people lost their lives so far, though timely rescue operations have mitigated further casualties.
He said that evacuations in vulnerable areas continued, including those near Trimmu, where water levels are rising steadily. “The area downstream of Trimmu may not withstand this pressure,” Mr Kathia warned, though he expressed hope that damage could be minimised.
A statement from the PDMA has said the ninth spell of monsoon rains began, as heavy rains were forecasted till Sept 2.
The rains were predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan and Rajanpur, the PDMA spokesperson said.
Arrangements in Multan
Earlier, National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) Chairman Shahryar Sultan and Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan visited the Head Muhammad Wala breaching section and Bund Bosan to review the flood management arrangements.
Mr Khan briefed about the current flood situation and the measures being taken to mitigate potential risks.
He said that a flood surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is expected in the Chenab River within the next two days. “The Head Muhammad Wala Road will be breached if Multan city faces any threat. The final decision will be made by the technical committee of the Irrigation Department.”
He said that over 119,715 people have so far been safely relocated across the division and a total of 84 relief camps have been set up. He said that uninterrupted provision of meals and medical care is being ensured in all relief camps, while arrangements have also been made for the supply of fodder and water for livestock. The assessment of losses will be carried out once the water recedes, and full compensation will be provided to the affected families, he added.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said the administration has set a target of relocating 300,000 residents to safer locations and assured that all riverine areas will be evacuated by Saturday night.

Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned a session of the National Assembly on Sept 1 (Monday) at 5pm in the Parliament House, according to a press release issued by the Presidency.
According to the Senate Secretariat, Mr Gilani and Mr Sadiq focused on strengthening institutional cooperation between the two houses of parliament and improving coordination on both national and international issues.
Talking to Dawn, PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Amir Dogar, expressed concerns that the government intends to introduce controversial constitutional amendments in the near future.
 







President summons NA session on Sept 1

During their meeting at the Senate’s chairman’s residence, Mr Gilani briefed Mr Sadiq on preparations for the upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference, scheduled for Nov 11-12. The event will bring together representatives from over 45 countries, marking one of the largest multilateral parliamentary gatherings ever hosted by Pakistan.
 
 

Mr Gilani said the conference would address key global challenges, including regional peace, sustainable development, climate change and the need for collective strategies to tackle emerging threats.
Mr Sadiq assured Mr Gilani of the National Assembly’s full support in ensuring the successful organisation of the conference, expressing confidence that the event would serve as a significant opportunity for Pakistan to showcase its commitment to global dialogue, cooperation, and peace-building.
Both leaders also discussed the prevailing political and economic situation in the country, with a particular focus on the devastating impact of recent rains and floods. They expressed concern over the exacerbating situation caused by India’s release of floodwaters into Punjab’s rivers, which has intensified both human and material losses in the affected areas.
In light of the natural calamity, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker appealed to the people of Pakistan to take precautionary measures and fully cooperate with the government and relevant authorities. They stressed the need for united national efforts to minimise casualties and reduce financial damages.

Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas delivered the judgment on three consolidated petitions filed by journalist Hamid Mir, the Judicial Activism Panel, and Sharif’s widow, Javeria Siddique.
The petitioners sought a federal government-initiated judicial commission for a “transparent inquiry” into the circumstances surrounding Sharif’s departure from Pakistan, his stay in Dubai, and his murder in Kenya in October 2022.
 
 

They argued that the current investigation by a Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT) was flawed and violated constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process.
Deputy attorney general, representing the state, countered, stating that the Supreme Court was actively supervising the case following its suo motu intervention.
He stressed that procedural actions have been completed, including FIR registration and submitting charges to the trial court, alongside securing a Mutual Legal Assistance agreement with Kenya to facilitate the investigation.
After a review, Justice Minhas recalled the apex court’s intervention, with a five-member bench initiating oversight in December 2022 to guarantee an independent and impartial investigation.
He highlighted that the creation of the SJIT was under the Supreme Court’s directive, with continuous oversight from the apex court.
“The matter concerning the tragic murder of the journalist Arshad Sharif is presently sub judice before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan,” Justice Minhas stated in the written order. “Consequently, this Court is restrained from issuing any directive … as doing so would encroach upon the apex Court’s jurisdiction.”
While dismissing the petitions, the court granted the petitioners partial relief. It ordered the federal government and the SJIT to keep the petitioners “duly informed regarding all developments in the ongoing investigation”.
The court also directed the state to provide the petitioners with copies of all reports and findings and to apprise them of future progress.
The ruling concluded that the petitioners were “not without remedy” and could bring their concerns directly to the Supreme Court.

Earlier this month, it was announced that Pakistan would be joining the Global Sumud Flotilla to break the Israeli siege of Gaza, according to a post on Instagram by the Pak-Palestine Forum, a platform aiming to advance support for the Palestinian cause.
According to its website, the flotilla is a “coordinated, nonviolent fleet of mostly small vessels sailing from ports across the Mediterranean to break the Israeli occupation’s illegal siege on Gaza”.
Reuters reports that dozens of boats carrying aid will depart Spain and Tunisia and set sail for the Gaza Strip. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and Portuguese left-wing politician Mariana Mortagua are among hundreds of people from 44 countries participating in the flotilla. Sumud means “perseverance” in Arabic.
Among the participants is a five-member delegation from Pakistan, led by former senator Khan.
 






In comments to Dawn.com, the former senator said that the flotilla — the largest civilian aid mission in history — will depart the Tunisian capital on September 4.
“We will be trained on the vessel and the journey from September 1 to 3 in Tunis,” the ex-senator said. “There will be over 100 ships from over 50 countries … this is the biggest humanitarian operation led by civilians,” he said.
“This flotilla is made up of vessels from four different coalitions. One of them, the Sumud Nasantra, includes delegations from the Philippines, Thailand, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan, which I am leading,” he added.
Other coalitions participating in the flotilla include the Maghreb Sumud Flotilla, Freedom Flotilla Coalition and Global Movement to Gaza.
“Europe’s Freedom Flotilla will depart from Barcelona, Spain, on September 1,” Khan said. “We are further away, so we will depart on September 4 and converge with the other vessels in the Mediterranean on September 5. We will then travel to Gaza via a sea route.”
The former senator emphasised that the flotilla is legal, nonviolent and peaceful.
“It is legal because we will be travelling from international waters, from which we will transition to Palestinian waters, so we are not coming into contact with Israel,” he explained. “We are only carrying food and water.
“We need to break the blockade, establish a humanitarian assistance corridor and stand up against the genocide,” Khan said. “These are our goals.”
Khan noted that he was the only member of the delegation to arrive in Tunis, as the remainder of the delegation are struggling to obtain visas.
“At the moment, I am alone; however, I am trying to help group members obtain visas. They are four men, none of whom are prominent political figures,” he explained.
In a Facebook post, the ex-senator said he had a meeting with the Pakistani ambassador in Tunisia, who him assured of full cooperation.
When asked about the difficulties or even consequences of embarking on this journey to Gaza, the former senator painted three scenarios.
“There are three options. One is that we reach Gaza successfully and are able to break the blockade and show the world what is taking place there,” Khan said. “Another possibility is that they (Israel) could arrest and deport us.”
The former senator could not rule out the possibility of death, recalling that in the past, Israel attacked and killed those who attempted to challenge their stranglehold on the besieged enclave.
“We are putting ourselves at risk so that the world turns its attention to Gaza and it is moved to stop the genocide going on,” he said.
This flotilla is the latest attempt by activists to break Tel Aviv’s blockage of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition’s previous attempts, the Handala and Madleen, ended in the detention and deportation of the volunteers on board.
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed over 63,000 people and injured 157,951, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The United Nations warned last week that with Israeli forces blocking aid, half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza, with famine conditions likely to spread further across the Strip.
Meanwhile, Israel has continued its bombardment after approving a plan to seize control of Gaza City, calling it the “last bastion of Hamas.”</p><small>2025-08-29 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/292114433107375.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938200/dar-confirms-pakistans-ambassador-in-kabul-received-a-demarche' target='_blank'><strong>Dar confirms Pakistan’s ambassador in Kabul received a demarche</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday confirmed that Afghanistan issued a demarche to Islamabad’s ambassador in Kabul, after they alleged that Pakistan carried out drone strikes across the border.
At least three people were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Khost provinces, which Afghan authorities claimed were strikes carried out by Pakistan. There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incidents.
Fielding questions after a press briefing in Islamabad today, Dar said that he had just returned from travelling and was still “going through the system”. However, he added that had received a copy of the letter to Pakistan’s ambassador but did not elaborate on why it was issued.
“I’m still going through the system, but they handed our ambassador a letter, which is called a demarche,” the foreign minister said. “This needs investigation, to look into the situation and why it is happening … right now, it’s too early to say anything.”
He did not respond to the question whether Pakistan was involved in the alleged strikes.
 






Replying to another question, Dar said that Islamabad had “only one ask” from Kabul, that being to either handle the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and not let its soil be used for terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
“We asked them ‘please take these people away from our borders or hand them over to us, whatever you choose’,” Dar said.
“Their development and stability is in our interest. Imagine what a massive mutual benefit there will be once the railroad gets off the ground,” he said, referring to the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway project.
“Once the railway system is complete, you will have connectivity with these Central Asian states, it’ll be a different ballgame.”
The foreign minister said he has no doubts regarding Kabul’s intentions and noted its intention to cooperate with Pakistan.
“During my bilateral meeting with [Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi], I said ‘this is a bilateral border and a very large one, please do what you can to control your side’. There is no resistance there.”
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
Earlier this month, Pakistan, China and Afghanistan committed themselves to bolstering joint efforts against the menace of terrorism and deepening their collaboration in key spheres.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism. They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan,” the Foreign Office (FO) had said regarding the meeting.
Before the meeting, Dar met Muttaqi on the sidelines and the two men are said to have noted the positive movement in political and economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They also reaffirmed their commitment to working closely on counter-terrorism and ensuring peace and stability in the region.

According to the board, the tickets are being sold starting from 40 dirhams (PKR 3,069.51) for the matches in Abu Dhabi and 50 (PKR 3,836.89) dirhams for the ones in Dubai.
 






“Tickets for the most sought-after India v Pakistan match will initially be available in a seven-match tickets package starting at 1,400 [dirhams] (PKR 10,743.28),” the ECB announced.
It said fans could buy separate (standalone) tickets for each of the remaining matches not included in the seven-match ticket package.
The board said that, in the coming days, tickets will also be made available at the ticket booths at both the Dubai International Stadium and Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi — the details of which will be announced in due course.
The Salman Ali Agha-led Pakistan are set to compete in the Asia Cup that runs from Sept 9 to 28 in the UAE. The Green-shirts are in Group ‘A’ alongside arch-rivals and defending champions India, Oman and the UAE while Group ‘B’ comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong. The matches will be staged in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
The eight-team tournament will kick off on Sept 9, with Afghanistan taking on Hong Kong at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi.
India’s sports ministry has declared that India and Pakistan would not have any bilateral sporting ties even on neutral venues as per an unprecedented new policy but the cricket team would not be stopped from playing the Asia Cup next month as it is a multi-lateral engagement.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board had asked sports federations in the country to seek approval before participating in sporting events held in India.
Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi has said that any talks on sporting ties with India would be held on equal footing and there would be no more pleading for negotiations.</p><small>2025-08-29 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291636576ec13f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938157/pakistan-agrees-to-consider-diplomatic-relations-with-armenia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan agrees to consider ‘diplomatic relations’ with Armenia</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that Pakistan has agreed to consider establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia.

Pakistan and Armenia do not have formal diplomatic relations so far.
The relationship is characterised by a regional geopolitical rivalry, with Pakistan supporting Azerbaijan against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as per the Press Information Department.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal.
“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a statement on X.
He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”</p><small>2025-08-29 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291522085f8e5b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938150/govt-forms-special-body-to-provide-legal-aid-to-missing-persons-families' target='_blank'><strong>Govt forms special body to provide legal aid to missing persons’ families</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Friday constituted a special committee to provide legal aid to address the issues of families of missing persons, a press release said.
The committee aims to provide legal aid to those families whose cases are being investiged by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIOED) in family law-related matters.
The commission was set up in 2011 to trace the missing persons and fix responsibility on the individuals or organisations responsible. In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted there.
“The families of missing persons having any such issue, especially relating to National Database and Registration Authority regarding issuance of  Computerised National Identity Card/Form-B for various purposes, may submit their grievances, in writing, to the Special Committee through any mode of communication, including email (coioed@gmail.com) or WhatsApp (0321-5101070), followed by submission of hard copies,” the press release read.
It added that the families could also visit and meet COIOED Islamabad Assistant Registrar Saadia Rashid at the Directorate General Civil Defence Building on any working day for submission and discussion on their issues.
On Saturday, Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah elaborated on the difficulties judges faced regarding cases of missing persons and enforced disappearances in the face of non-cooperation by the state and lawmakers.
The total number of cases received up by COIOED till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, according to the commission.
Last year, the government announced a Rs5 million “support package” per family of missing persons, which would provide them with legal and financial assistance as per the law minister.</p><small>2025-08-29 10:53</small></div><hr>
