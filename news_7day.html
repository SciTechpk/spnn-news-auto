Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he arrived earlier today on a day-long visit for the signing.
“I congratulate the people and governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan on the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Naibabad–Kharlachi rail link under the UAP Railway Corridor.
“I also thank the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for their support and commitment for timely signing of the agreement. We remained closely engaged throughout the negotiation process to finalise the details.”
 






He hailed the UAP Railway Corridor as a major milestone in advancing regional connectivity and economic integration that would connect Central Asian countries to Pakistani seaports through Afghanistan.
Dar said the signing of today’s agreement was a result of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership and commitment, who had tasked him as finance minister of the Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government to lead the effort with the countries.
“We collectively laid the foundation for this transformational project.”
In 2023, the three countries agreed on the UAP Railway project to build a rail link, which will pass through Termiz in Uzbekistan, Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan and enter Pakistan via the Kharlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project will facilitate regional, transit, and bilateral trade among­­st participating countries, while supporting both passenger and freight services.
Dar arrived in Kabul earlier today, accompanied by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, the special representative for Afghanistan, and the secretary of the Ministry of Railways.
 






Dar and Abbasi later met acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), both sides called for maintaining “the momentum in bilateral relations” and expanding cooperation in the trade, transit and security sectors.
“They agreed to remain engaged to achieve the full potential of regional economic development, including through [the] realisation of trans-regional connectivity projects,” the FO wrote on X.
 






Earlier in the day, the FO said the railway project aimed to build a rail link to connect Uzbekistan with Pakistan via Afghanistan and facilitate access to Pakistani seaports for Central Asian States.
“By facilitating regional trade and transit, the project is expected to promote regional stability, growth and development.”
It added that the agreement between the three participating countries will be an “important step towards its implementation”.
“During the visit, the deputy prime minister (Dar) will also hold a meeting with the Afghan acting foreign minister and will call on [the] acting prime minister of Afghanistan to discuss bilateral matters and exchange views on regional and international developments,” it said.
 






Earlier this month, Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement for the project.
In June, Pakistan and Uzbekistan decided to begin work on the trilateral railway transit corridor project, describing it as a milestone for regional economic growth and stronger trade ties.</p><small>2025-07-17 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17193116697786a.png?r=193453' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924815/pakistan-eu-agree-to-strengthen-cooperation-in-security-during-bilateral-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, EU agree to strengthen cooperation in security during bilateral dialogue</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the European Union (EU) on Thursday agreed on bolstering cooperation in security and counter-terrorism among other sectors during a bilateral dialogue, according to a press release issued by the Foreign Office (FO).
EU Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Riina Kionka in March had announced that European companies recognised Pakistan as a potential business destination and were exploring new avenues for economic partnership.
The EU is Pakistan’s sec­ond-largest trading partner, with the GSP+ status allowing the country to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
According to the press release, Pakistan and the EU held their 10th Political Dialogue in Brussels and discussed key regional and international issues, including multilateral cooperation. Both sides agreed to deepen dialogue and discussions on security during the event.
“The EU and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP) signed in 2019,” the FO stated. “Both sides aim to further deepen cooperation in all areas covered under the SEP.”
Additionally, both sides agreed to continue close engagement under the GSP+ framework. They also acknowledged meaningful cooperation on various aspects of migration, with the third Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Dialogue slated for later in 2025, the FO stated.
According to the FO, the EU and Pakistan acknowledged the importance of multifaceted cooperation on security matters, including counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics.
“They condemned all forms of terrorism,” the press release read. “Both sides agreed on the need for efforts based on dialogue and diplomacy in order to solve contentious issues and underscored the importance of upholding international law and the sanctity of international agreements [and] treaties.”
The FO stated that both sides also exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and Indian-occupied Kashmir and stressed the need to pursue peaceful solutions to conflicts, in respect of the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
“They agreed on the urgent need to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the statement read. “Both sides called for the resumption of a ceasefire and expressed support for initiatives that contribute to a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Palestine, in accordance with the two-state solution.”
Pakistan and the EU reaffirmed their aspiration to convene the 7th Strategic Dialogue in 2025 to strengthen Pakistan-EU cooperation. According to the FO, they agreed to hold the next Political Dialogue meeting in Islamabad next year.
Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch led Pakistan’s delegation, while the EU delegation was headed by Olof Skoog, Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service.
The EU is not the only Western power with whom Pakistan has experienced improved relations.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when US President Donald Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
Additionally, United States Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla last month praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).</p><small>2025-07-17 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17190505fdf7de8.png?r=190524' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924812/uk-to-lower-voting-age-to-16-in-general-elections' target='_blank'><strong>UK to lower voting age to 16 in general elections</strong></a><br><p>The British government said on Thursday that it would allow 16-year-olds to vote in general elections, a landmark change giving the United Kingdom one of the lowest voting ages worldwide.
The ruling Labour Party pledged to lower the age from 18 ahead of winning power last year. It is among several planned changes to the democratic system.
Some argue Britain’s democracy is “in crisis”, in particular due to low turnout.
The voting age change is contentious, however, with critics previously arguing it is self-serving as newly-enfranchised teenagers are seen as more likely to support centre-left Labour.
“I think it’s really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote, because they are old enough to go out to work, they are old enough to pay taxes, so [they] pay in,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
“And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go,” Starmer added.
The government will have to bring legislation before parliament, where it has a comfortable majority, to make the changes.
Only a small number of countries allow 16-year-olds to vote in national elections, according to online databases.
They include Austria — the first EU country to lower the voting age to 16 in 2007 — as well as Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Cuba.
’Democracy in crisis ’
Labour ministers insist the change is intended to “modernise our democracy”, while aligning general elections with the existing voting age for elections for the devolved regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales.
Other planned changes include introducing automated voter registration — which is already used in Australia and Canada — and making UK-issued bank cards an accepted form of ID at polling stations.
It follows changes to the electoral law introduced by the previous Conservative government, which required voters to show a photo ID. The Electoral Commission found that the rule led to around 750,000 people not voting in last year’s election.
Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, called the changes “the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969”, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
He noted that lowering the voting age and introducing automated voter registration could add 9.5 million more people to the voter rolls.
“Our democracy is in crisis, and we risk reaching a tipping point where politics loses its legitimacy,” he added, backing the changes.
The main Conservative opposition, however, accused Labour of inconsistency as 16 and 17-year-olds will still not be able to stand as election candidates, buy lottery tickets or alcohol, or get married.
“This is a brazen attempt by the Labour Party whose unpopularity is scaring them into making major constitutional changes without consultation,” the party’s communities spokesman Paul Holmes said.</p><small>2025-07-17 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17182448fdaa0b3.jpg?r=182452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924805/fo-says-no-information-on-trumps-reported-visit-to-pakistan-in-september' target='_blank'><strong>FO says ‘no information’ on Trump’s reported visit to Pakistan in September</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Thursday said he had “no information” regarding widespread reports of United States President Donald Trump’s visit to Pakistan in September.
Earlier in the day, some local television news channels reported, citing sources, that Trump is expected to visit Pakistan in September. The news channels said that Trump would also visit India after arriving in Islamabad in September.
 
 

Talking to Dawn.com on the reported visit, the FO spokesperson said: “We have no information about this matter.”
Similarly, a US embassy spokesperson in Islamabad told Reuters, “We have nothing to announce,” and said that the White House might be able to provide confirmation on the president’s schedule.
If confirmed, the visit would be the first by a US president since nearly two decades ago, when then-president George W Bush visited Pakistan in 2006.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
India is due to host the summit of the so-called Quad countries this year, but dates for the meeting have not been announced yet.
The Quad grouping includes the US, India, Australia and Japan and is focused on countering China’s rise in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that would last throughout the country till today. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours.
“Sixty-three citizens have died while 290 were injured due to monsoon rains [across the province] in the past 24 hours,” read a statement by the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson.
“At least 15 were reported dead in Lahore, nine in Faisalabad, five in Sahiwal, three in Pakpattan and nine in Okara,” the PDMA statement detailed, adding that the families of the deceased will receive compensation from the government.
An order from the Punjab Home Department said there was a significant increase in the accumulation of rainwater in low-lying areas, streets and open spaces, posing serious risks to the safety of children who often bathed in standing water.
“Dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries across the province of Punjab experience heightened water levels and stronger currents during these periods, making swimming and unauthorised boating activities extremely hazardous for human life, leading to a high potential for drowning and other tragic incidents.
“Prevailing weather conditions and the inherent dangers associated with these activities, necessitates immediate preventive measures to safeguard public safety and prevent loss of precious human lives,” the order said.
It added that the home secretary was thus imposing a complete ban under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure across the province on bathing in accumulated rainwater on streets, roads, open spaces, or any other area where rainwater has collected; swimming in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries, and boating by any unauthorised person or for unauthorised purposes in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries.
“This order shall remain in force for a period of 45 days from the date of issuance unless withdrawn.”
 






Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also announced that “a rain emergency has been imposed in different areas of Punjab due to unprecedented torrential rains and a flood situation.”
She added that directives were issued to keep the public alert through sirens and announcements. The chief minister urged the public to cooperate with the local authorities and take safety precautions.
 






In Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Biddar, Dhok Shah Arif, Sohawa, Rasoolpur, Chak Muhammad and Bhampar villages, according to Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.
Around 57 people have been rescued so far with the help of the Pakistan Army, he said in a statement, with more than 50 rescue boats involved in the Jhelum operations.
The spokesperson added that rescue teams have been deployed across the province, including Mianwali, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Layyah. Over 15,000 rescue personnel and 800 rescue boats were on high alert, Ahmad added.
“Pakistan Army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he said.
“Children were screaming for help, and women stood on rooftops, waving their shawls and begging to be rescued,” Tariq Mehbood Bhatti, a 51-year-old farmer in Gujrat’s Ladian village, was quoted as saying by AFP.
 






Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas”, leading to a flood situation.
“Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,” the Wasa DG said in a statement.
The PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) warned that urban flooding was expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad divisions during the next 24 hours.
However, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.
In a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a “significant surge” in water levels at the Tarbela, Mangla, Khanpur, Simly and Rawal reservoirs.
The water level at Khanpur witnessed a gain of 4.5 feet, while the other four recorded an increase of a foot each.
 






In a weather outlook, the FFD said the water flows in the eastern rivers were likely to increase from July 21.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 178 people across the country and injured 491 people.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 38 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death in Azad Kashmir.
Over 57 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by “house-collapse” incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 610 houses and led to the deaths of 126 livestock.

Flood alert issued for Rawalpindi
Earlier today, the PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian stations in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah rose.
At 10:50am, the Gawalmandi and Kattarian gauges had crossed the 20ft level, at which evacuation is supposed to be ordered. However, the water levels soon started to recede, reaching 7ft at Gawalmandi and 8ft at Kattarian at 4:21pm, according to the PMD’s real-time monitor.

Following the flood alert in the morning, the PDMA imposed a rain emergency in Rawalpindi, with Director General Irfan Ali Kathia noting that a local holiday has been announced in the district.
DG Kathia urged residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah to “cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary”. In a statement, he warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah.
 


In a separate statement, the PDMA also detailed the equipment provided to the Rawalpindi administration for its relief efforts. This included 16 outboard motor boats, 205 life jackets, 31 ambulances, 19 fire brigade vehicles and four rescue vehicles.
The PDMA provided 28 de-watering sets, five suction pumps, six tractors and as many jetting machines to Wasa.
Another five de-watering sets, seven mini trucks and three jetting machines were given to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), the statement added.
The Pakistan Army rescued a family stranded in the flood on Rawalpindi’s Chakri Road using a helicopter, Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Chakwal records 400mm of rain in 10 hours
Punjab’s Chakwal district was among the heaviest hit by the recent rains as it recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from the PDMA said.
“Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded,” the PDMA said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday.
However, a rainfall record issued by it at 8am stated 142mm of rainfall in the previous 24 hours.
Footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed water gushing across vast swathes of land, with floodwater entering various buildings, including a Rescue 1122 office.
 


In a statement, the PDMA said water levels had begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts were underway to rescue trapped citizens.
DG Kathia spoke on the phone with Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat, who briefed the former on the relief efforts.
She said the relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and other civil personnel, were present on the ground to take part in the rescue operation.
Relief arrangements had been made in hospitals and public buildings, Hayat said.
DG Kathia assured Hayat of providing all possible resources and assistance, according to the PDMA statement. He added that the district administration was in contact with the army as well for additional support.
“The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”
District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, were on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources” were also on standby.
NDMA forecasts more heavy rainfall across country
The NDMA has forecasted more heavy rains over the next 24 hours, Radio Pakistan reported.
“Various districts in Punjab — including Lahore, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Khushab, Sargodha, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Hafizabad — are likely to experience thunderstorms and heavy rain in the next 12 hours,” the report read.

Amid heavy rains and flooding in Punjab, authorities in the federal capital were also directed to remain on high alert by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa.
“Field teams should provide all possible assistance to citizens in case of an emergency,” Randhawa, also the Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman, said.
The chief commissioner directed that strict monitoring of all highways, drains and waterways of Islamabad should be ensured.
In case of any emergency, citizens were advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.
Child dead, 11 injured in Mandi Bahauddin
Separately, heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, rescue officials said. According to the PMD, Mandi Bahauddin recorded 167mm of rainfall in 24 hours up till 8am.
Shah Hussain, aged 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — eight-year-old Qasim and six-year-old Huzaifa — were injured due to electrocution during the rain.
Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations in Mandi Bahauddin. College Chowk, Pindi Purani, Jail Chowk and several other areas remained submerged under 2-4ft of water.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17121423c29bc20.jpg?r=121727' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924775/psx-reaches-new-peak-of-138000-with-2200-point-rally' target='_blank'><strong>PSX reaches new peak of 138,000 with 2,200-point rally</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its renewed bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000-point barrier.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points. The index closed at 138,665.49 points, up by 2,285.53 points or 1.68pc.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said: “Investor optimism over a potential rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy, expected later this month, has strengthened following a decline in yields during yesterday’s PIBs (Pakistan Investment Bond) auction.
“A stable external account and easing inflation further support the case for bringing interest rates down into single digits,” he told Dawn.com.
The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a high-level committee to address the business community’s concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.
 
 

The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the July 19 strike call by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the powers to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the federal budget.
Investor confidence was also reinforced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent briefing to Moody’s on Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook and financial stability, bolstering optimism for a potential ratings upgrade in the credit rating agency’s upcoming review.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17120352f3e41f8.jpg?r=120358' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists killed during joint operation in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday night, police said.
The spokesperson for the Bannu police, Khanzala Quraishi, told Dawn.com, “The three terrorists, belonging to the Zarar group, had been eliminated in an intelligence-based joint operation conducted in the Bannu city outskirts at midnight.”
He said that the “terrorists were wanted for attacks on security forces and the target killing of police personnel”.
According to the spokesperson, the terrorists were identified and all of them were residents of Bannu.
“Three Kalashnikovs, magazines, pistols and handmade improvised explosive devices were recovered from their possession,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the last few months.
Yesterday, two policemen were gunned down in a terrorist attack in Kulachi area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.
In early July, at least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured in an explosion targeting a government vehicle in Bajaur.
Terrorist killed by police during DI Khan search operation
Meanwhile, a terrorist was killed and six others were injured during a search operation in Dera Ismail Khan area against assailants who attacked police personnel, according to the District Police Officer (DPO).
A statement issued by DI Khan DPO Sajjad Khan said that a search and strike operation was conducted in the Kulachi area under his supervision. It added that an exchange of fire took place between terrorists and police, leaving one terrorist dead and six others injured.
“The process of identifying the dead terrorist is underway,” the statement read. “A Kalashnikov with a magazine and ammunition was recovered from his possession.”
Separately, six people were killed as a result of a clash between two parties over personal enmity in the Panyala area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan early on Thursday morning.
According to the DI Khan police spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, “the two parties were close relatives, and the clash took place due to a long-standing family dispute.”
The bodies and the injured parties were transported to Panyala Hospital. The police have cordoned off the area and started an investigation, but no arrests have been made yet, he added.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17165640e99029e.jpg?r=172322' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924802/air-india-crash-probe-focuses-on-actions-of-planes-captain-report' target='_blank'><strong>Air India crash probe focuses on actions of plane’s captain: report</strong></a><br><p>A cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the Air India flight that crashed last month indicates the captain cut the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
The newspaper cited people familiar with US officials’ early assessment of evidence uncovered in the investigation into the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner in Ahmedabad, India, that killed 260 people.
A preliminary report into the crash released by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday said one pilot was then heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel and “the other pilot responded that he did not do so”.
Investigators did not identify which remarks were made by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and which by First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3,403 hours, respectively.
Kunder, who was flying the plane, asked Sabharwal why he moved the fuel switches to the “cutoff” position seconds after lifting off the runway, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The Journal did not say if there was any evidence that Sabharwal did move the switches, beyond the verbal exchange it cited. But it quoted US pilots who have read the Indian authorities’ report as saying that Kunder, the pilot actively flying, likely would have had his hands full pulling back on the Dreamliner’s controls at that stage of the flight.
India’s AAIB, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Air India and two unions representing Indian pilots did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the Wall Street Journal report. Boeing declined to comment.
The AAIB’s preliminary report said the fuel switches had switched from run to cutoff a second apart just after takeoff, but it did not say how they were flipped.
Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.
The London-bound plane began to lose thrust, and after reaching a height of 650 feet, the jet started to sink.
The fuel switches for both engines were turned back to run, and the airplane automatically tried restarting the engines, the report said.
But the plane was too low and too slow to be able to recover, aviation safety expert John Nance told Reuters.
The plane clipped some trees and a chimney before crashing in a fireball into a building on a nearby medical college campus, the report said, killing 19 people on the ground and 241 of the 242 on board the 787.
No safety recommendations
In an internal memo on Monday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.
The AAIB’s preliminary report had no safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturer GE.
After the report was released, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The circumstantial evidence increasingly indicates that a crew member flipped the engine fuel switches, Nance said, given there was “no other rational explanation” that was consistent with the information released to date.
Nonetheless, investigators “still have to dig into all the factors” and rule out other possible contributing factors, which would take time, he said.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
The Air India crash has rekindled debate over adding flight deck cameras, known as cockpit image recorders, on airliners.
Nance said investigators likely would have benefited greatly from having video footage of the cockpit during the Air India flight.
Air India has faced additional scrutiny on other fronts after the crash.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said this month it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, after Reuters reported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17135538a30c222.jpg?r=135616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924763/fire-at-mall-in-iraq-leaves-at-least-69-dead-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at mall in Iraq leaves at least 69 dead, officials say</strong></a><br><p>A massive fire in a hypermarket in al-Kut city in eastern Iraq has left at least 69 people dead and 11 others missing, the city’s health authorities and two police sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Reuters’ footage of the aftermath of the overnight fire showed the blackened exterior of “Corniche Hypermarket” building, with rescue teams and security forces still at the site.
Videos verified by Reuters showed firefighters spraying water on the blazing building overnight and people climbing from the roof with the help of rescue teams.

“We have more bodies that have not been recovered still under fire debris,” city official Ali al-Mayahi told Reuters.
Officials said many people suffocated in bathrooms, while one person told AFP that his five relatives died in an elevator.
Several people told AFP they lost family members, including mothers and children who had gone to shop and dine at the mall.
The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but the province’s governor said initial results from an investigation would be announced within 48 hours, the INA state news agency reported. One survivor told AFP an air conditioner had exploded.
“We have filed lawsuits against the owner of the building and the mall,” INA quoted the governor as saying.
He told the news agency the victims included men, women and children.
A medical source in Kut told AFP there were “many unidentified bodies”.
An AFP correspondent reported seeing charred bodies at the province’s forensic department.
Civil defence teams rescued more than 45 people who were trapped inside the building, which includes a restaurant and a supermarket, the interior ministry said.
Ambulances ferried casualties as late as 4am, with wards in Kut overwhelmed.
An AFP correspondent reported seeing distraught relatives waiting at the forensic department for news, some collapsing in grief.
One man fell apart, pounding his chest and screaming.
Nasir al-Quraishi, a doctor in his 50s, said he lost five family members in the fire.
“A disaster has befallen us,” he told AFP.
“We went to the mall to have some food, eat dinner and escape power cuts at home.
“An air conditioner exploded on the second floor and then the fire erupted — and we couldn’t escape.”
Lax safety regulations
Moataz Karim, 45, hurried to the mall at midnight, only to be met with the devastating news that three of his relatives were missing.
Hours later, he identified two relatives despite their charred bodies, one of whom had only begun working at the shopping centre three days ago.
“There is no fire extinguishing system,” he said in anger, as he waited for further news outside the forensic department.
Safety standards in Iraq’s construction sector are often disregarded, and the country, whose infrastructure is in disrepair after decades of conflict, is often the scene of fatal fires and accidents.
Fires increase during the blistering summer as temperatures approach 50 degrees Celsius.
In September 2023, a fire killed at least 100 people when it ripped through a crowded Iraqi wedding hall, sparking a panicked stampede for the exits.
In July 2021, a fire in the Covid-19 unit of a hospital in southern Iraq killed more than 60 people.
The governor declared three days of mourning in Wasit province.
“The tragedy is a major shock … and requires a serious review of all safety measures,” he said.
Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ordered a “thorough probe” into the fire to identify “shortcomings” and prevent further incidents.

Thousands of Afghans who worked with the United Kingdom were brought to Britain with their families in a secret programme after a 2022 data breach put their lives at risk, the UK government revealed on Tuesday.
The scheme was only revealed after the UK High Court lifted a super-gag order banning any reports of the events.
UK Defence Minister John Healey said the leak was not revealed because of the risk that the Taliban authorities would obtain the data set and the lives of Afghans would be put at risk.
“Nobody has been arrested for their past actions, nobody has been killed and nobody is being monitored for that,” the Afghan government’s deputy spokesman, Hamdullah Fitrat, told reporters on Thursday. “Reports of investigation and monitoring of a few people whose data has been leaked are false.”
After the Taliban swept back to power in 2021, their Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada announced an amnesty for Afghans who worked for Nato forces or the ousted foreign-backed government during the two-decade conflict.
“All their information and documents are present here in the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the intelligence [agency] ,” Fitrat added. “We don’t need to use the leaked documents from Britain.”
He said “rumours” were being spread to create fear among Afghans and their families.
 
 

Around 900 Afghans and 3,600 family members have now been brought to Britain or are in transit under the programme known as the Afghan Response Route, at a cost of around £400 million ($535m), Healey said.
They are among some 36,000 Afghans who Britain has accepted under different schemes since the August 2021 fall of Kabul.
Tens of thousands of Afghans fled Afghanistan in a chaotic weeks-long evacuation when the Taliban won their insurgency, after the mass withdrawal of international troops and air support to the country.
Tens of thousands more have been resettled under European and US asylum schemes, which, after four years, have now slowed to almost a halt.
The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in 2023 that there were credible reports of serious human rights violations by the Taliban authorities against hundreds of former government officials and former armed forces members.
 
 

From the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan on 15 August 2021 to 30 June 2023, UNAMA documented at least 800 instances of extrajudicial killing, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and ill-treatment and enforced disappearance, it said in a report.
The Taliban’s Foreign Affairs Ministry denied the allegations and said all former employees had been pardoned.

The incident occurred almost two weeks after a five-storey building collapsed earlier this month in Lyari’s Lea Market, killing 27 people. This incident raised serious concerns about building safety, prompting authorities to evacuate other dilapidated buildings in the city.
Regarding the incident today, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com, “Two women have died in the accident, while more than two others are reported to have been injured.”
Providing details of the incident, he said: “The building was dilapidated. Some labourers were working on the roof of the sixth floor when it collapsed.”
He added that the rescue operation has been completed.
Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) South, Asad Raza, confirmed that the two people were killed and three others were injured in the incident.
“The top floor of the six-storey building — named Ghani Mansion, situated next to Bilal Masjid Peshawari Hotel — collapsed on the lower fifth floor,” he told Dawn.com.
He said three injured people and the bodies of the deceased, including two women, were taken to Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.
“The deceased women were sisters. Their daughters are among the injured and are being given medical assistance,” he said.
After the collapse of the Lyari building earlier this month, Sindh Local Government minister Saeed Ghani had addressed an emergency press conference, revealing that 588 buildings across the city had been declared hazardous — 456 of them located in District South, including 107 in Lyari alone.
The Sindh government had suspended the director-general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) for approving the building’s construction. The provincial government has formed a committee on hazardous and dilapidated buildings to ensure transparency.
A day earlier, it was revealed that as many as 44 dilapidated buildings, including 10 declared protected heritage in the city’s South district, have been vacated for demolition in the aftermath of the Lyari building tragedy.
A meeting, chaired by Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi, was told that so far, 44 dilapidated buildings had been vacated in the South and East districts for the safety of the residents.
In total, out of 588 buildings declared dilapidated by the SBCA, 68 buildings have been declared “highly dilapidated” by the city administration and will be vacated and demolished in the first phase.</p><small>2025-07-17 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/171337362f407e8.jpg?r=133920' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924784/syrias-sharaa-vows-to-protect-druze-rights-as-ceasefire-holds' target='_blank'><strong>Syria’s Sharaa vows to protect Druze rights as ceasefire holds</strong></a><br><p>Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa promised to protect the rights of Druze citizens on Thursday as a ceasefire appeared to be holding in the country’s south following US intervention to end fighting between government forces and Druze fighters.
Overnight, the government’s troops withdrew from the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, where scores of people have been killed in days of conflict pitting local fighters against the Damascus authorities and Bedouin tribes.
The violence in Syria escalated sharply on Wednesday as Israel launched airstrikes in Damascus while pressing attacks on government forces in the south, demanding they withdraw and saying Israel aimed to protect Syria’s Druze minority.
 
 

Describing Syria’s new rulers as “barely disguised jihadists”, Israel has bombed repeatedly this year, saying it will not allow Syrian government forces to deploy into areas near its frontier.
Facing calls from Israel’s own Druze minority to shield Syria’s Druze, Israel has also seized ground in the south.
In a speech to the Syrian nation on Thursday, Sharaa said Israel had “consistently targeted our stability and created discord among us since the fall of the former regime”, accusing it of seeking to “dismantle the unity of our people”.
Reuters footage showed Syrian forces moving out of Sweida overnight. The situation in Sweida was calm on Thursday morning, according to two people in contact with residents there.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late on Wednesday that the United States had engaged all the parties involved.
“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight,” he said on social media.
 






The violence has underlined the challenges that Sharaa faces in stabilising Syria and exerting centralised rule over the country, despite his warming ties with the United States and his administration’s evolving security contacts with Israel.
In his first televised statement after the outbreak of violence, Sharaa said protecting Druze citizens and their rights was “our priority” and rejected any attempt to drag Druze citizens into the hands of an “external party”.
“We have spent our lives facing challenges and defending our people, but we have put the interests of the Syrians before chaos and destruction,” he said.
Israeli strikes
Israel’s airstrikes on Wednesday blew up part of Syria’s defence ministry and hit near the presidential palace as it vowed to destroy government forces attacking Druze in southern Syria
“We will not allow southern Syria to become a terror stronghold,” said Eyal Zamir, Israel’s military chief of staff.
The United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday to address the conflict, diplomats said.
“The council must condemn the barbaric crimes committed against innocent civilians on Syrian soil,” said Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely against any terrorist threat on its borders, anywhere and at any time.”
The Syrian Network for Human Rights said 193 people had been killed in this week’s violence, including six women and six children.
Sharaa faces challenges to stitch Syria back together in the face of deep misgivings from groups that fear “Islamist rule”. In March, mass killings of members of the Alawite minority exacerbated the mistrust.
 
 

Druze, followers of a religion that is an offshoot of Islam, are spread between Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
Scores of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence on Wednesday, linking up with Druze on the Syrian side.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border.
The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed.</p><small>2025-07-17 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1711453083c9d20.jpg?r=114643' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924755/paf-to-showcase-advanced-jf-17-thunder-jets-at-uk-airshow' target='_blank'><strong>PAF to showcase advanced JF-17 Thunder jets at UK airshow</strong></a><br><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) featuring the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets arrived in the United Kingdom to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, a statement from the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
RIAT, which will run from July 18 to 20, is one of the world’s largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its website.
A PAF contingent comprising “state-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, has landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford, United Kingdom, to participate in the prestigious” RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.

“PAF’s participation in RIAT, one of the world’s largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force’s commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,” the ISPR highlighted.
Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.
“The intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF’s long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.
“JF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,” the statement added.
In May, when Pakistan downed 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the Pakistan-India conflict, the PAF formally acknowledged a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.
The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.
“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.
“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p><small>2025-07-17 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17084501fd09fba.jpg?r=084522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924724/us-firms-eye-investment-in-pakistans-port-sector' target='_blank'><strong>US firms eye investment in Pakistan’s port sector</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: Over 65 US companies joined a landmark webinar on Wednesday to explore commercial opportunities at Karachi Port and Port Qasim.
The webinar hosted by the US Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration and the US Department of State, in collaboration with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, part of the ‘Gateways to Growth: South Asia Port Opportunities’ series, has opened new doors for American commercial services in the port sector of Pakistan.
The webinar served as a strategic platform for American companies to engage directly with Pakistani port officials and private operators.
 






“US investors have made substantial contributions to Pakistan’s development, and we are confident that the port sector will be another area where we can achieve great success together,” said US Consul General Scott Urbom in Karachi, emphasising the role of partnership in fostering long-term commercial ties.
“We believe that by working together, we can unlock the full potential of Pakistan’s port sector, create new opportunities for American businesses, and contribute to Pakistan’s economic development,” he said.
Senior representatives from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Port Qasim Authority, Abu Dhabi Ports, which operates Karachi Gateway Terminal Ltd, and Dubai Ports World, which operates Qasim International Container Terminal, outlined Pakistan’s infrastructure goals, regulatory landscape, and trade priorities, and participated in the webinar.
 
 

The hybrid session highlighted how American firms can support Pakistan’s port development plans, helping expedite trade flows and build new supply chain linkages between our countries.
Ean Hundley, Director of ICT and Infrastructure Policy at the US International Development Finance Corporation, noted, “This initiative equips US companies with market intelligence and direct access to local decision-makers, enabling them to capitalise on infrastructure opportunities across South Asia.”

The seminar, hosted by the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) on Tuesday, was attended by leaders and workers from various political parties.
Speaking at the event, participants voiced grave concern over the worsening law and order situation in Balochistan, alleged genocide of the Baloch people, the arrest of female leaders and activists, enforced disappearances, human rights violations and the controversial adoption of the Balochistan Mines and Mineral Act.
BNP-M President Sardar Akhtar Mengal presided over the hours-long seminar.
 







Political leaders slam human rights violations, call for end to military operations

The speakers criticised the military operations, enforced disappearances and the discovery of mutilated bodies in the province. They denounced the inclusion of political activists in the Fourth Schedule (a terror watch list) and condemned the violation of the sanctity of homes during nighttime raids.
The speakers also denounced the systematic political killings and the installation of “puppet leadership” in both Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The declaration made during the seminar referred to the suppression of national movements through force as a modern form of colonialism that threatens the federation’s integrity.
The seminar also pointed to the denial of democratic space and the promotion of artificial leadership as a strategy to facilitate the exploitation of the region’s natural resources. The amendments to the Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act were described as legislative tools designed to enable the exploitation of Balochistan’s vast mineral wealth.
Political victimisation of Sardar Akhtar Mengal and his family was described as part of a campaign to silence dissent.
The seminar also drew parallels with the deteriorating security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former Fata regions, which they said was also rooted in the desire to control local mineral resources under the guise of counterinsurgency.

In a statement, Kuts expressed concern over the attack on Prof Afaq Ahmad Siddiqui of the faculty of pharmacy and called for an impartial investigation into the matter.
“It is deeply troubling that a respected academic, who has dedicated his life to education and research, was subjected to such behaviour,” it said.
The teachers’ body demanded an appropriate action against those responsible and urged the Rangers’ top leadership to take a serious notice of the incident and play its role in maintaining a peaceful and respectful environment on the campus.

Kuts demands Rangers leadership to take notice of attack on Prof Afaq Siddiqui

“The teachers of the University of Karachi have always respected state institutions and we expect this respect to be mutual so that a relationship of trust and cooperation between institutions and men of knowledge is established,” the statement concluded. 
The incident came to light when Prof Siddiqui narrated his ordeal to the Kuts leadership and university administration via a WhatsApp voice message on Tuesday night.
Prof Siddiqui, who lives in KU Staff Town for the past many years, said his next-door neighbour was a senior Rangers official. He said that for the past some time, garbage was being burnt regularly outside his residence as a means to “repel mosquitoes affecting goats kept on the premises”.
He added that on the evening of July 15, he returned home after Maghrib prayers and saw burning garbage. He approached a guard posted at the residence and requested him not to burn the garbage and cited health concerns due to the smoke.
However, a verbal exchange ensued, during which the guard misbehaved with him and then slapped him on the face, damaging his spectacles and causing an injury to his eye, the professor said, adding that other residents gathered and he was taken to the university clinic, where a doctor examined his eye. 
When contacted, Prof Siddiqui confirmed the incident. However, he was reluctant to share more details.
The KU campus security adviser and a spokesperson for the Sindh Rangers did not respond when Dawn reached out to them for their version.
However, a KU official told Dawn that Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Mahmood Iraqi met Prof Siddiqui and following that, the university administration held a meeting with senior officials of Rangers, asking them for an immediate and strict action against those involved.

The case is one of a number lined up against Imamoglu, the main rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is already being held over an investigation into alleged corruption.
His arrest in March as part of that case triggered Turkiye’s worst street protests in more than a decade. Wednesday’s hearing was held at Silivri court and prison complex on the western outskirts of Istanbul, where Imamoglu has been held since his arrest.
The court handed him a jail term of one year, five months and 15 days for having insulted a civil servant and two months and 15 days for threats, the court document showed.
Imamoglu, who appeared in court, has denied all the allegations, arguing that he was being targeted because of his plans to challenge Erdogan in the 2028 presidential elections. The prosecutor had initially called for Imamoglu to face up to seven years and four months behind bars, and to be banned from holding political office.
On Wednesday, that ban — which is handed down when the suspect gets a minimum two-year jail term — was not applied. Imamoglu was elected Istanbul mayor in 2019 and re-elected in 2024. He was arrested on March 19 in connection with a graft probe and allegations of terror ties.
The string of charges against him could prevent him taking part in the next presidential race. His arrest sparked demonstrations across the country in the worst street unrest since the 2013 Gezi Park protests, which spread across Turkiye and were brutally suppressed by police.

After days of struggling to brush off what he now claims is a Democratic hoax, Trump took his most combative tone yet to try and shut down the issue.
“It’s all been a big hoax, it’s perpetrated by the Democrats. And some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net and so they try and do the Democrats’ work,” Trump told reporters when asked about Epstein.
But Trump is facing the most serious split in his loyal right-wing base since he returned to power, over claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of disgraced financier Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for abuse by the rich and powerful.
The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched on to the scandal, claiming the existence of a secret list of Epstein’s powerful clients and that the late financier was in fact murdered in his cell.
Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office this January but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.

A meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, presided over by Syed Naveed Qamar, expressed concern over tax exemptions on the import of sugar.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial informed the committee that sugar imports were subject to a total of 54 per cent tax, resulting in higher retail prices of the commodity. He said the FBR had granted tax exemptions on sugar imports after receiving the federal cabinet’s decision in this regard.
Mr Qamar observed that the government should disengage from sugar-related matters and allow the private sector to handle its import and export. He said that while the prices of other commodities fluctuate based on supply and demand, increases in sugar prices consistently trigger public outcry. He added that it was surprising the government had deregulated wheat operations yet continued to focus on sugar prices, despite sufficient sugar stocks being available in the country.
 
 


Food ministry says retail price to be capped at Rs175 per kilogram

Committee member Javed Hanif inquired about the IMF’s stance on the tax exemption for sugar imports. He criticised the government for attributing every budgetary measure to IMF requirements, noting that taxes had been imposed even on poultry chicks and mutual funds, while sugar had been granted an exemption.
The finance secretary told the committee that discussions with the IMF were still ongoing on the issue.
The committee also considered “The Parliamentary Budget Office Bill, 2025”, moved by MNA Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, and constituted a subcommittee under the convenorship of MNA Nafisa Shah for detailed deliberation and submission of a report within 30 days. MNAs Ali Zahid, Arshad Abdullah Vohra and Muhammad Mobeen Arif will serve as members of the subcommittee.
The standing committee expressed serious concern over the absence of the industries and production secretary, who was scheduled to give a detailed briefing on the new electric vehicle (EV) policy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani regretted the absence and agreed with the committee’s decision to defer the agenda item related to the EV policy.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig presented the report of the subcommittee on “The Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2025”, moved by Nafisa Shah. The committee adopted the report but deferred discussion on it to the next meeting.
The Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) opposed the bill and requested additional time to consult all stakeholders. However, Nafisa Shah, Ikhtiar Baig and Javed Hanif opposed granting further time to the government on the matter.
Mr Kayani said it would be premature for him to state whether the draft bill would be supported or opposed, but emphasised that broader consultation with stakeholders was necessary before any informed discussion could take place in the committee.
The committee chairman allowed the government one month to complete its consultations.
Sugar price at Rs175 a kg
Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Wednesday said that the retail price of sugar in the market will not exceed Rs173 to Rs175 in the wake of the ex-mill price of sugar fixed at Rs165 per kg.
A formal notification, fixing the retail price, is being finalised and will be issued after approval from the federal cabinet, the ministry says. Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain emphasised that all provincial governments will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the approved retail price of sugar, providing relief to consumers and maintaining price stability across the country.

The KCCI has installed hoardings and billboards across major arteries of Karachi announcing the complete strike, with slogans demanding respect for taxpayers “instead of handcuffs”.
Despite the formation of a high-level committee by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to hold consultations with traders on budgetary measures aimed at documenting the economy, the KCCI leadership remains resolute in its decision. The committee, comprised of multiple stakeholders, has been tasked with conducting a 30-day consultation process to formulate a consensus-based proposal for submission to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
Mr Bilwani said the strike decision was reaffirmed following an unproductive meeting with the finance minister, where key demands to suspend five major anti-business measures were left unaddressed. These demands include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, which grant sweeping powers of arrest and prosecution to tax officials; repeal of Section 21(S), which imposes penalties on cash transactions of Rs200,000 or more; abolition of Section 40C, mandating the e-Bilty system for goods transport; rollback of SRO 709, which enforces a flawed digital invoicing system; and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.
 
 


KCCI confirms July 19 shutdown over unaddressed tax grievances

In a statement, Mr Bilwani criticised those spreading rumours about the strike, stating that such elements have no affiliation with the movement and are not part of the consultative process.
He stressed that the strike call was the result of extensive discussions with presidents and representatives of leading chambers of commerce and industry from all four provinces.
He further clarified that any decision to defer or cancel the strike would only be made through mutual consensus and formally announced at a joint press conference attended by all supporting chambers. “No decision will be made unilaterally or behind closed doors,” he assured.
Mr Bilwani lashed out at those disseminating false narratives, calling them enemies of the business community attempting to derail a unified national cause. He reaffirmed that preparations for the strike are complete across the country and appealed to industrialists, wholesalers, shopkeepers, and traders to stand in solidarity with the movement for the sake of the economy and the nation.
He concluded by urging the business community and the public to disregard misinformation and rely solely on official announcements issued by the KCCI and its legitimate partners.

The call comes as more than 1.3 million Afghans have returned to the country this year, straining communities where 70 percent of people live in poverty, the UN envoy said in a press statement.
“Afghanistan’s stability hinges on shared responsibility,” Ms Otunbayeva said in the statement circulated by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).
“We cannot afford indifference; the cost of inaction will be measured in lives lost and conflicts reignited.”
 
 

Women and children face the gravest risks, returning not only to dire economic hardships but to a context where their access to basic services and social protections remains severely constrained, Ms Otunbayeva said.
“Do not turn away,” she appealed to donors, development partners and regional governments.
“The returnees must not be abandoned. What we are witnessing are the direct consequences of unmet global responsibilities. We must act now — with resources, with coordination, and with resolve.”
Ms Otunbayeva said the United Nations in Afghanistan is calling for an integrated approach that resources humanitarian needs while scaling up assistance in areas of return.
She underscored the need for immediate reintegration assistance, including livelihood programs and community infrastructure investments, to stabilise communities.
Without swift interventions, the UN warned that remittance losses, labour market pressures and cyclical migration could lead to destabilisation, renewed displacement and risks to regional stability.
“What should be a positive homecoming moment for families who fled conflict decades ago is instead marked by exhaustion, trauma, and profound uncertainty,” she said after visiting the Islam Qala border crossing.
“The sheer volume of returns — many abrupt, many involuntary — should be setting off alarm bells across the global community.”
“It is a test of our collective humanity,” she added. “Afghanistan, already grappling with drought, and a chronic humanitarian crisis, cannot absorb this shock alone.”
Humanitarian operations remain dangerously underfunded, forcing agonising choices between food, shelter and safe passage, according to UNAMA.
Meanwhile, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA), said in a recent report that the number of Afghans returning from Iran has increased significantly following the recent escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran.
Approximately 167,000 Afghans returned from Iran between July 1 and July 5 alone.
The report noted that as political tensions and anti-Afghan sentiment rise, the profile of returnees has shifted, with families now comprising over 60 percent of those returning, in contrast to the predominantly single males of previous waves.

Although alert, both Indus River System Authority (Irsa) and Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) responding to warning are jubilant and promising to “absorb” the entire stream at Mangla Dam, where such cushion is available.
According to Irsa spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana, the authority would do its best to store the entire stream. “In fact, the authority was hoping, and praying, for River Jehlum to swell during this monsoon and yield some additional water. At present, Mangla Dam is standing at 1,186 feet, against its maximum level of 1,242 feet – it still can go up by 56 feet. It is holding 3.41 million acre feet of water, whereas it can go up to 7.3 million feet.
 
 

“Irsa’s optimism of absorbing the entire flood wave is based on the filling criteria. Unlike Tarbella, where after reaching a certain level, only one foot of water can be stored in 24 hours. Mangla Dam does not have any such restriction. It can absorb triple the amount of water which is being warned against, the authority’s spokesman claimed.

Irsa, Wapda officials say Mangla Dam still has 56 feet to fill; ex-official cautions about a catch

“Wapda is also determined to host it all,” says Azam Joya, General Manager (Coordination and Monitoring). But still, Wapda has moved all experts to Mangla Dam, set up a control room and is now evaluating all reports and monitoring river and its tributaries. Those managing Tarbella Dam are also onboard and providing back-up to the Mangla mangers. “Yes, Mangla Dam does not have any filling restrictions, but history of its filling is a guide and the authority is keeping that in mind. If the wave remains within the limits of forecast, things would remain under control,” he believed.
Mangla Dam GM Fakhar Jahan is equally confident and terms the situation at Dam “normal.” In an official communication, he says “in this regard (warning of high stream in river Jhelum), it is to inform that dam is being monitored vigilantly in accordance with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs). At present, the situation at dam is normal.
The hydrology directorate remains fully operational round-the-clock and closely observing the prevailing conditions. There is ample storage available to safely absorb the anticipated inflows and any potential peak. And relevant stakeholders will be promptly informed of the actual inflows received at Mangla Reservoir.“

• Women make up only 13.5pc of workforce
ISLAMABAD: Women in wage employment earn substantially lower wages than their male counterparts in Pakistan, according to a report launched by the International Labour Organ­isation (ILO) on Wednesday.
The ‘Pakistan Gender Pay Gap Report 2025’ estimates the gender pay gap at approximately 25 per cent based on hourly wages and 30pc based on monthly wages. The gender pay gap in Pakistan is also significant by international standards. In comparison, lower-middle-income countries — the income group Pakistan falls under — have an average gender pay gap of 21pc based on monthly wages and 17pc based on hourly wages.
While launching the report, Secretary of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhary reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.
 
 

He said the report and accompanying action plan represent a vital step towards identifying and addressing the barriers that hinder women’s participation in the economy.
This, he added, would support Pakistan in progressively fulfilling its obligations under the ratified ILO Convention on Equal Remuneration and the Convention on Discrimination.
ILO Country Director Geir Tonstol said: “We now have the evidence, the commitment, and the partnerships to move from promise to practice. The ILO stands ready to support Pakistan in advancing fair and transparent wage-setting systems, formalising informal work, and creating real opportunities for women across all sectors.”
Alongside a large gender pay gap, women’s employment is limited in Pakistan. In 2021, women’s employment rate was around 23pc compared to 79pc for men.
This reflects a gender gap in employment of 56 percentage points, higher than the gap in other countries in the South Asia region. This means that Pakistani women are substantially less likely than men to have paid jobs and that, even when they are in wage employment, women earn substantially lower than men.
 
 

The report also finds that women account for just 13.5pc of employees in Pakistan.
Data in the report also showed that women who are in wage employment are more likely than their male counterparts to have a high level of education.
Moreover, women employees are more likely than men to work in the public sector and in formal employment, as well as in jobs with permanent contracts, in professional occupations and in larger firms.

Israeli and Hamas negotiators have been taking part in the latest round of ceasefire talks in Doha since July 6, discussing a US-backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire that envisages a phased release of Israeli prisoners, Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza, and discussions on ending the conflict.
 
 

Trump will host the Qatari leader for dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening, the White House said in a daily schedule for the president. Trump on Sunday said he hoped talks for a ceasefire deal would be “straightened out” this week.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had said on Sunday he was “hopeful” about the ceasefire negotiations under way in Qatar, a key mediator between the two sides.

Hamas denies Israeli media claims of progress in ceasefire talks; 21 Palestinians killed in stampede at US-backed aid distribution site

Hamas says no progress in ceasefire talks
Hamas accused Israel on Wednesday of wanting to retain military control of the Gaza Strip, and denied Israeli media claims of progress in ceasefire talks.
The indirect negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha are now in their second week, with the future presence of Israeli troops in the Palestinian territory a key issue.
Hamas wants a full withdrawal and last week rejected an Israeli proposal which it said would have kept troops in more than 40 per cent of Gaza.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan on Wednesday quoted a foreign official it did not identify as saying that work was ongoing to revise Israeli pullback maps.
But Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said: “(Israel) has not yet delivered any new or revised maps regarding military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
 
 

“The entire Gaza Strip is currently under the military control of Israel. What is happening on the ground confirms (Israel’s) intentions and plans to maintain and prolong military control within the Gaza Strip for the long term.”
21 Palestinians seeking aid killed
At least 21 Palestinians were killed on Wednesday at an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in what the US-backed group claimed was a crowd surge instigated by armed agitators.
The GHF, which is supported by Israel, said 19 people were trampled and one fatally stabbed during the crush at one of its centres in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
“We have credible reason to believe that elements within the crowd armed and affiliated with Hamas deliberately fomented the unrest,” GHF claimed in a statement.
Hamas rejected the GHF allegation as false and misleading, saying GHF guards and Israeli soldiers sprayed people with pepper gas and opened fire.
 
 

Witnesses said that guards at the site sprayed pepper gas at them after they had locked the gates to the centre, trapping them between the gates and the outer wire-fence.
People kept gathering and pressuring each other; when people pushed each other…those who couldn’t stand fell under the people and were crushed,“ said eyewitness Mahmoud Fojo, 21, who was hurt in the stampede.
“Some people started jumping over the netted fence and got wounded. We were injured, and God saved us. We were under the people and we said the Shahada (death prayers). We thought we were dying, finished,” he added.
Palestinian health officials said that 21 people had died of suffocation at the site. One medic said lots of people had been crammed into a small space and had been crushed. On Tuesday, the UN rights office in Geneva said it had recorded at least 875 killings within the past six weeks in the vicinity of aid sites and food convoys in Gaza - the majority of them close to GHF distribution points.
Most of those deaths were caused by gunfire that locals have blamed on the Israeli military.
The UN has called the GHFs model unsafe and a breach of humanitarian impartiality standards. Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, accused the GHF on Wednesday of gross mismanagement.
“People who flock in their thousands (to GHF sites) are hungry and exhausted, and they get squeezed into narrow places, amid shortages of aid and the absence of organisation and discipline by the GHF,” he said.

The deceased were identified as Head Const­able Ghulam Muhammad, from Panyala village in Dera Ismail Khan, and Constable Shehzad, from Aba Khel village in Lakki Marwat district.
According to a police spokesperson, the constables were travelling on a motorcycle when the incident took place. One of the constables, who had a disability, was being transported to a hospital by his colleague when they were attacked. The assailants fired upon them as they reached Shahi Gate, resulting in the death of both officers on the spot.
Police and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area after the attack and initiated a search operation. As the attackers attempted to flee, police returned fire, killing one assailant and injuring two others. A Kalashnikov rifle and ammunition were recovered from the deceased militant.
The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and district police continue to conduct an extensive search operation in the area. The funeral prayer for the martyred constables was held with full official honours at Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines in Dera Ismail Khan.
The ceremony was attended by Commissioner Dera Zafarul Islam Khattak, Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada, several civil and military officials A police contingent presented a guard of honour, and participants laid floral wreaths on the coffins and offered prayers for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.
The bodies of the constables were sent to their native villages, where they were laid to rest with full official honours. Initial investigations suggest that the attack was an act of terrorism.
Gas pipeline blown up
Meanwhile, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area of Lakki Marwat district late Tuesday night.
According to police, an IED that had been planted along the pipeline detonated with a loud explosion that was heard in the surrounding areas. The blast caused significant damage to the pipeline, which supplies gas to Punjab.
 
 

The explosion occurred within the jurisdiction of Saddar police station. Police and bomb disposal units later arrived at the site to investigate the incident. The blast halted the supply of gas from the Bettani oil and gas field to several regions.
It was the fourth attack on the gas infrastructure in the district within a month. Police have noted increased terrorist activity in the area and have increased security measures around the gas facilities.

While PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members, opposition parties have experienced slight variations in their seat allocations. The development has not impacted the overall seat count for the opposition, but individual party positions have shifted.
The ECP reduced one reserved seat each for JUI-F and PPP, while one has been allocated to PML-N.
With the latest notifications, JUI-F and PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while PPP holds 10 seats. The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats.

ECP fears delay in oath-taking may affect Senate polls; asks PHC to designate ‘oath commissioner’

The fate of one of the 26 seats reserved for women is to be decided by a draw between ANP and PTI-P, while the reserved seat for non-Muslims will be determined through a similar process between JUI-F and PML-N.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. This shift follows the June 27 judgement by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench, which declared that PTI was not entitled to reserved seats in either the National or provincial assemblies.
Before that verdict, the opposition parties had 27 MPAs and were unable to requisition an assembly session. However, the opposition will now be able to requisition a session once their newly elected MPAs take the oath of office.
Both JUI-F and PML-N now hold seven general seats, nine seats rese­rved for women and one rese­rved seat for non-Muslims each.
The PPP holds four general seats, five reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each hold two general seats and one reserved seat for women.
 
 

Before the ECP’s July 15 order, which granted PML-N entitlement to reserved seats for women and non-Muslims based on seven general seats, the commission had calculated these seats based on six general seats. In the 2024 general elections, JUI-F was entitled to 10 seats reserved for women and two reserved seats for non-Muslims based on the seven general seats it won.
PML-N had previously been allocated eight reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims, while PPP had six reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each held one MPA-elect each on seats reserved for women.
ECP approaches PHC
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) last week annulled the original distribution of reserved seats in the KP Assembly and ordered the ECP to redistribute these seats within 10 days.
A two-member bench, comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal, announced the reserved judgement on the petition of the PML-N against the distribution of reserved seats. In its verdict, the court declared both the ECP’s announcements regarding the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities null and void.
The court had previously deemed the ECP’s Feb 22 deadline for independent candidates to join political parties unconstitutional.
In a desperate move, the ECP approached the PHC on Wednesday, requesting that it appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect on reserved seats.
In a letter to the court’s registrar, the Election Commission pointed out that the Senate elections in KP were days away and the electoral college was still incomplete.
According to the letter seen by Dawn, the ECP requested that the PHC chief justice, under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, may appoint a person to administer the oath to the elected members of the KP Assembly on the reserved seats before the Senate polling date (July 21).
The commission had previously written letters to the speaker of the KP Assembly, the governor and the chief minister, urging them to ensure the oath-taking of the members-elect; however, no progress has been made so far.
Wednesday’s letter emphasised that the conduct of the Senate election and the administration of oath to the returned candidates are constitutional imperatives and also a fundamental right of the members-elect to represent their constituencies.
The commission said that it is entrusted with the responsibility to organise and conduct elections under Articles 219(b) and 224(3) of the Constitution, and Section 107 of the Elections Act, 2017. Furthermore, Article 218(3) of the Constitution mandates the ECP to ensure that elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly, and in accordance with the law.

• Major leading Awaran operation martyred
QUETTA: Just days after the deadly bus attack in the Zhob area of Balochistan, another passenger bus came under attack that claimed three innocent lives, including two Karachi-based Sabri qawwals, and left 13 others injured on the outskirts of Kalat on Wednesday.
SSP Shahzad told Dawn that three people who lost their lives in bus firing Kalat included famous qawal Ahmed Hussain Sabri, his son Ahmed Raza Sabri, who left for Quetta along with other musicians of the group in a bus.
“My brother, nephew and one musician killed in the armed attack,” famous Karachi-based Qawal Majid Ali Sabri said on the phone. He said his brother, nephew and other musicians were travelling to Quetta for performance at a wedding ceremony.
“My close relatives and musicians are among the injured,” added Majid Sabri who along with his wife is due in the provincial capital on Thursday (today).
Officials said the armed assailants were lying in ambush on both sides of the Quetta-Karachi highway in Nemargh area and used automatic weapons to carry out the assault. “They first stopped the coach and then opened indiscriminate fire,” an official said while quoting eyewitness accounts.
The attack came on the day when a security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” in Awaran, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). It said an army officer, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, embraced martyrdom while leading the operation.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalat Shahzad Akbar confirmed the bus shooting and said three individuals were killed on the spot, while 13 others sustained injuries. The victims were musicians from a Karachi-based band who were en route to Quetta for a performance, police said.
 
 

The injured were identified as Haider, Imran, Manzar, Abbas, Muhammad Saqib, Faysal, Muh­ammad Nadeem, Muha­mmad Rizwan, Musawir Abbas, Muha­m­mad Waris, Faizan, Dilshad (all from Karachi), Najeeb Ahmed (driver), and Bilal Ahmed.
Hospital officials said the victims had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, mostly to the head and upper part of their body. Some of the critically injured are being shifted to Quetta for advanced medical treatment, they said.
According to Imtiaz Lehri, who had booked the team, Majid Sabri was due in Quetta on Thursday along with his wife by air, and a hotel room was booked for them.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed the incident, casualties and location of the assault. He said, “Security forces, district administration, and rescue teams immediately reached the site. A search operation is underway, and the attackers are being pursued.”
He said the terrorists had planned the attack and launched it from both sides of the road. “We cannot yet confirm the number of assailants.”
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti wrote on X, “Targeting innocent and defenseless civilians is an unforgivable crime.” He also blamed India-backed terrorist organisations, stating, “These groups once targeted people based on identity, but are now indiscriminately attacking civilians. This is a war against every Pakistani.” He termed the attack a direct assault on Pakistan’s unity, sovereignty, and peace and pledged that the government would eradicate such threats at all costs.
 






Army officer martyred
On the other hand, the Inter-Services Public relations said on Wednesday night security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” while an officer of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom while leading the operation conducted in Awaran area.
The ISPR reported that the operation was launched based on intelligence inputs about terrorist presence in the area.
“During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorist location, killing three Indian-sponsored terrorists,” it added.
Tragically, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, 34, a brave officer from Muzaffarabad, embraced martyrdom while leading his troops in the operation. “Major Tariq led from the front and paid the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the nation,” the statement read.
It said a sanitisation operation was underway in the area to eliminate any remaining threats.
The ISPR added, “Security forces of Pakistan are fully committed to eradicating Indian-sponsored terrorism, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers only strengthen our resolve.”
