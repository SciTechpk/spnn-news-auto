<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16122503da931a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961447/ihc-directs-witnesses-statements-be-recorded-again-in-controversial-social-media-posts-case-against-imaan-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>IHC directs witnesses’ statements be recorded again in controversial social media posts case against Imaan, Hadi</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday ordered the trial court hearing the controversial social media posts case against rights activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha to record witnesses’ statements afresh within three days.
IHC’s Justice Mohammed Azam Khan passed the directives while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order, when the court had recorded the testimonies of all prosecution witnesses. Chattha had appeared before the court while Imaan’s lawyers had marked her presence. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies.
On Tuesday, IHC’s Justice Khan observed that witnesses’ statements should be recorded again and said that the case was being referred back to the trial court without touching its merits.
During the hearing, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad told the court that senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui had submitted his power of attorney but was busy with cases in Lahore, seeking a hearing after court vacations.
He also pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had directed an early decision in the matter, though no specific timeframe was fixed. Last week, the apex court had stayed trial proceedings against the two until their pending appeals were decided by the IHC.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor, Raja Naveed,  maintained that the complete record was available before the court.
Azad then argued that the accused were entitled to full protection under Article 10A (right to a fair trial) of the Constitution and raised the objection that the record had not been properly provided. He contended that the issue had been raised at the previous hearing as well.
During the hearing, the court also questioned whether the statement of the four witnesses had been recorded in the absence of one of the accused. At this, the prosecutor responded by saying that the conduct of the accused was also a relevant factor.
Defence counsel Azad insisted that witness statements must be recorded in the presence of the accused and sought time until Monday.
Subsequently, the court issued directives to the trial court.
The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca.
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.</p><small>2025-12-16 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16113520908469e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961446/10-people-among-passengers-kidnapped-by-katcha-area-dacoits-from-quetta-bound-bus-rescued-police' target='_blank'><strong>10 people among passengers kidnapped by Katcha area dacoits from Quetta-bound bus rescued: police</strong></a><br><p>Ten people among those who were kidnapped by Katcha area dacoits from a Quetta-bound bus near Ubauro in Sindh’s Ghotki district have been recovered, Sukkur police said on Tuesday, adding that an operation for the rescue of the remaining passengers was under way.
Around 15 dacoits had attacked the bus on Monday night and kidnapped several passengers after injuring the driver.
A statement from the office of Sukkur Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) captain (retd) Faisal Abdullah Chachar today said that 10 of the kidnapped passengers had been rescued in an overnight operation under the DIG’s command.
“Police and Rangers personnel rescued 10 of the abducted passengers after an exchange of fire [with the dacoits] in Sonmiani,” the statement said.
Quoting the rescued passengers, it added that at least two dacoits were injured during the operation.
“All routes leading to the Katcha area were blocked, preventing the bandits from taking the hostages there,” the statement said, adding that the blockade was still in place and would continue “until all bandits are eliminated”.
It further stated that the dacoits were being chased and “the fight with them is ongoing” for the recovery of the remaining passengers.
Meanwhile, the rescued passengers were taken to safe locations.
The attack
According to some videos shared on social media after 9:30pm on Monday, a passenger said a Sadabahar Company coach departed for Quetta from Sadiqabad at 8pm.
When it reached near the Murid Shaikh area near M-5 Motorway, it took a turn towards Guddu at the Punjab-Sindh border. Some 65kms from the area, the dacoits intercepted the coach and started firing.
They entered the bus after smashing the windows and asked the passengers to leave the coach, but did not harm the female passengers.
It was reported that the dacoits had kidnapped 25 passengers, but the number of abducted passengers has not been confirmed by police yet.

 

Katcha is the area of land running along the Indus River, which is divided between Punjab and Sindh. The region is notorious for banditry.
For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur frequently.
PTI leader’s condemnation
PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, in a statement, condemned Monday night’s incident and  called into question the efficiency of Sindh and Punjab police.
“More than twenty citizens were kidnapped; now their bids will be put up,” he said, stressing that the rulers were “failing” to protect their citizens.
He noted that Katcha areas had been declared “no-go” areas. Sheikh called for the immediate release of all the hostages.</p><small>2025-12-16 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/161210437131728.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961448/security-beefed-up-for-ashes-adelaide-test-after-bondi-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Security beefed up for Ashes Adelaide Test after Bondi shooting</strong></a><br><p>Police armed with rifles will be part of a beefed up security presence at the third Test between Australia and England at Adelaide Oval after the Bondi Beach shooting attacks, officials said, while flags will be flown at half-mast.
South Australia state Premier Peter Malinauskas said extra measures would be in place for the Ashes clash that starts on Wednesday, although there was no intelligence pointing to an elevated threat level.
“Given the events that have occurred in Sydney, there will be additional protocols put in place at Adelaide Oval,” he said late Monday.
“This is done only as a precautionary measure, but it is appropriate that we are in an increasing sense of alertness just at the moment.”
An attack by a father and son on a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday killed 15 people with dozens injured.One of the assailants was killed, while the other is in a critical condition in hospital.South Australia Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said special security-response police, armed with rifles, would be present in and around the Adelaide Oval during the Test.
“There’s a balance between the concern about police officers carrying rifles in and about the community, balanced with the need for us to be able to effectively respond to an event, should an event occur and these officers are specifically trained for that purpose,” he said.
“There’s no intelligence at this time to indicate that there are any increased levels of threat or security risks around the cricket or any other community event,” he said.
Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board released a joint statement to pay tribute to the Bondi Beach victims, saying they were “horrified”.
“All of our thoughts are with the victims, their friends and families, the Jewish community and the people of Australia at this deeply distressing time,” they said.
“Our condolences go out to all those affected.”
There will be a moment of silence observed before the Test and players from both sides will wear black armbands.
“While sport can seem insignificant at times like this, we have the unusual opportunity to bring millions of people together to pay tribute, to console and to contemplate what we want our nation to be,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg.
“We will continue to look at ways cricket can support and honour those who have been affected by the Bondi shootings and thank those who provided assistance during and since this tragedy.”</p><small>2025-12-16 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16114346f8bedd7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961445/pakistan-seeks-oil-deal-with-russia-as-energy-ministries-hold-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks oil deal with Russia as energy ministries hold talks</strong></a><br><p>Russia and Pakistan are in talks on a potential oil-sector agreement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told RIA news agency in remarks published on Tuesday.
“All of these areas are Russia’s strengths. And we would be very happy if Russia agreed on an agreement in this sector with Pakistan,” Aurangzeb told RIA in an interview when asked about wider cooperation in exploration, production and refining between the two countries.
“At present, the issue is being discussed by the energy ministries of both sides.”
Russia also discussed upgrading a refinery in Pakistan with Russian companies involved, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev had said in November.
Pakistan has stepped up engagement with Russia in recent years as Moscow sought new energy markets after Western sanctions over Ukraine, and Islamabad looked to lower import costs.
Pakistan began buying Russian crude in 2023.
Aurangzeb also said Russia and Pakistan are looking into building another steel plant in Pakistan, RIA reported.</p><small>2025-12-16 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/161049093b4a98f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961441/nation-firm-united-in-its-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism-says-pm-shehbaz-on-11th-anniversary-of-aps-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Nation firm, united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism, says PM Shehbaz on 11th anniversary of APS attack</strong></a><br><p>In a message on the 11th anniversary of the Army Public School (APS) attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the nation stood firm and united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism.
In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded.

 

In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience.
“Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed.
“The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs.







In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs.
“Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X.
“Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said.







He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”.
“The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”.
“There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”.
“We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say.
The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said.
The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”.
President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.”
“We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added.
“The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded.</p><small>2025-12-16 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16094521c681031.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961437/bondi-beach-suspect-arrived-in-philippines-as-indian-national-says-manilas-immigration-department' target='_blank'><strong>Bondi Beach suspect arrived in Philippines as Indian national, says Manila’s immigration department</strong></a><br><p>The father and son behind one of Australia’s deadliest mass shootings spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national.
Sajid Akram and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern province of Davao listed as their final destination.
“Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP, adding they departed on November 28.
Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter.

 

Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference.
“These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.”

 

Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police.
Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said.
Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen
The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday.
“It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC.
“With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview.
Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time.
“They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said.
“He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.”
Memorial of flowers
Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia.
“Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims.
“My heart is torn apart … it is insane.”
A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life.
At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings.
Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year.
Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work.
“This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said.
“And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.”
Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds.
He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million).







Tougher gun laws
Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons.
Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined.
Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism.
Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters.
“He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said.
The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports.
Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said.
Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death.
“I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.</p><small>2025-12-16 05:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6940cd32def25.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961426/false-notes-in-a-vexed-song' target='_blank'><strong>False notes in a vexed song</strong></a><br><p>TWO essential components of any song are its tune and its words. Most Indians can’t sing the lines of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s 19th-century nationalist song Vande Mataram in tune; and an equal number, or possibly even more, would struggle to divine the meaning of its heavily Sanskrit verses. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi still staged a 10-hour debate on the 19th-century song in parliament, wasting time and treasure to the tune of Rs250,000 per minute needed to run a House in session.
It can’t be too different with Pakistan’s predominantly Turko-Persian national anthem, which may be beyond the ken of the country’s ordinary Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi or Pashto-speaking people. It is said that the only purely Urdu word in Pakistan’s anthem is ‘ka’, meaning ‘of’. All other words are of Persian or Turkic origin. A Bangladeshi or a Sri Lankan is less likely to not know what their national songs mean.
National songs or anthems are often imposed from above, in which case they tend to exclude the diversity of the masses they purport to represent. On the flip side, the songs can be constructed to celebrate the cornucopia of plurality that faithfully describes a people. South Africa’s post-liberation anthem is composed and sung in five languages to reflect the nation’s alluring cultural mix. For another example, take New Zealand. Its national anthem God Defend New Zealand is sung in both Maori and English, typically with the first verse in native Maori followed by the same verse in English, acknowledging the nation’s bicultural heritage.
Rabindranath Tagore first selected Vande Mataram from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel Anandmath and set it to tune in Raag Desh, an evening melody. By the time it travelled to Maharashtra, Vishnupant Pagnis sang it in another alluring composition in Raag Miyan ki Saarang, a late morning melody. The novel’s theme is a biased and divisive depiction of an anti-colonial rebellion by Hindu sanyasis and Muslim fakirs, two ascetic communities in undivided Bengal. Bonding with Bengali peasants, the fakir-sanyasi rebellion was triggered by the Great Bengal Famine of 1770 for which they held the East India Company accountable. When Bankim wrote Anandmath a century later, a totally communalised narrative had crept in.

National songs or anthems are often imposed from above, in which case they tend to exclude the diversity of the masses they purport to represent.

In historical accounts of the revolt, the main enemy was the East India Company and its economic policies. In the Bankim version, the Muslim nawabs of Bengal, emasculated stooges of British rulers, and British administrators were projected as the dual oppressors. In truer history, the triggers were exploitation, famine and mass displacement. In Bankim’s version, religious nationalism was invoked to a holy motherland. He also airbrushed Muslim ascetics and peasants, portraying the Hindu ‘santaans’, or children of the motherland alone as having revolted. Anandmath thus turned a secular socioeconomic struggle into a proto-nationalist war for a Hindu nation. Moreover, the invectives Bankim reserved for Muslims were no different from the ones in vogue today under Narendra Modi’s watch.
Though the novel by the highly regarded literary figure of his time is perplexing in its anti-Muslim vitriol, the poem/song is harmless. For, if the objection is to a song praising Hindu deities, then Mohammed Rafi, Naushad Ali, Shakeel Badayuni and many other Indian musicians would be seen as guilty of abandoning their beliefs to sing Hindu bhajans. Their songs have bequeathed an aura of spirituality to a genre of music that appeals to India’s secular timbre in the same way as Hindu singer Kamla Jharia praises Islam’s leading figures or Lata Mangeshkar renders religiously framed verses of Allama Iqbal.

 

It’s the context of the novel in which the poem is situated that makes the song controversial. Let’s say ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is a fine incantation but it becomes terrifying when it’s arbitrarily imposed or used to attack minority communities, be they Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Bankim initially wrote the first two stanzas to extol the beauty of Bengal, which he saw as his motherland. The poem describes Bengal’s soothing air and clear water streams, both of which have become a rare commodity in Bengal and in much of India. In fact, as Delhi was choking with record high AQIs around the time of the Bankim poem discussion last week, the government released a paper in parliament claiming that no deaths were recorded as linked to the murderous air quality in India’s capital. There’s also an old video clip circulating of Modi misleading schoolchildren about global warming. “As we get old, we begin to feel hot and cold a little more,” he claimed.
Instead of discussing similarly urgent issues pla­­guing the country, Modi as is his wont, cynically preferred a meaningless discussion to hurl some more invectives on his bête noire, Jawaharlal Nehru, claiming he excised the religious part of the song to appease Muslims, a claim not supported by history. The song, which is hardly an issue in large swathes of India — for instance in Nagaland, Kerala or Tamil Nadu — was used to test its polarising efficacy ahead of the crucial West Bengal assembly elections due in March 2026.
While Indian Muslims scarcely care about the controversy today, the entire corpus of Arya Samaji Hindus also shuns worship of any deity in the traditional way that many Hindus do. Their belief system is based on a monotheistic interpretation of the Vedas, which prohibits the worship of multiple deities. Also, Dalits converted to Buddhism under Bhimrao Ambedkar’s oath that severely forbade them from worshipping Hindu deities, including those eulogised in the Bankim song. The Vande Mataram controversy is being rekindled by right-wing Sanatani Hindus as another arrow in the communal quiver to devise cynical electoral strategies. The question remains though as to how many Indians really care beyond the two igniting words — ‘Vande Mataram’, praise be to the motherland — that had once become a clarion call in India’s freedom struggle but also played a role in its partition.

Published in Dawn, December 16th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-16 04:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6940cd980977a.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961427/after-the-trial' target='_blank'><strong>After the trial</strong></a><br><p>AFTER more than a year, the conviction of Faiz Hameed was announced last week. It’s hard to say if it came as a surprise to anyone; after all, once the news of his arrest was made public last year, the conviction was a verdict foretold. And in the last couple of months, there had been quite a few leaks about what was apparently due any day.
For someone uninformed and with little access to power, it is hard to say what exactly this conviction means for Pakistan, its state structure and the military. Hence, here are some thoughts and questions on this conviction which undoubtedly is unprecedented, for no officer who headed the ISI has ever been held to account by its own institution.
However, it is noteworthy that in Pakistan, with its complex civil-military relations, ISI chiefs have always attracted controversy, more a function of the political and power relations rather than individuals. From Asad Durrani to Hamid Gul and Ehsan ul Haq, who too were rarely ever far from media, which in their day was rather staid and limited.
In recent times, we had Shuja Pasha, who perhaps set the trend for extensions, along with his boss. In addition, he was front and centre of crises such as Memogate, where his affidavit became a source of controversy and instability. Though of course, now he is more remembered for his role in propping up the PTI and being the brains behind the famous Lahore jalsa.

It is hard to say what exactly Faiz Hameed’s conviction means for Pakistan.

He was followed by Zaheer ul Islam who was then accused of having orchestrated the 2014 dharna, at the height of which there were media reports about the unease between him and the then army chief during meetings with the government. Then came Rizwan Akhtar who spent his tenure quietly, as his subordinate Faiz Hameed dominated the spotlight and went up and down the country, managing all that had to be managed, in the run-up to the 2018 election. But even Akhtar was implicated in the controversies that came close to Gen Raheel Sharif’s retirement; for instance, when a senator gave a statement about Qamar Bajwa, who had not yet been chosen to be chief.
Hameed, one should acknowledge, had two stints of ‘fame’ during his time in service. From intervention in politics, to allegations of murder to threats, the suppression of the media, and even bribery, he is accused of it all during his time and much of this is now being said publicly. Politicians have spoken about threats he made and what he did, as have journalists. Much detail has been made part of the discourse and is being openly discussed.
However, it has to be said that since his departure, Nadeem Anjum also did not stay far away from the public eye or gossip. Indeed, he might have been the only spy head to even do a press conference that was telecast live.
Against this backdrop, it is worth wondering if Hameed crossed lines in a way that is unacceptable. This is not to say that he didn’t but it might take some time before it can be concluded if he was an exception or if he ended up creating a new normal in terms of the manner in which he exercised power.

 

Part of the reason this question is hard to answer is because so few details have been released about his conviction. The press release makes it clear that he was accused of misusing his powers; causing loss to people; violating the Official Secrets Act and meddling in politics. One can assume or guess the first two allegations were linked to Top City scandal where he is said to have used defence personnel to threaten and intimidate the owners of the housing society. But the second two are hard to even make educated guesses about. Which of his various alleged acts in the realm of politics have been deemed wrong and which continue to remain kosher remains unclear, especially as the press release hinted that the May 9 investigations may still be pending.
Publicly, there is great discussion of what he did but there is no official clarity on what was found actionable during the court martial. And while this discussion may paint him as a villain, whether his conviction will prove to be a deterrent for those who may enjoy similar powers is hard to predict.
Third is the May 9 case, which one assumes is what he might face further investigations in, with implications for Imran Khan. The government’s hints and threats about it will continue but even if there is another court martial and then Khan’s conviction, this will not put to rest the debate regarding May 9. Unless the trials are made public. For it will not explain why a senior military officer in Lahore was removed (without any court martial) shortly after May 9 if the real culprits behind the event were Hameed, who was court martialled, and Khan (who, according to speculation, may also be court martialled). And neither will it explain why others accused in May 9 were convicted in ordinary courts on the testimonies of ordinary policemen if the real evidence was solid enough to convict a former DG of ISI and a former PM.
Last, there are far too many assertions in the world of commentary of how this punishment of 14 years might be reduced later on. Is this simply conjecture or based on something more substantial? It is hard to say. But some of those who do say this, point to the conviction of Gen Javed Iqbal, which was reduced before he was pardoned. And Iqbal was accused of espionage, which, one assumed is a serious offence, compared to meddling in politics.
Indeed, it is hard to conclude so far, if one is a bit sceptical, what kind of turning point Hameed’s conviction is and the break that it will be from past precedents of the institution.

The apparent target of the suspects — a father and a son — was an event celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.
While the crimes of the Israeli state are undoubtedly horrendous, these can never be a justification for the targeting of innocent people of the Jewish faith. According to media reports, the surviving gunman — the father was shot dead by security personnel at the crime scene — was at one time ‘examined’ by Australian intelligence for alleged links to IS, but not charged. Both shooters had reportedly pledged allegiance to IS.
Violent extremism is a challenge in Muslim-majority states, as well as in non-Muslim countries. Terrorist groups like IS and Al Qaeda exploit the persecution of Muslims, such as the genocide in Gaza, or past Western occupation of Muslim states, such as in Afghanistan and Iraq, to radicalise individuals.
In non-Muslim societies, other factors are also at work, such as marginalisation and racism, which could prompt individuals to take the extremist path. To prevent tragedies such as the Bondi attack, Muslim-majority and non-Muslim countries must work together to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation and deradicalisation efforts.

 

Moreover, the main triggers for radicalisation — such as the massacres in occupied Palestine, the Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Syria, etc — must be addressed. Furthermore, vicious attacks such as these should not be used to delegitimise the just Palestinian liberation struggle. Attempts are being made by Israel’s rulers to link the horrible episode with Australia’s recent recognition of the Palestinian state. Such false narratives must be confronted and exposed.
Moreover, tragedies like the Sydney attack should never be exploited to fuel Islamophobic narratives or anti-migrant rhetoric. It must be remembered that if the suspected perpetrators in Sydney are of Muslim backgrounds, then Ahmed Al-Ahmed, the man who confronted one of the shooters, was also a Muslim migrant in Australia. He has been described as a ‘hero’ by Australian officials, for helping save perhaps numerous lives due to his courage.

 

It is essential that governments and communities work together against terrorism. Letting hate divide communities would be a victory for terrorist groups such as IS, as well as far-right extremists in the West and elsewhere who seek to demonise Muslims, migrants and people of colour.
There should also be stringent checks on who can purchase firearms. The Australian government is reportedly considering tightening gun laws. This is the right thing to do. Closer CT coordination is necessary on an urgent basis, while in the long term, credible deradicalisation programmes, and addressing the root causes of extremism can help prevent such violent episodes.

A CTD official and a civilian lost their lives and three other police personnel injured in a heavy exchange of fire took place as the armed robbers atte­mpted to loot two other banks, including National Bank of Pakistan, in Chitkan Bazaar.
Officials said over 50 heavily armed men arrived in the area in several vehicles and barged into three banks in the main bazaar area and looted millions of rupees after holding the security guards and staff hostage at gun point. 
After looting three private banks, the armed men then attempted to enter the NBP and another bank. In the meantime, officials said, police and CTD personnel reached the site and challenged them. 

Police claim to have foiled two more bank heists 

“Armed men used heavy weapons in the gun battle and lobbed grenades, which continued for at least an hour,” SSP Dost Muhammad Bugti said, adding police and CTD officials returned fire.
During the exchange of fire, the CTD official, Dura Baloch, and the civilian, Amanullah, emb­r­aced martyrdom and three other cops suffered injuries, while armed robbers fled, police said.
“The armed men belonged to a banned militant organisation,” an official of the local administration said on the condition of anonymity.
According to some media reports, armed men looted around Rs190 million from three banks. Security officials said that an operation was launched in the area to trace out the armed gang. However, no arrest was reported till filing of this report on late Monday night.
Eyewitness account said the bodies and injured were shifted to Panjgur district hospital. Two CTD and police personnel were shifted to Karachi as they rece­ived serious injuries, they said.
While lauding the timely and courageous response of the law enforcement personnel, Baloch­istan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said CTD and police personnel demonstrated exceptional bravery and professionalism in safeguarding the lives and property of citizens.
The chief minister paid tribute to martyred CTD constable Dura Baloch, saluting his courage, sense of duty, and supreme sacrifice. He said the sacrifices of brave sons like Dara Khan would never be forgotten and that the nation remains indebted to the blood of its martyrs.
Expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the martyred civilian, the chief minister prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the deceased. He reiterated that there was no place for terrorists and criminal elements in Balochistan and vowed that the state would continue operations against anti-state elements with full force.
Mr Bugti emphasised the sacrifices of security forces for the restoration of peace and order would not go in vain and assured that the protection of life and property of the people would be ensured at all costs.

Representatives of multiple bu­­­siness bodies urged the Sindh government to intervene and address the situation stemming from the stri­­ke, which has a crippling impact on industrial production and supply chains.
In a letter to the Sindh chief minister, Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce Industry (OICCI) Secretary General Abdul Aleem said the situation was a very serious concern for the industry and commerce in the country.
He said he had raised this matter on Dec 12 with the Punjab and Sindh chief secretaries, but it partially eased the situation in Punjab only. However, the situation in Sindh and Karachi port, inward and outward movement of goods, has remained unchanged, he added.
“Many of our members have reported that trucks from Punjab are still unable to enter Karachi and port operations have also been severely constrained, and several major manufacturing facilities are now at imminent risk of shutdown,” he informed the Sindh CM.

Sindh CM urged to intervene to address issue as cargo unions announce nationwide boycott on 19th

“One OICCI member reported production lines shutdown this morning, with some others anticipating closures between tomorrow (Tuesday) and Wednesday,” he said, adding that “OICCI members further report that essential raw materials and finished goods are stranded across highways”.
According to Pakistan Vanas­pati Manufacturers Association (PVMA) Chairman Sheikh Umer Rehan, the supply of edible oil, ghee and essential daily-use commodities has been affected, while the transportation of industrial raw materials has come to a halt.
Mr Rehan warned the suspension of raw material supplies could paralyse the production process, leading to severe repercussions for the economy. He said the delivery of imported goods had come to a complete standstill, resulting in consignments being stuck at ports and exposing businesses to substantial financial losses in the form of demurrage and detention charges.
Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers General Secre­tary Wajid Bukhari said the goods transporters’ strike had a crippling impact on industrial production and supply chains. Prolonged disruption could result in layoffs, wage losses for workers, and long-term damage to Pakistan’s industrial credibility, he feared.
He urged the federal and provincial governments to engage in talks with the transporters, review the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025, and ado­pt a balanced approach that ens­ured road safety without paralysing the industry and production.
The current wave of protests by transporters began in response to the enforcement of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025 on Dec 8, under which traffic auth­orities imposed increased fines, strict penalties, vehicle impoundment, and FIRs against drivers and transport operators. Trans­po­­rt unions argue that the ordinance has been implemented without adequate consultation and has made routine transport operations financially unviable.
While negotiations temporarily eased tensions in some areas of Punjab on Dec 13, major transport bodies, including the All Pakistan Transport Federation and allied goods transport associations, have now announced a nationwide wheel-jam strike on Dec 19 after expressing dissatisfaction with government assurances.
Transport leaders have warned that unless controversial clauses of the ordinance are withdrawn or substantially revised, goods and passenger transport across the country will remain suspended.

During the massacre, 147 people were killed, including 132 students and 15 staff members, while 180 others were wounded in the attack on December 16, 2014.
The siblings and parents of the martyred students and staff members assembled on Shami Road and walked to the school, raising slogans and demanding justice for their martyred children.
The parents also lit candles at the Shuhada Monument inside the school and offered prayers for the martyred students.

Shuhada APS Forum President Ajoon Khan told Dawn that despite 11 years having passed since the massacre, justice has not been delivered to the bereaved families.
He demanded that the authorities punish those advocating for the resettlement of the terrorists involved in the incident, and said a judicial inquiry should be conducted into the matter.
Khan further demanded that the report of the judicial commission, which probed the APS massacre on the Supreme Court’s directive, be shared with the parents.
Regarding activities for the 11th anniversary, Khan said that a main function would be held at the APS campus in the morning, while parents would light candles at the Shuhada APS Monument near the Archives Library on Sher Shah Suri Road.
In response to the brutal attack, the government in January 2015 launched the National Action Plan (NAP) — introducing a series of kinetic and non-kinetic measures to counter terrorism, one of which was the decision to try terrorists in military courts. In 2021, the PTI-led government decided to review NAP.
A judicial commission report submitted to the Supreme Court in 2020 highlighted the belated response to the terror attack, while acknowledging that further devastation was foiled by Mobile Vigilance Team-2 (MVT) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
The commission also made certain recommendations, including medical and psychological treatment of the injured and the martyrs’ close relatives, as well as provision of free education to the injured and the martyred students’ siblings.</p><small>2025-12-16 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16075007bd54699.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961401/after-two-decades-gilgit-baltistan-to-have-local-government-polls-on-feb-14' target='_blank'><strong>After two decades, Gilgit-Baltistan to have local government polls on Feb 14</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: After a gap of 20 years, the Gilgit-Baltistan chief election commissioner on Monday announced the holding of local government (LG) elections in the region for February next year.
Separately, the GB Election Com­mission convened a multiparty conference (MPC) on Dec 18 to consult political parties on the general elections scheduled for Jan 24 next year.
According to the schedule issued by the GB Election Commission, polling for LG elections will be held on Feb 14. In this regard, a public notice will be issued on Dec 19, while nomination papers can be filed from Dec 22 to 26.
In a statement, CEC Raja Shahbaz Khan said LG elections in GB were the need of the hour and that the election commission was fully prepared and committed to conducting the polls.

Election commission to convene MPC on 18th for consultation on next month general elections

He said LG elections had not been held in the region for the past 20 years and that their conduct would help resolve public issues at the grassroots level, enabling citizens to secure rights at their doorsteps.
CEC Khan described LG elections as a milestone for strengthening democratic institutions and promoting development in the region, saying local governments play a key role in any democratic system.
He said the elections would provide people with an opportunity to directly participate in decision-making and local development, adding that the election commission was determined to hold the polls in a clean, transparent, fair and lawful manner.
Multiparty conference
Meanwhile, the GB Election Commission has convened the MPC at 11am on Dec 18 (Thursday) at its secretariat to consult political parties on the holding of general elections scheduled for Jan 24.
CEC Khan expressed the hope all political parties in Gilgit-Baltistan, or their authorised representatives, would participate in the conference. The purpose of the meeting was to seek views, suggestions and guidance on key electoral matters to make the process more effective, transparent and in line with democratic principles, he added.
He asked the leaders of all political parties to attend the consultative meeting and share their valuable views and suggestions with the election commission. He reaffirmed the commission’s determination to ensure the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections with the cooperation of all stakeholders.
Due to harsh weather conditions in the region, sources said, political party leaders had already opposed the holding of the general elections on Jan 24.
While the MPC is expected to demand a delay in the polls until May, the election commission in such scenario is considering to hold the general and local government elections simultaneously, the sources added.

In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot price of HSD has been reduced by Rs14 per litre (5pc) to Rs265.65 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs279.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares based on an approximate Rs27 per litre increase between May and August, and have not reversed them despite a Rs9 per litre cut.
The ex-depot petrol price was kept unchanged at Rs263.45 per litre. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-16 02:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16073513d5e7d8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961376/rate-cut-too-meagre-to-address-major-challenges-industry-leaders-complain' target='_blank'><strong>Rate cut too meagre to address major challenges, industry leaders complain</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The decision of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to lower the policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.50pc drew mixed reactions on Monday, with a foreign investors’ body welcoming it while the country’s wider business community criticised it as marginal and ineffective for boosting local production and exports.
The Overseas Investors Cham­ber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) viewed the rate cut as a prudent measure.
“The State Bank has taken a cautious and measured step to ease financing conditions,” OCCI’s Secretary General and Chief Executive Abdul Aleem said.

 

Mr Aleem said the unexpected reduction is positive and will help stimulate business activities by lowering borrowing costs while preserving overall economic stability.

MNCs’ association terms SBP move ‘cautious’ for fostering stability

He added that the chamber notes that a gradual approach “allows businesses to plan investment decisions with greater confidence and helps ensure that the impact of ease remains aligned with sustainable economic growth objectives”.
However, local business leaders expr­essed immediate and deep disappointment, arguing the minor adjustment fails to address the severe challenges they face.
“Such a token adjustment falls far short of what is urgently required to revive Pakistan’s fragile economy and restore business confidence,” Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Rehan Hanif said.
Mr Hanif said the marginal cut neither reflects prevailing economic realities nor offers meaningful relief to businesses struggling under an exceptionally high cost of doing business. Despite a visible decline in inflation, borrowing costs in Pakistan remain among the highest in the region, he said.
“Regional economies such as China, India, Bangladesh, Viet­nam, Indonesia and Sri Lanka maintain single-digit interest rates, enabling their industries to access affordable financing, expand capacity, and remain competitive in global markets, while the situation in Pakistan is opposite,” Mr Hanif said.
Mr Hanif noted when the cost of financing remains prohibitively high, businesses defer expansion plans, shut down marginal units, and reduce employment, ultimately leading to lower economic output and reduced government revenues.
Echoing that sentiment, leaders from other major trade bodies said the small reduction would fail to encourage new investment or create jobs.
“The 50 basis point cut would not resolve the industries’ problems and fail to boost exports under the challenging business environment,” Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FPCCI) Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said.
“The interest rate should be brought down to a single digit to at least come at par with regional peers.”
Industries are currently burdened with exorbitant energy tariffs, high fuel prices, excessive taxation and a volatile exchange rate. Business leaders argue that maintaining a high interest rate regime suffocates productive economic activity.
Ahmed Azeem Alvi, president of the SITE Association of Industry, termed the move insufficient. “People are losing jobs every day.
The government must bring the policy rate down to single digits so that the economy can breathe and employment opportunities can grow,” he said.
Alvi added that bureaucratic hurdles and IMF conditions were preventing effective decision making.
Businessman Diwan Fakhr­uddin outrightly rejected the reduction, noting that high interest rates have made bank financing difficult to obtain, forcing manufacturing units to operate below capacity and leading to rising unemployment.
He stressed that small and medium enterprises have been particularly hard hit.
“As a result, not only has the establishment of new industries come to a halt, but existing manufacturing units are also being forced to operate below capacity,” Mr Fakhruddin said.
He urged the SBP to take into account the ground realities and announce an immediate, substantial, and effective reduction in interest rates.
Pakistan Chemicals and Dyes Merchants Association Chai­rman Saleem Valimuha­mmad said if the interest rate remains at this level, it will be impossible for businesses to grow, and the overall economic growth will continue to slow down. Unless the interest rate is brought down to single digits, there will be little hope for the improvement of the economy.

Trump accused Britain’s publicly owned broadcaster of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said “fight like hell”.

 

It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest.
Trump’s lawsuit alleges the BBC defamed him and violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit’s two counts.
The BBC has apologised to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action. But it has said there is no legal basis to sue.
Trump, in his lawsuit filed on Monday in Miami federal court, said the BBC despite its apology “has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses”.
The BBC is funded through a mandatory license fee on all TV viewers, which UK lawyers say could make any payout to Trump politically fraught.
A spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the BBC “has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda”.
A BBC spokesperson told Reuters earlier on Monday that it had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.”
The broadcaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the lawsuit was filed.
Crisis led to resignations
Facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history, the BBC has said it has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms.
The dispute over the clip, featured on the BBC’s ‘Panorama’ documentary show shortly before the 2024 presidential election, sparked a public relations crisis for the broadcaster, leading to the resignations of its two most senior officials.
Trump’s lawyers say the BBC caused him overwhelming reputational and financial harm.
The documentary drew scrutiny after the leak of a BBC memo by an external standards adviser that raised concerns about how it was edited, part of a wider investigation of political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster.
The documentary was not broadcast in the United States.
Trump may have sued in the US because defamation claims in Britain must be brought within a year of publication, a window that has closed for the ‘Panorama’ episode.
To overcome the US constitution’s legal protections for free speech and the press, Trump will need to prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted recklessly.
The broadcaster could argue that the documentary was substantially true and its editing decisions did not create a false impression, legal experts said. It could also claim the program did not damage Trump’s reputation.
Other media have settled with Trump, including CBS and ABC when Trump sued them following his comeback win in the November 2024 election.
Trump has filed lawsuits against the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa, all three of which have denied wrongdoing.
The attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s presidential win over Trump in the 2020 US election.</p><small>2025-12-16 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16072434e5b0ede.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961408/orchestrated-campaign-against-state-unearthed' target='_blank'><strong>‘Orchestrated campaign against state unearthed’</strong></a><br><p>• Talal Chaudhry claims terrorists using social media to manipulate public opinion• Alleges PTI-linked accounts creating ‘anti-state trends’• Warns citizens against becoming part of ‘paid trends’
ISLAMABAD: As he targeted the opposition for alleged social media campaigns, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday claimed that Pakistan had uncovered extensive evidence of coordinated and paid online campaigns being run through fake accounts operated largely from abroad.
According to the state-run APP, the minister said the government recently provided foreign media with background information on how terrorists and organised networks were exploiting social media platforms to manipulate public opinion in Pakistan.
The minister explained that investigations revealed how artificial trends were created and sold through WhatsApp groups and other platforms.
He said individuals were paid small amounts ranging from a few rupees to cents per post to repeatedly tweet or forward messages, sometimes hundreds of times a day. Many of these accounts, he said, originate outside Pakistan and are operated by companies using fake identities. He added that account names are frequently changed depending on the campaign being promoted, making it harder to trace their origins.
The state minister claimed the same networks had been found promoting content linked to terrorist organisations, as well as ‘unrelated international causes’, demonstrating that the activity was commercial rather than ideological. These trends are not organic or natural, he added.
Mr Chaudhry clarified that the evidence shared was gathered directly from the same social media platforms being misused, including details of temporary WhatsApp groups formed to run trends and then deleted to avoid detection. He said social media companies’ own community guidelines were being violated, leading to account closures and further action by the platforms.
While emphasising that the government did not want ordinary citizens to face criminal cases, the minister issued a clear warning, saying that if people knowingly became part of paid trends that were against the country, they could face legal consequences.
Freedom of expression is not without responsibility, he said, claiming that no one had the right to hurt religious sentiments, target friendly countries, or malign individuals and institutions under the guise of free speech.
Responding to questions, Mr Chaudhry stated that most accounts involved were fake and that privacy laws limited access to IP addresses and ownership details, although Pakistan was engaging with platforms and foreign governments to address the issue. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms, anywhere in the world, noting that the country has long been on the front line in the global fight against terrorism.
The press conference, he said, was aimed at dispelling the notion that controversial online narratives reflected genuine public opinion. This is not popularity.
This is a money-driven mechanism operated through fake accounts across the world, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan would continue to work with international partners to curb such activities.
PTI blamed
Mr Chaudhry also accused PTI-linked social media accounts of receiving foreign funding to promote the “enemy’s narrative and target institutions by creating anti-state trends”. He said that PTI social media accounts were being operated from abroad, mainly from North America, Europe, and some parts of South Asia, and were used specifically to create trends.
He alleged that a malicious campaign was being run against state institutions on social media, vowing that no compromise would be made on national sovereignty. He regretted that the PTI was using social media to promote a ‘specific narrative’ and said coordinated campaigns were allegedly launched to unleash propaganda against national security.
He alleged that some companies auction and sell trends and hashtags. He said certain elements were actively working against the country’s sovereignty, reiterating that the government would not compromise on national security.

Pakistan Railways Rawalpindi Divisional Superintendent Noorduddin Dawar confirmed to Dawn that the Millat Express struck a police vehicle belonging to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that suddenly tried to cross the track at an unmanned crossing, leaving two constables dead and one injured. He added that two other constables were “safe”.
“SHO (Station House Officer) RPS (railway police station) Sargodha and SHO Cantt Sargodha Punjab Police are present at the site,” he said in a message to Dawn. “This falls under the jurisdiction of Sargodha Cantt District Police. The train has moved after a brief stop.”
Muhammad Sawar Khan, an area officer for Pakistan Railways, confirmed to Dawn that the train — which left Sargodha and headed towards Charnali railway station —was running through the unmanned crossing when a police van belonging to the SIU attempted to cross.
“The driver of the police van tried to cross the unmanned crossing without looking and was hit by the train. Two police constables died in the collision and three were injured, one of whom is in critical condition,” Khan elaborated.
The two deceased cops were identified as Constables Sibtain and Amanullah, while the other three were identified as Head Constable Muhammad Owais, Constable Abrar and Driver Constable Ziafat, according to Rescue 1122 Sargodha.
Visuals of the vehicle showed that the front end of the vehicle had been completely mangled in the collision.
According to the police, the five personnel were performing a routine patrol of the area when they attempted to cross the railway track.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar took immediate notice of the incident and demanded a report from the deputy inspector general of the SIU.
Meanwhile, a Punjab Police spokesperson said that the incident was being investigated and legal action would be taken.
Pakistan Railways has some 4,072 level crossings – 1,341 manned and 2,731 unmanned – on its 8,000 kilometres or so long operational track. At least Rs4 million are required to convert an unmanned level crossing into manned one.</p><small>2025-12-15 20:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15211454e3198a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961285/terrorists-in-afghanistan-hinder-regional-economic-integration-pose-serious-security-challenges-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorists in Afghanistan hinder regional economic integration, pose serious security challenges: envoy</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq on Monday shared “concerns over the large number of terrorists in the neighbourhood, hindering regional economic integration and posing serious security challenges.”
In a post on X, Sadiq, who also holds the special assistant to the prime minister portfolio, said he had held separate meetings with his counterparts from China and Uzbekistan on the sidelines of the Afghanistan Neighbours Conference in Tehran.
“We agreed that collective efforts needed to address this threat,” he said.







Separately, senior diplomats of Afghanistan’s six neighbouring countries and Russia, who met in Tehran on Sunday, supported all efforts to reduce tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
They expressed their readiness to help strengthen these efforts, an Iranian government statement said on Monday.
Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported that the participants also called on Islamabad and Kabul to return to the negotiating table and resolve their problems through diplomatic channels.
In October, border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists.
Without referring to any country, the participants opposed any attempt by foreign countries to have a military presence in Afghanistan.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for taking back Bagram Airbase, north of Kabul.
The Taliban rulers have rejected President Trump’s call.
Expressing security concerns, the special envoys announced and emphasised their readiness to assist Afghanistan in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and human trafficking.
They emphasised the responsibility of the international community to lift sanctions and release Afghan assets, according to the statement.
The US had frozen around $9 billion of Afghanistan’s state bank after the Taliban takeover in 2021.
The diplomats called on international organisations to support the return of Afghan citizens from neighboring countries to their country and to create conditions for their dignified return.
The call came at a time when the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran is underway.
They emphasised regional integration and the centrality of the region in resolving existing issues and challenges, including some issues related to Afghanistan. They emphasised strengthening stability in Afghanistan and expressed their readiness to help achieve it if the Afghan side declares a need.
Emphasising the importance of continuing economic and trade relations with Afghanistan with the aim of improving the livelihoods of the people of that country, they pointed out the need for the country’s integration into the political and economic processes of the region.
They also stressed the responsibility of countries that are responsible for Afghanistan’s current situation to help rebuild and improve its economic and welfare situation without turning it into a political lever.
The participants agreed to hold the fifth meeting of foreign ministers of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, as soon as possible.
They welcomed Pakistan’s readiness to hold the second round of the meeting of special representatives of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries in Islamabad in March 2026.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/152223434170356.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961287/india-charges-six-over-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>India charges six over Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>India’s counter-terrorism agency said on Monday that it had filed charges against six people in connection with a deadly attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir.
The chargesheet from India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) “charged the banned LeT/TRF as a legal entity for its role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam attack,” an agency statement alleged.
The Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned in 2002 by the Pakistan government during the rule of then-military ruler Pervez Musharraf. The Resistance Front – a little known oragnisation that was blamed by New Delhi for the attack – was recently designated as a terror group by the United States.
Three of those named are dead, while two are said to be in Indian custody.
The trio were killed by Indian security forces in a forest in held Kashmir weeks after the attack, according to NIA. Two local men, Parvaiz Ahmad and Bashir Ahmad Jothatd, arrested in June on charges of harbouring the attackers, have also been charged.
Pahalgam was the site where gunmen killed 26 tourists on April 22. India blamed the attack on Pakistan, without evidence – an allegation that Islamabad had strongly denied while calling for a neutral investigation – triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict in May of this year.
After the four-day conflict, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation.
Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown.
The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/152209410c65d21.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961286/militants-blow-up-girls-school-in-north-waziristans-mir-ali' target='_blank'><strong>Militants blow up girl’s school in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali</strong></a><br><p>In another attack targeting educational institutions, a government school for girls in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali was destroyed by explosives, spreading fear and anxiety among students.
Last week, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the same district, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children.
The latest incident occurred in Eppi village, according to the police. The attackers planted explosive material inside the school building during the night, triggering a powerful blast that completely destroyed the structure.
According to government officials, around 250 girls were enrolled at the school. It was the only educational institution for girls in the area, where students used to travel from far-flung localities for education.
Police officials said the school was closed at the time of the explosion and no loss of life was reported. However, the blast caused severe damage to government property. Following the incident, panic gripped the area. Police reached the site, collected evidence, and launched an investigation against unknown perpetrators.
The targeting of two educational institutions within a week has raised grave concerns among students and parents in the area.
Reacting to the incident, a local tribal elder said, “Targeting educational institutions is an attack on the future of the entire nation. The tribal people will not tolerate such elements under any circumstances, and the government must immediately expose and bring the culprits to justice.”
Meanwhile, the district administration strongly condemned the attack and stated that security at schools was being further strengthened.
“Attacks on educational institutions are intolerable. Strict action will be taken against those involved, and additional security measures are being implemented to protect schools,” said the administration.
Local parents and members of civil society have also urged the authorities to ensure continuity of education by swiftly reconstructing the damaged school buildings and establishing lasting peace in the area.
In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building.
Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1519550325090ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961281/no-fly-zone-punjab-assembly-passes-stringent-bill-regulating-kite-flying' target='_blank'><strong>No fly zone: Punjab Assembly passes stringent bill regulating kite-flying</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on Monday cleared the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill 2025, proposing a near-total ban on kite-flying, except on specific days and designated locations across the province, with strict penalties to curb fatal accidents and property damage.
The development comes after the Punjab government lifted a ban on the Basant festival after 18 years, with the festival slated to be celebrated in February next year. The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp kite strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders.
Under the bill, flying kites with metallic wires, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials is prohibited, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
Violators involved in kite-flying could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5m.
All offences under the proposed law will be cognisable and non-bailable.
The bill empowers deputy commissioners to allow “permissible kite-flying” on specific days and at designated locations, subject to government approval and strict conditions. However, the use of sharp or metallic strings will remain banned under all circumstances.
Special provisions are included in the bill that deal with children involved in kite-flying. Minors will be tried under the Juvenile Justice System Act and be fined Rs50,000 for the first offence and Rs100,000 for repeat violations, with parents or guardians held financially responsible in case of default.
The proposed law also introduces the mandatory registration of kite manufacturers, traders and sellers of permissible kite-flying material, as well as kite-flying associations. Police officers not below the rank of sub-inspector will be empowered to arrest offenders without a warrant, conduct searches and seize illegal materials.
To encourage enforcement, the bill includes a whistleblower reward of up to Rs5,000 for providing credible information about violations.
If passed by the provincial assembly, the new law will repeal earlier kite-flying ordinances and establish a uniform, province-wide regulatory framework aimed at protecting lives and public safety.
Kite-flying, particularly in Punjab, has been outlawed due to severe and sometimes fatal accidents.
Last July, a 13-year-old boy was electrocuted while catching a stray kite in Kasur’s Basti Lal Shah area.
The boy rushed to catch a stray kite attached to a metal string. The metal string fell on the transmission line before he caught it.
In March last year, a motorcyclist died after a metal string, believed to be part of a stray kite, cut his throat in Faisalabad. Following the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz ordered a crackdown on those involved in kite-flying.
The provincial government intensified its crackdown on kite-flying by declaring kite-making, flying, and transportation as non-bailable offences in August 2024.</p><small>2025-12-15 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15192347070a96c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961278/hero-who-disarmed-bondi-gunman-recovers-in-hospital-as-donations-pour-in' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hero’ who disarmed Bondi gunman recovers in hospital as donations pour in</strong></a><br><p>Donations for a Sydney man who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers during a mass shooting at Bondi Beach have surged past Australian dollars (A$)1.1 million ($744,000), as he recovers in hospital after surgery for bullet wounds.
Forty-three-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, a father-of-two, hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ahmed’s bravery saved lives.
“What we’ve seen in the last 24 hours was the worst of humanity in a terrorist act. But we also saw an example of the best of humanity in Ahmed Al Ahmed running towards danger, putting his own life at risk,” Albanese told state broadcaster ABC News.
He was shot twice by a second perpetrator, Albanese said. Ahmed’s family said he was hit in the hand and arm.
Australian police on Monday said a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
Hailed a hero for disarming the gunman
Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed, told ABC News in an interview that his son was an Australian citizen and sells fruits and vegetables.
“My son is a hero. He served in the police; he has the passion to defend people. When he saw people lying on the ground and the blood, quickly his conscience pushed him to attack one of the terrorists and take away his weapon,” Mohamed Fateh said.
Jozay Alkanji, Ahmed’s cousin, said he had had initial surgery and may need more.

Tributes have poured in from leaders both abroad and at home.Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales where Sydney is located, said in a social media post that he visited Ahmed at St George Hospital and conveyed the gratitude of people across the state.
“Ahmed is a real-life hero,” his post said. “Thank you, Ahmed.” A photo showed Minns at his bedside, and Ahmed propped on pillows with his left arm in a cast.







US President Donald Trump called Ahmed “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.1 million within one day. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was the largest donor, contributing A$99,999 and sharing the fundraiser on his X account.
Supporters thank Ahmed for saving lives
Outside St George Hospital, strangers came to show their support.
Misha and Veronica Pochuev left flowers for Ahmed with their seven-year-old daughter, Miroslava.
“My husband is Russian, my father is Jewish, my grandpa is Muslim. This is not only about Bondi, this is about every person,” Veronica said.
Yomna Touni, 43, stayed at the hospital for hours to offer assistance on behalf of a Muslim-run charity also raising funds for Ahmed.
“The intention is to raise as much money as possible for his speedy recovery,” she said.</p><small>2025-12-15 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151456016e17c0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961265/central-bank-slashes-policy-rate-by-50-bps-to-105pc' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank slashes policy rate by 50 bps to 10.5pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.5 per cent, effective from December 16.
In a statement, the monetary policy committee (MPC) noted that inflation remained within the 5-7pc target range on average during July-November FY26, though it said that core inflation proved to be “relatively sticky”.
“On balance, the inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged, mainly owing to the relatively benign global commodity prices and anchored inflation expectations, amidst [a] prudent monetary policy stance,” the statement read.
The MPC further observed that economic activity was increasing based on an improvement in key high-frequency indicators, including a higher-than-anticipated increase in large-scale manufacturing during the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year.







“Nonetheless, the committee noted that the global environment remains challenging, particularly for exports, which may have some implications for the macroeconomic outlook,” the statement read.
“In this backdrop, while ensuring the ongoing price stability, the MPC noted the available space to reduce the policy rate to support sustainable economic growth.”
Additionally, the committee observed some developments since its last meeting in May, namely a rising unemployment rate from 2020-21, increasing foreign exchange reserves and “sizeable” debt repayments and increasing consumer confidence. It did note that business confidence “moderated slightly”.
“Led by sizable SBP profit transfer, the overall and primary fiscal balances recorded surpluses during Q1-FY26,” the statement read. “The global environment remains fluid, characterised by generally supportive commodity prices, but also evolving tariff-related dynamics and challenging financial conditions.”
The MPC added that high-frequency indicators support previous assessments of ongoing momentum in sectors, such as large-scale manufacturing. It further noted that the sale of automobiles, fertiliser, cement and the imports of machinery and intermediate goods, “all signal a positive outlook for industrial activity”.
On the other hand, the committee said that the ongoing challenging export environment poses some risks for industrial outlook.
“In the agriculture sector, incoming information about major crops also support the previous assessment,” the statement read. “The latest information on area under wheat crop, input conditions and government-backed incentive schemes indicates that wheat production may surpass the target.”
The MPC stated that these positive developments are likely to support the services sector and real GDP growth for FY26 is expected to remain in the upper half of the earlier projected range of 3.25–4.25pc.
In terms of the external sector, the MPC said that the current account posted a cumulative deficit of $0.7 billion during July-October FY26, in line with its expectations. Imports continued to grow with improving economic activity and workers’ remittances remained resilient.
“However, exports came under pressure, largely owing to a sharp decline in food exports, particularly rice,” the statement read.
“On the financing side, net inflows remained tepid. Despite this, SBP’s FX (foreign exchange) reserves have crossed the December 2025 target of $15.5bn, led by continued FX purchases by the central bank,” it added.
The statement added that changing trade dynamics may constrain Pakistan’s exports, while lower global oil prices may contain imports.
“On balance, the assessment for the current account is broadly unchanged, and the deficit is projected to remain within 0 to 1pc of GDP in FY26,” the MPC said. “Moreover, with the realisation of planned official inflows, SBP’s FX reserves are projected to strengthen to $17.8bn by June 2026.”
The MPC noted that in Q1-FY26, both the overall and primary balances recorded surpluses, thanks to the transfer of sizeable SBP profit.
“At the same time, the expenditure to GDP ratio remained lower than last year’s comparable level, which also contributed to this fiscal performance,” the statement read.
“Meanwhile, the FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) collection slowed down considerably to 10.2pc [year-on-year] during July-November FY26, implying significant acceleration required to achieve the budgeted tax collection target in the remaining seven months of FY26,” it added.
The committee further said that interest payments were expected to be lower than the budgeted amount for the year and help contain the fiscal deficit.
“The MPC underscored the importance of structural reforms, especially to broaden the tax base and privatise loss-making SOEs (state-owned enterprises), to strengthen fiscal buffers while creating space for public investment and needed spending for socioeconomic uplift,” the statement added.
According to the statement, since the committee’s last meeting, broad money growth accelerated to 14.9pc as of November 28. Due to borrowing by key sectors like textiles, wholesale and retail and chemicals, private sector credit ballooned by Rs187bn between July and November.
“Consumer financing, particularly automobile loans, remained strong in the wake of easing financial conditions, improved consumer sentiments and a stable macroeconomic environment,” the statement read.
“On the liability side, currency in circulation broadly remained unchanged, whereas an increase in deposits led to a moderate decline in the currency-to-deposits ratio.”
The MPC also observed that headline inflation remained within the medium-term target range over the past three months, with food, energy and core components of inflation beginning to converge.
“In this context, the prudent monetary policy stance, complemented by fiscal discipline, is helping stabilise inflation within the target range, despite recent supply-side frictions and relatively sticky core inflation,” the committee stated. “Moreover, inflation expectations also remain anchored.”
However, inflation is expected to rise past the target range towards the end of the current fiscal year, before reverting to base levels in FY2027.
“The committee noted that this outlook is subject to risks from volatile global commodity prices, magnitude and timing of energy price adjustments, fiscal slippages, and uncertainty around prices of wheat and allied products and perishable food items,” the statement added.
‘A welcome move’
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction with the cut in interest rates, hailing the move as a “harbinger of … improvement of the business community and the common man”.
“By the grace of Allah, the hard work of the government’s economic team is bearing fruit, the PM said, praising Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team for their efforts.
“There is economic stability in the country and Pakistan is moving towards development,” he added. “The business community and the public have made sacrifices for economic stability. The economic improvement is providing relief to the public as much as possible.”
The PM said that small and medium-sized businesses will benefit the most from the reduction in interest rates and access to loans at low cost.
Yousuf M Farooq, the research director at Chase Securities, called the cut “a welcome move”, provided the current account stays contained and the exchange rate can act as a shock absorber if external pressures re-emerge.
“Lower rates should be supportive for equities by lifting valuation multiples and easing financing costs, particularly for leveraged sectors,” he told Dawn.
“It should also help stimulate domestic demand while reducing the government’s interest expense.”
Farooq noted that while a 50bps reduction is not material on its own, it clearly signals the direction of policy in the coming months.
Meanwhile, AKD Securities Research Director Avais Ashraf told Dawn that the slashed rate would improve domestic industry and make exports more competitive.
“We expect its impact on trade imbalance to remain manageable as food supplies improve,” he said.
Ashraf noted that the recent surge in trade balance was caused by a disruption in food supplies amid higher rains and floods in the monsoon season this year.
“Higher food imports and lower food exports exert pressure on [the] current account that remain manageable given robust remittances and manageable interest payments,” he stated.
Ashraf expressed concern over the growing import of automobiles, which is increasing despite government restrictions on financing terms.
Topline Securities wrote in an X post that the slashed policy rate was a “surprise”, as they expected the rates to remain unchanged.
“In last four monetary policy meetings, [the] SBP observed [the] status quo. [The] last cut of 100bps was announced in [a] May 5, 2025 meeting,” the post read.







The last reduction in the policy rate came in May. Since then, the benchmark rate has been held at 11pc, even as headline inflation dipped to 3pc earlier this year. November inflation was recorded at 6.1pc, compared to 6.2pc in October.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised maintaining tight liquidity to curb expected inflation, despite mounting industry pressure.
In a second review released on Thursday, the Fund said the monetary policy needed to remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep expectations anchored, while noting that the SBP had maintained positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis.
It said the tight stance had been pivotal in reducing inflation and should be maintained to ensure price stability and support the rebuilding of external buffers.
Industrial leaders had previously called for a reduction in interest rates to help them stay competitive globally.</p><small>2025-12-15 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151724244235b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961270/soldier-martyred-in-di-khan-counter-insurgency-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Soldier martyred in DI Khan counter-insurgency operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement.
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/150848327439f16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961083/fixing-the-water-crisis-in-karachi-with-lining-work' target='_blank'><strong>Fixing the water crisis in Karachi with lining work</strong></a><br><p>After achieving 30 per cent progress in lining the Kalri Baghar (KB) Feeder Upper lining project last year, work was all set to resume from Dec 20 this year. The work will begin during the annual closure of Kotri Barrage. The barrage feeds an offtaking canal, the KB Feeder, which then fills the Keenjhar Lake — a principal source of urban water usage for Sindh’s capital city.
Usually, there is a fifteen-day closure for the maintenance of the barrage and its four canals during winter, ie from Dec 25 to Jan 10. However, considering the importance of lining the KB Feeder, the closure will be extended to 25 days, as far as the KB Feeder is concerned. The canal will be closed for five days before the scheduled closure and will be opened for regular operations five days later, according to project management.
The KB Feeder Lining project was part of the larger K-IV project that was to ensure the required water needs of Karachi from Kotri Barrage. The lining project was being executed on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis by the federal and Sindh governments after having been approved by the Centre. Project officials, including Project Director Ghulam Mohiuddin, pointed out that this year’s lining work will take the overall physical progress to 75–80 per cent completion. The project was divided into three packages for lining.
Due to new rate schedules, the project cost will stand at around Rs50 billion — up by Rs10bn — after revision (currently pending) is approved. The first cost as per PC-I was approved at Rs39.94bn by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council in July 2023.

Though lining barrages will offer some relief to Karachi’s water crisis, permanent resolution is only possible if extension plans at the water source are set in motion

Karachi needs a quantum of 2,400 cusecs of water as agreed by the federal government at the time of the Water Apportionment Accord 1991. The Sindh government had approached the federal government with a request that the 2,400 cusecs of water for Karachi should be made available for the metropolis exclusively out of the ‘national pool’; the issue is pending before the Council of Common Interests. It was also discussed with the Indus River System Authority, which ensures interprovincial water distribution.
The present execution of the KB Feeder Upper’s lining project will ensure a conservation of 500-550 cusecs of water in Phase I. Subsequently, Phase II of the lining of two non-perennial canals of the Kotri barrage, ie Pinyari and New Phulelli, is supposed to be initiated. This would ensure conservation of 700 cusecs of water, leading to a cumulative saving of 1,200 cusecs, and would meet the actual needs of Karachi, ie 2,400 cusecs.
The lining project was being executed by the Sindh irrigation department. Mr Mohiuddin noted that the KB Feeder gets a discharge of 9,000 cusecs, by and large, from Kotri Barrage, inclusive of Karachi’s 1,200 cusec requirement. Once the lining under Phase-I is completed, the barrage will be in a position to save 500-550 cusecs of water that would eventually be diverted to Karachi.
The KB Feeder is a perennial canal that also caters to the agricultural needs of the Thatta and Jamshoro districts before it ends up in Keenjhar Lake in the Thatta district. The Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation lifts water from the lake through the Keenjhar-Gujjo canal for its water supply system to meet the drinking water needs of Karachi’s burgeoning population.
The bigger K-IV, or Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, has been under progress since 2011 by the Water and Power Development Authority at a cost of Rs126bn. It aims to provide 650 million gallons per day (MGD) of water to Karachi from Keenjhar Lake in two phases, ie 260 MGD in Phase I and 390 MGD in Phase II. During a recent visit to the K-IV site, the Wapda chairman promised its completion sometime in 2026 while linking it with timely funds’ releases under the project.
The Indus River remains the principal source of drinking water supplies to Karachi from Kotri Barrage. The barrage itself lies at the tail-end system of the Indus River System and often faces unprecedented shortages. Surplus flows, if any, are seen only during monsoon season. But shortages quite evidently and invariably remain 70–80pc in the April-May period, undermining Kharif crops’ cultivation even in perennial canals’ command areas.
According to World Urbanisation Prospects 2025, released by the United Nations and reported last month, Karachi is set to become one of the 10 largest cities in the world between 2025 and 2030, with rapid population growth expected to continue through the mid-century. The metropolis could stand as the fifth largest with a projected population of almost 33m by 2050.
Considering the city’s drinking water needs, a separate scheme for ‘Extension of the Keenjhar Lake’ in addition to lining works is being planned. This scheme has been worked out at a total cost of Rs170bn and was forwarded to the Ministry of Water Resources after having been okayed by the Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) in March this year for inclusion in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
“The [Keenjhar] lake must have a backup support system for meeting 2,400 cusecs of dependable water supplies to Karachi. This can only be achieved when Keenjhar Lake is expanded,” said retired chief engineer, Haji Khan Jamali. He last served as Kotri Barrage’s Chief Engineer. According to him, the Kotri barrage remains under stress during and after the December period.
“The lining works of KB Feeder Upper, New Phulelli and Pinyari will definitely ensure conservation of water, but we should not lose sight of the fact that the last two non-perennial canals that run for six months of the summer season don’t get the required quantum over the rest of the period; therefore, without enhancing Keenjhar Lake’s capacity, somewhat reliable supplies for Karachi will remain a tricky affair,” Jamali said.
According to the concept paper of the lake’s extension plan, a continuous supply of 1,200 cusecs depletes the lake to a dead level (RL44) in 55 days without inflow. With an inflow of 600 cusecs, it hits dead level in 105 days. Keenjhar Lake has a live storage of 0.429 MAF currently.
However, the K-IV execution that includes an additional 1,200 cusecs supply (as mentioned above) would take the total quantum of water to 2,400 cusecs, which means that the lake would hit dead level within 28-60 days, thus posing a threat to its sustainability. Therefore, “augmentation of Keenjhar Lake is imperative to maintain storage levels and ensure a sustainable water supply to Karachi”, according to the scheme’s concept.
