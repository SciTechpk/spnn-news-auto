Punjab is facing an unprecedented flood emergency due to a combination of heavy rains and India’s decision to release water from two dams. Both countries have been ravaged by intense monsoon rains and flooding in recent weeks.

What we know so far:

Two headworks at Chenab, one each at Ravi and Sutlej in ‘exceptionally high flood’
Another point in Chenab in ‘very high’ flood, while 5 headworks on Indus River see ‘low’ flood
PM orders ministers to visit affected districts
PDMA says over 20,000 evacuated from areas along Chenab, Ravi
Sialkot breaks 49-year rain record; more showers expected across Punjab


The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said late on Tuesday that India had opened all the gates of its Thein Dam on the Ravi River. The announcement came a day after Pakistan received a second warning from India that it intended to release water from the rapidly filling Madhopur Dam, Reuters reported. Both dams are located on the Ravi River, which flows from Indian Punjab into Pakistan.
At the same time, heavy rains in the upper catchment areas of the Chenab River have swollen downstream flows, placing thousands of citizens at risk.
As of 10am, Chenab at the Marala and Khanki headworks, Ravi at Jassar, and Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala were in an “exceptionally high flood” condition, according to the data by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD).
Marala and Jassar had already been declared as facing exceptionally high flood at 2am.
The water outflows at Khanki were recorded at over 975,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs) and were rising, while the outflows at Marala exceeded 600,000 cusecs and were declining.
The outflow at Jassar and Ganda Singh Wala were over 200,000 cusecs, with a falling trend in the former and a “steady” flow in the latter.
 


Qadirabad Headworks on the Chenab River was placed in the “very high flood” category, with over 500,000 cusecs of “rising” outflows.
The headworks of Chashma, Taunsa, Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri on the Indus River were in “low” flood as of the last update at 6am. Islam Headworks on the Sutlej River was also in low flood at 10am.
In view of the risky situation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued special directives to the federal ministers to visit the affected areas in Punjab and monitor the relief operations, the government said on X.
The premier also ordered National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik to remain in contact with the Punjab PDMA and provide full assistance in evacuating people to safe locations.
“Relief operations should be further accelerated, and coordination between institutions should be intensified. The process of immediately relocating people living along river passages to safe locations should be made more effective and swift,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
 






According to a spokesperson for the Punjab Home Department, the army has been requisitioned in Lahore, Faisalabad, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal and Okara districts to support district administrations in protecting lives and property.
The decision was taken after local administrations formally requested the immediate deployment of troops.
In a post on X, state-run PTV News said the army was carrying out rescue and relief operations in Lahore, Faisalabad, Okara, Kasur, Sialkot and Narowal since last night.
 






Over 20,000 evacuated so far from areas along Chenab, Ravi: PDMA
Speaking to the media this morning, Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said 20,000 to 25,000 people had already been evacuated from the flood plains of Chenab and Ravi.
He highlighted that all relevant institutions, including rescue teams and district administrations, have been alerted as per the directives of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
He cautioned that the high flood in Ravi at Jassar was expected to pass through Lahore and Shahdara tonight between 10pm and 12am, while it is expected to pass through Balloki Headworks at 9am tomorrow.
 


DG Kathia pointed out that the last time such a huge flow of water was seen was nearly 38 to 39 years ago. In 1988, 346,000 cusecs of water were recorded, while in 1994 and 1995, 132,000 and 171,000 cusecs were recorded, the PDMA DG said.
“But now we’re expecting that the water will be between 180,000 and 190,000 cusecs,” he said, adding that since Shahdara has a capacity of 250,000, it is expected to pass safely without major losses.
More rain expected across Punjab as Sialkot breaks 49-year record
In an update at 11am, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said rain with strong winds and thunderstorms was likely to continue in Narowal, Sialkot, Lahore, Kasur, Jhelum, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujarat, Sheikhupura, Azad Kashmir and surrounding areas in the next one to three hours.
The PMD advised the public to take precautionary measures and stay updated.
 






In the last 24 hours till 9am, Sialkot witnessed the highest amount of rainfall in the last 49 years, the PMD said.
During the 24-hour period, the city recorded 363.5 millimetres of rain, surpassing 339.7mm it received on Aug 6, 1976, the PMD added.

Weather officials forecast more rain and thunderstorms with gusty winds for the mountainous region of Ladakh, while heavy rain is set to lash the occupied Jammu and Kashmir territory.
Authorities were battling to restore telecom services as communication was “almost nonexistent”, said Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
Tuesday’s landslide near the shrine of Vaishno Devi on the pilgrims’ route killed at least 30 people, said ANI, in which Reuters holds a minor stake.
It was the latest havoc from downpours in the Himalayan region that killed 60 people, with 200 missing in Kishtwar in occupied Kashmir last week.
Authorities also ordered the closure of educational institutions in held Jammu, which weather officials said was deluged with 368 millimetres of rain on Tuesday.
The rivers Tawi, Chenab, and Basantar overflowed beyond their alert levels, causing floods in low-lying areas, held Jammu district official Rakesh Kumar told reporters.
Television images showed vehicles falling into a big hole after a bridge collapsed on the Tawi river, while some highways linking occupied Jammu to the rest of India were also damaged.
Pakistan has also grappled with monsoon rains in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, Islamabad said Punjab faced a “very high to exceptionally high” danger of flooding from a combination of heavy rains and India’s decision to release water from two dams.
The number of displaced in the province now exceeds 150,000, including nearly 35,000 who left voluntarily after flood warnings triggered by heavy rain since August 14, officials said.</p><small>2025-08-27 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/27105036f9bc2de.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937550/swiatek-sinner-cruise-as-expanded-us-open-serves-up-tennis-feast' target='_blank'><strong>Swiatek, Sinner cruise as expanded US Open serves up tennis feast</strong></a><br><p>Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner showed their championship pedigree at the US Open on Tuesday with commanding displays at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, walloping their first-round opponents on the third day of first-round action at the newly expanded major.
Wimbledon champion Swiatek arrived in pristine form after capturing the Cincinnati title and made quick work of Emiliana Arango 6-1 6-2 in just an hour, never facing a break point.
The 2022 winner acknowledged the unique challenge of New York’s atmosphere afterwards.
“Every year is tough, because New York is just so loud, and it’s hard to find that balance off the court,” she said.

“But I’ve got to say I’m probably good at it compared to other players, so I’m really trying to be in my bubble.”

She next plays the Netherlands’ Suzan Lamens.
Top-ranked defending men’s champion Sinner followed suit with an equally dominant performance, swatting aside Czech Vit Kopriva 6-1 6-1 6-2.
 






The Italian, who had entered last year’s tournament under the dark cloud of a doping controversy after escaping a ban despite failing two drug tests, enjoyed strong crowd support as he set up a second-round meeting with Australian Alexei Popyrin.
With both day matches wrapping up in well under three hours, organisers moved 21st seed Linda Noskova’s clash with Hungary’s Dalma Galfi to the main stadium, where the Czech prevailed 6-4 7-5.
Red ‘night outfit’
Coco Gauff had a tougher time, needing three sets to overcome Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic 6-4 6-7(2) 7-5 in the evening session on Ashe after dropping her opening service game and hitting consecutive double faults while serving at 5-4 in the decider.
The American, who recently split with mentor Matt Daly and hired biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan to address service issues, remained philosophical about her ongoing struggles.
 






“Honestly, it’s been really tough,” she said. “One of the days was mentally exhausting, but I’m trying. I mean, (my serve) wasn’t the best today, but … it came in when it mattered.
“It’s an improvement from last week. I’m just trying to improve with each match.”
Next up for Gauff is Paris Olympics silver medallist Donna Vekic.
Twice former champion Naomi Osaka dismantled Belgium’s Greet Minnen 6-3 6-4 while sporting a crystal-encrusted red Nike outfit.
“I just thought it would be really fun to do a New York under the lights,” Osaka explained of her custom ensemble.
“This is my night outfit, so hopefully I’ll wear my day outfit next time.”
 






Elsewhere, 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti outlasted big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7(3) 6-3 6-4 6-4 at the Louis Armstrong Stadium and will face Belgian David Goffin, while American eighth seed Amanda Anisimova rolled past Australian Kimberly Birrell 6-3 6-2.
After Daniil Medvedev’s chaotic exit on Sunday, Marin Cilic became the latest former champion to be knocked out as 23rd seed Alexander Bublik beat the Croat 6-4 6-1 6-4 on Grandstand, while US 14th seed Tommy Paul made short work of Denmark’s Elmer Moller 6-3 6-3 6-1 to book a second-round clash with Portugal’s Nuno Borges.
Third seed Alexander Zverev closed out the evening’s action on the main showcourt by beating Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo 6-2 7-6(4) 6-4 to set up a meeting with Briton Jacob Fearnley.</p><small>2025-08-27 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68ae38b2a0f09.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937461/disease-outbreaks-feared-in-karachi-as-stagnant-water-turns-toxic' target='_blank'><strong>Disease outbreaks feared in Karachi as stagnant water turns toxic</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: As dense clouds continue to dominate the city’s skies following recent monsoon devastation, health experts and senior environmentalists have urged the authorities to speed up the process of clearing standing water and lifting solid waste before the next spell to minimise the threat of disease outbreaks.
They also stressed the need to prioritise regular cleaning of storm water drains and rainwater harvesting in ways that help replenish depleting groundwater resources and minimise the threat of urban flooding.
“There is a high risk for the spread of vector and water-borne diseases this year, given the high intensity of rains we have just experienced. We must try to utilise the brief time available right now before the next spell hits as pools of standing water will soon turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes,” shared Dr Imran Sarwar, who heads the emergency department of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
He added that generally cases of gastroenteritis, malaria and dengue see a sharp increase soon after the rains, especially during this season.

Overflowing gutters, pools of standing water, heaps of garbage fast becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes, experts warn

At the moment, Dr Sarwar pointed out, most patients reporting at the emergency department suffered from viral infections. “But, this pattern is likely to change in the coming days, as happens every year during and after the monsoon.”
Sharing his clinical observations, Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, Medical Superintendent at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre, said the vector and water-borne diseases constituted 30 to 40 percent of the patient load.
 
 

“The threat of water and vector-borne diseases must not be taken lightly as these diseases can kill, if complications occur. All age-groups are affected,” he said, adding that the city’s infrastructure was fragile and citizens shared the responsibility with the state to contribute towards making their neighborhoods livable.
Killing mosquitoes
Talking of solutions, Dr Waqar Ahmed at Karachi University’s Institute of Environmental Studies said that a small amount of oil, such as vegetable, neem or mineral or kerosene oil, added to the water where mosquitoes breed could kill these insects.
“This is an old traditional method. Unfortunately, most people have forgotten it. If citizens start doing so, there will be a sharp decline in mosquito population and cases of illnesses the insects cause,” he said, adding that the method didn’t cause any harm to the environment because the oil used was in too small a quantity.
Dr Ahmed also suggested that rainwater could also be used to replenish underground water resources with rain.
“If we could collect rainwater on the roofs and then direct it into boring channels going inside the ground, we could help recharge our reservoirs,” he explained, regretting that growing concretisation of the city had left limited unpaved spaces for replenishment of underground water.
The city authorities, he stressed, should also think and plan for rainwater harvesting, and make it mandatory on new buildings to have this mechanism.
“This will also help minimise urban flooding. The other strategy is ensuring regular cleaning of storm water drains and removing encroachments over them,” he said.

According to sources, the matter came under detailed discussion at the recent meeting of the Board of Governors (BoG), which lasted nearly three hours, Dawn has learnt.
PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi also attended the session for about 15 to 20 minutes. During the meeting, various departments of the PCB including International Cricket, High Performance Cen­tre, Legal Affairs and Women’s Cricket presented their reports to the BoG.
The members, sources said, voiced dissatisfaction over the performance of the men’s senior team, women’s team and Pakistan Shaheens, questioning the International Cricket department over the ongoing slump.
The department, in its response, pointed to the instability at the top level, noting that the board has worked under four chairmen in less than three years — from Ramiz Raja (2021-23) to Najam Sethi and Zaka Ashraf (both with six-month tenures in 2023-24) and now Mohsin Naqvi since February 2024. With each chairman bringing wholesale changes, captains, selectors and coaches have been reshuffled repeatedly, creating further uncertainty.
The department also highlighted that in 2021 the PCB had restricted bilateral Test series to just two matches. However, from the next ICC cycle beginning in 2027, the board has decided to revert to full home-and-away series comprising at least three Tests, three ODIs and three T20 Internationals.
While acknowledging the financial cost of this approach, officials said it was necessary to improve performance standards.
Another factor cited was the closure of the National Cricket Academy in recent years, which, according to the Inter­national department, adversely affected player development. The board has now decided that Pakistan Shaheens will regularly play series against major opponents, often alongside the senior team.
The High Performance Centre recommended that long-term appointments be made for captains, coaches and selectors to ensure continuity. It assured BoG members that all domestic academies would soon be fully operational, with positive results expected within a year. While offering to provide input on appointments, HPC officials stressed that the final decisions rested with the PCB chairman.

PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan questioned how a country facing economic hardships could afford such packages.
“Is the board free to fix salaries at its own discret­i­­on without seeking appro­­v­­al from anyone?” he asked.
The chairman directed the finance division to provide details of the matter in the next meeting, to be held today (Wednesday), along with a list of how many other chairmen in various institutions were drawing salaries in the hundreds of millions.
The PAC also reviewed an audit objection regarding the non-recovery of Rs1.66 billion from the Karachi Country Club.
 
 

Members recalled officials had assured the committee that the case had been decided in government’s favour, the land taken over, and payments cleared, but fresh claims contradicted those statements, with officials admitting the government never had possession of the land.
“This is a new story altogether. Previous­­ly, we were told not only that the land was secured and payments made, but even that future plans for the property were finalized. Now, the narrative has completely changed,” remar­ked committee member Kha­­waja Shiraz Mahmood.

• Gas levy funds to reduce power tariffs for all consumers
ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Tuesday approved a financial bailout for Pakistan Television (PTV), a recovery plan for Rs47 billion in outstanding petroleum levy from Cynergico Refinery, and the use of funds collected under the captive levy on gas to reduce electricity rates for all consumers.
The committee also gave the green light to the construction of the Multan to Rawalpindi oil pipeline in partnership with Azerbaijan and sanctioned Rs3 billion in relief for flood-affected families in Gilgit-Baltistan. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the meeting.
The captive levy, imposed as part of the government’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), applies to gas and RLNG supplies to captive power plants of industrial units.
Introduced on July 1 it began at 5pc above the notified tariff, with scheduled increases to 10pc from Aug 1, 15pc from Feb 1, 2026, and 20pc from Aug 1, 2026. An act of parliament mandated that revenue generated from this levy be used exclusively to lower electricity tariffs for all consumer categories.
Following the levy’s introduction, some influential business groups sought to channel the funds solely towards industrial sector electricity rates. However, the Power Division resisted, citing legal obligations under the Captive Levy Act to benefit all consumers.
Adjustment mechanism
The ECC upheld the Power Division’s stance and approved a monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism to pass on the benefits of the levy to all electricity consumers. Under the system, the Petroleum Division will remit collected levy funds to the Finance Division within two days after each month closes.
The Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) will calculate the relief amounts based on electricity sales data and forward recommendations to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), which will then incorporate the benefits into consumers’ bills with a two-month lag. For example, levy collected in January will be credited in March bills based on January consumption.
Recovery
On the issue of petroleum levy recovery, the ECC approved a framework to recover approximately Rs47.5bn from Cynergico PK Limited (CPL), which has defaulted on payments since 2019. Including late payment surcharges, CPL’s liability stands at about Rs60bn.
Despite financial difficulties, CPL has resisted settling even the principal amount. The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) mediated a settlement plan, under which CPL will pay roughly Rs1bn monthly to clear the outstanding dues. The Petroleum Division was authorised to sign the settlement deed and instructed to ensure strict adherence to the repayment terms.
PTV bailout
The ECC also sanctioned an Rs11bn bailout for Pakistan Television Corporation for the current fiscal year. This move follows the government’s decision to waive the PTV fee on electricity consumers from July 1, 2025. The waiver severely impacted PTV’s revenue, leaving it unable to meet staff salaries, pensions, and other liabilities. Under the bailout plan, the Finance Ministry will immediately release Rs3.8bn to cover the first quarter’s expenses, followed by Rs2.396bn for each of the remaining three quarters. This shifts the financial burden from electricity consumers to taxpayers.
Oil pipeline
In a significant move for energy infrastructure, the ECC approved the tariff framework for the Machike-Thallian-Tarrujabba white oil pipeline, a government-to-government project with Azerbaijan. The Frontier Works Organisation, Pakistan State Oil, and Azerbaijan’s Socar will establish a joint project company to manage the pipeline.
The Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) will set a transportation tariff in US dollars applicable to the entire route from Multan to Tarrujabba (near Peshawar). The agreement requires oil marketing companies to commit to minimum annual pipeline volumes, with shortfalls compensated through inland freight equalisation margins. The tariff model is designed for optimal pipeline utilisation under a “default mode of transportation.”
The Finance Ministry’s prior demand to rationalise payouts and reduce liabilities was overruled in favour of ensuring the pipeline’s timely launch, reflecting its strategic importance in strengthening bilateral ties between Pakistan and Azerbaijan.
Lastly, the ECC approved a Rs3bn relief package for flood-hit communities in Gilgit-Baltistan, aimed at providing tents, medicines, food, and other essential supplies. This humanitarian support was issued under the Prime Minister’s directives to assist those affected by recent heavy rains in the region.

Numerous studies have shown that those who are more aware of and better prepared for risks are likely to cope with disasters more effectively.
Yet, translating this simple truth into practice has proven extremely difficult for our successive governments. But pleasantly, many poorer countries have made substantial progress in risk governance since 2000.
According to the World Resilience Poll Index 2024, 74 per cent of Vietnamese respondents said they felt capable of protecting themselves from disasters, compared to only 31pc of Pakistanis. Even more concerning, the number of Pakistanis who reported having experienced a disaster rose from 11pc to 27pc over the past five years. This must have gone up in recent weeks.
 
 

The poll also reveals a remarkable level of public trust in Vietnam, a country that had expelled a superpower just 50 years ago. An impressive 84pc of its citizens said they believe their government cares about their well-being. In stark contrast, only 27pc of Pakistanis said the same. In other words, nearly two-thirds of Pakistanis believe their government does not care about them. No wonder Pakistan ranks among the bottom 10 countries on the Resilience Index.
Here’s another sobering comparison: the 2025 Chandler Good Government Index ranks Pakistan 109th of 120 countries, while Vietnam stands at 48th. On the sub-index titled ‘Government Helping People Rise’, Pakistan sinks to 115th place; Vietnam at 52nd. All other South Asian countries rank above us but below Vietnam. Widespread gender-based discriminations make half of our population vulnerable to disasters too. Think. On the Global Gender Gap Index 2025, we stand right at the bottom.

The spread of poverty and vulnerability is not a natural phenomenon; it is the outcome of deliberate public policy.

Access to mobile phones is critical — not only for accessing early warnings of coming disasters but also for reporting emergencies. According to the Mobile Gender Gap Report 2024, only 53pc of Pakistani women and girls have access to a mobile phone, compared to 86pc of men. The likelihood of owning a phone drops further among the poor due to rising poverty. The earlier Swat tragedy also proved that even where phones are available, our risk communication system failed entirely. It is fair, then, to demand accountability and to call for criminal charges where negligence amounts to manslaughter.
The ongoing disaster is likely to deteriorate our ranking on most indices.
Another layer of vulnerability is illiteracy. Those who are uneducated are less likely to understand disaster warnings and emergency communications. A 2023 study conducted by Pattan and Clear Global in Sindh and south Punjab in the aftermath of the 2022 super floods found that over 90pc of participants could not understand the awareness material including pictorial ones.
One woman in a focus group held in Rojhan said angrily, “Our feudal lords didn’t support us when we needed them the most. I wish I could hit them with my shoes when they come to ask for our votes.” Another flood-affected man stated, “State officials serve the feudal lords, just like we do. They never visit us, but they regularly visit each other.”
The spread of poverty and vulnerability is not a natural phenomenon; it is the outcome of deliberate public policy. A recent World Bank report found that nearly 45pc of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line. By the end of this ongoing colossal disaster, 45 may become 50. Research by the UN, World Bank and Asian Development Bank has consistently found a strong link between poor governance and high levels of poverty, hunger, marginalisation and gender disparity. And often it is deliberate.
The comparison between Pakistan and Vietnam makes this painfully clear. Vietnam is not a democracy in the conventional sense. It has been ruled by a single Communist Party for over five decades, without free elections or independent media. What makes this difference?
 
 

As stated above, most of its citizens believe that their government cares for them. In contrast, more than two-thirds of Pakistanis believe their government is indifferent or even hostile to their needs. Unlike Vietnam, Pakistan holds general elections. Though rigged, its media is ‘free’ to make authorities accountable. It has more than 200 political parties. Logically, one would expect good governance in Pakistan. Shamefully, it’s the opposite, because a callous super elite has captured our country thoroughly. We are not alone. Though India hasn’t been captured by elite, it is too trailing behind China and Vietnam on many counts.
In a 2013 op-ed ‘Why Is India Trailing China?’, Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen observed that “China has done more than India to raise life expectancy, expand education, and secure health care for its people”. So, what motivates rulers of China and Vietnam, and what prevents governments in India and Pakistan from doing the same? It appears revolutions emanate from a prolonged struggle creating a responsible leadership, while liberal democracies in the Global South have been comprehensively captured by corrupt elites whose focus is just to amass wealth.
Lastly, the National Disaster Management Act, 2010, obligates the National Disaster Management Commission to meet once in a year. Besides some ministers it consists of the prime minister, leaders of opposition in the Senate and National Assembly and all provincial chief ministers.
Since its creation it has met only thrice. It also requires the establishment of disaster management authorities at the local and district levels. It failed on this count too. Hence, we have a military-led NDMA without oversight. Meanwhile, donors and UN agencies, in the name of ‘partnership’, have made NGOs effectively subservient to state authorities. The result: there is no sustained or organised system of accountability for those responsible for disaster risk reduction/management.
From being the ‘sick man of South Asia’, Pakistan now risks becoming the ‘sick man of the Global South’. Let’s act to end the inaction.

His trip to India, Pakistan and Afghanistan reinforced China’s pivotal role in the emerging global power dynamics.
While it reaffirmed China’s close strategic ties with Pakistan, Wang Yi’s visit to India also signified improvement in relations with the latter country. His day trip to Kabul marked Beijing’s efforts towards regional cooperation and connectivity.
The visit assumes greater significance in view of the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, which heightened tensions in the region, and the breakdown in New Delhi’s strategic relations with Washington, driven by President Donald Trump’s tariff war. The latest development has dramatically changed regional power dynamics, highlighting China’s central role in propelling the shift towards a multipolar world order. Being a major global investor and trading partner, it is reshaping global trade dynamics.
 
 

Although Wang Yi did not make any specific comment about the India-Pakistan conflict, he stressed the need for increasing regional cooperation. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he emphasised that China’s partnerships with both India and Pakistan “were not targeted at any third party, nor were they affected by any third party”. The Chinese foreign minister described Islamabad as the “most important stop”, underscoring a “stronger internal drive” behind Pak-China ties.
During his three-day stay in Islamabad, the Chinese foreign minister co-chaired the Pak-China Strategic Dialogue, besides meeting the top Pakistani civil and military leadership. The dialogue reportedly reviewed the entire spectrum of the relationship between the two countries — from defence to connectivity and economic cooperation. While close cooperation in defence has been the hallmark of Pakistan and China’s long-standing strategic partnership over the years, the economic dimension has become equally important.
Whereas Pakistan’s success in the four-day conflict against India owes, to a large extent, to the defence cooperation with China, support from its all-weather friend has also helped keep this country financially afloat. China has become the biggest investor in Pakistan with its multibillion-dollar projects under CPEC. The Islamabad dialogue also discussed the second phase of CPEC, widening the scope of the project to agriculture, mining and industrial production.
There may be some questions in Beijing over the warming of relations between Islamabad and Washington and the increasing security cooperation between them, but there is no sign of the development affecting the strategic alliance between China and Pakistan.
 
 

Despite its ongoing trade war with the US, it is not a zero-sum game for China. Soon after his highly publicised luncheon meeting with President Trump at the White House in June, the army chief flew to Beijing where discussions on developments in the regional and global political landscape were on the agenda.
There seems to be a clear understanding in Beijing about the transactional nature of the new ties between Islamabad and Washington and that it would not in any way impact its strategic partnership with Pakistan. But we need to be careful as we try to balance these two relationships. It’s extremely useful to have good relations with the most powerful country in the world, but one has to be cautious about the ‘business deals’ given Trump’s impetuousness and unpredictable policy approach.
There are, however, some irritants in Pak-China relations that need to be resolved. A major concern for Beijing is the deteriorating security situation and the targeting of Chinese nationals working on various CPEC projects in Balochistan and KP by militants fighting the Pakistani state. Chinese officials have often publicly spoken about their concerns. It’s extremely important to address the security concerns, particularly as Islamabad negotiates the next CPEC phase. There is huge potential for Pakistan to expand its bilateral trade with China but for that, there needs to be a clear and long-term policy.
Before coming to Pakistan, the Chinese foreign minister spent three days in New Delhi meeting senior government officials. It was the first visit by a top Chinese diplomat to India in three years amid a thaw in icy relations between the world’s two most populous nations. The shift in India’s stance came after growing acrimony with the Trump administration in the tariff face-off.

Pak-China relations have not been affected by Islamabad’s improved ties with Washington.

In the latter instance, tensions between the two allies have taken a vicious political turn, with Trump slapping a 50 per cent tariff on all Indian exports to the US. India is now among the countries subjected to the highest US tariff rates. Interestingly, 25pc of the tariff is on account of India’s import of Russian oil.
 
 

There have been other political reasons behind Trump’s ire as well, including India’s refusal to acknowledge America’s role in mediating a ceasefire in its conflict with Pakistan. Cracks in its decades-long alliance with Washington are becoming visible, which is a major geopolitical setback for India, a key partner in the US-led anti-China coalition. Previous US administrations had projected India as a counterweight to China.
New Delhi is now moving to reset its foreign policy options by trying to mend fences with its rival. India’s foreign minister and national security adviser had earlier visited Beijing — before the Chinese minister came to New Delhi, where, setting aside protocol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Wang Yi, and also accepted the invitation to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to be held in China at the end of this month.
It will be the first visit of the Indian prime minister to China in seven years. It is being seen as India’s move to defuse the tension aggravated by border clashes between the two countries in 2020, soon after the Modi government annexed occupied Kashmir. The summit will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

Importantly, the conference will provide an opportunity for the leaders to hold meetings on the sidelines. According to some media reports, a meeting between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected, with Putin joining in.
The SCO conference has assumed great importance in view of the shifting sands of global politics. The forthcoming gathering of over 20 countries from Asia and the Middle East is being seen as a powerful show of Global South solidarity in the age of global disorder.

To resign or not to resign. To contest or not to contest by-elections. A majority decision was taken by the party’s political committee on Monday that it would contest polls for seats that have fallen vacant due to the disqualification of its lawmakers.
However, this had immediately invited the ire of Imran Khan’s sisters, who saw it as a betrayal of the PTI founder’s express instructions not to. But on Tuesday, when the decision was placed before Mr Khan for ratification, he merely returned it for further consideration.
 
 

The PTI’s political committee was directed to hold another debate on Tuesday evening on participation in by-elections. There was also the matter of the party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja’s surprise resignation, the reason for which was never fully given. That, too, was presented to Mr Khan, but he asked Mr Raja to continue as usual.
The political committee had not taken another decision when these words were being written, but that does not matter as Mr Khan still has the final say on the matter. One thing that Mr Khan seems particularly keen on is to see the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief, Mahmood Achakzai, as the National Assembly opposition leader. He was reported to have underlined this again on Tuesday. Apparently, some within the PTI leadership have had reservations regarding this choice.
It is speculated that this may have had something to do with Mr Achakzai having been traditionally antagonistic to powerful quarters. The only consolation offered by Mr Khan to this camp is that the recently disqualified PTI leaders of the opposition will continue to take all measures to challenge their disqualification; failing which, Mr Achakzai will be nominated for the role. Perhaps Mr Khan wants the establishment, too, to choose from these options.
A senior journalist suggested in a recent column that Mr Khan should take one of his famous U-turns and reach a settlement with his opponents. Yet, even though it seems that his party is on crutches, he is adamant about having his way. It is dizzying how many representatives the party appears to have accumulated, each of whom claims to be the ‘true spokesperson’ for Mr Khan.
 
 

On top of that, there are many factions within the party, and their ideas are often diametrically opposed to each other. It is amidst this chaos that the PTI still, somehow, manages to survive. It is a wonder that it does; a bigger wonder still that it remains unwilling to change despite all the trouble such chaos causes.
Can sheer willpower bring Mr Khan and his party out of their present predicament, though? It seems unlikely. And while unlikely does not mean impossible, it is certainly a very difficult path to tread.

• UN inquiry on violence halted due to paucity of funds
• Qatar awaits Israeli response to truce proposal
GENEVA: The United Nations insisted on Tuesday that Israel must not only investigate alleged unlawful killings in Gaza like the recent hospital strike that killed 20 people, including several journalists, but also ensure those probes yield results.
“There needs to be justice,” United Nations rights office (OHCHR) spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told reporters in Geneva, adding that the large number of media workers killed in the Gaza war “raises many, many questions about the targeting of journalists”.
His comments came after an Israeli strike on the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis on Monday killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, sparking an international outcry.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Israeli military claimed the two strikes that killed five journalists a day earlier were targeting a camera operated by Hamas.
An initial Israeli military inquiry claimed that its soldiers “identified a camera that was positioned by Hamas in the area of the Nasser Hospital” in the southern Gaza Strip, adding that they “operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera”.
However, the Reuters news agency pointed out that it and other news providers often deliver live video feeds to media outlets worldwide during major news events to show the scene from the ground in real time.
Reuters has frequently broadcast a feed from Nasser hospital during the Gaza war, and for the past several weeks had been delivering daily feeds from the hospital position that was hit.
On Monday, the Reuters live video feed from the hospital, which  ameraman Hussam al-Masri, a Reuters contractor, had been operating,  suddenly shut down at the moment of the initial strike. Masri was killed in the attack.
The journalists killed also included Mariam Abu Dagga, who freelanced  for the Associated Press and other outlets, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist who worked with several news organizations including Reuters, and Ahmed Abu Aziz.
At least 278 journalists, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in Israel’s war on Gaza over the past 22 months, according to Al Jazeera.
“The Israeli authorities have, in the past, announced investigations in such killings… but these investigations need to yield results,” Kheetan said.
“We haven’t seen results or accountability measures yet. We have yet to see the results of these investigations, and we call for accountability and justice.”
Describing this as “a shock” and “unacceptable”, he said this incident and the killing of all civilians, including journalists, must be thoroughly and independently investigated, and justice must follow.
Probe stalled amid fund shortage
On the other hand, a document showed, a team of UN investigators tasked with researching cases of violence by Israeli settlers and the transfer of arms to Israel for use in the Gaza war could not complete their work due to financial constraints.
The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory can provide evidence of international crimes used in pre-trial investigations by tribunals like the International Criminal Court.
Last year, the council approved a request from Pakistan to research additional evidence on arms transfers to Israel in the context of the Gaza war and Israeli settler violence.
But Navi Pillay, who heads the inquiry, told the council’s president in a letter that a lack of funds meant it was unable to hire staff.
“The Commission has started informing the sponsors of the two resolutions that it will be unable to produce these mandated reports and present them to the Council in March 2026,” said Pillay, who has served as a judge at the ICC and is a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Qatar ‘still awaits’ Israeli response
Meanwhile, mediator Qatar said that it was “still waiting” for Israel’s response to a proposal for a truce and prisoners’ deal in the Palestinian territory after Hamas agreed to the framework more than a week ago.
Qatar and Egypt, along with the United States, who have been mediating indirect ceasefire negotiations throughout the Gaza war, but despite sealing two temporary truces, the successive rounds of talks have repeatedly failed to bring a lasting end to the conflict.
“We are still waiting for an answer” from Israel, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told a news conference on Tuesday, adding: “The statements that we are hearing right now do not fill us with confidence.”
“The responsibility now lies on the Israeli side to respond to an offer that is on the table,” he said, adding that Qatar did not see a “positive trajectory coming out of this escalation on the ground”.

Released on Tuesday, the UNHCR study says the contrast reveals both the fragile progress in reintegration over time and the urgent need for targeted development interventions to ensure that no one is left behind.
The UNHCR study says fragile but positive progress in reintegration of returnees from Pakistan. The large-scale return of Afghans from Pakistan, and now from Iran, has marked a new chapter for thousands of families seeking to rebuild their lives amidst uncertainty. But returning home is only the beginning — the real challenge lies in achieving meaningful reintegration, securing livelihoods, and restoring dignity.
According to the report, income gains and widening gender gaps for men both wages and employment improve the longer they spend in their area of return, because they transition from reliance on humanitarian assistance to labour-based income, and those better positioned, typically men, benefit more from emerging opportunities.
Women excluded from gains
Over time, some economic indicators suggest cautious progress: employment rates for returnees rise by 16 percentage points within six months of their return, possibly driven by increased daily wage labor as returnees become better connected with the local community and better in accessing labour market information. Men, experience these gains, with wages in male-headed households increasing by 7pc on average and employment rising from 53pc to 69pc.

Germany to resume entry of vulnerable Afghans after pressure

Women are excluded from these gains, with their wages declining and employment rates dropping, reinforcing gender inequalities. For women-headed households, income outcomes worsened significantly. Six months after return, women’s wages decline by 23pc, and their employment rate drops from 42pc to 39pc. This widening gender gap leaves women earning nearly 17pc lower than men, while also facing barriers to essential services, legal rights, and safety.
Alarmingly, women are cut off from vital support, services, and economic opportunities in other significant ways that extend far beyond employment, such as access to documentation and a mobile phone. Only 25pc women have access to a mobile phone, compared to 95pc men.
 
 

Similarly, one in five women lacks national identity documents, compared to just 5 per cent of men.
At the household level, despite men’s rising employment, debt and food insecurity increases, indicating that the income gains are insufficient to meet growing needs, repay debts, or cope with rising costs. This rise in debt and food insecurity is particularly evident in woman-headed or vulnerable households.
Berlin to allow Afghans’ entry
Meanwhile, Germany is set to end its months-long halt on the entry of vulnerable Afghan nationals it had pledged to admit, following mounting legal pressure at home and a deportation push by Pakistani authorities, Welt newspaper reported on Tuesday.
Around 2,000 Afghans approved for relocation to Germany under a programme for those deemed at risk under Taliban rule have been stranded in Pakistan for months, after Berlin froze the scheme amid a pledge to curb migration, adds Reuters.
Rights groups and dozens of affected Afghans challenged the freeze in courts, with some winning rulings that increased pressure on Berlin to act.
The urgency grew further as Pakistan moved to expel documented Afghan refugees ahead of a Sept 1 deadline, including those registered in Germany’s relocation programme.
According to the newspaper, citing government sources, the Afghan families are expected to arrive in the coming days on regular commercial flights with stopovers in Dubai or Istanbul.

While some progress has been made, major gaps persist, with people living in low-income countries, fragile contexts, rural communities, children and minority ethnic and indigenous groups face the greatest disparities, according to the report, “Progress on Household Drinking Water and Sanitation 2000-24”, published on Tuesday.
The report, with special focus on inequalities, says in 2024, 1.4 billion people lacked basic services, 287 million with limited services, and 302 million with unimproved services.
 
 

Since 2015, 961 million people have gained access to safely managed drinking water services. Coverage has increased from 68pc to 74pc. The number of people using surface water for drinking has decreased by 61 million, according to the report. In Pakistan, the least basic drinking water coverage in urban areas declined from 94pc to 93pc.
The number of people still lacking even a basic sanitation service decreased from 2.7bn to 1.5bn. In urban areas, 1.7 billion people gained safely managed services, with coverage increasing from under half of the population (48pc) to two thirds (66pc).

First introduced in the United States this year, the feature is now expanding globally, with Pakistan among the latest countries to gain access.
The tool, powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5, enables people to ask longer and more complex questions that previously required multiple searches. Available in English, AI Mode can be accessed via the Google app on Android and iOS, as well as on mobile and desktop web.
In a statement, Google said that early testers have shown that queries are already two to three times longer than traditional searches, highlighting the tool’s usefulness for exploratory tasks such as comparing products, planning trips, or tackling “how-to” questions.
“It dives deep to answer multiple questions at once, with helpful links for further exploration,” the company said.
Google explained that Pakistani users can use ‘AI Mode’ for different use cases, including “Planning a trip” by writing a prompt about a trip to any place at a particular time and seeking suggestions from the AI mode for a five-day itinerary that balances sightseeing, adventure and local food experiences, with a follow-up prompt: “Can you recommend some local food spots or traditional dishes in that particular area?”
At the same time, the other prompts could be related to the education of children, such as the example of a child in grade 9 struggling with math. “Can you suggest free online resources in Pakistan to help with algebra and geometry?” and the follow-up prompt like “Can you recommend interactive apps or YouTube channels for grade 9 math practice?”
 
 

Behind the scenes, AI Mode uses a “query fan-out” technique, breaking down a user’s question into subtopics and running multiple searches simultaneously.
This approach allows Google to surface highly relevant content from across the web, combining it with information from the Knowledge Graph and real-time shopping data for billions of products.
The feature is also multimodal, allowing users to interact through text, voice or images. For example, a photo of unfamiliar spices at a local market could be uploaded with the question: “What are these spices and how can I use them in Pakistani cooking?” Follow-up questions can then be asked in a conversational style, creating a seamless browsing experience.
Google said AI Mode is designed to deliver deeper, smarter and more comprehensive results, but acknowledged that, as with any early-stage AI system, responses may not always be accurate.

The study, titled “Unveiling exploitation and abuse in the brick kilns of Punjab”, was conducted in collaboration with the Pakistan Partnership Initiative.
The investigation highlighted systemic exploitation, gender-based violence, debt bondage, and widespread denial of basic labour rights to brick kiln workers.
The report was based on extensive field research in Faisalabad and Kasur — two of Punjab’s brick kiln hubs.  Surveys of 200 workers and in-depth interviews with 30 victims led to documented case studies. The study engaged trade unions, kiln owners, and officials from the Punjab Labour Department to provide a multi-stakeholder perspective.
Speaking at the launch event, NCHR Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said: “Today’s report follows months of fieldwork, interviews, and surveys identifying violence, exploitation, and abuse in Punjab’s brick kilns. It documents laws ignored, promises broken, and dignity denied.”
She said the NCHR had long been demanding reform in this most inhumane of sectors. “For all of us, ending bonded labour is not charity. It is not a favour. It is justice and human dignity. It is the fulfilment of our Constitution’s promise.”
Justice Jawad Hassan of the Lahore High Court, the chief guest, said the evolution of bonded labour from colonial bondage to constitutional protection showed progress, but the brick kiln horrors reminded of unfinished work.
“It is incumbent not just on the judiciary but also on the legislative and executive branches to work towards correcting these horrors and let this report ignite collective action for a Pakistan where no worker is bonded, and dignity prevails,” Justice Jawad Hassan said.
He called for legislative reforms, judicial and institutional strengthening and collaborative action to end this extreme form of exploitation.
Violation of Constitution
Abdul Khalique Shiekh, the Secretary, Ministry of Human Rights, said: “Bonded labour is a violation of our Constitution, our laws, and our commitments under international human rights treaties.”  He said the government had taken important steps to ensure that brick kiln workers live a life of dignity, citing amendments to labour laws, initiatives like the Elimination of Bonded Labour in brick kilns project  and efforts to regulate advances. “But we know more is needed.”
 
 

Abdul Khalique Shiekh said such studies were essential to show where gaps remained between law and enforcement, between policy and practice. “They remind us that passing laws is only the first step. Implementation is the true test of justice.”
Ashraf Wadhawa Mall, the PPI CEO, said the study had exposed the extreme conditions faced by brick kiln workers. He said so far 2,339 families from brick kilns across the country had been rescued and rehabilitated.
The study documents extreme abuses ranging from verbal and physical harassment to cases of abduction and even murder. Women workers remained especially vulnerable, subjected to rampant sexual harassment, coercion, and forced marriages. Workers continued to labour in unsafe, unhygienic, and exploitative conditions under extreme weather, often receiving wages well below the legal minimum and having no access to social security.
The study showed that 97 per cent workers entered kilns because of urgent loans, 90pc had no written contracts, leaving them invisible to labour protection efforts and over 70pc of families lived in a single cramped room. It said 92pc workers reported verbal abuse, many described beatings, torture and even abductions.

The decision was taken on Tuesday at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti and attended by provincial Finance Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan, Principal Secretary Babar Khan and banking sector expe­rts. It reviewed an initial feasibility report for the project and declared it viable.
The chief minister dire­cted the officials concer­ned to prepare a comprehensive and operational plan within one week. “The Bank of Balochistan will be a revolutionary step aimed at providing high-quality and accessible banking services to the business community, traders, industrialists, investors and common people,” Mr Bugti said.
He added that the initiative would not only boost economic activity but also generate employment opp­o­r­t­unities for the youth. “The Bank of Balochistan will prove to be a milestone in stabilising the provincial economy and will accelerate development projects by utilising local resources,” he said.
 
 

Mr Bugti assured the public that they would soon receive good news regarding the project, saying the bank would initially meet provincial needs but could also play a role at the national level in future.
Banking experts, who joined the meeting via video link, stressed the importance of the decision, saying the establishment of a provincial bank would make financial resources available for development projects.
The idea of setting up the Bank of Balochistan was first announced in the provincial budget for fiscal year 2007-08 by then finance minister Syed Ehsan Shah during the coalition government of Nawab Aslam Khan Raisani. In the 2017-18 budget, then finance minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi allocated Rs10 billion for the project, but it did not materialise for unspecified reasons.

Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) Chief Exec­utive Officer Babir Sahib Din told Dawn that all residential and commercial property owners in Lahore’s upscale localities, including Gulberg, Johar Town, Muslim Town, New Mus­lim Town, Shadman, Faisal Town, Garden Town, Upper Mall Scheme, and the localities facing the Canal Road, Mall Road, and Jail Road will receive their bills next month.
Private housing schemes are exempt, however, because they have their own disposal system. “This was in the works for long and finally the government decided to impose a clea­n­liness fee in a bid to ensure excellent cleanliness in all area­s, starting from the posh ones in the first phase,” he revealed.
Penalty
The proposal to introduce a cleanliness fee regime had been approved by the Punjab cabinet in a meeting held a few months ago after the launch of the Suthra Punjab Progra­mme. However, its implementation across the province may take up to two months.

Defaulters to face hefty fines, even FIRs for littering

An LWMC spokesperson said that those people who failed to pay their bills will have their waste disposal service cancelled after two months. Besides, they could face hefty fines and FIRs if they were found dumping their waste illegally, he said.
Fee categories
Under this regime, Rs300 per month fee has been fixed for a five-marla house, Rs500 for up to 10-marla, Rs1,000 fee for the houses measuring one kanal and above.
Likewise, Rs500 to Rs3,000 cleanliness fee has been fixed for business premises according to nature and volume of the business. Rs200 fee has been suggested for houses in rural areas.
Mr Din said people in the posh localities of other districts, including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Sahiwal, Faisalabad, and Sargo­dha, would also receive cleanliness bills for August in the coming days.
He said these neighbourhoods would be declared ‘zero-waste’ areas, so the government would impose fines in case anyone was found littering. “
Our enforcement inspectors and their staff will start making rounds of these localities very soon. And if they found anyone littering, a fine would immediately be imposed on such people,” he warned, requesting the people to refrain from such acts.
He said the core objective behind the introduction of the cleanliness regime was not only to make the waste management system sustainable but also to create a sense of ownership among the public at large.

• Jailed founder refuses to accept Salman Akram Raja’s resignation; throws his weight behind Achakzai as potential replacement for NA opposition leader
ISLAMABAD: Changing its mind once again, the PTI has decided to boycott the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assemblies, in line with the opinion of its incarcerated leader, Imran Khan.
The decision was taken by the party’s political committee, which met to consider Mr Khan’s input following a meeting with his legal team at Adiala Jail on Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, Mr Khan’s message was relayed to the media by his sister, Aleema Khan, who also met Mr Khan in prison.
She was flanked by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — whose resignation was reportedly turned down by the incarcerated former PM.
Denying reports of a bitter exchange with Mr Raja, she said the lawyer was “like family” to them. She said her brother had asked the party’s political committee to hold another meeting on the by-election issue based on his instructions, and report back to him.
Later on Tuesday night, PTI MNA Amir Dogar confirmed that the political committee had endorsed Imran Khan’s opinion on not contesting by-elections, adding that party lawmakers would also start quitting parliamentary bodies soon.
Imran’s view
Talking about nominations to appoint new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, Salman Akram Raja said that for them, Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were still the opposition leaders, adding that they were still contesting their cases and would fulfil all legal requirements.
 
 

“If there is a need after that, then the name that Imran has repeated today for the NA opposition leader is that of Mehmood Khan Achakzai,” he said.
Mr Raja explained that Imran gave his “clear directions” about participating in the by-polls after listening to all those allowed to meet him today, including his sisters.
A day earlier, the party’s political committee had voted 12-9 to take part in the by-elections. Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram had even tweeted that candidates would be given Sunni Ittehad Council tickets to avoid the chances of their being declared ‘independents’.
According to insiders, Sheikh Waqqas Akram, Salman Akram Raja, SIC leader Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Arif Alvi, Sajjad Burki, ex-GB CM Khalid Khursheed and some others were against the decision to take part in by-polls, while those in favour included Aliya Hamza, Sanaullah Mastikhel, Aamir Dogar, Farhat Abbas and others.
Talking to Dawn, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser confirmed that in Imran Khan’s opinion, the party should not go into by elections, and that its lawmakers should leave all parliamentary standing committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
“Parliament has already been made a rubber stamp, as the voice of the opposition members has been suppressed by not telecasting their remarks on the floor of the house. Secondly, after the passage of the 26th constitutional amendment, courts have come under immense pressure,” he added.
Mr Qaiser said that the jailed PTI founder had given his opinion, and asked the party’s political committee to review its decision.
“Imran Khan was of the view that the government will not let the PTI candidate to win by-elections… [and] if [we] take part in the elections, it will legitimise the government’s illegal action of de-seating PTI legislators,” he said. He, however, said the PTI will continue its street protests and continue to approach the courts to seek justice.
When contacted, Mustafa Nawaz Khaokhar – who is part of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance alongside the PTI – said there seemed to be two opinions in the party regarding by-elections, one suggesting that it should not legitimise the de-seating of its lawmakers, while the other was opposed to ceding political space.
He agreed that this was causing a visible rift in the PTI’s ranks, which had created disappointment in the party workers.
Commenting on the situation, political analyst Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said it was quite unfortunate that the decision taken by the party’s political committee to contest by-elections was reversed by jailed founder Imran Khan.
The PTI is more of a ‘one-man show’ than any other political party, he noted.
He also noted with irony that the party had decided, once again, to leave all parliamentary committees, especially the PAC. “This is the same act it committed when it left the National Assembly and ceded all provinces, where it was ruling, one by one,” he added.

The Trump administration said late last month that it would abolish a tax exemption on small packages entering the US from August 29.
The move has sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in France, Britain, Germany, Italy, India, Australia and Japan, that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.
The United Nations’ Universal Postal Union (UPU) said it had already been advised by 25 member countries that their postal operators “have suspended their outbound postal services to the US, citing uncertainties specifically related to transit services”.
It said the suspensions would remain in place until there was more clarity on how US authorities planned to implement the announced measures.
The UPU did not provide a list of postal services it had heard from.
‘Considerable operational changes’
The organisation, which was established in 1874 and counts 192 member states, warned that the new US measures would “entail considerable operational changes for postal operators around the world”.
From Friday, the UPU said the measures would require postal carriers delivering packages to the US “to collect customs duties from senders in advance”, on behalf of the US Customs and Border Protection agency.
India’s communications ministry said at the weekend that Trump’s executive order issued last month required transport carriers or other “qualified parties” approved by US authorities to collect and remit the tariff duties.
But “several critical processes relating to the designation of ‘qualified parties’ and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined,” it said in a statement.
Under the new US measures, individual customers will still be able to send documents and items worth up to $100 as presents to the country without being taxed.
But anything above that value is expected to be hit with the same tariff rates applied to other imports from the sending country.
That means 15 per cent for countries in the European Union and 50pc for India.
And Germany’s postal service DHL warned last week that even exempted items would be subject to extra checks to prevent the service from being used for commercial goods.
‘Sustainable solutions’
The UPU stressed that it was “taking all possible measures to prepare its member countries for the impacts [the new measures] may have on their postal flows”.
UPU chief Masahiko Metoki had sent a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday to convey member countries’ concern regarding the operational disruptions, it said.
Pointing to the short implementation timeline and voicing particular concern over the impact on the delivery of e-commerce items, the union said it was “working with the relevant US authorities to ensure that information on the operational requirements of the measures is communicated effectively to other member countries”.
In parallel, it said it was working with “relevant postal stakeholders” to help find sustainable solutions, including one initiative aimed at developing a system to facilitate duty collection and remittance across its network.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26203658b5b209b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937384/pakistan-iran-army-chiefs-affirm-readiness-to-eradicating-terrorism-for-secure-borders' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran army chiefs affirm readiness to eradicating terrorism for secure borders</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and his Iranian counterpart, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, affirmed their readiness on Tuesday to eradicate terrorism for securing the borders of both countries.
Pakistan and Iran, earlier this month, agreed that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combatting terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained ties.
A statement issued by the Iranian embassy said Field Marshal Munir and Gen Mousavi, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, held a telephonic conversation today.
“The two sides are ready to eradicate terrorism to secure common borderlines,” it read.
 






A statement carried by Iranian state news agency IRNA said Gen Mousavi mentioned that Iran was prepared to eradicate terrorism and secure its borders with Pakistan, pointing to growing cross-border movements of terrorist groups and calling for joint efforts to eliminate terrorism.
It added that Field Mashal Munir echoed the call for securing common borders, saying the two sides must “jointly turn the Pakistan-Iran border into a border of friendship, brotherhood, and economic development”.
“Field Marshal Munir expressed his gratitude for Mousavi’s sympathy for the Pakistani nation and expressed his condolences for the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan Province.”
Gen Mosavi also expressed his sympathy with the flood-affected victims in Pakistan, saying that “Iran would proudly provide any assistance within its power to dear brothers in Pakistan”.
He further expressed his satisfaction over bilateral ties, saying both countries were interacting and cooperating at various levels, particularly commending Pakistan’s stance and support for Iran during the 12-day war with Israel.
In his visit earlier this month,  Iranian Presi­dent Masoud Pezeshkian had said that development of economic and trade ties would be achieved through peace, stability and tranquillity.
“Given the threats from terrorist groups in border areas, both sides emphasised the need to increase cooperation to ensure border security and safeguard the peace and well-being of citizens in border cities,” the Iranian president had added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had acknowledged that security was paramount for progress in bilateral relations. “There will be zero tolerance for all forms of terrorism. If anyone falls victim to terrorism in Iran, it is the same as someone being affected by terrorism in Pakistan,” he had said.
“For peace and development in our region, and along our hundreds of kilometres-long shared border, we must cooperate against terrorism and take effective steps to eliminate the scourge of terrorism once and for all,” the PM had added.
While the two leaders voiced their commitment to deepening cooperation, specific operational details were reportedly discussed in President Pezeshkian’s meeting with Field Marshal Munir.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26202643291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937383/main-suspect-in-raiwind-murder-video-case-arrested-handed-over-to-ccd-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Main suspect in Raiwind murder video case arrested, handed over to CCD: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>The main suspect in the torture of two brothers by some street vendors in Raiwind has been arrested and handed over to the Crime Control Department (CCD), the lawyer of their father said on Tuesday.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in the Raiwind area a few days back. They were lying in a pool of blood, and the suspected attackers, holding clubs in their hands, were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father on August 22 at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
It said the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit. “Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.
He said he managed to free his sons after reaching the scene, accompanied by other people, adding that the suspects fled while uttering threats. The complainant urged action against the suspects.
The lawyer for the father, lawyer Ahmed Ali Awan, told Dawn.com today: “The main suspect has been handed over to CCD. He was arrested by the police today.”
He added that the second suspect was still in police custody and raids were underway to arrest the other suspects.
In June, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen after a video of the incident went viral on social media, prompting authorities to take notice of it.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26162512ba39807.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937371/9-ttp-terrorists-killed-so-far-in-joint-operation-in-kps-upper-dir-police' target='_blank'><strong>9 TTP terrorists killed so far in joint operation in KP’s Upper Dir: police</strong></a><br><p>Nine terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group have been killed in a joint operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Dir district, the police said on Tuesday.
A statement issued by Upper Dir District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Bilal said the police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted a targeted operation against the TTP in the district.
“Nine terrorists were killed in the operation that has been going on for three days, and the bodies of five were recovered,” he said, adding that 10 police personnel were injured in firing by terrorists and two locals were also killed.
The statement said the operation was carried out in adjoining areas within the limits of the Dir City Police Station based on credible information indicating the presence of elements of banned terrorist organisations.
“Dir Police is always ready to eliminate terrorism and protect the lives and property of the people, and is determined to make every kind of sacrifice. This operation will continue until the complete elimination of Fitna-al-Khawarij,” the DPO said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the police and the CTD for the operations, adding that he and the entire nation were proud of them.
 






Five security personnel and three civilians, including a two-year-old child, embraced martyrdom while several policemen sustained injuries as clashes between security forces and militants continued over the weekend and a day ago in various parts of KP. At least seven terrorists were also killed, officials and sources had said.
In Upper Dir and Lower Dir districts, officials and sources had said five suspected militants were killed and seven policemen injured late on Sunday night during fierce clashes between the security forces and the TTP. They said the exchange of fire in the Dobando area of Upper Dir continued for several hours. Two civilians from Hatnar Dara, caught in the crossfire, lost their lives.
A senior CTD official had told Dawn.com that the bodies of all five terrorists were in police custody. They might have links across the border in Afghanistan, he had said.
In Lower Dir’s Lajbook Dara area, heavy firing broke out between police and militants. Though no casualties were reported from this clash, tension gripped the area as the attackers torched police vehicles, including two pick-up trucks and a car, locals had said. Sharing the footage on social media, the outlawed TTP claimed they had “seized the vehicles and destroyed them”.
In July last year, the government designated the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past years, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.

An earlier version of this story erroneously mentioned Upper Dir as Lower Dir. The error has been rectified and is regretted.</p><small>2025-08-26 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2621544469f37e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937387/steep-us-tariffs-set-to-hit-indian-exports-from-wednesday' target='_blank'><strong>Steep US tariffs set to hit Indian exports from Wednesday</strong></a><br><p>Indian exporters are bracing for a sharp decline in orders from the United States after trade talks collapsed and Washington confirmed that steep new tariffs on the South Asian nation’s goods would take effect from Wednesday, escalating tension between the strategic partners.
An additional 25 per cent duty announced by President Donald Trump, confirmed in a notice by the Homeland Security Department, takes total tariffs to as much as 50pc, among Washington’s highest, in retaliation for New Delhi’s increased buying of Russian oil.
“The government has no hope for any immediate relief or delay in US tariffs,” said a commerce ministry official, who sought anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to the media.
 
 

Exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to alternative markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East, the official added.
However, the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the latest notice.
The new duties will apply from 12:01am EDT on Wednesday (9:31am IST), it showed. Exceptions are shipments in transit, humanitarian aid and items under reciprocal trade programmes.
The Indian rupee fell to a three-week closing low of 87.68 against the dollar, despite recovering some ground after suspected central bank intervention to support it.
The benchmark equity indexes closed down 1pc each, for their worst sessions in three months.
Wednesday’s tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks, during which Indian officials had signalled optimism that tariffs could be capped at 15pc.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgment and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose two-way trade is worth more than $190 billion.
 

The chart shows India’s monthly imports and export to US

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have accused India of indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine by boosting Russian oil purchases.
This month, Bessent said India was profiteering from its sharply increased imports, making up 42pc of total oil purchases, versus less than 1pc before the war, in a shift Washington has called unacceptable.
India has issued no directive yet on oil purchases from Russia. Companies will continue to buy oil on the basis of economics, three refining sources said.
Exporters seek aid
Exporter groups estimate hikes could affect nearly 55pc of India’s merchandise exports worth $87bn to the US, while benefiting competitors such as Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.
 

The table shows the sectors that get affected mainly from US tariffs on India and the total potential impact on trade numbers

“The US customers have already stopped new orders,” said Pankaj Chadha, president of the Engineering Exports Promotion Council. “With these additional tariffs, the exports could come down by 20-30pc from September onward.”
The government has promised financial aid such as greater subsidies on bank loans and support for diversification in the event of financial losses, Chadha added.
“However, exporters see limited scope for diversifying to other markets or selling in the domestic market.”
The commerce ministry official said the government had identified nearly 50 countries to which India could boost exports, particularly items such as textiles, food processed items, leather goods and marine products.
India’s diamond industry exports have already hit a two-decade low on weak Chinese demand, and the higher tariffs now threaten to cut it off from its largest market, taking nearly a third of $28.5bn annual shipments of gems and jewellery.

Broader economic impact
Private sector analysts warn that a sustained 50pc tariff could weigh on India’s economy and corporate profits, prompting the steepest earnings downgrades in Asia, even if proposed domestic tax cuts partly cushion the blow.
Last week, Capital Economics said full US tariffs would chip 0.8 percentage points from India’s economic growth both this year and the next.
Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar also said trade talks continued and Washington’s concern over Russian oil purchases was not equally applied to other major buyers such as China and the European Union.
The US could be a major energy supplier to India, an official of its New Delhi embassy said on Tuesday.
The US is committed to collaborating with India on exports of high-quality products and services to help achieve energy security and economic growth, the official added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to compromise the interests of Indian farmers, even if it entails a heavy price. Modi is also moving to burnish ties with China, planning his first visit there in seven years at the end of the month.</p><small>2025-08-26 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261159341c8649c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937333/engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-detained-under-mpo-also-booked-under-blasphemy-charges' target='_blank'><strong>Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza detained under MPO, also booked under blasphemy charges</strong></a><br><p>Jhelum police said on Tuesday that they have detained cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza for 30 days under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance for alleged controversial remarks and later booked him under blasphemy charges.
Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel.
Earlier today, Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meesam Abbas and District Police Officer (DPO) Ahmed Mohiyuddin confirmed Mirza’s arrest under MPO to Dawn.com.
Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
A religious group had yesterday filed an application, seen by Dawn.com, requesting legal action against Mirza for alleged controversial remarks made during an interview that “went viral on social media”.
Separately, a first information report (FIR) was registered at the Jhelum city police station on August 26 under Section 295 C (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (2016).
Mirza “has severely hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims by making blasphemous remarks”, the FIR read. The complainant said that legal action must be taken against Mirza under Section 295C of the blasphemy laws.
Mirza was also among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram last year to prevent any potential sectarian violence.
The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him.
The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-08-26 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261744017ee724a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937376/aleema-rejects-reports-of-tense-exchange-with-ptis-salman-akram-raja' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema rejects reports of tense exchange with PTI’s Salman Akram Raja</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, on Tuesday rejected rumours of a tense exchange with PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja that allegedly led to his decision to resign.
There seems to be a tug of war within the PTI over whether to participate in the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assembly seats — vacated after the recent disqualifications of a number of key lawmakers. Insiders had told Dawn the party’s political committee — in its meeting on Monday — had a change of heart after a majority of members voted against the decision to boycott by-polls. This contravenes the opinion reportedly expressed by Imran, transmitted by Aleema on a couple of occasions, to steer clear of by-elections so that the party isn’t seen as legitimising the process.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram had shared the party’s decision on social media and triggered a wave of criticism from across the globe. When approached, Akram confirmed that he, Raja and a few others were against the decision, but they had to go with the majority. In a dramatic turn of events, however, Raja announced his intention to step down from the post of secretary general. Although he did not specify what prompted him to take this decision, the timing of his X post indicated that the “incident” he referred to was — in all probability — the political committee’s decision to contest by-polls.
Questioned about reports of a tense exchange with him being the cause of his decision, Aleema said while talking to the media outside Adiala Jail today: “I had no bitter exchange of words with him. He is our lawyer and like a family [member] with all of us, but I think it is more so [a matter] of his own [decision] and that of the political committee. It is an issue [of participation] in the by-election and you should ask him (Raja).”
 


Pushed on the reports of a disagreement in the party over whether to contest the by-elections or not, Imran’s other sister, Uzma Khanum, interjected and said: “The party will tell what conflict it was. As per our last family meeting, Khan sahib very firmly, repeatedly and clearly said not to contest the elections but to boycott them because there will be no benefit, it will harm the party and the [movement] for actual freedom and the illegitimate disqualifications would be legitimised.”
Addressing the media later, Aleema said Imran had directed PTI lawmakers to resign from parliamentary committees and to inform him about the political committee’s decision regarding the by-elections tomorrow morning after holding a meeting later today on the issue based on his instructions.
Meanwhile, Raja said while talking to the media that Imran had not accepted his decision to resign.
He added that the political committee would have a meeting again today to discuss the issue of participating in the by-elections based on Imran’s “clear instructions”.
Raja further said that the PTI had a clear stance that Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were still the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, adding that they were still contesting their cases and would fulfil all legal requirements.
“If there is a need after that, then the name that Imran has repeated today for the NA opposition leader is that of Mehmood Khan Achakzai.”
 


Raja explained that Imran gave his “clear directions” about participating in the by-polls after listening to all those allowed to meet him today, including his sisters.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar said he had not read Raja’s statement on resigning as secretary general, nor had he received any resignation in writing.
“Imran will decide whether he decides to continue or not. It is unfortunate. I’ve always said that something always comes up from inside the party and people make it an issue. Imran said that no party leader would mention their resignation in public.”
 


The PTI has already obtained stay orders against the de-seating of key opposition leaders. It has also, albeit reluctantly, nominated replacements while the party pursues legal options.
But faced with threats on multiple fronts — including the possible loss of maj­o­rity in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly due to future disqualifications, a push to reclaim political space in Punjab, and a showdown between two opposing camps within the party — it seems as if the PTI may throw its hat in the ring, despite all misgivings about the by-elections. According to sources privy to proceedings, Monday’s meeting of the political committee had voted 12-9 in favour of fielding candidates for the upcoming by-elections.
Additionally, Akram had announced that all candidates would be issued tickets under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council, which appears to be an insurance policy of sorts, to offset chances of them being declared ‘independent candidates’, since the dispute around PTI’s intra-party elections and the matter of its electoral symbol are still in limbo.</p><small>2025-08-26 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26165117bcfea13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937353/many-areas-in-gbs-ghizer-cut-off-for-5th-day-as-gilgit-shandur-road-remains-blocked' target='_blank'><strong>Many areas in GB’s Ghizer cut off for 5th day as Gilgit-Shandur road remains blocked</strong></a><br><p>Several areas in Gilgit Baltistan’s (GB) Ghizer district have been cut off for five days, as preparations are underway to clear the Gilgit-Shandur road, authorities said on Tuesday.
Since late July, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country, especially in its northern regions like GB, by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to locals, majority of the areas in the Ghizer district, including Gupis, Phander, and Yasin tehsils, remained stranded for five days as five kilometres of the region’s main road were submerged by an artificial lake formed at Raushan  village in Ghizer.
Local resident Meraj Ali Shah told Dawn.com that 300 houses had been dama­ged by the glacial flood, with houses submerged due to artificial lake in Hakis, Thangi, and Raushan villages as they remained without basic necessities.
He added that hundreds of people had been displaced when a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) swept everything in Tildas village.
“They are living without electricity, drinking water, proper accommodation, medical facilities, [and] other basic needs,” he said.
Locals also complained of a lack of support from the government, adding that they had been dependent on relief items by welfare organisations.
Two patients in a critical condition were taken from Gupis to Gilgit on Monday through a helicopter belonging to the Aga Khan Development Network, as per the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat.
According to the locals, people affected in previous floods in Ghizer’s Khalti, Daen, Chatorkhand, Yasin, and other areas did not have access to roads, clean drinking water, and other necessities.
Since three weeks, the Karakoram Highway at Hassanabad Hunza could not be opened as it was blocked after a Glof from Shishper glacier submerged a portion of the thoroughfare, posing severe difficulties to Hassanabad’s residents. The Glof also damaged dozens of homes, farmland, and the area’s government and private infrastructure.
Residents in the Hisper valley of Nagar district have been disconnected for a month as the only accessible road was blocked owing to river erosion and landslides. Gilgil’s Haramosh and Bagrot valleys have also remained disconnected.

Locals said the water supply systems to areas populated by thousands of people, including Gilgit’s Danyor, Sultanabad, and Mohammadabad have remained suspended, adding that they had to purchase water tankers daily, which the poor could not afford.
“For the last month, people in the populated areas have faced a severe water shortage,” said a local resident Shahzad Hussain.
Furthermore, according to the locals, the crops and trees have dried up due to the unavailability of irrigation water supply systems.
A local, Muhammad Alam, told Dawn.com that flood-affected people in Mashabrum sub-division of Ghanche district in Baltistan are currently living in difficult circumstances. “Above sixty households in Ghanche district, including Haldi and Balayagan villages displaced in flood have taken shelter in tents under the open sky and are waiting for the government’s assistance.”
Unfortunately, locals said, no concrete steps have been taken by the government so far for their rehabilitation and redressal of their problems, due to which the victims have been plunged into severe difficulties and deprivation. Without basic facilities, they say they are forced to spend their days and nights in destitution and helplessness.

Furthermore, those traumatised by high intensity floods also complain of mental health issues, demanding mental rehabilitation.
According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the GB government, the affected people in the recent floods, especially children, women and the elderly, are suffering from mental and psychological problems.
In view of these challenges, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Arif Tahseen, the additional secretary of the GB department of social welfare. Senior officials of various government and private institutions participated to formulate a coordinated strategy for the mental and psychological rehabilitation of the victims.
In the meeting, it was agreed to work together to restore mental health among the people of the affected areas in collaboration with the GB Health Department, Aga Khan Health Service and Rupani Foundation.
On this occasion, Additional Secretary Tahseen said the recent floods have not only caused physical and economic devastation but have also left deep emotional and psychological impacts on individuals and families, especially children, women and the elderly in affected areas.
“To address these impacts, it is imperative that a joint and coordinated strategy involving all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors be launched immediately to include this important aspect in the overall disaster response process,” he said.
The meeting discussed the improvement of mental health facilities, provision of psychologists, community outreach programs and the launch of awareness campaigns, and suggested practical measures.
All the institutions expressed their determination to jointly fulfill this important national responsibility and agreed that a comprehensive and long-term plan would ensure the complete rehabilitation of the victims.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain said in a statement that due to the recent rains and flood situation, the National Highway Authority machinery has been mobilised to clear the Gilgit-Shandur road in the Raushan area. He added that formal approval has also been obtained for the construction of an alternative route in a short period of time and work on it is progressing rapidly.
“Under the project, a bypass will be constructed and the road will be connected to the main highway through a bridge,” he said, adding that this will ease movement and reduce difficulties faced by people.
“The government is utilising all available resources for the restoration of flood-affected areas, and for this purpose, work is being done in close coordination with the relevant institutions,” Hussain said. “We stand with the affected people and are trying to resolve their problems immediately.”

Dar arrived in Jeddah on a two-day visit yesterday, where he spoke on Israel’s ongoing Gaza onslaught during the 21st extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers.
Today, on the sidelines of the OIC meeting, Dar met with Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Algeria’s FM Ahmed Attaf.
Terming his discussion as a “meaningful interaction”, Dar said: “I reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening ties with our brotherly countries in North Africa, Algeria and Egypt, through enhanced connectivity and broader cooperation across diverse fields.”
The foreign ministers discussed the “grave situation in Palestine”, Dar said on X.
The trio stressed the “urgent need for humanitarian access, a ceasefire, and lasting peace, while underscoring the importance of unity within the Muslim Ummah in these challenging times”.
 






At the OIC session yesterday, Dar slammed Israel’s “annexationist and rogue mindset” and condemned Tel Aviv’s plan to take control of Gaza City as threatening regional peace.
He also presented seven “urgent and essential steps” for the international community and Muslim nations to halt Israel’s war on Gaza — already termed a genocide by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch — and secure enduring peace in Palestine.
 
 

Pakistan also fully endorsed and joined the statement issued by 31 Arab-Islamic countries and the secretaries general of the OIC, the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments about ‘Greater Israel’.
Algeria’s Ambassador to the UN Amar Bendjama has called for sanctions on Israel in response to its Gaza City plan.
Pakistan has brotherly ties with Egypt and Algeria, bonded in shared religion and culture.
In April, Islamabad and Cairo agreed to enhance bilateral collaboration in the health sector, with a specific focus on eliminating Hepatitis C. It was also reported earlier this year that Egypt’s renowned Al-Azhar University had plans to set up its campus in Pakistan.
Meeting with Turkiye’s foreign minister
The deputy PM also met with Turkiye’s FM Hakan Fidan today, expressing his “deep appreciation” to Turkiye for its leadership role in the capacity of chairing the OIC ministerial session.
“We affirmed firm solidarity with Palestine, noting the worsening humanitarian crisis and famine, and the urgent need for humanitarian aid and relief,” Dar noted.
The two ministers also “reaffirmed the brotherly Pakistan-Türkiye relations, and looked forward to further strengthening our multifaceted cooperation”.
 






Dar had also met with the top diplomats of several other friendly countries yesterday on the sidelines of the OIC meeting. They included Saudi Arabia’s FM Faisal Bin Farhan, Iran’s FM Abbas Araghchi, Malaysia’s Mohamad Haji Hasan, and Bangladeshi Adviser for Foreign Affairs Md Touhid Hossain.</p><small>2025-08-26 10:54</small></div><hr>
