<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69570cc194e00.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964528/words-without-actions' target='_blank'><strong>Words without actions</strong></a><br><p>MOST conversations on educational issues in Pakistan, sooner than later, come to the topic of ‘values’ in our society — our young people in particular. People lament that values have changed and the change has been for the worse: young people just do not possess the values that older generations held. Empathy, tolerance and community feeling are often mentioned as prime examples of values we need badly but do not have or have lost to a large extent over time. The conversation then focuses on how curricula, textbooks and teaching should be changed to facilitate the inculcation of these values.
This is all good — and yes, curricula, textbooks, teachers and teaching should definitely engage with the issue of values. In fact, we have always done that in education. Society has an interest in shaping how young people think and grow up and what they become. This is an essential part of the meaning of the very word ‘education’. But we should also remember that children learn much more from what they see adults doing around them and what they read, hear and watch on television, social media and within their social circles. They are shaped by what they see their parents, family elders and teachers do. Children learn from examples and what they see — far more than from what they might be asked to read/reproduce for assignments and examinations. If the two are not in line, curricula, books, lectures and lessons are likely to fall on deaf ears.
Do religious minorities have the rights all citizens should? There are minorities in Pakistan who are even afraid to divulge their identity lest they be punished for just that. Even majorities have difficulty practising their religion freely. People are afraid to talk about religious issues in public and have internalised fear and self-censorship. A look at newspapers from a few months reveals countless reports of incidents where minorities and even individuals from majority communities have been victims.
Those in power have decided to use power to secure their own interests (and longevity) rather than those of the public. If a judge or a few judges are deemed to be too independent or are disliked for one reason or another, the Constitution, law, rules, regulations, practice, everything can be changed to ensure that they are sidelined, are made out to be culprits, have their reputations ruined, or are forced to leave or become ineffective.
If a journalist is disliked, we have him/her fired. Programmes are taken off-air, columnists are stopped from being able to write in papers. If a paper is deemed too ‘independent’ their advertisement revenue is restricted or other normal operations made difficult. Channels are taken off air. If these have required tightening of the laws, it has been done. But often, a call to the relevant newspaper or channel is enough of a threat given how the state has been handling these issues.

Children are shaped by what they see their parents, family elders and teachers do.

The state has weaponised the law against the citizens and in many domains. There are new laws against posting on social media, there are new laws against journalists, and laws are tightened around public protests. How the political opposition has been and is being treated is very clear. We need not say more on that.
FIRs are used as a weapon. If the state does not like an individual and/or wants to give them a warning, all they have to do is register a case against them under any of the laws mentioned or start an investigation even before an FIR is registered. Even if the investigation is eventually closed or an FIR quashed, there will be months, sometimes years, of appearances before law-enforcement agencies and courts. The expenses and time consumed can be ruinous. The state knows this well but has, sadly, used it and is using it quite effectively against citizens they may not like for some reason.

 

The right to public protest has become almost impossible to exercise and has been nearly criminalised. The use of Section 144 when a protest is expected gives the state the right to register FIRs against those who come out to protest and then face the wrath of the law for months and years. Charges like ‘obstruction of law-enforcement officers’ or ‘resisting law-enforcement officers’, ‘causing public nuisance’, ‘obstruction of traffic’, etc, are easy to weaponise against protesters and they have been weaponised. Every protest is deemed to be anti-state and a violation of the law. Every dissent is seen as dangerous to the integrity and sovereignty of the state.
And then we say we should teach our children values like empathy and tolerance through books and classes. Are they not able to see what is happening around them? Do they not hear what is being said on news and chat programmes every day? Do they not have friends, relatives and elders who talk about these issues in their social spaces? How can they take what we give them in books and classes as important when they live in a society that violates these values and norms all the time as a matter of law as well as a matter of pride?
As a society we need to think deep and hard about where we are and where we want to go. Some measures might seem desirable to ensure short-term survival but might have a very corrosive impact for us in the medium to long run. Those in power today have taken the state to such a place. This does not bode well for people who are facing all this but, just as importantly if not more so, it does not bode well for what we are likely to give our children and leave them in terms of values, institutions and practices. May 2026 be a year of reflection and course correction for us.

On Wednesday, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka, where they had both arrived to attend the state funeral of former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia, who passed away earlier this week. It was, doubtless, a significant moment which invited attention across three countries.
The Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, made note of it in a post on his X account, which stated that the two men had “exchanged greetings” during their interaction ahead of the funeral programme organised for Ms Zia. Pictures of the two, sombrely attired for the occasion, accompanied his post.
Indian media downplayed the event, framing the handshake as a usual nicety at such events and therefore inconsequential. The Pakistani media, noting that it was the first high-level contact between the two nations since the May hostilities, ran with the statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat, underlining the part where it claimed that the handshake and pleasantries had been initiated by Mr Jaishankar, who reportedly approached Mr Sadiq with an informal acknowledgement.
One reason for the interest could be that this is a slow time of the year for newsrooms. Another could be that anticipation has continuously been high for what happens next between Pakistan and India. Yet, given the prevailing atmosphere, not much can or should be read into a mere handshake.

 

Interestingly, the NA Secretariat’s statement on the ‘handshake’ notes that Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation”. Can this be read as a signal to New Delhi that the door to talks remains open?
Unfortunately, the hostile rhetoric and posturing from next door show no signs of relenting. Recent reports regarding plans for controversial hydropower projects by India, which would violate the Indus Waters Treaty, are designed to be provocations for further tensions between the two states.
There is, without question, a strong need for temperatures to be brought down. But handshakes and exchanging pleasantries alone will not make that happen. It will require earnest effort, especially on New Delhi’s part, and diplomacy at the highest levels before a thaw can be expected.

In the interview defending his health, the US leader also changed his previous statement about receiving an MRI scan in October, saying it was instead a quicker CT scan.
Trump, who at 79 is the oldest person to assume the US presidency, told the Journal “my health is perfect” and expressed frustration with scrutiny of his well-being.
Trump has based much of his political image on projecting vigour whether through his frequent interactions with journalists, constant social media posting, or AI memes depicting him as a superhero.
However, the first year of his second term in office has raised growing questions.
His right hand shows persistent bruising, often covered with thick makeup and at times a bandage, and his ankles have appeared swollen.
On occasion, Trump has clearly struggled to keep his eyes open, including during a televised Oval Office meeting with health representatives in November, a politically sensitive issue for someone who constantly frames his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as “sleepy”.
Bruising and ‘blinking’
The Republican explained the bruising on his hand as the result of aspirin that he takes daily to thin his blood. “I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” he told the Journal.
He said he applies makeup or bandages when his hand is “whacked”. One cut, he said, was caused when his attorney general Pam Bondi hit the back of his hand with her ring while giving him a high-five.
Explanations of his health issues have been inconsistent.
Trump himself told reporters that he underwent an MRI scan in October, but said at the time he had “no idea what they analysed”.
To the Journal, Trump said it was not an MRI, “it was less than that. It was a scan”.
Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, confirmed to the newspaper that a CT scan a procedure that takes far less time than an MRI was done “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues”.

Coins and decorative lapis lazuli stones, dating back to the 2nd and 6th centuries BC, were unearthed during recent excavations.—Dawn

TAXILA: Archaeologists excavating the ancient Bhir Mound have unearthed decorative stones dating to the 6th century BC and rare coins from the 2nd century AD, a discovery officials are hailing as the most significant at the site in a decade.
The finds were made during ongoing excavations at the Unesco-listed site, which is regarded as the earliest urban settlement of the extensive Taxila civilisation.
Experts uncovered fragments of metamorphic decorative stone identified as lapis lazuli, alongside the rare bronze coins attributed to the Kushan dynasty, dramatically pushing forward the material narrative of ancient Gandhara.
Aasim Dogar, the deputy director of the Punjab Department of Arch­aeology who serves as head of the excavation team, confirmed the preliminary analysis of the artefacts.
“The decorative stones are lapis lazuli, a prized semi-precious stone, while the coins belong to the Kushan period,” Mr Dogar said.
The excavation team relied on specialised forensic assistance to date the metal artefacts. Mr Dogar noted that detailed numismatic analysis conducted by specialists from the University of Peshawar confirmed that the coins bear the image of Emperor Vasudeva. Vasudeva is recognized by historians as the last of the ‘great Kushan rulers’ who presided over the region.
According to Mr Dogar, the obverse of the recovered coinage depicts Vasudeva, while the reverse features a female religious deity.
Mr Dogar described this specific imagery as a distinct hallmark of Kushan-era religious pluralism, which often blended various theological traditions.
The artefacts were discovered on the northern side of the archaeological remains, specifically within the B-2 trench — one of 16 distinct trenches currently excavated at the site. Dogar said the surrounding archaeological evidence reveals that these specific remains constituted a residential area.
These latest discoveries affirm that Taxila reached the zenith of its political, cultural, and economic influence under Kushan rule, particularly bet­ween the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.
“Under emperors such as Kanishka the Great, Taxila emerged as a major administrative, commercial, and intellectual centre,” Mr Dogar said.
Mr Dogar added that widespread Kushan patronage of Buddhism during this era led to the construction of stupas, monasteries, and vast religious complexes.
The period also marked the rise of Gandharan art, a distinctive synthesis of Greek, Roman, Persian, and Indian traditions, with Taxila serving as its core hub.
Malik Tahir Suleman, a renowned numismatist, told Dawn that Kushan coins serve as some of the most critical historical sources for understanding ancient South and Central Asia.
“Issued between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, Kushan coins evolved from Indo-Greek imitations into a sophisticated imperial currency system,” Mr Suleman said.
“Struck mainly in gold, copper, and bronze, they reflect the empire’s economic strength and vast trade networks, including links with Roman markets.”
Mr Suleman said Kushan coinage is distinguished by its rich iconography and multilingual inscriptions.
He explained that they often depict rulers in Central Asian attire on one side and a remarkable range of deities — from Helios and Mithra to Shiva, Nana, and the Buddha — on the other.
Beyond the coins, the discovery of the deep-blue lapis lazuli fragments provides vital clues regarding anci­­ent supply chains. Mr Dogar noted that the stone has been valued for mil­­lennia across ancient civilisations.
“Its presence at Taxila points to long-distance trade links, particularly with Badakhshan in present-day Afghanistan, a historic source of lapis lazuli,” Mr Dogar said.

TEHRAN: Protesters and security forces clashed in western Iran on Thursday, leaving six people dead in the first fatal violence since cost-of-living demonstrations erupted earlier this week.
The unrest, triggered by soaring inflation and a collapsing currency, has spread from the capital to other major cities.
The semi-official Fars news agency reported that two civilians were killed in Lordegan, following confrontations with security services. Meanwhile, state media confirmed that a member of the Basij paramilitary force was killed overnight in the city of Kouhdasht.
The violence marks a significant escalation in the demonstrations that began on Sunday, when shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike to protest economic stagnation and high prices.
By Tuesday, students from at least 10 universities had joined the movement, which has since expanded to include closing major bazaars across the country.
“Some protesters began throwing stones at the city’s administrative buildings, including the provincial governor’s office, the mosque, the Martyrs’ Foundation, the town hall and banks,” Fars reported regarding the situation in Lordegan.
The agency stated that police responded with tear gas after the buildings were “severely damaged” and arrested several people described as “ringleaders”.
In Kouhdasht, state television cited Said Pourali, the deputy governor of Lorestan Province, reporting the death of a 21-year-old member of the Basij. The channel said the man was killed “by rioters while defending public order”.
Mr Pourali noted that “during the demonstrations in Kouhdasht, 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing”.
However, accounts of the violence vary. The rights group Hengaw repo­r­ted that security forces killed and wounded several people in Lordegan.
Regarding the death in Kouh­dasht, the Revolutionary Guards accused demonstrators of taking advantage of the protests.
Contrarily, Hengaw identified the deceased as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard and alleged he was a protester killed by security forces.
Hengaw also reported that a protester was shot dead on Wednesday in Isfahan province in central Iran. Reuters could not immediately verify these reports.
Protests also took place on Thursday in Marvdasht in the southern Fars province, the activist news site HRANA reported.
Hengsaw said Wednesday’s events included demonstrations and detentions across Kermanshah, Khuzestan, and Hamedan.
The unrest comes at a critical moment for Iran’s clerical rulers.
The economy has been hammered by Western sanctions and a currency that has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year.
Inflation reached 52 per cent year-over-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran.
The country is also recovering from regional tensions that led to a 12-day air war in June, during which Israeli and US airstrikes targeted the country’s nuclear infrastructure and military leadership.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sought to calm tensions on Thursday, acknowledging the protesters’ “legitimate demands” and calling on the government to improve the economic situation.
“From an Islamic perspective … if we do not resolve the issue of people’s livelihoods, we will end up in hell,” Pezeshkian said at an event broadcast on state television.
Despite the conciliatory tone, authorities promised to take a “firm” stance against disorder. Iran’s prosecutor general warned on Wednesday that while peaceful economic protests were legitimate, any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a “decisive response”.
“Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response,” the prosecutor said.
Government spokesperson Fate­meh Mohajerani announced on Thur­sday that authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trade unions and merchants, though she did not provide further details.
The current demonstrations remain smaller than the nationwide uprising in 2022, which was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code. That wave of anger left several hundred people dead.
Tasnim news agency reported on Wednesday evening the arrest of seven people allegedly affiliated with “groups hostile to the Islamic Republic based in the United States and Europe”, claiming they were “tasked with turning the demonstrations into violence”.
Local media coverage has been mixed, with some outlets highlighting economic hardships while others focus on incidents caused by “troublemakers”.

Official data show SBP’s reserves stood at $11.7bn on Jan 3, 2025, rising to $15.915bn by the end of December — an increase of $4.2bn. However, reserves grew by only $1.4bn in the second half of the year, from $14.5bn on June 30 to $15.9bn at year-end.
While the overall increase has strengthened external buffers and supported the exchange rate, a significant portion of the reserves comprises loans from friendly countries.
The central bank aims to raise reserves beyond $18bn by the end of FY26, but the slower accumulation in recent months has raised concerns. Despite record remittance inflows providing space for dollar purchases from the interbank market, reserve growth remained modest.

 

During January-September 2025, the SBP purchased $4.2bn from the market, reflecting a lower level of buying compared to last year. Over the previous 16 months, the central bank had purchased $9.7bn, which helped rebuild reserves.

Gains slow in second half as pace of accumulation slows down

The higher reserves contributed to exchange rate stability, enabling the economy to remain relatively steady despite weak economic growth and rising poverty.
Analysts warn that the second half of FY26 (January-June) could prove challenging, with the country facing large loan rollovers, the need to curb the trade deficit, boost GDP growth and create jobs for millions of skilled and unskilled workers.
In its weekly statement, the SBP reported that its reserves rose by $13 million to $15.915bn in the week ended Dec 26, 2025.
Total liquid foreign reserves held by the country stood at $21.012bn, including $5.097bn with commercial banks.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan said 2025 was relatively more stable than 2024, noting that the rupee remained firm against the US dollar. Since the IMF’s earlier agreements, volatility in the dollar had been contained, he added.
Despite historically low investment levels, Mr Bostan said investor confidence had improved, though he cautioned that stagnant export growth remained a key concern.
Economists and analysts also point out that despite higher reserves and a stable exchange rate, the country has yet to attract sufficient domestic and foreign investment to revive economic activity and achieve higher growth.

ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.
These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday.
Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows.

 

The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives.
Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan.
In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured.
The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations.
Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance.
Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year.
These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others.

The premier emphasised that looking into domestic energy resources was critical for national economic stability.
He also ordered the digitisation of the entire supply chain for the import and domestic utilisation of oil and gas on a priority basis.
“With the digitisation of the oil and gas supply chain, smuggling of these products will be effectively curbed, which will ultimately benefit the national exchequer,” the prime minister noted.
The meeting was info­rmed that the Oil and Gas Development Comp­any Limited (OGDCL) had discovered significant new oil and gas reservoirs in the Nashpa Block area of Kohat district.
The newly discovered re­s­e­rves are expected to yield around 4,100 barrels of oil per day.
The meeting was also informed that domestic con­sumers experienced improved gas pressure during the current winter season against last year.
Officials said work on RLNG connections had been stepped up, with a target of providing 350,000 new connections by June 2026.
The meeting was further told that pipelines for the Sheva and Batani gas fields had been commissioned, while work on the pipeline from the Kot Palak gas field was underway.
Chairing a separate mee­ting on economic reforms, the PM highlighted that implementation of the government’s economic governance policies was inevitable. He sou­ght proposals from all relevant ministries sugges­ting practical measures and a comprehensive strategy invo­lving minimal duration.

ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners.
The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy.
“We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said.
Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported.
Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day.
Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council.
At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”.
“So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said.
Exchange of lists
Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown.
Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.”
He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added.
India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani.
The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
“Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said.
Dulhasti power project
The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.

 

Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations.
“No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.”
The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart.
Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.”
He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

The PTI earlier said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
“Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News Capital Talk on Thursday.
He said the efforts at the level of leaders like him and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Malik Amir Dogar, would continue, but until confidence among the top leaders is established, the political situation would not see a breakthrough.
Sanaullah added that confidence-building measures would be possible only when social media accounts propagating a hate campaign against the army and its leadership are shut down.
“The PTI leadership can’t evade responsibility [for these accounts] … They have to disown them,” he said, adding that PTI could instead initiate propaganda against political parties.
He further said that the PTI should withdraw its call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, as it would be a “failure” and would further “damage the situation”.
In response to Sanaullah, Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.
“If these five leaders meet the conflict can be resolved,” added Dogar, without specifying which five leaders he was referring to.
‘Outright rejected negotiations’
Separately, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking on Dawn News Dosra Rukh, denied any contacts with the government regarding negotiations.
“We have outright rejected the negotiations,” he said, adding that Imran Khan had stated the PTI would not negotiate with a Form-47 government.
“The decision on whether to hold negotiations with the government rests with Achakzai and Abbas, as they welcomed it in the statement issued by the TTAP after the national conference,” he said.
In response to another question on PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar’s statement regarding meetings with Imran Khan, Akram said: “PTI is dealing with frustration due to his statement, and this is clearly visible outside Adiala prison, where a crowd gathers every Tuesday. FIRs are lodged, people are arrested, yet workers gather the following week.”
Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.</p><small>2026-01-02 02:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/020722450d022a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964638/new-york-mayor-mamdani-vows-to-enact-democratic-socialist-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>New York Mayor Mamdani vows to enact democratic socialist agenda</strong></a><br><p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s mayor on Thursday, vowing during a public swearing-in ceremony on the steps of City Hall to enact an aggressive agenda aimed at making the nation’s largest city more affordable for working people.
Mamdani, a member of his party’s left-wing democratic socialist faction, was elected last November in a prominent victory that could influence this year’s midterm elections that will determine control of the US Congress. Some Democrats have embraced his style while Republicans portray him as a foil on the national political stage.
The 34-year-old campaigned heavily on cost-of-living issues and was sharply critical of Republican US President Donald Trump, whose approval rating has fallen over the past year amid economic concerns.
Many of New York’s 8 million residents — some with hope, some with trepidation — expect him to be a disruptive political force.
In a speech following his public swearing-in, Mamdani promoted core campaign promises of universal childcare, affordable rents and free bus service.
“We will answer to all New Yorkers, not to any billionaire or oligarch who thinks they can buy our democracy,” he said. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist.”







‘Tax the rich’
The programme for Mamdani’s inauguration included remarks by US Senator Bernie Sanders and US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, fellow democratic socialists at the vanguard of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.
Sanders, whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, defended Mamdani’s agenda.
“Making sure that people can live in affordable housing is not radical,” Sanders said. “It is the right and decent thing to do.”
The crowd of several thousand cheered loudly when Sanders called on America’s millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes, breaking into a chant of “tax the rich”.
Even with temperatures well below freezing, the city set up a viewing area along Broadway to allow thousands more to watch a livestream of the ceremony, which included musical performances.

 

Mae Hardman-Hill, 27, volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign and said it felt like his political momentum was growing.
“I’m a native New Yorker. I’ve watched the city like you just become less and less affordable, less and less livable,” Hardman-Hill said. “I’m really excited for … regular people to get some power back again.”
Prior to the public ceremony, Mamdani was privately sworn in as New York City’s mayor in the first minutes of the New Year on Thursday at the historic City Hall subway station, which was decommissioned decades ago and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.
Reflecting his Muslim faith, he used the Holy Quran for his swearing-in, a first for a New York City mayor.
Republicans blast Mamdani
Hours after Mamdani took office, the lead group tasked with electing Republicans to the US House of Representatives sought to portray him as a “radical socialist”.
“Every time Mamdani opens his mouth or swipes his pen, he tattoos the Democratic Party’s failures onto every House Democrat facing voters in 2026,” spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement that signaled the sizable role Mamdani is likely to play on the national campaign stage.
Mamdani, a former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for the Democratic Party around the country ahead of November midterm elections.
Dean Fuleihan, the incoming deputy mayor, told the Financial Times that Mamdani will move ahead with plans to increase taxes on millionaires to pay for his campaign promises and balance New York’s budget.
He added that he doesn’t expect rich people to leave the city as a result of potentially higher taxes.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul has said she opposes raising personal income taxes but is considering raising corporate taxes to pay for a potential budget shortfall amid federal cuts.
In one early reversal, Mamdani said on Wednesday that he would no longer seek to end mayoral control of New York City’s public school system, the largest in the US, naming veteran educator Kamar Samuels as chancellor.
Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 per cent of the vote in November, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.
Inauguration of a new era
The Uganda-born Mamdani has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.
Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg’s first term in 2001.
As mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilisation programme, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan’s upscale Upper East Side.
Bankers and others in New York, the nation’s financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election many have explored how to work with him.</p><small>2026-01-02 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/020725203fe1f0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964543/traders-question-inflation-figures-despite-relief' target='_blank'><strong>Traders question inflation figures despite relief</strong></a><br><p>• Vegetable price slump offsets costlier staples• Tomato glut eases prices, hurts growers• Flour, milk and meat rates climb
KARACHI: Traders appear dissatisfied with the official inflation numbers, despite the fact that prices of many items have declined compared to rising trend in other items.
Consumers have found some relief in vegetable prices, with tomatoes leading the decline. Tomato prices have dropped to as low as Rs30 per kg in various cities, although this relief for consumers has hit growers hard.
In Karachi, several pushcart vendors are seen offering 2.5kg to 3kg tomatoes for Rs100, owing to heavy arrivals from producing areas.
According to the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the last week of December 2025, the national average price of tomatoes ranged between Rs30 and Rs130 per kg across different cities.
Consumers are also benefiting from improved onion supplies from producing areas, thus dropping the national average price to Rs60-140 per kg from Rs110-180 per kg in the first week of January 2025.
The national average price of new potatoes has also plunged to Rs30-100 per kg, compared to Rs80-150 per kg a year ago, in various cities.

 

During October 2025, in contrast, consumers had paid Rs600-700 per kg for tomatoes in various parts of the country, while onion prices had reached Rs220 per kg.
Pulses prices have largely remained stable. The national average price of gram pulse decreased to Rs220-350
per kg from Rs330-450 per kg over the past year.
The average prices of moong, masoor and mash stood at Rs340-470, Rs240-330 and Rs360-530 per kg, respectively, compared to Rs350-470, Rs260-370 and Rs440-590 per kg in the first week of January 2025.
Fresh milk prices in the country edged up to Rs170-260 per litre from Rs150-240 a year back.
The price of a 20kg wheat flour bag jumped to Rs1,810-2,650 from Rs1,580-2,200 after an increase in wheat rates whose 10kg bag price soared to Rs1,052 from Rs806 over the past year. The average price of fine flour rose to Rs132 per kg from Rs111.
The national average price of 1kg ghee pouch, 2.5kg ghee pack and five-litre cooking oil also increased to Rs560-590, Rs1,400-1,588 and Rs2,850-3,110, respectively, from Rs545-585, Rs1,370-1,500 and Rs2,695-2,945 a year earlier.
The price of beef with bones and mutton (average quality), which were Rs700-1,300 and Rs1,550-2,400 a year ago, has soared to Rs900-1,450 and Rs1,700-2,550 per kg, respectively.
Prices of Basmati broken rice have slightly surged to Rs140-300 per kg from Rs130-280, while prices of Irri 6/9 rice
in Sindh and Punjab remained unchanged at Rs110-200 per kg during the last one year.
Zaid Bin Haris at Sherman Securities said the food index rose 3.2pcYoY, due to increase in prices of wheat (up 20.8pcYoY), chicken (up 16.11pcYoY) and meat (up 13.56pcYoY).
Mr Haris attributed the rise in wheat prices to higher retail rates, prices, supported by a new government wheat policy raising its minimum support price (MSP) to assist flood-affected farmers. He added that chicken and meat prices increased YoY due to higher feed costs and weak enforcement of price controls, keeping market prices above official rates.
‘Highly disappointing year’
Separately, All Karachi Tajir Itehad Chairman Atiq Mir termed 2025 as a “highly disappointing year” in which trading and business activities shrank by 60pc, alongside rising food prices, unemployment and declining business confidence and investment.
In a statement, he further said no new industrial units were set up during the year, which led to increased capital flight amid an uncertain business environment.
While painting a bleak outlook for 2026, Mr Mir said the government appeared non-serious in providing a business-friendly environment, citing rising prices of power, gas, LPG, petrol and diesel, along with a number of taxes and duties.

The PUC is a broad coalition of clerics from various Sunni schools of thought.
Ashrafi, also a member of the Supreme Council of the Muslim World League and other Islamic organisations, has been given the appointment at a critical time, given the evolving situation in the Muslim world and the strategic importance of relations with the Gulf nations and other Islamic countries.
Talking to Dawn, he said that under the new role, he will be responsible for strengthening coordination, enhancing mutual understanding and further improving Pakistan’s relations with Islamic and Arab states, mainly the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
“This is because I have maintained close and longstanding ties with leading Islamic scholars and senior leaders of the Arab and Muslim world,” Ashrafi said, adding, “And the reason for this close coordination is that I always talk about the issues and the problems faced by Pakistan are similar to those faced by other Muslim countries.”
“We face terror in the form of the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and the Arab countries face terror threats from Daesh (Islamic State); we need to have a collective stance against terror groups – this is the need of the time to counter the image problem faced by the Muslim world in the West,“ he added
His appointment reflects the government’s commitment to advancing religious harmony locally and advancing constructive engagement with the Muslim world to counter extremism, as well as enhancing Pakistan’s non-commercial role in the Middle East.
Ashrafi has held similar positions in past governments; he previously served as a special representative and brings extensive experience in religious diplomacy, interfaith engagement and international outreach.</p><small>2026-01-01 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0121512448986b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964486/govt-should-have-shown-a-big-heart-pti-leaders-again-denied-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Govt should have shown a big heart’: PTI leaders again denied meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>PTI leaders were once again denied a meeting with incarcerated party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday, as party leaders lamented the restrictions and said the government should have “shown a big heart”.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. The party has staged sit-ins near the prison to demand a meeting with the party founder, with one earlier this week dispersed with water cannons.
“I was hoping that, considering the offer of talks by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the first day of the new year, the government would allow us to meet PTI’s founding chairman,“ said Muhammad Jamal Khan, a member of the National Assembly (MNA) while talking to Dawn.
“It could have been the first step towards creating national harmony and ending the tense political environment, but the government lost that chance.”
On Wednesday, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja had written a letter to the Superintendent at Adiala jail — where Imran is imprisoned — and shared the names of six people for a meeting with the party founder. The names included Dr Amjad Ali, Sahibzada Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Iqbal Khattak, Shoaib Ameer Awan and Muhammad Jamal Khan.
The MNA said he approached the gate of Adiala jail at 2:30 pm and informed the jail staff that his name had been forwarded by Raja for the meeting.
“The officials told me that they had noted my name and suggested I return to the check post and wait, where media personnel were also standing,” Jamal added.
“They told me that I would be informed if they got the approval for the meeting. I waited there until 4:40 pm, but they kept telling me that they had not received approval to let me in.”
When asked why only two people arrived outside Adiala jail, despite the prison administrators having received six names, Jamal said that he and Member of the Provincial Assembly Iqbal Khan Khattak had arrived at the prison together.
“There is a possibility that other leaders might have been elsewhere at Adiala jail. I did not have their contact numbers, so I cannot confirm whether they had arrived or not,” he added.
Replying to a question, Jamal said that the government had shown weakness.
“It should have allowed the meeting to signal that it is serious about negotiations, and the nation would have seen it as a positive message from the government,” he added.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
A sit-in staged by PTI leaders and the sisters of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan was once again dispersed using water cannons late on Tuesday night.</p><small>2026-01-01 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0113431331c89c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964459/dozens-killed-100-injured-in-fire-at-swiss-ski-resort-bar-police-say' target='_blank'><strong>Dozens killed, 100 injured in fire at Swiss ski resort bar, police say</strong></a><br><p>Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured, most of them seriously, after fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year’s Eve party in the upscale Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, officials said on Thursday.
Fire broke out at 1.30am in a bar called “Le Constellation” in the resort in southwestern Switzerland, which locals said was popular with teenagers. The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, remains unclear but authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.
Swiss police said “tens” of people were presumed dead, with around 100 injured, and the Italian foreign ministry said information from Swiss police indicated about 40 deaths. Swiss officials declined to give a specific figure.

“There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead,” said 21-year-old local Samuel Rapp, who saw the aftermath of the fire. “They had jackets over their faces, thats what I saw, nothing more.”
Ceiling caught fire
Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities.
Two young French women who said they were in the bar told France’s BFM TV that they saw the fire start in the basement section of the club after a bottle containing “birthday candles” was held up too close to the wooden ceiling.
“The fire spread across the ceiling super quickly,” one of the two women, who identified themselves as Emma and Albane, told BFM TV. The pair said they were able to climb a narrow staircase to the ground floor and escape the building. Minutes later, the fire had reached the ground floor too, they said.

BFM showed video of a waitress carrying a champagne bottle with a lit ‘fountain candle’ through the bar, in line with the account, but the video did not show the fire taking hold.
Video footage verified by Reuters showed fire spreading from the building, with people outside the club, some of them running and screaming.
Victims come from several countries
Italy’s ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told Sky TG24 local authorities had told him the blaze was started by someone letting off a firework inside the bar which set fire to the ceiling. He was in Crans-Montana, where he said a number of Italians had gathered seeking information about missing relatives or friends.
He declined to say if there were any Italian victims but witnesses said many of those in the bar appeared to be from other countries.
Witnesses described the injured being treated in improvised triage centres set up in a nearby bar and in a branch of UBS bank and said many suffered after coming out of the heat of the bar into the freezing night air.
“And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible,” said Dominic Dubois, who witnessed the frantic scenes as the bodies were brought out.

A waiter in a restaurant near the bar, who declined to be named, said that first responders approached staff overnight asking for table cloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers.
On Thursday morning, hours after the explosion, footage from the street outside showed the area cordoned off, with forensic tents behind white screens set up in front of the bar, one of many in Crans-Montana, a fashionable ski centre with an array of boutiques, luxury hotels and restaurants.
“I know someone who might have been among the victims and I can’t reach her. I’m very worried,” said local resident Karine Spreng. “I’m going to try to contact other people who know this woman to see if she is still alive.”
The daytime scene, with small groups of people, some in tears or carrying flowers, was a stark contrast to the panic and confusion that officials said faced first responders who arrived when the alarm was raised.
“The first responders - the firefighters and police officers - arrived at a scene of chaos, at a dramatic scene,” Stephane Ganzer, head of security for Valais canton, told reporters.
He said some of the victims were from other countries, hundreds of personnel were working on the case and a helpline had been opened for relatives. Officials said the grim task of identifying badly burned bodies would take a considerable time.
“I can’t hide from you that we are all shaken by what happened overnight in Crans,” the canton’s head of police, Frederic Gisler, told the press conference.
“Our count is about 100 injured, most seriously, and unfortunately tens of people are presumed dead,” he said, adding that patients had been dispatched to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
Local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said a full investigation had been opened into the incident at the bar, which Swiss company records indicated was owned by a French couple.
“At the moment we are considering this a fire and we are not considering the possibility of an attack,” she told a press conference.
Mourning
Swiss Federal President Guy Parmelin expressed shock at the scale of the disaster, which came less than a year after a fire in a club in North Macedonia killed 59 people.
“What was meant to be a moment of joy turned, on the first day of the year in Crans-Montana, into mourning that touches the entire country and far beyond,” he said on the social media platform X, expressing condolences.
The foreign ministers of neighbouring Italy and Germany and other countries including the United States expressed condolences but there was no immediate confirmation of the nationality of any of the victims.
Prosecutor Pilloud said authorities were trying to get the bodies of the victims to their families.
“A lot of resources have been put into forensics to identify the victims. These resources are intended to allow us to get the bodies to the families as soon as possible,” she said.
Earlier, police said many people were being treated for burns and that the area had been completely closed off, with a no-fly zone imposed over Crans-Montana, which is due to host next year’s Alpine World Ski Championships. Authorities said 10 helicopters and 40 ambulances had been deployed.







President Zardari, PM Shehbaz extend condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari said he was deeply saddened over the incident and extended condolences to the families of the victims and wished the injured a swift recovery.
In a social media post on X, the president said he was “heartbroken by news of the devastating explosion & fire in Crans-Montanaon, Switzerland on New Year’s night“.

Station House Officer (SHO) Ghulam Ali Abro, posted in Sibi, told Dawn that the incident was a grenade attack which occurred at 7:05pm.
“One person expired and five others were injured,” the SHO said. “Security forces and Edhi ambulances arrived on the scene as soon as they received reports about the incident.”
He further told reporters at the site of the attack that six injured people were transported to a hospital, with one of them succumbing to their injuries on the way.
Meanwhile, Sibi region Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Barkat Khosa told Dawn that the injured were moved to the Teaching Hospital, while the body of the deceased was handed over to his heirs.
“Police have tightened security in the area, and further investigation is underway,” DIG Khosa said.
Last month, an eight-year-old child was killed and five other members of a family, including two women, were injured when a grenade exploded inside a house in the Wadh area of Balochistan’s Khuzdar district.
Police said two families from Sindh’s Kashmore district were in the house when unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade into the courtyard. It exploded, killing the child on the spot.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, 2025 was recorded as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, a report from the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) think tank stated.
The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials rising almost 38 per cent in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024 and 34pc in 2025.</p><small>2026-01-01 16:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01201607b48fed0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964483/punjab-bar-suspends-licence-of-lawyer-representing-tiktoker-rajab-butt' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab bar suspends licence of lawyer representing TikToker Rajab Butt</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq for representing TikToker Rajab Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the local bar.
The strike had been called in protest against the alleged victimisation of the Karachi Bar Association’s former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. During the strike, judicial proceedings were strictly prohibited within the city courts’ premises.
According to an order issued by PbBC Executive Committee’s Chairman Zabiullah Nagra, the action was taken after receiving a letter from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association.
The letter drew the council’s attention to a “video circulating on social media in which Advocate Ashfaq was seen appearing before the Karachi City Courts while representing TikToker Rajab Butt during an ongoing lawyers’ strike,” said Nagra.
“It further observed that the advocate appeared before the courts despite the strike, allegedly accompanied by private guards or individuals in clear violation of the strike restrictions and the established canons of the legal profession,” the order stated.
It further noted that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”.
“These remarks reportedly caused divisions within the legal fraternity, leading to confrontation and discord among lawyers,” it added.
As per the order, Advocate Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.
Examining his professional record, the order said that Advocate Ashfaq was registered as an advocate with the PbBC in 2010 and the high court in 2012.
“As a practising lawyer,” the council asserted that Advocate Ashfaq was “duty bound to uphold the dignity and high standing of the legal profession at all times”.
“The executive committee unanimously decided to suspend Advocate Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect,” it said.
The committee also referred the matter to the disciplinary committee of the council for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation of the licence in accordance with law.
Talking to Dawn, Nagra said the PbBC, as a statutory regulatory body, was not required to issue a prior notice before suspending a lawyer’s licence in cases involving professional misconduct.
“Every enrolled advocate is presumed to have full knowledge of the code of conduct prescribed under the Bar Council rules and is duty-bound to comply with it,” he said.
Council’s executive committee chairman added that the lawyer concerned had been found involved in activities “unbecoming of a member of the legal profession” for quite some time.
On Monday, YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted at a sessions court in Karachi during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
The hearing, during which the Youtuber was represented by Ashfaq, was marred by violence and chaos.
Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.</p><small>2026-01-01 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0113565387876c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964467/are-you-ready-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-says-he-will-visit-karachi-on-january-9' target='_blank'><strong>‘Are you ready?’: KP CM Sohail Afridi says he will visit Karachi on January 9</strong></a><br><p>Days after concluding a three-day visit to Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced on Thursday that he will visit Karachi on January 9.
“Friday, January 9!” the chief minister said on social media platform X. “Karachi, Sindh, are you ready?”
Afridi said he would be coming to Karachi “bearing Imran Khan’s message”, adding that he would be meeting “all friends of the party”.







Afridi had previously announced that Karachi was his next destination for galvanising party supporters.
During his visit to Lahore, the KP CM had attempted to deliver a speech to supporters at Liberty Chowk but was unable to do so as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to the area by setting up pickets.
He had also addressed PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, a visit that was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
He was also barred from visiting the cantonment to meet party leaders, as well as the food street that had been shut down ahead of his visit. He also went to Zaman Park amid heavy police deployment, while the detention of party supporters during the tour was also reported.
On Monday, he wrote to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to complain about the treatment meted out to him during his visit. He maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”.
He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”.
The KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, exce­ssive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”. He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government” and stressed that it damaged the “collective credibility of federating units”.
Separately, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan said the KP CM’s visit to the provincial assembly would be investigated by the law enforcement agencies in light of the CCTV footage and the initial inquiry report.</p><small>2026-01-01 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/011838353e1963b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964481/household-integrated-economic-survey-shows-57pc-surge-in-internet-users-across-pakistan-as-access-reaches-70pc-of-homes' target='_blank'><strong>Household Integrated Economic Survey shows 57pc surge in internet users across Pakistan as access reaches 70pc of homes</strong></a><br><p>Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) 2024–25 on Thursday revealed the surge of up to 57 per cent in the individual internet users in Pakistan as household internet access rate increased from 34pc to 70pc.
HIES — a yearly survey — conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) is focused on social and economic conditions of the country to provide data for policy making at the national and provincial levels.
The PBS released the results of HIES during a ceremony at the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Islamabad, today.
“The PBS has successfully completed and released the results of the Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) 2024–25, marking a major milestone in Pakistan’s national data ecosystem,“ a statement from the Press Information Department (PID) said.
It further said that “the survey provides comprehensive insights to review the social and economic conditions of the country and serves as a key tool for evidence-based planning and policymaking.”
PID said that “HIES 2024–25 is the First-Ever Fully Digital HIES conducted after Digital Population and Housing Census 2023.”
“Field operation of the survey was completed in June 2025 by conducting on a quarterly basis, covering 32,000 households across Pakistan, representative at the provincial and national level,” said PID.
“A fully integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system was used for data collection, task management and real-time monitoring.”
Key highlights
As per the key results and major highlights of the survey released by PBS, there was an increase from 17pc to 57pc in the number of individuals using the internet in Pakistan.
It also said the household mobile or smartphone facility was increased to 96pc. Furthermore, household internet access increased from 34pc to 70pc.
PBS said that the gender parity at the primary level saw a rise from 92pc to 96pc in Pakistan.
According to the survey results, the neonatal mortality rate declined from 41 to 35 per thousand live births. Moreover, the infant mortality rate decreased from 60 to 47 per thousand live births, and the total fertility rate also decreased from 3.7 to 3.6 children per woman.
The survey said the use of clean fuels—such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, biogas, solar energy, and electricity for clean heating, lighting, and cooking—surged to 38pc.
PBS mentioned that household income and consumption increased to Rs82,179 and Rs79,150, respectively, in Pakistan.
It said that the major part of the household consumption goes to food (37pc), housing and fuel (26pc), followed by restaurants and hotels (6.63pc), clothing and footwear (6.28pc) and transport (6.21pc) at the national level.
Pakistan Panel Household Survey 2024 had earlier revealed that only 19.5pc of households can always afford desired meals, while 30pc sometimes go without three meals a day.
‘Major milestone for policymaking’
Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed the survey as a “major milestone towards data-driven governance and evidence-based policymaking”.
Addressing the launch ceremony, Iqbal said the Ministry of Planning had assumed ownership of clearing long-pending statistical backlogs and had completed surveys that remained stalled for six to seven years.
Ahsan Iqbal said the availability of updated data would strengthen government policymaking while enabling researchers, businesses and youth to undertake better research, business planning and national analysis. “This survey is a milestone for the country,” he remarked.
Referring to the findings of HIES, the minister said Pakistan had faced a series of economic shocks over the past six to seven years, beginning with policy disruptions after 2018 that derailed the growth momentum built between 2013 and 2018.
He said mismanagement, particularly the surge in imports in 2022 to around $80 billion, resulted in a massive current account deficit and depletion of foreign exchange reserves, causing currency instability and prolonged inflation.
“There was no economic plan or direction; only reactive measures, and retaliatory measures do not run an economy,” he said, adding that the situation was exacerbated by Covid-19 and subsequent global commodity and supply shocks.
The minister said the survey showed the lower middle class had been the most affected, with sharp changes in income and consumption patterns. “Food inflation and rising utility prices consumed most of their income, leaving little room for other expenses,” he said.
Despite the turbulence, Ahsan Iqbal said the economy had now moved past the worst phase and was on a recovery path.
Iqbal cited GDP growth of 3.71pc in the first quarter as “very encouraging” and expressed optimism that growth could reach 4pc or higher if the current trajectory was maintained.
However, he cautioned against artificial, consumption-led growth driven by excessive imports. “We do not want short-lived growth that crashes due to foreign exchange shortages,” he said, stressing the need to align growth with export earnings, remittances, foreign direct investment and other inflows.
Iqbal said the government was pursuing a prudent growth policy alongside reforms under the IMF programme to ensure stability and sustained high growth in the coming years.
On social indicators, the minister acknowledged relative improvements in literacy, health and infant mortality but said progress remained insufficient.
He pointed out that literacy had risen only from around 60 to 63 per cent, far short of global benchmarks.
“Under an education emergency, we must raise literacy to 90 per cent in the next five to six years,” he said, calling for joint efforts by governments, civil society and individuals.
Highlighting the Uraan Pakistan agenda, Iqbal said the survey reinforced the urgency of accelerating socio-economic development while ensuring peace and stability.
He urged a shift in national discourse from political confrontation to issues shaping the country’s future, such as child stunting, literacy and universal primary enrolment.
“The future belongs to nations that prioritise their economy and socio-economic development,” he said, adding that strong socio-economic foundations were essential for political stability.
The minister called upon the media, opposition, private sector and civil society to use the survey as a basis for constructive debate and collaboration. “We can only achieve our goals through cooperation as Team Pakistan,” he said.
Describing the HIES as “an invitation to think and act,” he reiterated the resolve to transform Pakistan’s social and economic indicators under Uraan Pakistan, while achieving a $1 trillion economy by 2035.
Uraan Pakistan is a five-year National Eco­nomic Transforma­tion Plan launched in 2024, focused on the revival of the country’s economy through targeted measures.</p><small>2026-01-01 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01165453583d61d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964478/128-journalists-killed-worldwide-in-2025-press-group' target='_blank'><strong>128 journalists killed worldwide in 2025: press group</strong></a><br><p>A total of 128 journalists were killed around the world in 2025, more than half of them in the Middle East, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said on Thursday.
The grim toll, up from 2024, “is not just a statistic, it’s a global red alert for our colleagues,” IFJ general secretary Anthony Bellanger told AFP.
The press group voiced particular alarm over the situation in the Palestinian territories, where it recorded 56 media professionals killed in 2025 as Israel’s war with Hamas ground on in Gaza.
“We’ve never seen anything like this: so many deaths in such a short time, in such a small area,” Bellanger said.
Journalists were also killed in Yemen, Ukraine, Sudan, Peru, India and elsewhere.
Bellanger condemned what he called “impunity” for those behind the attacks.
“Without justice, it allows the killers of journalists to thrive,” he warned.
Meanwhile, the IFJ said that across the globe, 533 journalists were currently in prison – a figure that has more than doubled over the past half-decade.
China once again topped the list as the worst jailer of reporters with 143 behind bars, including in Hong Kong, where authorities have been criticised by Western nations for imposing national security laws quashing dissent.
The IFJ’s count for the number of journalists killed is typically far higher than that of Reporters Without Borders, due to different counting methods. This year’s IFJ toll also included nine accidental deaths.
Reporters Without Borders said 67 journalists were killed in the course of their work this year.
It said in the report that Israel was responsible for nearly half of all journalists killed this year worldwide, with 29 Palestinian reporters slain by Israeli forces in Gaza.
In Pakistan, the Pakistan Press Foundation documented at least 137 confirmed incidents targeting journalists and media professionals in 2025, including eight killings.
It also reported 35 incidents of physical assault and manhandling, along with two journalists injured while on assignment, five detentions, two abductions and four attacks on property, including raids.</p><small>2026-01-01 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01163805ce00d78.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964479/446-lawmakers-fail-to-submit-asset-statements-ecp-issues-revised-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>446 lawmakers fail to submit asset statements; ECP issues revised deadline</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday said 446 lawmakers — including 125 members of the National Assembly — failed to submit their statements of assets and liabilities with the ECP by the due date — set at December 31.
In a press release issued today, ECP notified the lawmakers who had missed the earlier deadline to submit their statements by January 15, and said that “as many as 446 lawmakers failed to submit their statements of assets and liabilities” with the ECP by the due date.
Out of these, 125 lawmakers are members of the National Assembly, 26 Senators, 159 members of the Punjab Assembly, 62 members of the Sindh Assembly, 48 members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly and 26 members of the Balochistan Assembly.
The commission said that members of the parliament and provincial assemblies were required to submit a copy of a statement of assets and liabilities by Dec 31, including assets and liabilities of their dependents.
It stated that the submission was a mandatory requirement under Section 137 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137 (1) of the Elections Act, 2017 stipulates that “every member of an assembly and senate shall submit to the Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a copy of his statement of assets and liabilities, including assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day of June on Form B.”
ECP directed lawmakers who had not yet complied to submit their statement by Jan 15 during office hours.
It warned that members who failed to do so will be suspended the next day, in accordance with Section 137 (3) of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137(3) pertains to the suspension of lawmakers who fail to comply with the deadline.
Last year, ECP suspended the membership of 139 lawmakers after they failed to submit their annual statements of assets.
Those suspended included two Senators from Balochistan, Muhammad Qasim of BNP and Abdul Quddus of PPP.
Other lawmakers included 16 members of the National Assembly, 68 of the Punjab Assembly, 33 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, 15 of the Sindh Assembly and five of the Balochistan Assembly.
The suspended lawmakers were barred from attending the respective legislature’s proceedings.</p><small>2026-01-01 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/011632278e97dbb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964476/cpi-inflation-slows-to-56pc-year-on-year-in-december' target='_blank'><strong>CPI inflation slows to 5.6pc year-on-year in December</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s consumer price inflation slowed to 5.6 per cent year-on-year in December, while prices fell every month, official data showed on Thursday.
The data comes after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.5pc last month, breaking a four-meeting hold, in a move that surprised markets. All analysts polled by Reuters had expected rates to remain unchanged at the December meeting.
Inflation eased from 6.1pc in November and marked a sharp slowdown from levels that peaked above 30pc in 2023, according to official data.
Lower prices of perishable food items helped drive the monthly decline, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said, with food prices falling 1.7pc month-on-month in December, led by declines in both urban and rural areas.
The finance ministry had said on Wednesday that inflation was expected to remain moderate at 5.5-6.5pc in December.
The SBP has said that inflation stayed within its 5-7pc target range during the July-November period, but warned that core inflation remains sticky and headline inflation could rise temporarily towards the end of this fiscal year, which ends in June, due to base effects.
Non-food inflation remained elevated in both urban and rural areas in December, underscoring the central bank’s concerns over persistent underlying price pressures.
The central bank has said the inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged, while the International Monetary Fund has cautioned against premature monetary easing under the $7 billion loan programme.</p><small>2026-01-01 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01140511501d1be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964469/pti-seeks-disqualification-of-senator-saifullah-abro-for-voting-in-favour-of-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PTI seeks disqualification of Senator Saifullah Abro for voting in favour of 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI submitted a reference to the Senate chairperson on Thursday, seeking the disqualification of Senator Saifullah Abro for defecting from party line and voting in favour of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
PTI Senator Ali Zafar posted about the development on his X account, saying: “Saifullah Abro went against party line by voting in favour of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, for which a reference for his disqualification has been filed.”







The reference, moved by Zafar, invoked Article 63-A of the Constitution, which deals with disqualification on grounds of defection.
“The declaration is being submitted for onward reference to the chief election commissioner for laying the same before the election commission in accordance with the said Article 63-A,” the reference, dated January 1 and seen by Dawn, said.
It added that a meeting of the PTI was convened before voting on the 27th Amendment, in which it was “explicitly decided and communicated to all PTI senators in writing” that they were to oppose and not vote in favour of any legislative measure or bill relating to the said amendment.
The direction to oppose and not vote in favour of any legislative measure relating to the 27th Amendment was also issued by Zafar to all PTI senators, including Abro, the reference stated, adding: “The record confirms that this direction was properly conveyed to him and that he was fully aware of it.”
The direction was also widely published in the media, the reference said.
However, Senator Abro voted in favour of the legislation first on November 10, 2025 — when the Senate first voted on the amendment — and then on November 13,2025 when the house considered the legislation for the second time after some changes were made to it, the reference said..
At both instances, Abro voted in favour of the amendment, contrary to the “clear, unanimous and duly communicated direction” of the PTI and his parliamentary leader in the Senate, it said.
The reference further stated that a show-cause notice dated December 2, 2025 was issued to Abro, and it was subsequently “received at his residential/official mailing addresses of Larkana and Islamabad, affording him full and adequate opportunity to show cause as to why a declaration may not be made against him in terms of Article 63-A”.
The show-cause notice was issued in compliance with the requirements of Article 63-A, the reference said, further stating that no reply or explanation was received from Senator Abro.
By voting against the direction issued by the PTI, Abro “committed a deliberate and wilful breach of party discipline“, the reference said.
The reference stated that after due consideration of the facts, the PTI, as well as its parliamentary leaders in the Senate, had concluded that the conduct of Senator Abro was “contrary to the direction issued by the PTI parliamentary party, which constitutes defection from the PTI”.
“Senator Saifullah Abro is, therefore, declared to have defected from the PTI in terms of Article 63-A.”
The PTI requested the Senate chairman to refer this declaration to the chief election commissioner “for laying it before the election commission for [a] decision in terms of Article 63-A”.
Speaking to Dawn, PTI Senator Aon Abbas Buppi said, “We are sure that the [Senate] chairman is not going to forward this reference to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). So we are also filing a reference with the ECP.“
According to Article 63-A of the Constitution, after receiving a declaration of a member’s defection, the presiding officer of a House — the Senate chairperson in this case — shall refer it to the chief election commissioner within two days.
“In case he fails to do so, it shall be deemed that he has referred the declaration to the chief election commissioner who shall lay the declaration before the election commission for its decision thereon confirming the declaration or otherwise within 30 days of its receipt by the chief election commissioner,” the provision says.
If the ECP confirms the defection, the relevant member “shall cease to be a member of the house and his seat shall become vacant“, Article 63-A states, adding that any party aggrieved by the ECP’s decision may appeal it within 30 days in the Federal Constitutional Court.
The court shall then decide the matter within 90 days from the date of the filing of the appeal, it says.
Abro’s resignation
Apart from Abro, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Senator Ahmed Khan had also voted in favour of the 27th Amendment against party line on November 10.
While the JUI-F had expelled Khan after the vote, Abro had announced his announced his resignation as a senator on the floor of the House.
Speaking on the floor of the upper house, he said he had “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces had made the nation proud by winning against India in the May conflict.
“During the passage of the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue,” he had further stated.
After he announced that he was stepping down, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani had commented, “We will make you a senator again”.
Separately, during the Senate session on November 13, 2025, Gilani had said a verbal announcement of a resignation meant nothing in legal terms. “I will call him (Abro) when he submits his resignation in writing. Maybe I will succeed in convincing him not to resign,“ he had remarked.
No further development has been reported with regards to Abro submitting his resignation in writing.
A day after Abro announced his resignation, PTI Senator Zafar, while speaking to Dawn, had said: “I have issued instructions under Article 63A. He [Senator Abro] violated them and is disqualified accordingly.”
Replying to a question, he said the party had distanced itself from Senator Abro, who had been removed from all communication channels, including the parliamentary party’s WhatsApp group.
No decision by JUI-F yet
Meanwhile, the JUI-F, after expelling Senator Khan, said he had been asked to resign from his Senate seat. If he fails to do so, the JUI-F will approach the ECP for his disqualification, the party said.

When asked about this after today’s developments, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza told Dawn that the matter was still under consideration.
“The issue is, if we file a reference with the Senate chairman to de-seat Ahmed Khan from the upper house, there is a strong chance that the Senate chairperson will not take up our case and delay it.
“This will degrade our party position,“ he said.
He further stated that if the Senate chairman would refer the reference to the ECP, a “seat which is still in our name on paper will go to the PPP or PML-N”.
“We do not want to give undue benefit to the PPP or the PML-N this way,“ he said.</p><small>2026-01-01 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0111194828e3bdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964457/aerial-firing-during-new-year-celebrations-leaves-at-least-28-karachiites-injured' target='_blank'><strong>Aerial firing during New Year celebrations leaves at least 28 Karachiites injured</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: At least 28 people were injured in celebratory aerial fire during New Year celebrations in the metropolis, Edhi said on Thursday.
Incidents of aerial firing are a routine occurrence on occasions such as Independence Day and New Year’s Eve. Last year, over two dozen citizens were wounded in celebratory aerial firing
According to the information given by Edhi, a total of 28 people were brought to hospitals across the city after suffering injuries from stray bullets, with the youngest victim being 11-years-old.

On Wednesday, Sindh police had urged citizens to refrain from aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling on New Year’s Eve. In a statement, police had also warned of strict legal action against those involved in aerial firing, calling on citizens to act responsibly.
First Lady and MNA, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, on Wednesday had also called on citizens to celebrate responsibly.
“Aerial firing costs innocent lives every year. Senseless shooting can turn moments of joy into tragedy. Be responsible and celebrate safely!” she said in a post on social media platform X.

The 34-year-old Democrat took his oath of office at an abandoned subway stop under City Hall just after midnight to take the helm of the United States’ largest city. He will be New York’s first Muslim mayor.
His office said the understated venue beneath City Hall reflected his commitment to working people, after the 34-year-old Democrat campaigned on promises to address the soaring cost of living.
NBC News reported that Mamdani took the oath with his hands on two copies of the Holy Quran — one belonging to his grandfather and the other from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Centre for Research in Black Culture.

“Happy New Year to New Yorkers, both inside this tunnel and above,” said Mamdani, standing beneath a vaulted ceiling with the words City Hall over his head. “This is truly an honour and a privilege of a lifetime.”
He also called the ornate subway station “a testament to the importance of public transit to the vitality, the health, and the legacy of our city”.
Mamdani’s private swearing-in to start his four-year term was performed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud. His wife, Rama Duwaji, was also present alongside him.

According to CNN, his parents, filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, were also in attendance.
A larger, ceremonial inauguration is scheduled later on Thursday with speeches from left-wing allies Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Around 4,000 ticketed guests are expected to attend the event outside City Hall.
Mamdani’s team has also organised a block party that it says will enable tens of thousands of people to watch the ceremony at streetside viewing areas along Broadway.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who’s in charge of America’s most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small swearing-in just after midnight.
Born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin, Mamdani moved to New York at age seven and enjoyed an elite upbringing with only a relatively brief stint in politics, becoming a member of the New York State Assembly before being elected mayor.
He is surrounding himself with seasoned aides recruited from past mayoral administrations and former US president Joe Biden’s government.

 

Mamdani has also opened dialogue with business leaders, some of whom predicted a massive exodus of wealthy New Yorkers if he won. Real estate leaders have debunked those claims.
He has promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.
Mamdani had inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than two million voters and took 50 per cent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><small>2026-01-01 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0112241256ad76f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964460/cjp-afridi-says-judiciary-to-pursue-meaningful-reforms-in-2026-to-improve-accessibility-strengthen-transparency' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi says judiciary to pursue ‘meaningful reforms’ in 2026 to improve accessibility, strengthen transparency</strong></a><br><p>In his New Year’s message, Supreme Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi has said that the judiciary will “pursue meaningful reforms” in 2026 in a bid to improve accessibility, reduce delay and strengthen transparency in the justice system.
In a message posted on the Supreme Court’s website, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Afridi conveyed his greetings to the people, members of the judiciary and the legal fraternity on the new year.
“In the coming year, the judiciary will pursue meaningful reforms aimed at improving accessibility, reducing delay, strengthening transparency, and responsibly leveraging technology in the service of justice,” he said.
He said that the efforts would be guided by “a clear focus on outcomes that matter most to the public — timely decisions, understandable processes, and courts that are approachable and humane”.
CJP Afridi maintained that it was the judiciary’s responsibility to “ensure that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done — fairly, impartially, and without delay“.

 

“This responsibility acquires deeper meaning when viewed through the lived experience of ordinary citizens who approach our courts with hope, vulnerability, and trust,” the CJP said.
He underscored that the new year called on the judiciary “to reflect, to reform, and to renew our commitment to a justice system that places the citizen at its very centre“.
He asserted that “justice must be accessible in practice, not merely in principle; dignified in process, not just in outcome; and responsive to the needs of women, children, the marginalised, and those living in remote and underserved regions”.
The CJP expressed confidence that “through collective resolve, professionalism, and integrity, the judiciary will continue to strengthen public trust and uphold the ideals enshrined in our Constitution“.
He reaffirmed the “judiciary’s unwavering commitment to serve every citizen with fairness, independence, and compassion”.
CJP Afridi hoped that the new year would “bring renewed confidence in the rule of law and a justice system that truly reaches every doorstep.”</p><small>2026-01-01 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01074636804edfc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964432/we-envision-a-promising-future-for-pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-says-pm-shehbaz-after-phone-call-with-mbs' target='_blank'><strong>We envision a promising future for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, says PM Shehbaz after phone call with MBS</strong></a><br><p>After a phone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Wednesday that the two leaders envisioned an “exciting and promising future” for both countries.
In a post on the social media platform X on Thursday morning, the premier echoed the statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) a day earlier.
Calling it a “warm and most cordial telephone conversation”, PM Shehbaz said the two “reaffirmed our shared commitment to further strengthening the long-standing fraternal bonds between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which have attained new heights in recent months”.
“While expressing Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the kingdom, we also exchanged views on the regional situation, emphasising the need for unity within the Ummah and maintaining regional peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy,” he said.







PM Shehbaz said he was “grateful” to the Saudi crown prince, who reaffirmed the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest and also “shared his intention to undertake an official visit to Pakistan in the coming year”.
“Together, we envision an exciting and promising future for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
A similar statement was also issued by the PMO a day earlier, when the premier had also met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmad Al-Malkiy at the Prime Minister’s House to discuss regional and global developments.
The prime minister reiterated the need to maintain peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy.
He expressed satisfaction over bilateral relations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further deepening ties, while appreciating Saudi Arabia’s support for Pakistan and its role in promoting regional peace and stability, the statement said.
The prime minister recalled his meetings with the crown prince during the year, which he said had been highly productive and contributed significantly to elevating Pak-Saudi ties to new levels.
He also expressed deep appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s consistent support to Pakistan in times of need and its constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability.
Ambassador Al-Malkiy conveyed greetings from the Saudi leadership and reiterated the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.</p><small>2026-01-01 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01074457cea6f81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964391/afghan-border-closure-brings-down-terrorist-violence-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan border closure brings down terrorist violence in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has recorded a significant drop in cross-border terrorist attacks and violence-linked fatalities after it closed down the border to Afghanistan on October 11.
Terrorist attacks went down by almost 17 per cent in December, preceded by 9pc decline in November. Terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials also fell in the last quarter of 2025, by nearly 4pc and 19pc each in November and December, shows data collected by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of its annual security report 2025.

 

With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, the year 2025 went by as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, says the report. The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with almost 38pc in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024, and 34pc in 2025.
The comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveals a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2555 in 2024 to 3417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34pc year-on-year surge in violence.

CRSS report says most significant surge in violence recorded in KP

The most significant surge in violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the fatalities rose from 1620 in 2024 to 2331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.
Balochistan also had an upward trend, with fatalities increasing from 787 to 956; an additional 169 deaths, which are nearly 22pc higher than the previous year’s figures.
Regional impact of violence
Violence remained heavily concentrated in the country’s northwestern KP and southwestern Balochistan provinces, with both accounting for over 96pc of all fatalities and almost 93pc of violent incidents recorded during the entire 2025.
KP was the worst-hit region, suffering over 68pc (2331) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and around 63pc (795) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, accounting for 28pc (956) of the fatalities and over 30pc (386) of the incidents of violence.

 

In contrast, Punjab and Sindh experienced comparatively lower levels of violence. The former recorded 25 incidents of violence resulting in 40 fatalities and 24 injuries, representing just 1.15pc of total casualties, while the latter saw 51 incidents causing 56 fatalities and 40 injuries; 1.73pc of the total.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory though incidents numbers remained minimal, the injury figures were relatively high, with the former recording 103 injuries, and the latter registering 38, from just five incidents at each location.
Gilgit-Baltistan remained the least affected region. Compared to last year, though small in absolute numbers, the region recorded a four-fold increase from one to four fatalities.

Mirabai and Ghalib stamps, mentioned in Adeeb’s 1952 letter, that are part of the ‘Indian Saints and Poets’ series | Photos from the writer's collection

 
In a letter dated November 22, 1952, Professor Syed Masood Hasan Rizvi Adeeb of Lucknow writes to Allama Syed Murtaza Hussain Fazil Lakhnawi, “Yesterday, I sent you a registered letter in your name. It bears two postage stamps, one with Ghalib’s portrait and the other with Mirabai’s. The postmark has been placed in such a way that Ghalib’s picture has not been marred. Since you collect everything related to Ghalib, you should keep this stamp safe as well.” 
This very stamp and the letter are still preserved in good condition. A faded Lahore post office mark on this stamp reads as “…53, Lahore”, indicating its arrival in Lahore in January 1953.
Fazil Lakhnawi, the editor of centenary editions of Ghalib’s collected works in Persian, Urdu-i-Mu’alla and Oud-i-Hindi, was an avid admirer of Ghalib and had a large collection centred around the poet, consisting of the first editions of his works, along with some of his letters and manuscripts. Adeeb was obviously aware of his passion. 
Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, one of the greatest Urdu and Persian poets, is honoured on postage stamps in Pakistan and India as part of their shared cultural and linguistic heritage. To my knowledge, he is not only the first Urdu poet depicted on postal stamps, but also among the earliest Persian poets to appear on them.

EVOLUTION OF COMMEMORATIVE STAMPS
Postage stamps soon acquired a commemorative role after their introduction in the 19th century. With the adoption of adhesive stamps, postal systems gained a visual medium through which states could mark events, represent authority and honour figures of public importance. Although stamps were introduced as a practical means of pre-paid correspondence, they gradually assumed a broader function, carrying images and messages that reflected political authority, official memory and national identity.
The first stamps used in the Subcontinent were the Scinde Dawk [Sindh Daak] of 1852, issued in Sindh under the administration of the East India Company, followed by the first all-India issues in 1854. From that point onward and throughout most of British rule, Indian postage stamps generally carried the portrait of the reigning British monarch, a convention that continued until Independence in 1947.
Over time, stamps moved beyond their immediate postal purpose and began to reflect historical and cultural themes. By the early 20th century, many postal administrations were issuing commemorative stamps to mark anniversaries, prominent individuals and cultural achievements. Poets and scholars gradually became part of this visual record, signalling a growing recognition of their place in public life.
It is within this broader development — from postal utility to cultural commemoration — that Ghalib’s appearance on stamps in India and Pakistan should be understood.
The first stamp, mentioned in the letter, was issued in India as part of a six-stamp series titled “Indian Saints and Poets.” Ghalib was featured on a 4½ anna mauve stamp, the penultimate one of this series. It was issued on October 1, 1952, featuring images of Kabir (15th century), Tulsidas (16th-17th century), Mirabai (15th-16th century), Surdas (16th century), Ghalib (18th-19th century) and Rabindranath Tagore (19th-20th century). It was the second such series in India to feature portraits of individual personalities on postage stamps, the first being the 1948 Gandhi commemorative series.

THE CENTENARY YEAR
The year 1969 marked the centenary of Ghalib’s death, which was commemorated in Pakistan, India and the Soviet Union. Special editions of his works, including the mentioned centenary editions, were published. Iran also played a role in this event. The Collected Persian works of Ghalib, Kulliyat-i-Ghalib Farsi, by Fazil Lakhnawi, along with select other Persian works, was jointly commissioned by the governments of Iran and Pakistan. It was published by the Majlis-i-Taraqqi-i-Adab Lahore, with a photo of the Pahlavi Crown of Iran before the title page. It was the first critical edition of Ghalib’s Persian works.
Many other books and special issues were also published on this occasion in both Pakistan and India. Majlis-i-Yadgar-i-Ghalib in Lahore also published special editions of his works. In Karachi, the Ghalib Library was established that same year by the Idara-i-Yadgar-i-Ghalib. 
In India, the Ghalib Academy was also established beside his burial site in Delhi by Hakeem Abdul Hameed, the elder brother of Hakeem Muhammad Saeed. Alongside these activities and efforts, the governments of Pakistan and India issued separate stamps to commemorate this occasion.

On February 15, 1969, Pakistan issued a pair of 15- and 50-paisa stamps, designed by artist Abdul Rauf, featuring a portrait of Ghalib wearing his famous long woollen hat, set against a Mughal-style floral border on the right. The left side, with a geometric pattern background, bears the text, including the occasion of this issue in English, “DEATH CENTENARY OF GHALIB 1797-1869”, in two lines with different couplets on each stamp. 
It was Pakistan’s first pictorial stamp featuring a human portrait; although Pakistan had already issued stamps in honour of the Quaid-i-Azam and Allama Iqbal, none of them featured a portrait. An official cancellation stamp was also beautifully designed and used on the first-day covers, featuring a couplet by Ghalib.
Two days later, India also issued a single 20-paisa stamp, bearing his left-facing portrait wearing a black cap, an impression of his personal seal dated 1278 AH, and a portion of his handwritten letter in the background. The black border bears the words “Ghalib” and “India” in English and Hindi, alongside his dates of birth and death.

SUBSEQUENT PAKISTANI STAMPS 
Another stamp was issued in Pakistan on February 15, 1998, designed by Faizi Amir and Saeed Akhtar, depicting the same image of Ghalib from the previous series, with different colours and a caption: “DEATH ANNIVERSARY OF MIRZA ASAD ULLAH KHAN GHALIB.” 
This stamp served as a belated commemoration of the bicentenary of his birth, which was on December 27, 1997. Ideally, this stamp should have been issued on this occasion rather than on his 129th death anniversary. This delay, however, does not diminish the significance of the issue or the effort behind it.
The most recent stamp about Ghalib was issued on the occasion of Mirza’s 150th death anniversary. According to litterateur Dr Aqeel Abbas Jafri, he sent a letter to the Pakistan Post authorities, requesting that they issue a stamp on this occasion. The request was accepted, and they asked him to write a note and suggest a Ghalib verse for this purpose. 
This correspondence is preserved in his personal archives. Finally, an eight-rupee stamp, designed by Liaquat Ali, was issued on February 15, 2019, preserving his portrait from previous issues, with a couplet in his honour and an English caption on the right side, noting the occasion.

GHALIB AS CORRESPONDENT
While Mirza Ghalib is celebrated multiple times on postage stamps, one wonders whether he himself ever used stamps on his letters. He was a passionate correspondent and his letters have been largely preserved and studied and influenced Urdu and Persian literature. Stamps were introduced and widely used in British India in the last years of Ghalib’s life, but very few of the envelopes he sent are preserved; therefore, this question may require a detailed study.
However, it’s noteworthy to examine two of his envelopes, published by Fazil Lakhnawi in March 1972 in Sahifa, Lahore. These envelopes, along with the letters written by Ghalib’s own hand, are preserved at the Lahore Museum. These letters were addressed to Mirza Alauddin Khan Alaa’i, a pupil of Mirza, who later became the Nawab of Loharu state. These envelopes were sent on July 6, 1862 and July 13, 1864. 
Apparently, postage stamps were already introduced at that time, but they may not have yet been widely used. Instead of adhesive stamps, these envelopes bear one anna post office stamps, indicating the postal fee for a letter from Delhi to Loharu. They also bear postal markings from the Delhi and Loharu post offices.
These stamps are part of a cultural heritage not bound by national borders, as Mirza Ghalib not only does not belong to one city, country or nation but has also contributed to global literature as a whole. His works have been translated into multiple languages and he is celebrated in different countries.
In this sense, the stamps and letters together trace not only Ghalib in public memory, but also the quiet ways in which literature enters everyday circulation.
