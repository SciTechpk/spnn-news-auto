The Mina Emergency Hospital is one of 15 such facilities operating just a few weeks a year around the annual pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest sites, which in 2024 saw more than 1,300 people die in the desert heat.
Saudi authorities hope to head off a fatal repeat of last year’s pilgrimage when temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius.
 
 

Temperatures this year are forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, officially commences on Wednesday.
So far, authorities have recorded 44 cases of heat exhaustion.
Abdullah Asiri, Saudi Arabia’s deputy minister for population health, told AFP at the Mina hospital that “the focus is on heat-related conditions because the Haj coincides with extreme heat”.
Brimming with staff but no patients just yet, the hospital is part of the kingdom’s efforts to prepare for “the worst case scenario” after pilgrims descend on Mina, Asiri said.

Defying the scorching heat, pilgrims have already started to flock to Makkah.
As of Sunday, more than 1.4 million pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the multi-day pilgrimage, according to officials.
Makkah’s Grand Mosque is serviced by the largest cooling system in the world, according to Saudi state television, with enormous fans and cooled pavements dotting the massive complex.
But outside, hiding from the heat can prove challenging.
Increased capacity
Some pilgrims wear caps or carry umbrellas, but others walk on foot without any protection from the sun, like Palestinian Rabah Mansour, 70, who said that after a lifetime of working outside as a farmer, “heat doesn’t bother me”.
“I have been working in the fields since I was a child,” he said, as sweat trickled down his face.
While many pilgrims may be overcome with religious fervour, Asiri warned devotees against unnecessarily exposing themselves to harsh conditions.
Badr Shreiteh, another Palestinian pilgrim, told AFP that he believed such hardships on the Haj trail would increase the blessings he reaps.
“As you can see, we’re dripping with sweat,” he said, adding: “The more hardship we endure, the more reward we gain.”
According to Asiri, of the health ministry, a total of 50,000 healthcare workers and administrative staff have been mobilised for the Haj, far exceeding previous years’ numbers.
More than 700 hospital beds are ready, equipped with fans to treat severe cases of heat illnesses.
“Capacity this year has been expanded by more than 60 per cent compared to last year,” Asiri said, expecting greater numbers of patients.
“That’s why we are doing all of these measures,” he said.
Last year, medical staff treated 2,764 pilgrims for heat exhaustion and other heat-related conditions, according to the health ministry.
‘Challenge’
To prevent people from needing hospitalisation in the first place, 71 emergency medical points have been set up around Makkah’s holy sites with a focus on “treating patients on the ground before their case deteriorates”, said Asiri.
On the second day of Haj, pilgrims will head to Mount Arafat, climbing it and reciting prayers for the whole day.
Asiri said pilgrims can stay in the shade.
“Most of the heat-related illnesses that happen in Arafat is because people think that they must be under the sun,” he said.
“You don’t have to be outside your tent during Arafat. You don’t have to climb the mountain,” he added, citing no religious obligation to do so, “and it’s very risky from a health point of view”.
Haj Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told AFP earlier that thousands of misting fans and more than 400 water cooling units have been deployed.
Authorities built cooled walkways, including a newly completed four-kilometre pathway leading to Arafat.
Last year’s Haj deaths were a high-profile example of the havoc wrought by heat in 2024, which the Copernicus Climate Change Service said was the hottest ever recorded.
Abdul Majid Ati, from the Philippines, said there is “extreme heat, but there are also times that we are inside the (Grand mosque) — it’s extreme cold because of the tiles and of the aircon”.
“We take this as a challenge and a test of our moral character. “</p><small>2025-06-03 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03182412dbd0b47.jpg?r=182646' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915195/cybercrime-agency-busts-child-sexual-exploitation-gang-in-muzaffargarh' target='_blank'><strong>Cybercrime agency busts child sexual exploitation gang in Muzaffargarh</strong></a><br><p>National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh district, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry made the revelation during a press conference in Islamabad, saying the NICCIA has uncovered a “huge network” during an operation conducted on May 23.
He said an international gang masterminded by a German citizen was operating a child sexual exploitation group in Muzaffargarh where children were groomed.
“They set up a small club where children aged 6-10 years were taught games. They provided state-of-the-art facilities and modern cameras,” he said.
He added that children from disadvantaged families were “brought there, given money, and then blackmailed” to exploit them, and “their videos were uploaded on the dark web daily and sold for thousands of dollars.”
“Some videos were live-streamed and seen around the world from Muzaffargarh,” the state minister said. “The network was run by a German national and all efforts will be made to arrest him.”
Providing further information, he said fifty children had been victimised by the grooming gang, while “ten children were recovered and six were handed over to the child protection bureau.”
He mentioned that on May 23, the NCCIA launched an operation lasting five hours with assistance from other agencies, as a result of which two suspects were arrested.
“Unfortunately, the families and parents of some children were also involved in the nefarious crime and action has been initiated against them as well,” Chaudhry said.
He said the NCCIA had been working diligently against financial scams, harassment, and other cybercrime, adding that financial scams had become common due to the easy availability of mobile phones and the agency had been taking action after receiving complaints.
The minister went on to say that the workforce of the agency should be increased threefold and a branch should be set up in every district. “The interior minister and prime minister have been requested to increase funds for the NCCIA in the budget,” he said.
Chaudhry added that an international organisation, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), provides information and the NCCIA takes prompt action.
He detailed that 178 first information reports have been lodged against child exploitation, 198 suspects have been arrested, and fourteen were jailed between four to ten years.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ‘Cruel Numbers 2024’ by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p><small>2025-06-03 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03180953a9e10e6.jpg?r=181054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915197/cm-murad-notes-faint-tremors-good-thing-as-seismic-activity-continues-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad notes faint tremors ‘good thing’ as seismic activity continues in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said low-intensity tremors helped prevent major earthquakes as he attempted to allay panic caused by the recent seismic activity that continued for the third day in Karachi.
The metropolis continued to witness faint tremors today, taking the tally since Sunday to 20, according to data provided by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Experts have previously pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
“I have also studied engineering […] these (low-scale tremors) are a good thing. The earth is releasing its energy,” CM Shah said, responding to reporters’ queries about yesterday’s jail break incident in Karachi.
He explained that if the earth releases its seismic energy altogether, it could result in a major earthquake. “But if it releases in bits, then it is better — nothing is actually better — but saves us from a big disaster,” Murad added.
The most recent tremor occurred at 11:52am and measured 2.0 on the Richter scale, with its epicentre located 23 kilometres east of Malir, according to the PMD’s data.
Since Sunday — when the series of minor quakes began — the total of tremors recorded near Malir is nine, five near the Defence Housing Authority, three near Quaidabad, along with one each near Gadap Town, Korangi and DHA City on the outskirts of Karachi.
The 3.6-magnitude jolt from Sunday evening was the most significant, while the lowest measured was of 2.0 magnitude from today morning.
Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari pointed out yesterday that there was a historical fault line which has become activated, causing frequent earthquakes in the city.
He said the fault is releasing its seismic energy, and when it’s spent, the tremors’ magnitude will reduce. Laghari added he expected the small-scale jolts to end within a week.
Murad’s remarks today echoed opinions voiced by Laghari and other experts, who have said that the chances of a major quake in Karachi are low.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Eurasian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.
Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University’s Department of Geography said an imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. He added that the quakes will likely stop when a balance between the plates has been achieved.
 
 

Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU’s Department of Geology, noted that a huge earthquake was unlikely in Karachi as the city was situated far from active plate boundaries.
“Karachi lies on what’s called a ‘passive margin’, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,” he added.
Dr Imran explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimetres every year in the Himalayan region.
At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure, and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, causing earthquakes.
The country had witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
In April, jolts were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — twice that month.</p><small>2025-06-03 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03172324e8f83e8.jpg?r=172341' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915187/fact-check-tiktoker-couple-mashal-khan-and-meena-khan-have-not-been-shot-dead-are-alive-and-well' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: TikToker couple Mashal Khan and Meena Khan have not been shot dead, are alive and well</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users on multiple social media platforms since Monday alleged that TikToker Mashal Khan and his wife Meena Khan from Peshawar were shot dead. However, both are still alive and well.
A day ago, 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf was shot dead at her home by an unidentified man who entered her house and shot her in the chest. She was popular on TikTok and Instagram, with over a million combined followers
Today, a user on X claimed that TikTok influencer Mashal Khan and his wife Meena Khan had been shot dead.
The caption of the post said: “Peshawar TikTokers Mashal Khan and his wife Meena Khan were shot dead, while Chitral TikToker Sana Yousaf was also killed in Islamabad.”
The user made derogatory remarks, blaming people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and a specific Muslim sect for the incidents.
The post was viewed over 17,200 times.
The same claim was shared by other users as can be seen here, here and here on X, and here and here on Facebook.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim in light of its nature and timing, coinciding with the 17-year-old Yousaf’s killing with keen public interest in the matter.
Mashal and Meena have separate TikTok accounts, with 90,000 and 1.1 million followers, respectively. The couple is known for creating videos together, often set to Pashto songs.
A keyword search for “TikToker”, “Mashal Khan”, “Meena Khan” and “dead” yielded no results from any credible national or local news outlets that covered the alleged murder.
Reviewing their TikTok accounts to check for recent activity showed that the accounts posted many videos on Monday and Tuesday
Furthermore, a June 2 video was found on Mashal’s TikTok account where the couple addressed and debunked the viral rumour.
  @mashal.khan.mk0 Fake news de da videos share kai plz#foryoupageofficiall #foryou #viral ♬ original sound - Mashal Khan MK  
They said they intended to take legal action against those responsible for spreading the false rumours and would be filing a complaint with the Federal Investigation Agency’s Cybercrime Wing today.
The couple said the false rumour caused panic and distress within their family, prompting relatives to rush to their home and call them repeatedly.
“This entire situation disturbed us deeply and caused mental stress,” Meena said in the video.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that social media influencer Peshawari couple Mashal and Meena were shot dead around the same time as the similar murder of Yousaf in Islamabad is false. The couple is still alive and well.

The minister virtually addressed the meeting of SCO Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors held in Beijing, saying he was unable to attend due to the ongoing annual budget session in Pakistan.
In his address, the finance minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s dedication to the vision and principles of the SCO. “He emphasised that the SCO is an essential platform for promoting regional cooperation, enhancing economic ties, and working towards shared prosperity, in line with the “Shanghai Spirit” and the SCO Charter,” the statement said.
The minister highlighted Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to strengthen economic cooperation within the SCO framework, calling for increased collaboration in trade, investment, and financial integration.
He proposed initiatives such as joint ventures, technology transfer, and capacity-building programmes that could deliver mutual benefits to all member states.
Aurangzeb reiterated Pakistan’s strong support for the establishment of the SCO Development Bank, describing it as a “pivotal institution to support infrastructure financing, promote development, and deepen regional economic integration.”
“Pakistan strongly supports its establishment. The bank will provide a vital source of funding for infrastructure and development projects, enhancing regional connectivity, and economic integration,” he was quoted in the statement as saying.
He envisioned the Bank as forward-looking, incorporating digital finance, fintech innovation, and green financing tools into its operations. Pakistan looks forward to actively contributing to the technical discussions surrounding its establishment, he said.
“We envision the bank as an institution for innovation, integrating digital finance, digital solutions and green financing mechanisms into its core operations, and look forward to engaging on the technical details of the establishment of the SCO development bank.”
He also welcomed the operationalisation of the SCO Network of Financial Think Tanks, recognising it as a timely initiative that will foster evidence-based research, strategic foresight, and policy coordination among member states, that will “serve as an excellent platform for regional analysis and strategic foresight in our financial cooperation”.
He further emphasised Pakistan’s continued reform efforts which have led to notable macroeconomic stability and laid the foundation for sustainable and inclusive economic growth, per the statement.
These reforms, particularly in the areas of fiscal discipline, improvements in key economic indicators, reduction of the current account deficit, exchange rate stabilisation, and increased investor confidence, were highlighted as examples of Pakistan’s progress.
“Pakistan has made significant progress over the last year on the macroeconomic stability front. We registered a current account surplus, the primary surplus on the fiscal side, stable currency on the back of growing foreign exchange reserves, and inflation on a multi-year low … We have seen sovereign credit upgrades by international rating agencies. This is on the back of structural reforms which are well underway on the taxation side, on the energy side, SOEs, and in the public finance space,” he said.
Recognising the growing importance of the digital economy, he outlined Pakistan’s digital financial initiatives aimed at promoting inclusion and expanding access to capital. He pointed to programmes like Roshan Digital Accounts and digital banking platforms, which have shown notable success in widening access to financial services.
The finance minister stressed that the global economy is currently facing multiple challenges, including sluggish growth, rising inequality, and climate change. He underscored the need for collective action among SCO member states to address these issues and to ensure that the benefits of sustainable development are equitably shared among all countries in the region.
He noted that SCO member states can learn from one another’s experiences and successful policy models, especially those tailored to the unique needs of the developing world.
“Pakistan remains fully supportive of regional initiatives that aim to deliver long-term, sustainable development outcomes,” he said.
In conclusion, Aurangzeb reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to deepening economic cooperation under the SCO framework.
He expressed confidence that continued collaboration and mutual support among SCO member states would “help unlock regional economic potential, promote resilience, and ensure a more inclusive and sustainable future for the entire region.”
China’s Minister of Finance and the Governor of the People’s Bank of China acknowledged Pakistan’s economic progress and commended the Government of Pakistan for successfully stabilising the economy and advancing its reform agenda.
The SCO was established in 2001 and has nine member states, including China, Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan as its founding members while Pakistan, India and Iran joined the organisation in 2017.</p><small>2025-06-03 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/031654439ea6b08.jpg?r=170634' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915192/nigeria-flooding-death-toll-jumps-past-200' target='_blank'><strong>Nigeria flooding death toll jumps past 200</strong></a><br><p>Flash flooding in north-central Nigeria last week killed more than 200 people, the Niger state humanitarian commissioner said Tuesday, while hundreds more remain missing and are feared dead.
The town of Mokwa was hit with the worst flash flood in living memory Thursday from overnight rains, with more than 250 homes destroyed and swathes of the town wiped out in a single morning.
The announcement comes after several days of the official toll standing at around 150, even as residents were sometimes missing more than a dozen members in a single family.
“We have more than 200 … corpses,” Ahmad Suleiman told Nigerian broadcaster Channels Television, adding: “Nobody can tell you the number of casualties in Niger state right now because up till now, we are still looking for some corpses.”
“We’re still looking for more,” he added. But, he said, “sincerely speaking, we cannot ascertain.”
Given the number of people still missing nearly a week later, the toll from a single morning of flooding in Mokwa could be worse than all of 2024 combined, which saw 321 deaths from flooding across the country.
Climate change has made weather swings in Nigeria more extreme, but residents in Mokwa said human factors were also at play.
 
 

Water had been building up for days behind an abandoned railway track that runs along the edge of the town, residents told AFP.
Floodwaters would usually pass through a couple of culverts in the mounds and run into a narrow channel. But debris had blocked the culverts, forcing water to build up behind the clay walls that eventually gave way.
Floods in Nigeria are often exacerbated by inadequate drainage, the construction of homes on waterways and the dumping of waste in drains and water channels.
Volunteers and disaster response teams have recovered bodies nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) away after they were swept into the Niger River.
Days before the disaster struck Mokwa, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency had warned of possible flash floods in 15 of Nigeria’s 36 states, including Niger state, between Wednesday and Friday.
When AFP reporters visited the town earlier this week, a powerful stench filled the air, which residents said came from decaying corpses trapped under the rubble.
The government said it has delivered aid, but locals have criticised what they say is a lacklustre response, with multiple families telling AFP they hadn’t received anything.</p><small>2025-06-03 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/031105475459269.png?r=111128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/faisalabad-man-held-for-murder-of-17-year-old-social-media-influencer-in-islamabad-ig' target='_blank'><strong>Faisalabad man held for murder of 17-year-old social media influencer in Islamabad: IG</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad police said on Tuesday they have arrested the main suspect in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, a day after she was shot dead in her house.
A first information report (FIR) had been filed yesterday evening at the Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The teenager was well-known for her social media activities, with nearly 800,000 followers on her TikTok account and almost 500,000 on her Instagram account.
Addressing a press conference, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said the culprit was a 22-year-old man arrested from Faisalabad and termed it a case of “repeated rejections”.
“A beast, cold-blooded murderer is now in the law’s grip,” IG Rizvi announced, adding that the man had tried to contact Sana repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The police chief said the culprit wanted to establish contact with the social media influencer and “become friends” with her.
IG Rizvi described the man as having done matriculation and hailing from a lower-middle-income family, with “no source of income”.
The IG highlighted that the police conducted 11 raids — three in the federal capital and the rest in various cities of Punjab, with multiple raids in the Faisalabad district.
He detailed that the suspect had taken Sana’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered, along with the weapon of offence.
IG Rizvi noted that the man had “tried his best to contact” Sana on her birthday on May 29. “He reached her home and tried to meet her for seven to eight hours but failed.”
The officer added that yesterday, the culprit made another similar attempt for the same amount of time but could not succeed. “First, it was a cellular rejection. Now, it was a physical mode of rejection.”
Rizvi asserted it was “necessary to give a clear message that if any of our sister or daughter or youngster is becoming a social media influencer, and pursuing it as a profession, […] as a hobby and even as their bread and butter, we have to encourage it”.
 
 

The Islamabad police chief termed the murder a “very challenging case”, stressing that arresting the perpetrator in the “shortest time possible was necessary”.
“It was a blind murder; there was no clue, things were not clear, and it was further attempted to give it another angle, even though the aim of taking the mobile was to wipe out the clues,” he said, listing the hurdles faced by the police.
IG Rizvi appreciated members of the social, electronic and print media, stating that “many leads” came from journalists, who “offered their services in analysing social media”.
He also hailed seven police teams, as well as officials of the Crime Investigation Agency, for their efforts.
Earlier today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed the arrest in a post on X.
“The incident occurred yesterday in Islamabad when a young girl was murdered by a masked accused,” the minister said, adding that the suspect was arrested at around 12pm.
Naqvi stated that the police have recovered the murder weapon and pistol from the man, as well as the mobile phone used by the slain girl. The suspect has confessed to the murder, he added.
 






In the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
She added that two shots struck Sana in her chest, injuring her severely. The girl was taken to a hospital but she had succumbed to her wounds, the FIR added.
The mother described the suspect as having a “smart appearance, moderate physique and height”, and dressed in a black shirt and pants. She asserted that she and her sister-in-law, Lateefa Shah, were eyewitnesses to the incident and could identify the suspect if they saw him in person.
Farzana detailed that her 15-year-old son was not present at the house as he had gone to their native village in Upper Chitral, while her sister-in-law was visiting them for a few days.
 
 

In January, a man who recently brought his family back to Quetta from the United States confessed to shooting his 15-year-old daughter dead, motivated by his disapproval of her TikTok content, according to police.
The same month, two TikToker men died in separate incidents in Lahore after their pistols went off accidentally in Lahore.
More than 54 million people use TikTok in Pakistan, with authorities blocking the video-sharing app several times in recent years over content deemed objectionable.
The platform was banned four times in 2021 alone. It is currently accessible, with stringent moderation in place and complying with requests to remove certain content.</p><small>2025-06-03 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0312070154dfbf8.jpg?r=124704' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh IG says 78 of 213 escaped prisoners from Karachi’s Malir jail recaptured</strong></a><br><p>Over two hundred inmates managed to escape from District Prison Malir in Karachi last night, the Sindh police chief confirmed on Tuesday, adding that 78 were recaptured while one was shot dead.
Police officials earlier said the prisoners broke through the jail’s outer wall, which had been weakened due to the multiple low-intensity tremors felt in the area since Sunday. Police cordoned off the whole area and no one was allowed to enter or leave without ascertaining their identity.
Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon on Tuesday told Dawn.com that over 200 prisoners managed to escape from Malir prison late on Monday night when they were brought out from their barracks for counting due to an earthquake, out of them 78 were recaptured while teams are being constituted to re-arrest the remaining 138.
Memon, who visited the jail earlier today, said that as per his assessment and briefings of jail and police officials, after the earthquake in the area, the jail administration brought an estimated 2,000 prisoners languishing in the jail from their barracks for counting at around 12:45am.
“Most of the prisoners were drug addicts,” he noted. “The addicts’ state of mind is such that they tend to develop mob psychology. Thus, when such an atmosphere was created inside the prison, the prisoners ran by opening the door of the jail,” he elaborated.
The police chief said FC personnel deployed at the prison resorted to massive aerial firing to push them back. He said the FC fired an estimated 700 shots. He said there were an estimated 2,000 prisoners, and 213 of them managed to escape.
The law enforcers launched an operation, recapturing 78 prisoners. “During the action, one prisoner was shot dead while two others were injured,” confirmed the Sindh IG. He said the situation was now under control.

The Sindh police head said they are setting up teams to re-arrest the remaining 138 escaped prisoners. “One of the escaped prisoners was brought back to the jail by his mother,” he added. The police and jail administration had information about all escaped prisoners.
To a question, the provincial police head opined ostensibly there would be “some lapses” and the prisoners, finding an opportunity, managed to escape.
However, he said the Sindh government has decided to set up an inquiry committee to ascertain the circumstances which led to the incident and fix responsibility for it.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that one unidentified prisoner aged around 45 years old was brought dead to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre with a firearm injury. He was pronounced dead on arrival. “Doctors are waiting for police papers to conduct his post-mortem,” she added
The police surgeon said four other prisoners with gunshot injuries were also brought to the hospital for treatment.
They were identified as Mohammed Tahir, aged 28, who sustained a bullet injury on his left arm with no exit wound; Abdul Hadi, aged 25, who suffered firearm wounds on his hip joint and thigh; and the third prisoner, 35-year-old Akhter Naeem, who got a gunshot wound on his glutes.
The police surgeon said two policemen — namely Sikander, aged 22, and Mohammed Shamraiz, aged 40 — were also injured during the assault by the prisoners, adding that they were brought to the hospital for treatment of abrasions on their feet, back and neck pain.
While addressing a press conference in Karachi, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said that the government has removed the inspector general (IG) of prisons and the deputy inspector general (DIG) of prisons. “The new IG will be appointed today, and an inquiry committee will be formed as well,” he said.
He assured that there was no reason to panic or worry over the incident, emphasising that the police and FC personnel had “bravely” worked through the night to capture the inmates.
When asked by a reporter if this was an act of terrorism, he said it was not, highlighting that the jailbreak followed the earthquake tremors. Memon also reiterated that he would wait for the inquiry committee’s report.
The senior minister urged the parents of the inmates to tell them to surrender themselves.
CM Murad vows probe into ‘wrong decision’ to let prisoners out of cells
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah termed the incident “alarming” and asserted that action would be taken against those who made the “wrong” decision to let the prisoners gather in the open ground.
Responding to media queries after an event in Karachi, CM Murad said: “I do not want to say anything judgmental, but my initial thought is that it was wrong to let them out [into the ground].”
He detailed that jolts of such minor magnitude were a “good thing” as the earth releases its seismic energy in bits instead of a massive quake.
Stating that there were “some concerns” among the prisoners amid earthquakes yesterday, the Sindh CM noted that no one was usually allowed to be outside their cells after 6pm but the inmates were last night, due to which they assembled into a mob.

Murad said: “Definitely, those who made this wrong decision would be punished […] There are more than 6000 prisoners in the Malir jail.
“As far as I know, they also snatched weapons and there was also firing,” Murad noted, adding that one prisoner died.
CM Murad said the incident would be investigated, highlighting that most of those who escaped had “committed petty crimes” and, according to the latest details, there was no “major terrorist or foreigner” among them.
“My request to them (escaped prisoners) would be to surrender, otherwise, their involvement in the jail break incident will amount to terrorism or bigger cases,” he added.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar had also visited the Malir prison last night. Sindh Prisons Minister Ali Hasan Zardari had earlier taken notice of the jailbreak and sought a report from the IG and DIG prisons.
IG Memon telephoned and discussed the incident with Sindh Prisons IG Qazi Nazir, said a statement issued by the police chief’s spokesperson Syed Saad Ali.
Memon said police will provide all possible support to recapture the escaped prisoners. “Due to the timely response of police and other law enforcement agencies, many prisoners were immediately caught,” he said.
“Prisoners of drugs and minor offences are kept in Malir jail,” he said, adding that the Prisons Department and Malir Jail administration kept a complete record of every prisoner.
He continued that police teams have been formed to arrest the escaped prisoners. The senior superintendent of Malir police also gave a detailed briefing about the measures being taken to arrest the escaped prisoners. He said police cordoned off the entire area after the jailbreak.</p><small>2025-06-03 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/031410128617160.jpg?r=141216' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915182/fertiliser-companies-fined-rs375m-for-anti-competitive-conduct' target='_blank'><strong>Fertiliser companies fined Rs375m for ‘anti-competitive conduct’</strong></a><br><p>The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) on Tuesday imposed fines of Rs375 million on fertiliser companies for “anti-competitive conduct”.
“The Competition Commission of Pakistan has taken decisive action against anti-competitive conduct in the fertiliser sector, imposing a penalty of Rs50 million on each of the six major urea manufacturers,” said a press release by the CCP.
It added that it also penalised a leading industry association Rs75m, totalling Rs375m in fines.
The CCP said that following a detailed inquiry-initiated suo motu, the Commission’s bench comprising Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu and Mr Salam Amin determined that six urea manufacturing companies — Fatima Fertiliser Limited, Fauji Fertiliser Company Limited, Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited, Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited, Engro Fertiliser Company Limited and Agritech Limited — in coordination with their trade association, Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC), were involved in anti-competitive conduct.
 
 

“Under the guise of conducting an awareness campaign/advertisement, [they] have effectively fixed the price of urea across the country. Such conduct goes beyond the bounds of lawful information dissemination and enters into the realm of anti-competitive behaviour in violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010,” the press release said.
Despite claiming price independence, the manufacturers failed to justify their synchronised pricing strategy. The Commission’s “investigation uncovered that the conduct not only distorted competition but also harmed farmers across Pakistan, especially during the critical Rabi and Kharif seasons, by artificially influencing fertiliser prices and limiting market choice”.
“The respondents’ attempt to claim protection under the ‘state action doctrine’ was also rejected. The bench held that no formal government directive or compulsion existed to justify their collusive behaviour,” the statement said.
The CCP osberbed that the respondents took advantage of a federal government direction regarding initiating an awareness campaign encouraging farmers regarding urea price and used it as a tool to fix the price in due coordination among themselves and jointly announced the uniform price for the urea consumers.
The bench also held that such “actions, under the pretext of complying with government instructions, effectively undermined market forces and distorted competitive pricing mechanisms”.
It was also noted with great concern that all respondents were charging an identical price for the size of a urea bag bag — Rs1,768, despite significant variations in input costs, different economies of scale, size of the market, different prices of gas, etc.
The bench further observed that “in a market where each undertaking’s production capacity and market share are matters of common knowledge, such a coordinated disclosure cannot be viewed as incidental or competitively benign. Rather, the joint announcement constitutes an overt manifestation of concerted conduct”, according to the press release.
Moreover, repeated directions from the Fertiliser Review Committee were given to the respondents to address their failure to manage supply imbalances.
Previously as well, warnings were issued by the Commission to the fertiliser Manufacturers and FMPAC in the years 2010, 2012 and 2014; however, they failed to produce any lasting change, according to the CCP.
The chairman reiterated the commission’s message that associations across the country should not provide a platform for sharing price-sensitive information or the exchange of views on prices.
Last month, in a significant move to curb deceptive marketing practices, the CCP had imposed a hefty fine on a housing society for false and misleading advertisements.
Through a cautionary notice, the CCP had also warned undertakings of financial penalties of up to Rs75 million or 10 per cent of annual turnover if they enter into prohibited agreements without seeking prior exemption.</p><small>2025-06-03 09:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03141032d4e892b.png?r=141149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915162/india-used-pahalgam-attack-as-pretext-for-unlawful-military-actions-bilawal-led-team-tells-oic-envoys' target='_blank'><strong>India used Pahalgam attack as pretext for unlawful military actions, Bilawal-led team tells OIC envoys</strong></a><br><p>A high-powered team led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday met the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) officials to brief them on Pakistan’s stance in the wake of the recent conflict with India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The high-level team — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York on Sunday for consultations at the United Nations.
Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the delegation.
Bilawal, while addressing the OIC Permanent Representatives, “categorically rejected India’s attempt to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident without any credible investigation or evidence”, according to a press release by Pakistan’s Mission to the UN.
He highlighted that the blame was “used as a pretext for unlawful military actions, including cross-border strikes, which targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure”.
The Pakistani delegation is scheduled to arrive in Washington today, where it plans to engage with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, other senior officials, lawmakers, and think tanks till June 6. The team will also visit London and Brussels.
The visit coincides with the arrival of an Indian delegation in Washington on June 3, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.
During his meeting with the OIC envoys, PPP chairman expressed concern at India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, which Pakistan considered “a blatant act of weaponising water and a violation of international and treaty obligations”.
“He [Bilawal] made it plainly clear that we cannot allow this to become a new normal,” the statement read.
It continued that the PPP chairman stressed that “due to India’s belligerent aggression, the world has become a less safe place, with real and present implications for peace and security in South Asia”.
The former foreign minister went on to thank the OIC for its efforts and role aimed at mediation to de-escalate tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, highlighting that the “only path to peace is dialogue, engagement and diplomacy”.
“He [Bilawal] reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace, restraint, and diplomacy, and called for the restoration of the Indus Waters Treaty, full respect for the ceasefire, and the resumption of a comprehensive dialogue with India, with the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute at its core,” the statement read.
 






 






Meanwhile, the permanent representatives of the OIC countries expressed their “appreciation for Pakistan’s transparent and timely briefing and reaffirmed their solidarity with Pakistan and the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.
“They reiterated their concern over worsening security situation in South Asia and stressed the importance of upholding the principles of the UN Charter and international law and in this regard, the sanctity of treaties, including the Indus Water Treaty,” the statement added.
Separately, the delegation also held a meeting with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) president for the month of June, Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, who represents the Republic of Guyana.
 






The delegation emphasised that in the face of a growing trend of unilateralism and escalation, the UNSC must play its crucial role to ensure peace and conflict resolution.
It urged the UNSC to play a proactive role in promoting de-escalation, ensuring respect for international law and treaties and facilitating peaceful resolution of the disputes, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the Council’s resolutions.
Ambassador Rodrigues-Birkett reaffirmed the UNSC’s commitment to upholding international peace and security in line with its mandate.
Meetings with permanent, elected UNSC members
Yesterday, the nine-member Pak­is­tani delegation held a series of meetings at the UN Headquarters.
It briefed the permanent representatives of the UNSC’s elected members  besides itself — namely Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Panama, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Somalia and South Korea.
 






The group also engaged with envoys of the UNSC’s permanent me­m­bers.
According to a statement by Bilawal after the team’s meeting with China’s Ambassador Fu Cong, the two neighbours agreed “aggre­ssive posturing and unilateral actions threaten peace in the region and must be firmly opposed”.
In its briefing to Russia’s Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, the delegation described India’s allegation as premature and lacking any credible investigation.
During the meeting with the United States’ UN envoy, Ambassador Dorothy Shea, Bilawal urged her country to play its role in ensuring comprehensive dialogue between India and Pakistan to address all outstanding issues.

The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the “Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme” includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB’s “first ever policy-based guarantee” of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.
“Pakistan has made significant progress in improving macroeconomic conditions,” said ADB country director for Pakistan, Emma Fan.
“This programme backs the government’s commitment to further policy and institutional reforms that will strengthen public finances and promote sustainable growth.”
The programme supports far-reaching reforms to improve tax policy, administration, and compliance, while enhancing public expenditure and cash management.
“It also promotes digitalisation, investment facilitation, and private sector development. These measures aim to reduce Pakistan’s fiscal deficit and public debt, while creating space for social and development spending,” the Manila-headquartered institution said.
The programme is underpinned by a comprehensive support package —including technical assistance and close coordination with development partners — designed to help Pakistan build long-term fiscal resilience and stability, it added.
Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, confirmed that the financial institution has approved the programme. “Diplomacy led by Economic Affairs & Ministry of Finance secures majority support at ADB Board,” he said in a post on X.¶

The disposal of meat close to the airports in the aftermath of Eidul Azha — to be celebrated later this week — often attracts birds to the site, posing a serious threat to flight safety, passengers and nearby surroundings. Awareness campaigns have been launched in recent years to avoid the possibility of such incidents.
In a notification issued by Punjab’s home department, it was detailed that under Section 144, the following activities will remain banned within a 15-km radius of all airports and airbases: pigeon-flying, fireworks, use of drones and laser lights, and the dumping of sacrificial waste and Sadqa meat. The ban will remain in place till June 20.
The banned activities were termed as a “serious threat to flight operations” and the decision has been taken to ensure the protection of  human lives and property.
All deputy commissioners have been directed to ensure special cleanliness arrangements at airports and their surrounding areas.
In recent years, there have been multiple incidents of birds colliding with aircrafts in the country, disrupting flight operations.</p><small>2025-06-03 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/031142249e1707e.jpg?r=114228' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915170/7-terrorists-killed-in-2-operations-in-balochistan-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>7 terrorists killed in 2 operations in Balochistan: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Seven terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan in two separate operations in Balochistan, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.
The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today, “Seven terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan, were sent to hell in two separate operations in Balochistan.”
An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in general area of Mach in Kachhi district on the reported presence of the terrorists, the ISPR said.
“During the conduct of operation, [the] troops effectively engaged the Fitna al Hindustan terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the statement said.
In another IBO conducted in the general area of Margand in Kalat district, a terrorist hideout was busted and two terrorists were successfully neutralised, ISPR said.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the slain terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement said.
“The nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of Indian sponsored terrorism and their facilitators to justice,” the statement concluded.
The government has designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Last week, a district official was killed when his house was attacked by terrorists in Balochistan’s Surab city, a statement from the provincial government had said.
Four soldiers were martyred as security forces killed 12 terrorists linked to “Indian proxy groups” in operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the military’s media wing had said last week.</p><small>2025-06-03 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/683e1b4bb0bfd.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915036/high-prices-of-sacrificial-animals-in-kp-keep-buyers-at-bay' target='_blank'><strong>High prices of sacrificial animals in KP keep buyers at bay</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The prices of sacrificial animals in the provincial capital and other neighbouring districts have surged despite presence of a huge number of animals in the cattle markets.
Traders attribute the price spiral to tensions with India and trade ’restrictions’ with Afghanistan, besides most animals are brought here from Punjab and Sindh provinces, leading to increased costs.
There’s no doubt the number of animals in all cattle markets has increased significantly but the business is still very slow. Along with traditional livestock markets, the number of sacrificial animals at the unofficial regional markets has also increased to the extent that alleys and streets resemble livestock markets.
During a visit to weekly livestock markets in various areas of Peshawar, Charsadda, and Nowshera districts, including Ring Road, Kala Mandi, Saifan Mandi, Sarband Mandi, Palosai, Chehel Ghazi Baba, Sar Dheri, Naguman, Shabqadar, and Tangi, it was observed that a large number of customers were searching for animals of their choice.

Traders attribute high rates to restrictions on trade with Afghanistan, increased transportation costs

Many people from low-income groups were seen searching for big-size sacrificial animals on a partnership basis at affordable rates.
The buyers said they had been visiting different livestock markets for several days but couldn’t make a purchase due to high prices of sacrificial animals.
Ubaidullah, a resident of Tehkal here, who visited Kala Mandi, said they wanted to buy a suitable bull but the price was out of their reach.
In Nasirpur market, traders Wasim Khan and Habib Khan said that animal prices had increased due to the prevailing tensions between India and Pakistan. Compared to last year, they said prices had increased by Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 per animal this year.
Traders said majority of animals came from Punjab and Sindh, where prices were high. They suggested that trade with India and Afghanistan should be restored to bring prices back to normal.
Traders Rahim Khan and Shamsur Rehman attributed the price hike to the outbreak of different diseases among animals. Mouth and foot disease is said to be widespread but there is no proper check from the livestock department to create awareness and protect the animals from the fatal disease.
Many traders said they had lost several animals to the FMD because there was no proper treatment available and they had to purchase medicines on their own.
They said fines imposed by police, increased transportation costs, and fodder expenses were common factors contributing to the high prices.
Traders said that in the past, people used to raise animals locally, which benefited both the breeders and buyers. However, due to the increasing population, agricultural land is fast disappearing, resulting in a several-fold increase in fodder prices. Due to these reasons, local animals have become extremely scarce, and the few that remain are weak due to lack of proper food, making them unattractive to buyers. In contrast, animals from Punjab are plump and visually appealing.
Mursalin Khan, a retired schoolteacher, said in the past, people used to raise animals, which provided numerous benefits. “However, now people tend to buy all dairy products from market, and they no longer consider water-added milk as bad.
In Peshawar, the largest livestock animal market is known as Kala Mandi, located on the GT Road in Jhagra area. There are separate spaces for buffaloes, bulls, and cows here. Most traders involved in buffalo trade hail from Punjab, who regularly bring livestock from their cities, particularly from Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan, Zahir Pir, Multan, Goondal, Rajanpur, and Sahiwal. They say that people in rural areas prefer buffaloes, while in cities, bulls, cows, goats, and sheep are the choice.
“At Saifan livestock market on Kohat Road and Sarband cattle market on Bara Road, there is a good number of goats and sheep.
Rahman Ali, a trader in Sarband area, said compared to last year, the price of sheep has increased by Rs30,000 to Rs40,000 this year. “In the past, a large number of sheep were brought from Afghanistan, but currently, due to border restrictions, animal trade is almost non-existent.”
In the current situation, most sheep come from Swabi, Mansehra districts of Khyber pakhtunkhwa and Talagang, Gali Jahangir and Mianwali areas of Punjab.
Adnan, a trader, said last year, a nine-month-old goat was available for Rs40,000, but this year, it’s hard to find one for even Rs70,000 to Rs80,000. Some customers also complained they were charged from Rs1,000 to Rs3,000 per animal by the contractor when they bought an animal in the market.
The contractors said they were allowed by the district administrations to charge a six per cent fee for exit of per animal, but they used to charge less than that owing to the poor financial position of people.

• City weatherman says tremors will stop in a day or two; maintains chances of major quake are slim
KARACHI: Although the seismic experts have said that the recent earthquakes in the city are largely harmless and that the magnitude will reduce in a day or two when the “active” fault fully releases its energy, they expressed concern over the city’s vulnerability to earthquake damage.
They warned that while the metropolis may not experience any major earthquake, its weak infrastructure cannot withstand a big jolt.
During the past two days, multiple low-intensity earthquakes have occurred in the city’s Quaidabad area, Gadap Town, Malir and DHA with the highest being recorded at 3.6-magnitude.
Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari said that there is a historical fault which has become activated and is causing frequent earthquakes in the city. He said the fault is releasing its energy and when it’s spent, its magnitude will reduce and the tremors will stop in a day or two as it is of low magnitude.
He also said that the chances of a major earthquake are low in Karachi as, historically, there has never been a big earthquake.
Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University’s Department of Geography said imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. And the frequent tremors are most likely due to the fact that the plates are trying to maintain balance. When that balance is achieved, the earthquakes will likely stop.
Talking to Dawn, Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU’s Department of Geology, explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimeters every year in the Himalayan region. At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, which causes earthquakes.
Most often, that pressure is released through what he called the “fault planes,” from where it can easily escape. However, he said there is a low chance of any major earthquake taking place in Karachi as the city is far from these active plate boundaries.
“Karachi lies on what’s called a ‘passive margin’, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,” he added.
 
 

Former vice chancellor of the NED University of Engineering and Technology, Prof Dr Sarosh Hashmat Lodi said that Karachi has no history of major earthquakes. “But if, God forbid, a strong earthquake was to take place, the city’s infrastructure would not be able to sustain it. If an earthquake of magnitude 5 or 6 struck, it could cause massive destruction,” he said.
Explaining the reasons behind this, he said that much of the city’s infrastructure is weak. “Many buildings are made with low-quality construction materials, and there is little quality control,” he said, adding that the safety standards of most buildings are questionable, and there is also “a lot of corruption in the construction industry,” which means cheap materials are often used for raising buildings.
He also said that earthquake-resistant iron rods, which are made from billet, are not produced in Pakistan because there is no factory for them. Moreover, he added, “the building code, which is supposed to ensure safety, is not being followed in the country. I can say that for sure because I’m the head of the Building Code of Pakistan.”
He said that due to all these reasons, the damage in the city could be “catastrophic” if a big earthquake takes place.

In a statement, the power division announced that the six tariff interventions allowed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to KE entailed a financial impact of Rs453bn spread over seven years.
On top of that, the division added, a fuel cost impact higher than the national average for 2024-25 alone meant an additional cost of Rs41bn, which even if it remains flat would translate into Rs287bn in seven years.
The division said the government position was to seek review of the Nepra determination to ensure fairness and uniformity, tariff must reflect actual costs and reasonable returns to protect consumers and there should be no extra allowance for inefficiency.
“All utilities should be treated equally. KE should not receive special cost or profit allowances unavailable to other power companies,” the power division said, adding that “extra allowances for inefficiency and high profit rates must be removed to keep bills affordable”.
Regulatory accountability
At the same time, the power division called for regulatory accountability, besides revision in assumptions, benchmarks, and profit margins so that they align with real performance data and the standards used for other utilities.
It said the KE was allowed losses build-up it did not actually incur with a seven-year financial impact of more than Rs200bn and stressed that only actual losses following a due write-off process should be allowed.
The government has also challenged a two per cent allowance for law & order specific to KE with a seven-year impact of Rs99bn, followed by yet another major Rs83bn allowance for capacity payments for unutilised expensive plants of KE.
It said the regulator had been asked to revisit its recent approval of “several cost items and profit margins for KE that are higher or more favourable than for any other utility in Pakistan, resulting in unnecessarily high bills for consumers and extra pressure on public finances”.
It said Nepra had allowed inflated fuel cost benchmark to KE at Rs15.99/kWh, significantly higher than the national grid that shifted about Rs28 billion (FY24) and Rs13bn (FY25) of extra costs onto the federal budget rather than KE customers.
This perk was not granted to any other utility, even those operating in equally or more volatile regions, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
“Moreover, law & order in Karachi has improved considerably over the last few years, and thereby there exists no reason for a such a margin,” it said.
Working capital allowance
The power division also questioned the working capital allowance permitted to KE at 24pc markup, a much higher percentage than in its previous tariff and higher than any other power distributor. “This increased KE’s allowable revenue by about Rs2.4bn in FY24 and is projected to total around Rs15bn over the control period.”
The power division said Nepra set KE’s allowed loss at 13.90pc, instead of the 13.46pc KE had proposed. These losses are on account of electricity generated but not billed, due to leaks or theft, or Kunda (illegal connections).
Around seven per cent of all such leakages can be attributed to theft, which translated into an extra Rs3.1bn burden in FY24, rising to about Rs21bn over the control period.
The power division said Nepra had allowed to KE retention of “Other Income” charged from fines imposed on its contractors, interest on bank deposits, and profits from side businesses.
KE briefing
K-Electric’s Chief Executive Officer Moonis Abdullah Alvi on Monday said the proposed MYT would not place any additional burden on consumers.
Speaking to journalists at a corporate briefing at PSX, he said under a uniform national tariff policy electricity consumers across the country pay the same rates. “There will be no special hike for Karachi consumers under MYT,” he emphasised.

Talking to media persons on Monday, Mr Qaiser hailed the alleged victory in Sunday’s election as proof of the PTI’s public support.
He noted that despite the backing of federal and provincial governments, the PML-N failed to win the seat, clearly reflecting their “waning popularity”.
According to unofficial results of the election on PP 52, PML-N candidate Hina Arshad Warraich clinched the seat with 78,702 votes, defeating the PTI-backed independent candidate, Fakhir Nashat Ghumman, who bagged 39,018 votes.
The balloting on Sunday remained peaceful throughout the day, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
The PTI, as well as PPP, lambasted the local administration’s decision to block roads leading to the returning officer’s office for security reasons.

“The external sector may face pressure, as easing import controls and debt repayments are likely to widen the current account deficit,” said the Ministry of Planning and Development in its Annual Plan 2025-26. However, it forecast strong remittances and export recovery and anticipated external financing to cushion these pressures and support external sustainability.
Yet, the planning ministry did not forecast any major increase in industrial sector output compared to the current year, which missed most of the targets set for various sectors of the real economy.
The Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) projected Pakistan’s economy to grow by 4.2pc in 2025-26, signalling expectations of a broad-based recovery against 2.7pc GDP growth during the current fiscal year against 3.6pc target, the planning ministry said. Pakistan’s economy has experienced repeated boom and bust cycles, as growth is often followed by balance of payment challenges due to increased import needs.

Cautions liberal imports to widen current account deficit

It forecast the commodity-producing sectors to expand by 4.4pc in FY26, driven by a 4.5pc rebound in agriculture and 3.5pc positive growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing. Both agriculture and LSM sectors missed targets during the current year by a wide margin as agriculture grew by 2.3pc against a 3.1pc target and LSM contracted by 1.5pc against a targeted 3.5pc growth.
It said the agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7pc) and cotton ginning (7pc), as well as robust performance in livestock. During the current year, imported crop output contracted by 13.5pc against an estimated 4.5pc fall, while cotton ginning contracted by 19pc against a 2.3pc decline. Livestock, however, showed better than growth at 4.7pc when compared to 3.8pc growth target.
The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in LSM with 3.5pc growth, the planning ministry said with 3pc growth in mining and quarrying, “alongside sustained growth momentum in Construction and Energy, Gas and water supply”. The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4pc, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage and communications, financial services and real estate.
“These projections reflect cautious optimism, contingent on effective macroeconomic management and stable external conditions,” the planning ministry said.
It forecast national savings to remain at 14.3pc of GDP in FY 2025–26, financing a total investment of 14.7pc of GDP, up from 13.8pc in FY 2024- 25. This reflects a narrowing saving investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows.
Public investment is projected to increase from 2.9pc to 3.2pc. Similarly, private investment is also projected to rise from 9.1pc of GDP to 9.8pc. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim for consolidation and stability, with an expected inflation of 7.5pc due to the low base effect and risk of ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.

The G7 is an informal grouping of the industrialised west and Japan — France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and Canada. It is also attended by the European Union (EU), the IMF, the World Bank and the United Nations.
India Today noted that South Africa, Ukraine and Australia have reportedly accepted invitations from Canada, it said “uncertainty remains over PM Modi’s visit.”
The report said “India is yet to receive any official invitation for the summit, which is being hosted by Canada from June 15-17,”  but also added that the Indian side was not “inclined to attend”. It quoted sources as saying “relations must improve” before any such high-profile visit takes place.
The report also cited security concerns that would need to be addressed if Mr Modi was to travel to Canada in the future. Last month, the Ministry of External Affairs, on two occasions, stated that there was “no information” on PM Modi’s visit to Canada for the G7 summit.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, like other European leaders, is racing to rebuild the UK’s military capabilities after US President Donald Trump told the continent it needed to take more responsibility for its own security.
Monday’s Strategic Defence Re­­view will call for Britain’s armed forces to move to a state of “war­fi­g­­hting readiness” and reverse its post-Cold War military decline. “The moment has arrived to transform how we defend ourselves,” St­­armer told workers at BAE Sys­t­e­­ms’ Govan shipbuilding site in Scot­land, saying he would “end the hollowing out of our armed forces.”
“When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready.” Despite cuts to the military budget in recent years, Britain still ranks alongside France as one of Europe’s leading military powers, with its army helping to protect Nato’s eastern flank and its navy maintaining a presence in the Indo-Pacific.

With 70,860 full-time trained soldiers, the army is at its smallest since the Napoleonic era

But the army, with 70,860 full-time trained soldiers, is the smallest since the Napoleonic era and the government has said it must rebuild given the growing strategic threats.
Elected last July, Starmer has already cut the aid budget to fund an increase in defence spending to 2.5pc of GDP by 2027, from 2.3pc, with an ambition to get to 3% over the longer term.
Starmer has sought to cast the higher defence spending as a way to create jobs and wealth, as he juggles severely strained public finan­ces, a slow-growing economy and declining popularity among an inc­reasingly dissatisfied electorate.
The authors of the defence review, led by the former Nato boss, George Robertson, and a former Russia adviser to the White House, Fiona Hill, said the higher spending had enabled them to set out a 10-year military programme.
Recommendations
Among the report’s 62 recommendations that will be accepted by government, Britain will build at least six new munitions plants, procure up to 7,000 British-made long-range weapons, and launch new communication systems for the battlefield.
A Cyber and Electromagnetic Command will lead defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, after UK military networks faced more than 90,000 “sub-threshold” attacks in the last two years.
Britain will also build up to 12 of its next-generation attack submarines — which are nuclear-powered but carry conventional non-nuclear weapons — to replace the current fleet of seven from the late 2030s, developed by the UK, US and Australia, under a security partnership known as AUKUS.
Britain also put a price for the first time on the replacement of the nuclear warheads on a separate fleet of submarines, with the pre-existing programme set to cost 15 billion pounds before the next election due in 2029.

Heading a five-member bench of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) which started hearing of the case related to the delay in the conduct of local bodies elections in Islamabad and Punjab, he called for early completion of the local government laws in Islamabad and Punjab.
Mr Raja said it would be embarrassing for the government if the ECP issues an order. He declared that the ECP will issue an order at the next hearing for local government elections in Punjab.
He said the Commission cannot sit with its eyes closed as it wanted to see progress. The ECP will set the timeline itself without waiting for any input from Punjab, he said.

Calls for early completion of local govt laws in Islamabad, Punjab

He recalled that he personally appeared before the Supreme Court in the case and underscored that it was unacceptable for a provincial government to avoid passing necessary legislation and delay elections for five years. He also highlighted that the elections in rest of the three provinces and cantonments had already taken place.
The remarks came after Punjab’s Minister for Local Government informed the Commission that a draft of the election rules was ready and can be submitted. He also stated that the local government election legislation was currently under review by the standing committee, with efforts being made to speed up the process.
He said the Speaker of the Punjab Assembly has also been urged to accelerate the legislative process. The ECP secretary, Omar Hamid Khan, briefed the forum about the delays in holding electoral processes and contended that the Punjab and the federal government had shown a little interest in holding local government elections. He pointed out that Punjab has delayed the elections for over three years, as the term of local governments in the province ended on December 31, 2021. Moreover, he added, since 2019, local government laws have been amended five times in Punjab, and the law is now being changed for the sixth time in the province.
At one point, one of the ECP members wondered as to who should be called to give a commitment that the election will be held. The hearing was later adjourned without setting a new date.
Under Section 219 (4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections to local governments within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local governments of a province, cantonment and Islamabad Capital Territory. In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on Dec 31, 2021. That means the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022. Likewise, tenure of Islamabad’s local bodies expired on February 14, 2021, and the law required elections by mid of June 2021.

• Govt allocates Rs880bn for the public sector development programme, down 20pc from current year
• Provinces to pitch in Rs2.80tr under annual plan to boost uplift spending
• Development plan prioritises Bhasha Dam, Rs120bn Balochistan highway
• Ahsan Iqbal says more than 100 projects worth Rs1tr to face cuts
ISLAMABAD: Under the tight control of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  next year’s federal development programme cuts allocations for almost all sectors, barring a rise in road building schemes and no changes to  parliamentarians’ schemes.
Despite this, the Annual Planning  Coordination Committee (APCC) cleared the national development programme worth a record Rs4.083 trillion, aided by Punjab and Sindh, showing greater financial muscle than the Centre which is pauperised by greater financial devolution, debt servicing, and security needs.
Based on this spending, the government set next year’s growth target at 4.2pc, supported by a 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry, and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.
Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, who presided over the meeting, did not mince words about the unprecedented fiscal constraints and asked the provincial representatives to convince their leadership not to seek federal funds anymore, given their fattened kitties.
He said Pakistan faced some limitations with the IMF programme and thus the challenge ahead was to leverage the limited resources to achieve maximum returns from each project to satisfy goals and objectives outlined in the national economic transformation plan, 5Es based five-year plan, and the “Uraan Pakistan Programme”.
The provinces, however, indicated that they may not be able to provide cash surpluses they committed to with the Centre and the IMF under the national fiscal pact, given the over Rs1tr revenue shortfall by the FBR and resultant decline in their share.
Given the constraints, the APCC decided to put a complete ban on the approval of development schemes by the departmental development working parties (DDWPs) of various ministries and divisions until the conclusion of the IMF programme.
“Therefore, policy decision regarding moratorium on approval of DDWP level projects till completion of IMF programme so that focus may be made towards national level mega and foreign funded projects,” the planning ministry said, adding, “This will ensure financial discipline, reduce throw forward and focus on critical national level projects, particularly in water and transport sectors.”
Thus, the government allocated Rs880bn for the public sector development programme (PSDP) for next year, down 20pc compared to the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the current year’s original budget allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after also including Rs120bn for the N-25 highway in Balochistan to be generated through an additional petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month.
Lower allocations
But despite these challenges, the government has earmarked Rs50bn for parliamentarians’ schemes, unchanged from the current year’s Rs50bn. Likewise, the allocation for merged districts would also remain unchanged at Rs70bn. The transport and communication sector is the only sector where the allocations have been increased for next year to Rs332bn against Rs268bn during the current year.
All other sectors, including special areas, like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations. The infrastructure sector would get only Rs644bn next year against Rs661bn during the current year. Energy sector’s allocations would reduce to Rs144bn next year from Rs169bn this year, while the water sector allocation would fall to Rs109bn next year from Rs135bn this year despite aggressive Indian moves. The allocations for physical planning and housing would plunge by 34pc to Rs59bn next year from Rs89bn. The social sector would also face major fiscal tightening as it would get only Rs150bn next year compared to Rs200bn this year, down by a quarter.
The share of special areas – AJK and GB – has been reduced by 16pc to Rs63bn from Rs75bn during current year. The allocations for science and technology would also be down to Rs53bn next year from Rs62bn this year while governance-related projects would plunge by almost half to Rs9bn from Rs17bn.
Production sectors would get only Rs11bn next year compared to Rs15bn and the major loser would be the food and agriculture whose allocation would plunge to just Rs3bn from Rs8bn.
The four provinces would allocate about Rs2.795 trillion. This included Rs1.188tr in Punjab, about Rs888bn from Sindh, which would further jack it up to Rs1tr, followed by Rs440bn annual development plan of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Rs280bn of Balochistan.
Federal state-owned entities would together invest about Rs288bn next year, taking the total development spending to about Rs4.083tr, which may further go up as provinces come up with their final budgets. The consolidated Rs4.083tr development outlay is almost 21pc higher than current year, mainly because of higher share of the provinces.
Constrained fiscal space
The planning minister emphasised that despite constrained fiscal space and competing demands, the government was fully committed to sustaining development momentum through strategic realignment of resources, performance-based planning, and increased coordination with provinces. He reiterated that the government’s vision is to steer Pakistan towards becoming a $1 trillion economy by 2035 and $3 trillion by 2047.
As of May 31, Rs1.036tr had been authorised and Rs596 billion utilised. A total of 1,071 projects were included in the PSDP, with a cumulative approved cost of Rs13.427tr. Throw-forward liabilities stood at Rs10.216tr, prompting a strong push for project rationalisation.
The Rs1tr PSDP includes Rs270bn foreign aid with priority to Diamer-Bhasha Dam and the launch of Hyderabad–Sukkur Motorway in FY 2025–26 in line with political commitments.
Regarding projects on low priority that could be frozen or shut down, the minister said the government has identified 118 projects worth Rs1,000bn that need to be placed on low priority or capped to save resources, reported Dawn.com.

• UK PM says situation ‘getting worse by the day’
CAIRO: Israeli fire killed at least three Palestinians and wounded dozens of others near an aid distribution site operated by the US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, local health authorities said on Monday.
Separately, Gaza’s civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on a home in the northern town of Jabalia killed 14 people on Monday. “The number of martyrs from the targeting of the Al-Bursh family home has risen to 14, including six children and three women, in addition to more than 20 missing individuals still under the rubble,” agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.
The Israeli military said it was aware of reports of casualties near the aid distribution site and the incident was being thoroughly looked into.
The GHF, a private group sponsored by the United States and endorsed by Israel, said there had been no fatalities or injuries at its distribution site or the surrounding area. Reuters could not independently verify what took place.
The reported incident was the latest in a series underscoring the volatile security situation that has complicated aid delivery to Gaza, following the easing last month of an almost three-month Israeli blockade.
On Sunday, Palestinian and international officials said at least 31 people were killed and dozens wounded near the same site, one of four operated by the GHF in Rafah.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Monday he was appalled by reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza on Sunday, and called for an independent investigation.
“It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” Guterres said in a statement, without assigning blame for the deaths. “I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable.”
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday that the situation in Gaza was getting “worse by the day” and that it was important to ensure the Palestinian enclave receives more humanitarian aid urgently.
“The situation is intolerable in Gaza, and getting worse by the day,” Starmer told reporters in Scotland, when asked whether the UK would take any action over the issue.
“Which is why we are working with allies — to be absolutely clear that humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed and at volumes that it is not getting in at the moment, causing absolute devastation,” he added.
The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes across the enclave had killed 51 people and wounded 500 others in the past 24 hours.
Risk of famine
The GHF said Monday’s deliveries raised the number of meals it has distributed since it began operations to nearly six million.
The United Nations has said most of Gaza’s 2m population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade on aid entering the strip.
The GHF launched its first distribution sites last week and said it would launch more.
Its aid plan, which bypasses traditional aid groups, has come under fierce criticism from the UN and humanitarian organisations, which say the GHF does not follow humanitarian principles.
The Palestinian NGOs Network urged a boycott of what it called the “US-Israeli aid mechanism” in protest over the killings on Sunday.
At Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, relatives of Hussam Wafi, a 37-year-old father-of-six, who was killed near the aid site on Sunday, arrived to pay their last respects before burial. Wafi’s brother Ali said the victims were driven by hunger.
“The US and Israel, what do they tell us? Go and get your food and water, and the aid. When the aid arrives, they hit us. Is this fair?” Wafi told Reuters.
“They were going peacefully, they were killed. They went to get food and water for their children, to get a can of hummus or fava beans, a box or whatever is available, and they get shot, they died, he added.
Israel and Hamas, meanwhile, traded blame for the faltering of a new Arab and US mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli prisoners held in Gaza by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails.
On Monday, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort said Hamas leaders were in constant contact with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo and Doha.
Israel says it accepts a temporary truce to release prisoners, but that war can only end once Hamas is driven out of Gaza.

• Ukraine, Russia agree to fresh prisoner swap in Istanbul talks, but not truce
ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday reiterated his willingness to host a meeting between the American, Russian and Ukrainian leaders in an effort to end the war in Ukraine.
“My greatest wish for both sides is to bring both (Russia’s) Vladimir Putin and (Ukraine’s Volodymyr) Zelensky together in Istanbul or Ankara, and even to bring (US President) Mr (Donald) Trump to their side, if they accept,” he said.
Turkiye, he said, would “take steps” to facilitate such a meeting, following direct talks between the two sides in Istanbul on Monday.
Erdogan said it was a big achievement that Monday’s talks even took place.
Ukraine carried out one of its most brazen and successful attacks ever on Russian soil on the weekend, its drones ambushing dozens of strategic bombers at bases deep inside Russia.
“It is a success in itself that the meeting happened despite what happened yesterday,” he said, hailing the talks as “magnificent”.
Hours after Erdogan’s statement, the White House said US President Donald Trump is  “open” to meeting his Russian and  Ukrainian counterparts in Turkiye. Trump, who wants a swift end to the three-year war,  “is open to it  (a three-way summit) if it comes to that, but he wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together”, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in Washington.
At Monday’s meeting, which lasted just over an hour, Ukraine and Russia agreed to exchange severely injured prisoners of war as well as those under 25, alongside the remains of 6,000 troops killed in combat, Kyiv said.
“These figures given by both Russia and Ukraine… (are) very, very important in terms of showing how important these Istanbul meetings are. And we are proud of this,” Erdogan added.
Ukraine and Russia agreed another large-scale prisoner exchange, but failed to make a breakthrough on an immediate halt to the fighting.
At the second round of direct talks between the warring sides, Ukraine said Moscow had rejected its call for an unconditional ceasefire, offering instead a partial truce of two to three days in some areas of the frontline.
Urged on by US President Donald Trump, Moscow and Kyiv have opened direct negotiations for the first time since the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, but have yet to make progress beyond prisoner exchanges and the agreement to swap their demands for a longer-term settlement.
Top negotiators from both sides confirmed they had reached a deal to swap all severely wounded soldiers as well as all captured fighters under the age of 25.
“We agreed to exchange all-for-all seriously wounded and seriously sick prisoners of war. The second category is young soldiers who are from 18 to 25 years old — all-for-all,” Ukraine’s lead negotiator and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov told reporters in Istanbul.
Russia’s lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said it would involve “at least 1,000” on each side — topping the 1,000-for-1,000 POW exchange agreed at talks last month.
But there was less sign of progress towards a truce.
“The Russian side continued to reject the motion of an unconditional ceasefire,” Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters after the talks.
Russia said it had offered a limited pause in fighting.
“We have proposed a specific ceasefire for two to three days in certain areas of the front line,” top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said, adding this was needed to collect bodies of dead soldiers from the battlefield.
No ‘reward’ for Putin
The two sides also agreed to hand over the bodies of 6,000 killed soldiers, Ukraine said after the talks.
But Russia’s Medinsky said Moscow would hand 6,000 killed Ukrainian soldiers over unilaterally, adding that he did not know “if they have any bodies on their side”, but that Russia would take them, if so.
Moscow does not disclose how many of its soldiers have been killed, closely guarding any information on the huge losses sustained during its three-year invasion.
As talks concluded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must not “reward” Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
