<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0321590934a4e57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970840/federal-constitutional-court-disposes-of-arshad-sharif-suo-motu-case' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court disposes of Arshad Sharif suo motu case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Tuesday disposed of a suo motu case initiated on the killing of prominent journalist Arshad Sharif in Kenya, ruling that judicial oversight of the ongoing investigation was impermissible under Pakistani law.
The court emphasised that the matter was being handled through diplomatic channels and a mutual legal assistance (MLA) agreement between Pakistan and Kenya had also already been reached.
The 14-page judgment was authored by Justice Aamer Farooq and disposed of all pending applications.
“We acknowledge and share the grief felt by our nation and the journalist community over the death of our citizen,” the judgment said.
“Needless to observe that in case the legal heirs of Sharif have any specific grievance in the matter, they can approach the court(s) of competent jurisdiction,” it added.
The judgment said that in the present case, the MLA had been signed between Pakistan and Kenya, adding that both countries were coordinating at a diplomatic level to implement it.
“We were of the view that the authorities of both countries are taking appropriate action under their respective laws,” the judgment said, adding that there was no need for any judicial interference in this regard when the law and investigation were taking their due course.
The judgment said that if the FCC issued any judicial order directing the state, including the federal government, to represent the matter internationally, it would not only amount to interference in the ongoing investigation, which was already proceeding under MLA agreement, but would also encroach upon the domain of foreign policy.
“Undoubtedly, matters of foreign relations are best handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) and the federal government, who are better equipped to determine what serves the purposes of Article 40 and what is appropriate in the international context,” the judgment said.
It said that Article 40 provided that the state shall “foster goodwill and friendly relations among all nations”.
The judgment said that the court had also perused the Feb 13, 2023 order by the Supreme Court, in which it had concurred with the submission of Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman that steps under the MLA were underway and that diplomatic channels were being actively pursued.
It said that the SC had also observed that, in such circumstances, directly approaching international forums would not be the appropriate course of action.
“The Supreme Court accepted this submission, while clarifying that, should the need subsequently arise, recourse to such forums could be considered. Similarly, at this stage, we would leave this issue to the good sense of the federal government,” the judgment said.
The judgment also noted that several “pertinent and significant” steps had been taken by the federal government in the case.
“These include the signing of the MLA, telephonic conversation between the prime minister of Pakistan and the president of Kenya, the formation of the special joint investigation team and the investigation carried out by it, diplomatic contacts with the Kenyan authorities by the MoFA, and issuance of black warrants,” it said.
It further noted that remedies were also being pursued at the individual level by Sharif’s family, which were pending before the Kenyan Supreme Court.
The judgment noted that the attorney general had submitted that a formal request to visit Kenya had been made to the concerned Kenyan authorities and that Pakistan was presently awaiting their response.
Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple cases of sedition were registered against him in different cities.
On Jan 14, the FCC had dropped hints about closing the suo motu proceedings, observing that the court’s facilitation had already borne fruit with the signing of a MLA agreement between the governments of Pakistan and Kenya in September last year.
Last week, one of the widows of the slain journalist had pleaded before the FCC through a letter not to close the suo motu proceedings.</p><small>2026-02-03 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0321310096f7982.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970826/pti-accuses-police-of-crackdown-on-protesters-near-adiala-jail-as-access-to-imran-remains-out-of-reach' target='_blank'><strong>PTI accuses police of crackdown on protesters near Adiala jail as access to Imran remains out of reach</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI accused police of subjecting its workers to violence and arresting them near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Tuesday.
The IHC has allowed Imran twice-a-week meetings — on Tuesday and Thursdays — with his family, lawyers and other associates. Despite the order, the ex-premier has not been allowed any visitors for weeks, including his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
Therefore, protests and sit-ins near the Adiala jail, where Imran has been incarcerated since September 2023, have become a usual occurrence on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka — a police picket near the prison.
Imran’s sisters and supporters again staged a sit-in near the prison today while a PTI post on social media platform alleged that police had inflicted violence on party workers and arrested them as well.







A livestream on the PTI’s YouTube channel showed another of Imran’s sisters, Aleema Khanum, surrounded by party workers and supporters, including children, sitting on the ground and shouting slogans.



However, videos posted by PTI leader Aliya Hamza Malik from earlier in the evening showed men, appearing to be policemen, detaining people. Malik claimed in her post on X that lawmaker Mehar Abdul Sattar, along with party workers, had been arrested.







A video posted by Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi showed a large contingent of police riot gear. The caption said “a large contingent of police is approaching”.







In a subsequent post, he said police had dispersed PTI workers.







Speaking to reporters at the spot, Aleema demanded a meeting with Imran and immediate medical treatment for his eye condition Al-Shifa Hospital.
“They have made a joke out of this, they have to provide him medical treatment,” she emphasised.
The PTI has been raising concerns about Imran’s health after reports emerged, and later the government confirmed, that he was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).
Speaking to Geo News, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said last week that the former premier was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on Imran’s eye on the night of January 24. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
The PTI has also condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
Aleema said about the development today that information about the Pims visit had been “leaked” and neither she, nor anyone else in Imran’s family was informed.
“They quietly took him late at night. They might be worried that something might happen to him (Imran), but why leak it?” she questioned. “Why weren’t we told that he was taken to the hospital?” Aleema added.
She said they had to meet Imran and said that Imran medical check-up be conducted in the presence of his physician, Dr Aasim Yusuf. She also called for the examination of Imran’s eye by a specialist doctor.
While Aleema was staging a sit-in, the Rawalpindi sub-divisional police officer approached her with warrants issued for her by an anti-terrorism court in the garrison city on Monday, and Aleema signed the warrants.
PTI to file another contempt plea
Earlier, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja was at the Islamabad High Court to initiate the process of filing yet another contempt of court petition against Adiala jail authorities for repeatedly denying party leaders permission to meet Imran.
Announcing his party’s plans again moving the court against jail authorities, Raja said while speaking to reporters on the court premises that this would be the “sixth contempt petition” filed on the matter.
The PTI and Imran’s sisters both have previously filed contempt petitions against Adiala jail authorities over non-compliance with the IHC order.
Today, Raja said while speaking to reporters at the IHC that he was at the court to file “another contempt of court petition” over what he deemed was “continued and deliberate non-compliance with court orders”.
“This is not the first time; this is the sixth contempt petition,” Raja said, adding that despite clear judicial directions, prison officials had consistently obstructed access to the PTI founder.
“No constitution prevents a prisoner from speaking, and the jail rule being cited to restrict meetings is itself unconstitutional,” he asserted, without specifying which rule he was referring to.
Raja maintained that while incarceration lawfully curtailed a person’s physical freedom, it did not “extinguish fundamental rights altogether”.
The PTI leader said while a prisoner’s freedom was taken away, they could not be deprived of their capability to think and speak.
“When someone goes to meet a prisoner, he can say whatever comes to his mind. There is no law that allows the state to censor thought or speech in this manner,” the PTI leader added.







Raja alleged that restrictions on meetings with Imran were “not administrative but political in nature”, aimed at “silencing the former premier and controlling the political narrative”.
“An attempt is being made to hide the hollowness of the system,” he said, further alleging that authorities were trying to bury what he described as the “lie of February 8” — seemingly a reference to the 2024 general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly alleged were rigged.







He alleged that efforts were being made to hide that “people’s vote was robbed”, further accusing the state of “sending a message of submission” to the public. “They are telling the people that your destiny is only subjugation, that your vote and your voice have no value,” he said, without naming anyone.
Raja further alleged that the continued denial of meetings with Imran was intended to create an atmosphere of fear and helplessness.
“They are giving the people the impression that the freedom of your leaders is at our mercy,” he said, adding that such actions struck at the heart of democratic norms and constitutional guarantees.
Raja described Imran Khan as the country’s most popular political leader and claimed that those in power were unnerved by his influence even from behind bars.
“The founder of PTI is the biggest leader in the country, and today they are scared and terrified,” he said. “Their aim is to silence the voice of the founder of PTI.”

However, police denied the claim.
Imdad Qazi, the secretary general of the Communist Party of Pakistan and the convenor of the PLA, told Dawn that the 10-party alliance had called the moot to debate democracy and authoritarianism in Pakistan. However, police contingents were already deployed in the area, he said.
“Five veteran political workers, namely Husain Fatimi, Dr Hasan Nasir, Ramzam Memon, Shaheena, Mohammed Farooq and three other activists were apprehended by the police outside the KPC, to prevent them from attending the conference,” Qazi alleged.
Meanwhile, South Senior Superintendent of Police Mahzoor Ali denied the claim that arrests were made outside the KPC.
In a statement, the PLA said, “Complete authoritarian rule has been imposed in the country. This time, this authoritarianism has been enforced through so-called democratic institutions.”
It added that during the conference, police cordoned off the KPC as the majority of the participants were arrested right at the entrance, which was strongly condemned.
Meanwhile, it said that the moot expressed “serious concerns” over the situation in Balochistan and called for resolving the Balochistan problem through “political and democratic means and in accordance with the wishes of the people of Balochistan”.
According to the statement, the conference also demanded the revocation of all changes made to the Constitution in the last five years, particularly the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, and the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments.
The participants also demanded the release of all “arrested and convicted political prisoners”, including Iman Mazari-Hazir, Hadi Ali Chattha, Mahrang Baloch and others.
The moot also expressed solidarity with all families affected in the Gul Plaza fire and demanded “strict punishment for those responsible for these tragic incidents and called on the government to ensure all necessary safety measures to prevent such occurrences in the future”.
The participants further expressed serious concern over the “tactics used by the institutions” to pressurise press clubs across the country and demanded an immediate end to such harassment.
At the end of the conference, the United States’ raid on Venezuela last month and preparations for another act of aggression against Iran were strongly condemned. It urged the government to take a clear stand against this “open aggression”.</p><small>2026-02-03 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031842227ae12be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970831/achakzai-seeks-pm-shehbazs-intervention-for-imrans-medical-examination-by-trusted-doctors' target='_blank'><strong>Achakzai seeks PM Shehbaz’s intervention for Imran’s medical examination by ‘trusted’ doctors</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mahmood Khan Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, seeking his “personal intervention” for the medical examination of PTI founder Imran Khan by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
The letter was shared by the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X.
In the letter, Achakzai said, “I am writing with utmost urgency to bring to your immediate attention a serious matter concerning the health of former prime minister and PTI Chairman, Mr Imran Khan, who is currently detained at Adiala jail, Rawalpindi.”
He went on to say that it had come to his attention that recent medical check-ups were conducted “without the knowledge or presence of his personal medical team or family members”.
“His personal doctors, who are fully aware of his medical history, were not informed,” Achakzai said.







“A full medical examination and tests by his trusted doctors is critically needed without any delay to properly assess and manage his health, in line with medical ethics, legal obligations, and fundamental human rights,” he said.
He also listed the names of Imran’s personal doctors, saying that it would be better if they performed the medical examination. Dr Muhammad Aasim Yusuf, Dr Prof Mazhar Ishaq, and Dr Prof Aamir Awan were the three named in the letter.
“Your immediate personal intervention to ensure this medical access is needed so that the health and well-being of the former prime minister is safeguarded,” he said.
Separately, PTI’s Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking to the media, said that a meeting between Bushra Bibi and Imran was held, after which the former said that the latter was feeling much better.
His remarks came as Bushra Bibi’s family was allowed to meet her for half-an-hour at Adiala jail. While leaving the venue, the family met Gohar and conveyed Bushra Bibi’s remarks about Imran’s health.
Speaking to the media outside the jail, Gohar said that despite the message from Bushra Bibi’s family, it was still necessary to allow a meeting between Imran and his family, and to also allow Imran’s physicians to examine him.
He said that a meeting with Imran had not been allowed since December, adding that the meeting with Bushra Bibi was allowed after three months.
Gohar said that he was told that Imran was informed his eye would be damaged and he should visit Pims.
Days after reports regarding the treatment Imran emerged in mainstream media, the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).
Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
Subsequently, the Pims executive director, Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
“It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” he said in a video statement.
It is worth mentioning that the PTI had condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.</p><small>2026-02-03 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03181918af84867.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970800/kazakhstan-president-arrives-in-pakistan-on-2-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakhstan president arrives in Pakistan on 2-day visit</strong></a><br><p>Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday for a two-day official visit as the two nations seek to bolster bilateral ties further.
The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar received President Tokayev at Rawalpindi’s Nur Khan Base.







According to state-run Radio Pakistan, a 21-gun salute was presented to the visiting dignitary.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, who also welcomed the Kazakh preisdent at Nur Khan Base, later posted on social media platform X: “Honoured to welcome His Excellency Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, on his two-day official visit to Pakistan. He was received at the airport by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“This will be a great visit in terms of strong ties between both countries and we look forward to further strengthening our friendship and bilateral cooperation.”







Tokayev is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials. A video shared by his office showed the streets in Islamabad adorned with Kazakhstan’s national flag.



In a handout issued earlier in the day, the President’s Secretariat said that President Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country sometime this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to hold meetings with President Zardari and PM Shehbaz, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.

 

This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Kazakh Minister of Science and Higher Education Sayasat Nurbek was already on a visit to Pakistan.
Eight memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed on Monday between the higher education institutions of the two countries to promote joint research collaboration, faculty and student exchanges, collaborative academic programmes, and capacity-building initiatives.
As part of the collaboration, Kazakhstan educational centres were inaugurated at three public sector universities in Islamabad.
In September, when then-Kazakh deputy premier Murat Nurtleu visited Pakistan, the two sides signed the Action Plan of Cooperation to boost bilateral ties.</p><small>2026-02-03 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03201053e43a0a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970836/china-condemns-balochistan-attacks-says-it-will-always-support-pakistan-in-combatting-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>China condemns Balochistan attacks, says it will always support Pakistan in combatting terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism.
Jian made these remarks during a regular press briefing when he was asked to comment on a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan last week.
Jian said that China strongly condemned the attacks.
“We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
“China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added.
On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”.
In a post on X, the embassy said “we […] deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”.







Apart from China, the US, European Union, Iran and several other countries have also condemned the attacks.
As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives.
It said that terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
According to reports, the assailants targeted police stations in Quetta’s Sariab area, torched records and killed officers who resisted the attacks. They also raided banks in the Hazarganji area and opened indiscriminate fire before dispersing into different localities of Sariab.
In Kharan, armed men attacked the residence of the Mullazai Qaumi Etihad chairman, killing him and his six security guards. Senior police officer Abdul Baqi said the attackers fled the area after the assault.
In the Tump area of Kech district, armed men shot dead former tehsildar Abid after he resisted an attempted kidnapping.
Sources said armed men also attacked Mastung, burning the police station and breaking into the district jail, freeing 30 prisoners. They also targeted banks and government institutions.
Similar attacks occurred in Kalat, where terrorists attacked banks and police stations, injuring three police personnel and setting banks ablaze. Government offices were also attacked.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the attacks. Speaking on Saturday night, he said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.</p><small>2026-02-03 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03150135eb08965.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970818/pakistan-invited-to-participate-in-upcoming-us-iran-talks-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan invited to participate in upcoming US-Iran talks: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington, the Foreign Office (FO) confirmed on Tuesday.
“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query.
“Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn.
The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting.

 

The meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US outlet Axios cited two unnamed sources and a US official as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters, adding that some regional powers were also invited.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday and that it was important to start dialogue between the parties to avoid further escalation.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he has instructed FM Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” provided that an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.

 

The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said in a series of posts on X.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”
He added, “In return, we expect sanctions lifting.”
However, Araghchi said Tehran was ready for war if talks fail and warned that a conflict would likely spiral beyond Iran, CNN added.
Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with FM Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has also said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.</p><small>2026-02-03 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031856359ab6dad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970832/pm-shehbaz-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-fostering-friendly-ties-with-libya' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to fostering friendly ties with Libya</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering friendly relations with Libya, state-broadcaster PTV reported.
The development came as a high-level delegation from Libya called on PM Shehbaz at the Prime Minister’s House, PTV said in a post on X.
It said that the delegation comprised Libyan Prime Minister Dr Osama Saad Hamad, Libyan Arab Armed Forces Commander-in-chief Field Marshal Khalifa Abu-al-Qasim Haftar and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar.
It said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir were also present during the meeting.







“During the discussions, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest and underscored the importance of strengthening bilateral relations,” PTV said.
“The meeting reflected the shared desire to enhance cooperation in areas of common concern and to promote peace, stability, and development at regional and international levels,” PTV reported.
During the meeting, the premier “reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering friendly relations with Libya and emphasised the importance of continued engagement and dialogue”.
It added that the Libyan leadership appreciated Pakistan’s role and expressed interest in expanding collaboration between the two countries.
“The meeting concluded with an understanding to maintain close contact and explore avenues for future cooperation,” PTV added.
A day earlier, weeks after signing a more than $4 billion arms deal, Pakistan’s armed forces and Libya’s eastern military had pledged to continue their engagement and collaboration.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.</p><small>2026-02-03 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03170511f26f185.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970829/basant-set-to-make-its-grand-return-in-lahore-under-mostly-clear-skies' target='_blank'><strong>Basant set to make its grand return in Lahore under mostly clear skies</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday said dry weather with clear skies was expected for the majority of the Basant festival, which is set to be celebrated in Lahore this week.
“Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said in a forecast posted on the social media platform X.
It added that light westerly/north-westerly winds were likely to blow at the speed of 10 to 15 kilometres per hour, which was “suitable for safe kite-flying”.
The PMD advised the festival participants to “exercise caution while flying kites, especially near electric lines and open roads”.







The three-day Basant festival is set to kick off in Lahore from February 6, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a “provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday”.
Owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of kite-related commodities, the Punjab government on Monday approved the manufacture of only “permissible kite-flying material” in four more districts of the province.

 

According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying during Basant, whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
The festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
‘No better occasion to portray Pakistan’s positive image’
CM Maryam visited a Safe City office in Lahore on Tuesday, which she said was being used as Basant control room.
“All the street activities are being monitored from here through drone surveillance,” she said in a televised address.
The chief minister said that Basant was a festivity that was “exclusive to Punjab and we have witnessed how passionately people used to celebrate it”.
“But, due to some unfortunate incidents, the people of Punjab were deprived of it,” she expressed regret.
She further stated that it was unfortunate that “we adopt other cultures”.
“Punjab has a very rich culture and Punjabi, Saraiki, and Potohari are beautiful languages.”
But, the CM continued, “our children have been taught that if they speak English, they will be considered uncultured”.
“We want people to own Punjab, its language and culture,” she added. “Residents of Punjab should protect their culture and language as their historical heritage and take pride in it.”
The Punjab CM said that “our Sikh brothers from Indian Punjab and their children speak Punjabi with pride in all over the world ,whether it is US, Canada, UK or any other country”.
“I urge our Punjabi brothers and sisters to teach Punjabi to their children along with Urdu and English,” she said, adding that “it (Punjabi) is their pride, not a source of embarrassment.”
The chief minister said when her government announced the lifting of ban on Basant, she had little idea about the enthusiasm and Basant “fever” being witnessed among people presently.
People from cities other than Lahore were also making appeals to organise Basant in their cities, she said, adding, “We are organising Basant as a pilot project in Lahore, so that we can see how effective our security protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are.”
The Punjab CM further stated, “We cannot get a better occasion than this to portray Pakistan’s progressive image to the world.”
Maryam said Basant had “generated economic activity worth billions [of rupees]”.
“People from around the world are coming to Punjab. All the hotels and guest houses are booked,” she stated.
The Punjab CM said the tradition of Basant went back to 1250, and the festival marked arrival of spring.
“It’s colour is yellow , as yellow symbolises life returning to land. This is life returning to Punjab,” she remarked.
Outlining the rules and regulations notified by the Punjab government for Basant, she warned that strict SOPs and security protocols were being enforced and violators could face punishment.
“We are going to celebrate Basant from Feb 6 to 8, not a day before Feb 6 nor the day after Feb 8.
“No kites or threads exceeding the permissible size will be allowed, and the violations may lead punishment for up to 10 years and 2 million in fines,” she said.
Maryam said that all kite-flying material that imported from outside Lahore was being strictly monitored.
The CM said information regarding registered manufacturers and sellers of kite-flying material was available at online portal www.basant.punjab.gov.pk.
Moreover, 46 monitoring and implementation camps were established in the high-risk areas, 32 in medium-risk areas and 20 in low-risk zones, she added.
“Over 2500 traffic and 100,00 police personnel have been deployed for the safety of people”, the CM said.
She added that all the entrances of Lahore city were being monitored to prevent the transportation of any non-permissible kite-flying material.</p><small>2026-02-03 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03131703d407f43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970806/na-adopts-resolution-calling-for-aggressive-national-response-against-terrorisms-sponsors-facilitators' target='_blank'><strong>NA adopts resolution calling for ‘aggressive’ national response against terrorism’s sponsors, facilitators</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism.
The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.”
The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”.







The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”.
It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”.
The resolution also expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values.
It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”.
Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”.
The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday.
The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday.
Lawmakers sound alarm
Lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI, the PPP and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province.
During some opposition speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel.
Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai suggested an addition in a resolution that would “recommend that the first right of the children of a province be acknowledged on their respective province’s resources”.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq remarked that this was a “constitutionally protected” matter.



In his speech, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently.
“If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said.
Stating that Pakistanis are aggrieved when someone is killed in a terrorist incident, Qaiser said: “We need to see what the fundamental reason is for this insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the moment, and that insurgency is not being controlled in any way.”
He further said, “A state is like a mother, and when a state does not do justice to its children, does not give them basic rights, differentiates between them and does not treat them fairly, then it has to face such situations.”
The former NA speaker stressed the need to figure out the root causes behind the rising unrest in Balochistan. “The fundamental thing is democracy,” he added.
“When you do not give importance to the public and do not accept their opinions and suggestions, and when the people think they are beings of a lower level and their thoughts have no value,” he said, before the NA YouTube livestream was disrupted for over a minute.



The PTI leader then lamented that ex-premier Imran Khan was being denied the right to meet his family in jail. He contended that his imprisonment was “unlawful”, and his remarks were not aired for half a minute.
According to a clip uploaded by the NA, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq objected to certain remarks by Qaiser about the judiciary and expunged them.
Echoing the KP government’s stance, Qaiser lamented that the province was not being provided with the funds allocated for it.
He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz.
“The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied. On the other hand, the chief minister of a province uses a government airplane when going to China and Brazil. Is this not one country but two constitutions?” he said.

 

Noting the planned talks between the United States and Iran over their concerns, Qaiser said, “If Iran and America can sit for talks in Istanbul… then why not with Afghanistan, however much serious your concerns are?”
The PTI MNA affirmed that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism concerns with Kabul should be addressed, but stressed the importance of using diplomatic channels for it.
“All our trade, our business, our livelihood is linked with Afghanistan, our survival is not [possible] without it,” he said. He asserted that his party wanted full implementation of the National Action Plan and the complete eradication of terrorism.
“Since we are the victims, make a policy after speaking to us. We want the end of terrorism,” Qaiser said, calling for civilian supremacy and strong economic and foreign policies.
Noting that even India and the US, which were seen as having strained relations, have now signed a trade deal, Qaiser contended that Pakistan was “moving towards isolation”.
“We should revisit our policies. The state should act like a mother and remain within its jurisdiction, […] and this parliament should be rightfully elected,” the PTI leader said.
JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district.

 

She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered.
“Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously.
She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister, women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”.
“For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan.



Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been “on fire” for the past 48 hours.
“We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said.
“Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked.
“Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted.







Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”.
He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor.
“Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised.
Speaking after Chaudhry tabled the resolution, PTI’s Noor Alam Khan highlighted the rise in terrorist incidents in KP, pointing out that even school and college buildings were targeted.
“Whoever is doing terrorism in Pakistan cannot be a patriot,” he said.
The PTI lawmaker requested that the terrorism concerns of KP also be incorporated in the resolution as “terrorism is the highest there”.
“Our women, sisters and daughters are unable to study there. Please [add] this in the resolution,” he said.
PPP MNA Sehar Kamran emphasised that the Balochistan attacks could not be seen in isolation, noting there was a “nexus” between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and India.
“The aim was not just to target Balochistan, but to target Pakistan,” she said, adding that those responsible for “external interference” wanted to create instability in the province and weaken the country.
Sehar backed Alam’s opinion that KP was also adversely impacted by terrorism.
“To attack nine to 12 places in a coordinated manner requires tactical and logistic support. I think it is clear that there is external involvement,” the PPP MNA said, stressing the need for national unity to combat it.
During his speech, Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia pointed out that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed.
He noted that Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had made “correct” statements about the deprivation of Sui-supplied gas faced by the people of Balochistan.
A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan.
In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed.
Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity.
‘Province being provided significant financial support’
State Minister for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said Balochistan receives more than 40 per cent higher share than Punjab under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, stressing that the province is being provided significant financial and development support by the federation.
Addressing the house, Chaudhry stated that under the NFC formula, Balochistan receives more than double the per capita funds compared to Punjab and Sindh.
The state minister said 91pc of the “financial resources spent in Balochistan are provided by the federal government”.



Chuadhry further noted that the province has seen major infrastructural and institutional development.
“Balochistan currently has 13 cadet colleges, 321 technical education institutions, and airports even in cities with populations of around 200,000.
“Balochistan has 13 major hospitals, 757 basic health centres, and more than 25,000 kilometres of roads,” he added.
Chaudhry questioned the targeting of public institutions, asking why attacks are carried out on schools and hospitals if the struggle is truly for rights. He emphasised that such acts “harm” ordinary citizens rather than addressing grievances.
“Blocking highways, exploding bridges, and hijacking trains? What is the motive behind it, as common people use them?” he questioned. The interior official asserted that terrorists have no linguistic or religious affiliation.
“TTP is using the beard (religion), and BLA is running their narrative upon Baloch identity; however, they have nothing to do with either of them.”
Responding to the question of why sporting events were being held in the country despite terrorist attacks, he said, “That’s what terrorists want.”
“Terrorists want to tell the world that by halting the business, trade, markets, and sporting events, they have paralysed us. We will not let this happen.”
Chaudhry also criticised New Delhi, saying that despite condemnations from all over the world of the Balochistan attacks, “only India” refrained from it.
He added that security forces were playing their part in the fight against terrorism, and the political leadership had to back them with a joint narrative.
Balochistan attacks
The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province.
According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response.

The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred.
The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan.
The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03170504b8554ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970828/tree-cutting-drive-in-islamabad-conducted-on-orders-from-pm-office-ihc-told' target='_blank'><strong>Tree-cutting drive in Islamabad conducted on orders from PM Office, IHC told</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) told the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday that its recent tree-cutting drive in the capital was conducted on the direct instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The statement was part of a written report submitted to the court in response to a petition challenging the CDA’s tree-cutting drive, which had drawn significant public criticism.
Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in Islamabad, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian, drawing criticism alleging large-scale environmental damage. However, authorities have maintained that only Paper Mulberry trees were cut down as they were a major cause of allergies.
In its submission, the CDA defended the campaign as a “well-planned operation” aimed at removing Paper Mulberry trees, which it described as a major source of pollen allergies and asthma in Islamabad.
The authority cited scientific research, including a study published in the Journal of Global Health, linking Paper Mulberry pollen to increased asthma attacks and hospital visits.

 

The authority further claimed that the tree species deteriorated air quality and soil health. The CDA stated that the decision to remove the trees followed a multi-step process: a 2022 order from the IHC led to the formation of an Environment Committee, which recommended the trees’ removal in May 2023.
A public hearing was later held in July 2023, it said.
According to the CDA report, the issue gained attention after a journalist’s column in November 2024, prompting the PMO to direct the Ministry of Health and CDA to take action.
Subsequent meetings resulted in the PMO issuing formal directions to implement a pollen allergy management plan, the authority said.
The CDA denied allegations that it cut down trees other than Paper Mulberry, or that the drive was a cover for development projects.

 

It stated that trees for projects like the ‘Marka-i-Haq Monument’ were transplanted to other locations. The authority also argued that no separate environmental approval was needed because the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK-EPA) was part of the committee that recommended the action.
The CDA has asked the court to dismiss the petition, calling it “without merit”.
It is worth mentioning that environmental conservation organisation WWF-Pakistan, in a statement, had disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance that paper mulberry trees were removed due to a rise in pollen allergies, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development.
“WWF-Pakistan’s field assessments indicate that vegetation loss in the capital is not limited to Paper Mulberry management alone, but is also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations,” the environmental body had said.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03165825b19354d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970824/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-cricketer-wasim-akram-saying-imran-visited-jeffrey-epsteins-island' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show cricketer Wasim Akram saying Imran visited Jeffrey Epstein’s island</strong></a><br><p>Multiple pro-PML-N accounts on social media platform X were sharing a clip since February 1, of cricketer Wasim Akram, claiming that he said PTI founder Imran Khan visited Jeffrey Epstein’s island. However, Akram said no such thing.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender and United States financier, was accused of running a years-long sex trafficking network involving underage girls, with abuse linked to multiple properties in the US and overseas.
He died in August 2019 in a New York jail while awaiting trial on federal trafficking charges. His close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was later convicted by a US court for recruiting and grooming minors for Epstein’s abuse and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.
Millions of new files relating to Epstein have been released by the US Department of Justice, showing many of the world’s most renowned individuals.
On Feb 1, a user who appears to be a PML-N supporter based on his bio and past posts shared a video of Wasim in a podcast with the following caption: “Imran Khan - Modi - Epstein List. With Modi’s name now also linked to Epstein, the two are being portrayed as spiritual brothers because of their ties to the Jewish community.
According to Wasim, Imran also went to Epstein Island. He claimed, ‘Imran Khan and some youngsters were flown to Epstein Island on Maxwell’s private plane’. How shameful it is that the same person then holds a tasbih in his hand and lectures others about integrity.”
The post gained 46,000 views.
He shared the same video again with the same caption, gaining 28,000 views.
The same clip with a similar claim was shared by another PML-N supporter with the following caption: “In 1988, Imran Khan took us on his private plane with a woman over an island (Wasim Akram). Was it Epstein Island? Was that woman’s name Ghislaine Maxwell? As soon as more truth comes out in front of the public, PTI supporters will start trying to prove Jeffrey Epstein was an angel serving humanity.”
The clip gained 83,000 views.
The video was shared with similar claims by multiple pro-PML-N accounts on X, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the Epstein files.
A reverse image search was conducted to trace the source of the video, which yielded the full podcast of Wasim by an Australian YouTube channel on Nov 24, 2022. The video was titled: “Imran Said Let’s Go To A Nightclub“ | Wasim on Cocaine, Sledging & Sir Viv”.



In the podcast, the viral clip starts at the 17:35-minute mark, where Wasim can be seen talking about clubbing with Imran and does not mention anything related to Epstein or Maxwell.
In the podcast, Wasim mentions their visit to an island in 1988, whereas Epstein bought the islands in 1998; Maxwell was in the UK at that time. She moved to the US after the death of her father in 1991 and met Epstein thereafter.
Furthermore, the same clip was shared with the same claim in 2022, with Wasim debunking it at the time as false on his official X handle.







In addition, the pictures used in the collage with Wasim’s video, which show Imran with Maxwell, were also found to be old from a party in London in 1990.
A reverse image search yielded the images of the party that were uploaded on Shutterstock, a leading global provider of licensed images, videos, music, and other media.
According to the description, the party was hosted by Taki Theodoracopulos, a Greek writer and publisher, to mark the fall of communism at the Savoy Hotel, a year after the Berlin Wall was demolished — October 28, 1990.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video of cricketer Wasim shows him saying that Imran visited Epstein’s island is false. Wasim said nothing of the sort and did not mention or even hint at Epstein, Maxwell or Epstein’s island in his video reminiscing about a trip to an island with Imran on a woman’s personal plane.

The deal represents one of the most ambitious tie-ups in the technology sector yet, combining a space-and-defence contractor with a fast-growing AI developer whose costs are largely driven by chips, data centers and energy.
It could also bolster SpaceXs data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet’s Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.







The transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Investors in xAI will receive 0.1433 shares of SpaceX for every share of xAI as part of the acquisition, this person said. Some xAI executives may also opt for cash instead of SpaceX stock at $75.46 per share, the person said.
“This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” Musk said.
Deal breaks record held by Vodafone for world’s top M&A
The purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world’s largest merger and acquisition (M&A) deal, a distinction held for more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203bn in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.
The combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said.
SpaceX was already the world’s most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800bn in a recent insider share sale. XAI was last valued at $230bn in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.
SpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The deal further consolidates Musk’s far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem, which some investors and analysts informally call the “Muskonomy”, which already includes Tesla, brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.
“Starlink was already a cash flow engine, and now it adds an AI revenue layer on top while also becoming a distribution surface for AI services and data,” said Ali Javaheri, PitchBook Senior Emerging Spaces Analyst.
“With policy changes that allow certain customer data to be used for model training and the prospect of orbital data centres, SpaceX is positioning itself as an integrated infrastructure platform that can serve commercial and government use cases, which is a much stronger narrative heading into a public offering.”
Deal could draw regulatory scrutiny
The world’s richest man has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla’s stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.
The agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk’s overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.
SpaceX also holds billions of dollars in federal contracts with Nasa, the Department of Defence, and intelligence agencies, which all have some authority to review M&A transactions for national security and other risks.</p><small>2026-02-03 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03162849979dde0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970822/russia-says-india-has-not-said-it-will-halt-oil-purchases-following-us-trade-deal-announcement' target='_blank'><strong>Russia says India has not said it will halt oil purchases following US trade deal announcement</strong></a><br><p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday it had not received any indication from India that it would stop buying Russian oil following the announcement of a trade deal with US President Donald Trump.
Trump said he had struck a deal to reduce tariffs on India and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil over the war in Ukraine.
India’s purchases of Russian oil — discounted due to Western sanctions complicating logistics and cutting off markets — have surged since Russia launched its full-scale military offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.
Ukraine and its Western allies have been seeking to cut off the billions of dollars in revenue, a vital source of income for Russia’s stretched economy and its military.

 

“So far, we haven’t heard any statements from New Delhi on this matter,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including AFP.
Trump said he was cutting levies on Indian goods to 18 per cent. He had previously imposed 25pc “reciprocal” tariffs on many products, plus an additional 25pc for New Delhi’s purchases of Moscow’s oil.
While Modi thanked Trump for the “wonderful” phone call and the easing of tariffs, he made no reference to Trump’s assertion about halting oil purchases.
In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36pc of India’s total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day.
But after Trump hit New Delhi with tariffs, India’s monthly oil imports from Russia plunged by 38pc, local media reported, citing India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry’s data.
Russian President Vladimir Putin promised “uninterrupted shipments” of oil during a visit to New Delhi in late 2025.
Bilateral trade between the two sides reached $68.7bn in 2024-25 — almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic levels — dominated by Moscow’s energy sales, with Indian exports to Russia accounting for under $5bn.</p><small>2026-02-03 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031359069477faa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970815/lhc-issues-notices-seeks-replies-from-punjab-govt-others-in-lahore-manhole-deaths-case' target='_blank'><strong>LHC issues notices, seeks replies from Punjab govt, others in Lahore manhole deaths case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday issued notices to the Punjab government and other respondents on a petition seeking action against those responsible for the incident in which a mother and her daughter died after falling into an open manhole near Bhatti Gate.
Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi heard the petition filed by Aamna Malik and the Judicial Activism Panel.
Advocate Azhar Siddique, on behalf of the petitioners, pointed out that incidents of citizens falling into manholes were on the rise, which was a matter of serious concern.
The counsel expressed regret that negligence was shown by leaving a manhole open in a highly populated area. He claimed that the government took merely cosmetic measures instead of proceeding against the officials responsible for the incident.
Siddique asked the court to determine responsibility for the incident and initiate action against those responsible.
The assistant attorney general stated that the petitioner unnecessarily made the federal government a party to the petition, as the matter pertains to provincial authorities.
However, the judge observed that the court would like to know the opinion of the federal government as well.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the judge directed the respondents to submit their replies by March 3.
Earlier, the petitioner’s counsel, on the instructions of the court, removed the national and provincial disaster management authorities from the list of respondents.
The mother and her child had fallen into the sewer at the site of the under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhatti Gate. While the woman’s body was found late at night the same day, the 10-month-old child’s body was recovered after a day.
Officials of the contractor working on the under-construction Data Darbar extension project were arrested for their negligence.
On January 31, a judicial magistrate approved a four-day physical remand of the officials.
Meanwhile, a “high-powered committee” of police officials had launched a fact-finding inquiry to probe the allegations of torture against the husband of the woman.</p><small>2026-02-03 09:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03131944b5a5023.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970812/shireen-mazari-moves-ihc-for-meeting-with-imaan-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>Shireen Mazari moves IHC for meeting with Imaan, Hadi</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former federal minister Shireen Mazari on Tuesday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking urgent judicial intervention to allow her to meet her imprisoned daughter, human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, and son-in-law Hadi Ali Chatha, both held in Adiala jail.
A sessions court had sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
In a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, Mazari, through prominent lawyers including Kamran Murtaza, members of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) Raja Aleem Abbasi, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqub, Zafar Khokhar, Asif Irfan, Abdul Rehman Hur Bajwa, President Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, President District Bar Association Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, Riasat Ali Azad, and others, alleged that jail authorities had completely cut off the detainees from family contact and legal counsel, without any written order, recorded reasons, or lawful justification.
The petition states that Imaan and Hadi were convicted on January 24, 2026, in a case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and have since been held in “continuous judicial custody”. Despite repeated requests, the petitioner — mother of Imaan and mother-in-law of Hadi — has been denied visitation rights and kept in the dark about their physical and mental health, medical care, and jail conditions.
The plea contends that the detainees have also been deprived of confidential access to their lawyers, obstructing their ability to file an appeal against their conviction — a time-sensitive legal remedy. It argues that such “complete and indefinite denial” amounts to “incommunicado detention,” violating constitutional guarantees under Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14, which protect the rights to due process, dignity, fair trial, and humane treatment.
The petition further invokes the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, and international standards such as the UN Nelson Mandela Rules, asserting that the state has a heightened duty of care toward individuals in custody.
In her interim relief request, Mazari has urged the IHC to issue immediate directions allowing temporary family visits and legal consultations pending the final decision of the writ.
The respondents in the petition include the Federation of Pakistan through the secretary of Interior, the inspector general of police Islamabad, and the superintendent of Adiala Jail.
The IHC is yet to fix a hearing date on the petition.
The case
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCI) in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The First Information Report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Judge Majoka issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025.
Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them.
Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
Separately, a case related to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo. The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separataely, on January 23, Imaan and Hadi were arrested by the police in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025. They were then sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.</p><small>2026-02-03 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031326097f46d10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970810/rao-abdul-kareem-notified-as-new-punjab-police-chief-former-ig-appointed-dg-fia-in-major-reshuffle' target='_blank'><strong>Rao Abdul Kareem notified as new Punjab police chief; former IG appointed DG FIA in major reshuffle</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The federal government on Tuesday notified a reshuffle in the Punjab police high command, with Special Branch Additional Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem appointed as the new inspector general of police (IGP), replacing Dr Usman Anwar.
A day earlier, a highly-placed source confirmed to Dawn that the government has approved a change in the provincial police’s top ranks.
In three separate notifications, available with Dawn, Dr Anwar was notified as the new director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), replacing current DG FIA Riffat Mukhtar, who was transferred and directed to report to the Establishment Division, while Kareem was notified as the Punjab IGP.
In a post on X, the Punjab police also confirmed the announcement and expressed optimism that “under his inspiring leadership, the Punjab police will achieve milestones in protecting citizens’ lives and property, ensuring swift delivery of justice, and further strengthening the law and order situation”.







According to a separate press release issued by the Punjab police, Kareem belongs to Nawabshah and joined the police service in 1996 as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP).
“He belongs to the 24th Commons of Police Service of Pakistan,” the statement said.
He has previously held the posts of “commandant Punjab constabulary, DIG Traffic Punjab, RPO Gujranwala, DIG Telecommunication”.
Kareem has also previously served as ASP UT Sukkur, SDPO Sukkur City, Latifabad in Hyderabad and Chiniot, the statement added.
The senior police official was also posted as superintendent of police (SP) in Gujranwala, Lahore, and Sheikhupura, while in Mianwali, Kasur, and Jhang, he served as the district police officer (DPO).
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi offered best wishes to outgoing IGP Anwar for the new role as DG FIA.
“Dr Usman’s transformational leadership reshaped Punjab police, setting new benchmarks in professionalism, reform, and public service,” the interior minister said.
“As he takes charge as DG FIA, a new era begins,” he added.
Naqvi voiced optimism that “with his (Anwar’s) vision and dynamism, the public will witness real, visible change in the coming months”.







Dr Anwar was appointed Punjab IG during a large reshuffle by the Punjab caretaker government in January 2023. He was performing his duties with the National Highways and Motorway Police before being appointed Punjab’s police chief.</p><small>2026-02-03 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03113517650b5da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970799/gold-up-3pc-in-asia-to-4820-an-ounce-silver-5pc-higher-to-8334-an-ounce' target='_blank'><strong>Gold up 3pc in Asia to $4,820 an ounce, silver 5pc higher to $83.34 an ounce</strong></a><br><p>Gold and Asian stocks were on the rebound on Tuesday as trade took a calmer tone after wild swings in metals markets and a deal to cut US tariffs on India helped the mood, while the Australian dollar rose after an interest rate hike.
Australia’s central bank joined Japan as the only developed-world economy to tighten policy, saying above-target inflation and a tight labour market justified a unanimous decision to lift the cash rate 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent.
Markets had mostly anticipated the move, though are now rushing to price in a follow-up in May, which was enough to push the Aussie about 1pc higher and over 70 US cents.
India’s rupee, and stocks cheered an announcement by US President Donald Trump that tariffs on Indian goods would be cut from 50pc to 18pc in return for New Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.
Details, however, were scarce.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei jumped 4pc to recoup Monday’s losses, and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 5pc.
S&P 500 futures ESc1 were up 0.1pc with traders eyeing a busy few sessions of earnings.
With so many positions stopped out by collapses in crowded silver and gold bets, investors were taking stock and sitting back, according to Steven Leung, director of institutional sales at brokerage UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
“It will take a long time for them to rebuild a bull or bear position…so they are staying away from the market,” he said.
Speculation that tax hikes on Chinese telcos could extend to internet giants dragged stocks such as Tencent and Alibaba down by more than 3pc.
Metals stabilise
Gold was up 3pc in Asia to $4,820 an ounce, a bounce of around 9pc from Monday’s lows. Silver traded 5pc higher to $83.34 an ounce.
Gold, silver, stocks, and the dollar have all whipsawed since Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve sent metal prices tumbling. Warsh is seen shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet, pushing up bond yields, which is negative for precious metals that pay no income.
However, the dive in prices on Friday and on Monday went beyond fundamentals and was a wipeout for leveraged positions and sent tremors through global commodity and stock markets as traders sold other assets to bail out losing bets.
Looking ahead, Wall Street earnings are in the frame, with chipmaker AMD and server equipment company Super Micro Computer due to report after market.
Takaichi trade
Currency markets were finding a level after last week’s sharp spike lower in the dollar. The euro bought $1.1809 in the Asia session, off highs hit above $1.20 late in January.
The yen traded at 155.41 per dollar and has retraced about half the gains it made on the greenback that followed talk of possible joint US-Japan intervention to boost the yen.
Polls show Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Liberal Democratic Party heading for a landslide victory at the weekend’s election – putting pressure on bonds and the yen as it would hand a mandate to her agenda for fiscal loosening.
Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama on Tuesday was downplaying weekend remarks from Takaichi highlighting the benefits of a weak yen, at odds with the authorities’ efforts to support it.</p><small>2026-02-03 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03115306a07c19f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970804/pakistan-azerbaijan-naval-chiefs-pledge-to-strengthen-bilateral-defence-ties-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan naval chiefs pledge to strengthen bilateral defence ties: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The naval chiefs of Pakistan and Azerbaijan have pledged to strengthen their existing bilateral defence relationship, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust defence cooperation. In 2024, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf met with Commander Azerbaijan Naval Forces (ANF) Rear Admiral Shahin Mammadov, at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad today, where the two leaders “pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of [the] existing bilateral defence relationship”.







The two, during the meeting, also “discussed matters of mutual interest, regional maritime security situation, and avenues for enhanced cooperation in training and defence”.
The Azeri naval commander, upon arrival at the headquarters, was presented with a guard of honour by “a smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Navy”.
“Thereafter, the dignitary laid a floral wreath at the Shuhada’s Monument,” ISPR said.
“Later, a briefing was also given to the visiting dignitary on Pakistan Navy’s ongoing projects,” the statement read.
“Pakistan and Azerbaijan share longstanding brotherly relations marked by close naval cooperation.
“The visit of commander Azerbaijan naval forces will further enhance bilateral collaboration between the two countries in general and navies in particular,” ISPR added.
Last year in August, Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was honoured with a prestigious war medal by Azerbaijan’s defence minister.</p><small>2026-02-03 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03104106a018469.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970797/cuba-confirms-communications-with-us-but-says-no-negotiations-yet' target='_blank'><strong>Cuba confirms ‘communications’ with US, but says no negotiations yet</strong></a><br><p>Cuba’s government on Monday told AFP that it was in “communication” with US President Donald Trump’s administration but not yet in formal talks on a deal to end Washington’s pressure campaign on the island.
“Today we cannot talk about having dialogue with the United States, but it is true that there have been communications between the two governments,” deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio said in an interview.
Trump on Sunday claimed the United States was in talks with “the highest people” in Cuba and that he expected to “make a deal” with its leadership, without saying what a deal might look like.
De Cossio repeated that Cuba was “open to dialogue” with the United States amid calls from Cubans for the government to negotiate to avert a humanitarian crisis.
Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Havana since the January 3 capture by US special forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a top Cuba ally and financial backer.
Pressured by Washington, Venezuela’s new administration has cut crude shipments to Cuba.
Trump said Monday that Cuba’s other main supplier, Mexico, would also “cease sending them oil” after he threatened tariff rises on any country that allowed Cuba to circumvent the de facto blockade. There was no immediate response from Mexico.
The United States’ largest trading partner had incurred Trump’s ire by sending oil to Cuba to make up for a sharp decline in Venezuela’s output under Maduro.



As recently as December, Mexico was still sending crude to Cuba.
President Claudia Sheinbaum had been loathe to cut the lifeline to Cuba, warning of a “far-reaching humanitarian crisis directly affecting hospitals, food supplies, and other basic services for the Cuban people.”
But she also admitted last week: “We don’t want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs.” A decree signed by Trump last week effectively forced her and other Cuban partners to choose.
The highest people
The pressure tactics threaten to plunge Cuba into complete darkness, with its power stations already struggling to keep the lights on due to fuel shortages.
Jorge Grosso, a 23-year-old student who spent nearly 24 hours last week queueing at a petrol station to fill up his Lada, told AFP he backed talks “to see what conditions are imposed (by Trump) because in the end they’re strangling us.” For months Cubans have been forced to cope with power outages lasting up to 20 hours a day in rural areas.
On Monday, Trump repeated his claim that Cuba, which is limping through its worst economic crisis in decades, is a “failed nation.” He added he believed “we are pretty close (to a deal), but we are dealing with the Cuban leaders right now.”
His pressure on Sheinbaum comes as the United States and its southern neighbour begin talks on a review of a tripartite free trade deal with Canada, which is crucial to Mexico’s economy.
Over the past year, Sheinbaum has been scrambling to stave off the kind of tariff pain Trump has imposed on other allies.
In a move widely seen as an attempt to appease him, Mexico in January imposed stiff tariffs on imports from China.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0308413910f08ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970788/trump-warns-of-bad-things-if-no-deal-reached-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns of ‘bad things’ if no deal reached with Iran</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his counterpart Donald Trump threatened “bad things” if no deal with the Islamic republic was struck.
Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned late on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.







Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression.
Iranian state media reported on Monday that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington.
Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of nuclear talks.
“I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” Pezeshkian said in a post on X.
The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said.







A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
‘Police the world’
Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”.
Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people. The economic troubles are back-breaking… The officials should do something tangible, not just talk.”
The protests were sparked in late December by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January.
Authorities have said the protests were “riots” inflamed by its arch-foes US and Israel, with Khamenei likening them to a “coup” attempt.
Ambassadors summoned
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.
Young Iranian Selina, who would not give her full name, travelled to Iraqi Kurdistan seeking some relief from “living in fear”.
“It’s not safe for us” in Iran, the 25-year-old told AFP.
“We don’t even dare to go out after 6:00 pm because soldiers are everywhere.”
The crackdown prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies.
The EU also issued fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, including the interior minister, a move echoed on Monday by Britain, which announced sanctions on 10 individuals over the “brutality against protesters”.
Baqaei said on Monday the foreign ministry had summoned all the EU member state ambassadors in Tehran over the designation, and that other responses were to come.
Iranian state television also announced four foreigners had been arrested in Tehran for “participation in riots”, without specifying their nationalities.
Authorities have continued to announce arrests, with rights groups estimating at least 40,000 people have been detained over the protests.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031113591a6fc54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970792/pakistan-to-participate-in-us-critical-minerals-moot-seeks-strategic-partnerships-and-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to participate in US critical minerals moot, seeks strategic partnerships and investment</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is participating in the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial at the US Department of State on Wednesday, as Islamabad seeks to expand foreign investment and forge strategic partnerships in the minerals and energy sectors.
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik is representing Pakistan at the two-day conference, which is expected to bring together delegations from more than 50 countries to discuss strengthening and diversifying global supply chains for critical minerals—materials essential for advanced technologies, clean energy transitions and defence industries.
Hosting the meeting, the US State Department said the ministerial aims to “advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains” and to create momentum for international collaboration to secure resources “vital to technological innovation, economic strength, and national security”.
Opening remarks at the conference are scheduled to be delivered by US Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Global Supply Chains David Copley, and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg. Secretary Rubio is also due to hold a press availability with visiting delegations.
Pakistan plans to use the forum to highlight its largely untapped mineral potential, including reserves of copper, gold and rare earth elements. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation on the development and processing of critical minerals, reflecting what officials describe as expanding US–Pakistan engagement in this strategic area.
Minister Malik arrived in Washington on Sunday evening with a delegation of senior officials and technical experts who oversee Pakistan’s efforts to deepen foreign investment and international collaboration, particularly through enhanced engagement with friendly partners.
According to the State Department, “strengthening critical mineral supply chains with our international partners is vital to America’s economic and national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future.”
US officials say the discussions are expected to focus on supply-chain resilience, investment frameworks, and sustainable mining, processing and recycling capabilities.
The invitation list reflects a growing coalition of mineral-rich and industrial nations, including G7 members, India, South Korea, Australia and several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Kenya. The DRC, in particular, is expected to be represented at the highest level, with President Félix Tshisekedi attending alongside his mining minister.
For Pakistan, participation in the Washington gathering aligns with broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment, while avoiding entanglement in major-power rivalry over control of these resources.
Pakistan has invited both China and the US to the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF) 2026, scheduled for April 8–9 in Islamabad, aiming to secure investment for an estimated $6–8 billion in annual mineral export potential.
The forum will focus on copper, gold and rare earth minerals, with an emphasis on deepening China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)–related cooperation with Beijing, while also engaging other international partners.
Pakistan’s delegation is expected to remain in Washington through the end of the week to participate in related sessions and hold bilateral meetings with government and industry counterparts.</p><small>2026-02-03 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/030933239a737b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697/back-channel-talks-underway-after-pakistan-decide-to-skip-india-t20-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>‘Back-channel talks underway after Pakistan decide to skip India T20 World Cup clash’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The government of Pakistan’s decision on Sunday not to play its T20 World Cup group match against India, scheduled for Feb 15, has prom­pted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to initiate back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses, Dawn has learnt.
The decision was announced around 15 days ahead of the scheduled fixture, giving the ICC sufficient time to explore possible options, including accommodating any reservations Pakistan may have, sources said.
According to sources, a couple of other cricket boards have also stepped in to assist the ICC in its efforts to reach an amicable solution with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Pakistan announced its decision without citing a specific reason for boycotting the match against India. In the past, however, Australia and the West Indies forfeited their World Cup matches against Sri Lanka in 1996 on security grounds following instructions from their governments. England and New Zealand similarly forfeited matches against Zimbabwe and Kenya, respectively, during the 2003 World Cup on political grounds.
Some quarters have termed Pakistan’s move a mistake, noting that unlike previous instances involving other teams, no explicit justification was provided. Sources, however, said the PCB has factored this into its position and plans to rely on proceedings of the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in a case filed by Pakistan against India in 2018.
That case stemmed from India’s failure to honour a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the PCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2014, under which the two countries were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.
In return, the PCB had supported the ICC’s ‘Big Three’ revenue-sharing model, under which India, Australia and England received a larger share of ICC revenues.
“During the hearing, the PCB asked the BCCI to explain its refusal to tour Pakistan,” a sou­r­ce familiar with the 2018 proceedings said. “Initially, the BCCI stated that it was not obliged to provide a reason. Later, it claimed that the Indian government had not allowed the tour.”
When the PCB requested written instructions from the Indian government, the BCCI responded that such decisions were conveyed verbally and not documented, the source added.
Despite this, sources expressed concerns that, as in 2018, the BCCI influence within the ICC could again result in a ruling against Pakistan, potentially leading to financial penalties or sanctions. In such an event, the government of Pakistan may consider approaching an international court of arbitration, sources said.
It is believed that Pakistan’s decision was influenced by a recent ICC ruling involving Bangladesh. The ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to shift its World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka on security grounds and instead excluded Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing it with Scotland. The decision was passed by a 14-2 majority, with only Pakistan and Bangladesh voting against the move.
The India-Pakistan fixture is considered the most lucrative match in world cricket and a cornerstone of the ICC’s revenue model. Media reports estimate its overall commercial value at around $500 million, factoring in broadcast rights, advertising premiums, sponsorships, ticket sales and ancillary commercial activity. Advertising slots during an India-Pakistan T20 typically fetch between Rs2.5 million and Rs4 million for 10 seconds.
Following Pakistan’s announcement, the ICC issued a strongly worded statement, urging the PCB to “explore a mutually acceptable resolution which protects the interests of all stakeholders”.
“The ICC notes the statement made by the government of Pakistan regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026,” the statement said. “While the ICC awaits official communication from the PCB, selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event.”
“ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competition,” it added.
While acknowledging the role of governments in matters of national policy, the ICC warned that the decision was “not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan”.
There are reports that even if Pakistan maintains its stance, the Indian team will travel to Colombo for the scheduled match. If Pakistan do not field a team at the appointed time, India are expected to claim the points under tournament regulations.

Yet the lake is not doing so well. It is slowly drying.
A recent visit to Haleji Lake organised by Green Media Initiatives in collaboration with Accountability Lab Pakistan and the Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD) helped highlight several issues with this sanctuary.
A man-made lake, Haleji, located some 88 kilometres from Karachi, was constructed during World War II, between 1940 and 1943, by the British rulers in India to provide water to their troops stationed in Karachi. According to In Charge Haleji Wildlife Sanctuary, Sohail Ahmed Khoso this was initially a saltwater lake. But then the British created a small natural depression into a reservoir fed by a feeder canal from the Indus River. “That is how fresh sweet water from the Indus was stored here and supplied to Karachi,” he said.
“Soon after, migrant birds from Siberia started frequenting here. Following the Ramsar Convention in 1971, Haleji Lake was included in the list of protected Ramsar sites, which includes marshes, lakes, mangroves and man-made sites. So far some 172 nations are signatories to the Ramsar Convention of which Pakistan is also one,” he said. “The SWD also made Haleji Lake a protected area in 1972.

Water levels are dropping due to stoppage of inflows from the Indus for eight years now, official says

“We have some 225 wetlands in Pakistan of which 19 are Ramsar wetlands. And nine of those 19 Ramsar wetlands happen to be in Sindh of which the most important lake with so much biodiversity is Haleji Lake,” Mr Khoso pointed out.
Of late, Haleji Lake has become the biggest victim of water scarcity, which carries its consequences. With the levels of water in the lake falling rapidly, the food for the migratory birds is also reduced in quantity. The birds flying by this route include Northern Pintail, white-tailed Lapwing, Egyptian Vulture, Pheasant Tailed Jacana, ducks, Waders, pelicans, Mallards and so many more. The SWD carries out a census of the birds. It is worrisome to note their numbers may be decreasing.
The reason behind the water scarcity at Haleji Lake, as pointed out by Mr Khoso, is the stoppage of inflow of sweet water for eight years now.
“We are no longer getting water from the Indus River. It is being diverted towards water projects such as the K-IV before it reaches here. Earlier, water to Karachi was going from here. With no inflow and no out flow either, Haleji Lake has become a stagnant water body,” he said.
Ecologist Rafiul Haq, added to that by saying that wetlands support life forms. Therefore they are seen as unique ecosystems. “Wetlands also have economic value,” he said.
“One-third of our planet is water and nine per cent of it is taken up by wetlands. It amounts to around 63 million hectares of water bodies, which earns $3.4 billion per year for services such as water purification and supply, flood protection, recreation and tourism,” he said.
But he also regretted that all over the world and not just here in Pakistan, the degradation rate of wetlands is going up. “According to an estimate, it is happening at a rate, which is threefold the rate of deforestation due to climate change. Urban expansion, agriculture land use, construction of dams, pollution and climate change are all contributing factors here. It is also a sad estimate that one-fifth or 20 per cent of the remaining wetlands in the world may vanish by 2050 without urgent action,” the ecologist sighed.
“All over the world, World Wetlands Day is celebrated on Feb 2 to mark the 1971 signing of the Convention on Wetlands in Ramsar, Iran. It is important to celebrate this day and understand the dangers befalling our wetlands.
“Naturally, water bodies grow in size during the monsoon and later as the water level goes down they shrink. That’s when people, thinking that the water will not return from the area which dried up, use that land for agriculture. Dams also hurt lakes. When you hinder the natural flow of water you hurt water bodies. Don’t create such issues that disturb the dynamics or water cycles of water bodies.
“We may be signatories to the Ramsar Convention but we are not really doing our bit by not keeping our promises. We have governance gaps when it comes to caring about our natural resources. Our Ramsar commitments are there but their implementation is weak,” the ecologist reminded. “With the migratory birds, the plantation, the tourism which also helps the local community find its own ways of earning livelihoods, Haleji Lake is a biodiversity hub. It requires wise use. Don’t use it to deplete it. Coexist with it,” Mr Haq urged.
