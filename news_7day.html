Initially, pre-qualified bids were submitted by Lucky Cement, private airline Airblue and investment firm Arif Habib in the morning. Airblue exited the race after the first round of bidding, with a proposition lower than the reference price of Rs100bn.
In the first round, Lucky Cement put up a bid of Rs101.5bn, Airblue Rs26.5bn, and the Arif Habib consortium bid Rs115bn, after which the reference price was announced.
Following that, a 30-minute break was taken so that the two top bidders could hold consultations. A second round was then commenced.
It began with the base bid at Rs115bn, and the minimum increment was at Rs250 million. The base price was set on the basis of the highest bid made during the first round by Arif Habib.
Both bidders engaged in a brief competition to outbid each other during the round. However, when Lucky Cement raised its bid to Rs134bn, Arif Habib countered with Rs135bn, forcing Lucky Cement to bow out and congratulate Arif Habib.



The whole process was telecast live and streamed across all TV channels as well as the respective social media handles of the government.
Adviser to the prime minister on privatisation, Muhammad Ali, will also hold a press conference after the conclusion of the bidding process.
Privatisation will ‘promote’ investment
After winning the bid to acquire the national airline, business owner Arif Habib said the privatisation will “promote” investment in the country.
“PIA is our national institution,” Habib said.
“The national airline has witnessed days of glory and was once ranked number two in the world. All its employees are very competent,” he added.
Habib said he is hopeful of resolving all shortcomings with the new capital investment.
When asked about his expansion plans, he said, “Initially, we plan to expand the fleet to 38 aircraft in the first phase, then to 65, depending on demand.”
The successful bidder assured he would give “confidence to PIA employees” and help in “realising their potential.”
“Employment opportunities will grow as we expand,” Habib said. “The existing experienced employees will also get opportunities.”
“When all necessary capital investment is made, they will perform well.”
Later, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the business tycoon said that he was willing to bring in foreign airlines once the transaction was completed.
Asked if he was willing to bring in additional investors, including foreign airlines, Habib expressed hope that they would come on board.
“Now that we’re the highest bidder and once the cabinet approves the deal, we will have about 90 days to negotiate with them and possibly bring them into the airline,” he replied.
Habib added that his company would approach airlines, adding that once the consortium acquires PIA, it will demonstrate that it is able to put more capital into the flag carrier.
He also noted that the consortium‘s bid was Rs4bn higher than their adviser’s valuation.
“I think our adviser’s valuation was Rs131bn, so when the bidding happened, we ended up paying an entry premium,” he said, adding that this provision is needed when buying an active business.
“Considering the Lucky Group is strong and has deep pockets, that was something we took into consideration. We were expecting that this transaction would be achieved at around Rs130bn,” the tycoon elaborated.
Habib said it was a “big comfort” because when bids increase, there is more funding available for development and turnaround.
“This was a big factor behind the valuation,” he said.
Habib stated that he wanted to purchase a 100pc stake in PIA, but the transition commission produced a “very good structure” and limited the bids to 75pc of the flag carrier.
“They gave us the option of a balance of 25pc, which we can exercise in 90 days,” he said.
“The payment can be made within a year with a 12pc per annum premium. We need to assess the company’s value and make a decision within three months. If we avail the option, we will have to make the payment at a 12pc premium.”
’A very good start“
Khaqan Najeeb, a seasoned economist and policy expert, hailed the privatisation as a “sought-after” micro-economic reform that “must take place”.
Talking to Geo News, Najeed said, “It is a very good start that after 19-20 years, we have successfully privatised a major institution.”
“We have achieved this milestone on the third attempt. We must always remember that, despite parking Rs650 billion – not a small amount – in a holding company, it couldn’t be achieved,” he said.
“After removing a liability of Rs33 billion from the balance sheet of PIA and adding various other incentives in the form of tax or other concessions, only then have we made this happen,” Najeeb said.
The economist termed the development a “good outcome” and “positive” for the national airline.
“However, we achieved this by offering tax favours, deferred credits, and creating positive equities,” he said.
“We must notice that, as a good sweetener, it was necessary to reinvest 92.5% of the sold 75% in PIA, while only giving 7.5% to the state to run the company, because it is in need of significant funds to manage its affairs.”
“The company needs money to grow despite having multiple landing rights and air services agreements.”
He highlighted that the national airline has 18 planes in its fleet and carries four million passengers, but “it will not be enough to achieve economies of scale.”
“We have to reconsider how we have supported our SOEs, giving repeated sweeteners and unnecessary concessions, while selling a national airline that holds dozens of landing rights.”
Najeeb said that if anyone runs this company with “financial muscle,” a hidden value could be rediscovered. “I hope that when we finalise this deal, we will design a proper business and investment plan to expand the current fleet from 18 to 50 aeroplanes, reach further destinations, and carry more passengers,” he said.
“It’s a long way to go.”
Labelling the development as “positive,” he added, “There was a time when we were losing Rs50 to Rs100 billion. We can now avoid such losses – a good way to save taxpayers’ money.”
“However,” he reminded, “we have to keep in mind that for the Rs650 billion parked in the holding company, we have to pay around Rs30 billion every year from taxpayers’ money, according to estimates.”
He remarked that an “overhang” exists in Pakistan’s aviation policy, which has to be “fixed.”
The economist further stated the three important aspects of a good economy. “The first is a good regulatory environment, the second is a smooth policy-making process, and the last is the efficiency of operations,” he explained. “That’s how the economy works.”
‘Historic day for Pakistan’
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the sale as “a historic day for Pakistan” and congratulated Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, among others.
“It was our firm commitment to the people of Pakistan that speedy and concrete steps would be taken to privatise loss-making state-owned enterprises that have been a burden on the economy,” the PM wrote.
“The successful completion of the transparent and highly competitive bidding process for the privatisation of PIA marks an important milestone in fulfilling that commitment.”







The PM added that he has always maintained that regardless of which consortium won the auction, “Pakistan would be the ultimate winner and today’s outcome fully vindicates that belief”.
“The strong participation of our leading business groups and some of Pakistan’s most seasoned and respected investors is a powerful vote of confidence in our economy and its future,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
“This is work in progress and we will continue our hard work with even greater vigour and perseverance in the days ahead to build a brighter future for our nation.”
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also offered his congratulations on the successful privatisation of PIA.
“Pakistan has won today,” he exclaimed.
“By the grace of God, the process has been conducted with transparency,” Naqvi said.
He also extended felicitations to Advisor on Privatisation Mohammad Ali and his team, the prime minister, and especially to those who “secured PIA”.
“We are all looking forward to travelling through PIA again,” he added.







The Ministry of Privatisation also congratulated the consortium for winning the auction.
Aurangzeb hopes PIA sale will bring investment
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, speaking at the bidding ceremony, thanked the PM‘s aide and his team for their efforts and hailed the bidding process in terms of transparency.
“It takes a lot of time and effort to get to a good place where we are today,“ he said.
“All of the bidders today are from Pakistan. I used to say that no matter which team wins, Pakistan would win.”
He lauded Pakistan‘s biggest conglomerates for “vying for the best airline” and said that the flag carrier would be led by investors and some of Pakistan’s most experienced businesspeople.
“The fact that they have stepped up is a doubtless sign that anyone who is the successful bidder will take it not only to where we were, but where we need to be in the comity of nations,” Aurangzeb added.
“We need to stop the bleeding and losses, but more importantly, our institutions need to be part of the comity of nations, and we will take them there,” he added.
Aurangzeb also expressed hope that the bidding would increase the number of local investors and, in turn, the number of foreign investors entering the country.
“The government, through the privatisation of business entities under state custody, will not only save itself from losses in the thousands of billions but also accelerate the process of economic recovery,” he wrote, congratulating the privatisation commission.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif took to X to celebrate the sale, calling it a “growing vote of confidence in the national economy”.
Asif added that Europe and the UK lifting bans on PIA‘s operations was a major contributor to the success of today’s deal.
“From a bid of Rs10bn in the past to a price of Rs135bn today, it is proof of trust in our Civil Aviation Regulator.”
He also assailed the PTI government for leaving “no stone unturned to destroy PIA”, adding that it took three years to rebuild the flag carrier.







At the outset of the ceremony, the adviser to the prime minister on privatisation addressed the audience.
Ali hoped that PIA’s privatisation would open “paths for investment in the country”.
“I would also like to thank all bidders who are present today, and those who were part of the bidding process but did not reach the final round. We wouldn‘t have been here without them, and this process wouldn’t have been completed,” he said.
“We actively engaged with all the bidders. Two of them demanded to take up to 75 per cent at least, and the other two demanded 100pc,“ he said.
“We wanted a multitude of bidders so the process of bidding would be transparent and competitive,” he continued.
He said that the government had “decided to sell at least 75pc of shares, and simultaneously, we also decided to offer the other 25pc”.
“Bidders will have the right to consider and let the government know if they also want to buy the other 25pc in the next 90 days,” he said.
He further said, “The transaction would be from 75pc up to 100pc; however, 75pc of them will be made available for sale today”.
“The government wanted to structure this transaction so it would also get a fair share and investment to be made,” he said, adding that the government did not just want to sell PIA but “to bring the national airline back to the glory it enjoyed in the past”.
He stressed the need for bringing in “new investment, buy new carriers and repair the engine, cut the liabilities, pay the employees on time”.
“If we want to expand the fleet from 18 planes to 30-40 or more, then investment is the only way,” he added.
Pre-qualified bids
In the morning, representatives of the bidding groups had walked in one by one to deposit sealed offers into a transparent box, briefly fumbling as they pushed envelopes through the slot in a separate public ceremony in Islamabad that was also broadcast on state television.
Following that, the reference price for PIACL’s bidding was approved by the Privatisation Commission Board and the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation after bids were received.







Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Ali said, “God willing, we will get a good bid, there will be good investment, and we will succeed.“
The auction was Pakistan’s second attempt at selling the once storied flag carrier after televised bidding last year collapsed when a solitary offer fell far below the government‘s reference price, derailing what would have been the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, thanked government officials and the Privatisation Commission for their role in the national carrier’s privatisation.
He stressed that the process has been made “transparent“, stating that it will be the “largest transaction” ever in Pakistan’s history.
“Today, as the bidding starts [..] the bids will come in sealed envelopes, there will be transparent boxes, there will be a live telecast. When the price is determined, the envelopes will be opened. They will compete, and whoever has the highest bid will [succeed],“ he said.
“Only God knows how high the bid will go, but the process must come back to the cabinet,” he said.
Unsuccessful bidders to be excluded from PIA management
Earlier, Ali said the two unsuccessful bidders will be excluded from any future role in the airline’s management thanks to a unique stipulation.
In recent remarks, he explained that losing bidders will have no right to join the winning bidder, and only those groups who were not party to the auction would be able to join the new management.
This means that while only one of the three consortiums currently in the running for the flag carrier will become part of its administration upon acquisition of a majority stake, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd retains the option to join with them subsequently, if it wishes to.
The company was previously in the race for PIA but then decided to quit the bidding process.
Ahead of Tuesday’s bidding, reports surfaced of a behind-the-scenes deal involving at least two of the parties involved — the Arif Habib and Lucky Cement groups — that reportedly fell through.
In a tweet, journalist Kamran Khan alluded to a meeting where it was proposed to split the controlling stake among three of the four interested parties. However, Khan claimed, this arrangement fell through as one of the parties — i.e. the Muhammad Ali Tabba-led Lucky Cement group — did not agree to it.







Both Tabba and a high-ranking government official privy to developments confirmed this, but clarified that this was not a government-brokered mee­ting, but rather an informal interaction.
Talking to Dawn, Tabba expressed unwavering confidence in the privatisation process, and clarified that the proposal was floated to him after a meeting in Islamabad, which he did not pursue.

Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, party members and lawyers, prompting them to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex every Tuesday and Thursday — the court-mandated days for visiting Imran. At times, police also used water cannons and baton charges to disperse them.
A Dawn correspondent said that the PTI founder’s sisters left Factory Naka at around 9:30pm and moved towards Gorakhpur on foot, before heading home. Meanwhile, traffic resumed as soon as the 6-hour sit-in ended.
Half an hour before that, the Saddar police station house officer arrived at the protest site and began negotiations with PTI’s Shaukat Basra and Meena Khan Afridi. After initial talks, the PTI leaders reached out to Imran’s sisters for consultation.
An earlier post shared on the PTI’s official X account showed that the sit-in was ongoing at 7pm. In a video shared in the post, PTI workers are seen shouting slogans of “Prime Minister Imran Khan“.







A Dawn correspondent confirmed that police had installed a riot fence near the Factory Naka in Rawalpindi, and upon reaching the spot, Imran’s sister, along with party workers, staged a sit-in.
Earlier today, a PTI livestream showed crowds of party supporters marching towards the prison on Adiala Road, before being stopped in front of the riot fence, where they chanted slogans and waved Pakistani and PTI flags.
On the occasion, Aleema said that Imran was being kept in “solitary confinement”, stressing that the “government had become so fearful of Imran’s message that they had resorted to breaking the law” — in a reference to the police presence at the scene.







Speaking to reporters, Aleema said that the authorities are afraid of Imran, which is why they have jailed him.
When asked about the statement issued after the TTAP’s two-day conference, she said it “was not a statement”.
“The PTI people are saying that they want to negotiate (with the government), I responded by saying that Imran Khan has instructed Sohail Afridi to take to the streets and lead a movement,” she said.
She added that this last message came from lawyer Salman Safdar, who represented the PTI founder when he was convicted in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday.
“Whoever says that we should negotiate with the government after Imran gave these instructions, they cannot be a member of Imran Khan’s party,” Aleema stated.







“We will sit here and we will not leave Imran Khan.
She questioned what the government wants to negotiate when meetings with the PTI founder have been banned.
“Tell me why I cannot have meetings (with Imran),“ she said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja spoke to reporters and said that the party’s struggle is now a national one for democracy and judicial independence.
“These punishments are unlawful and wrong,” Raja said when asked about Imran’s conviction. “Punishments have been handed out before. These are false cases.
“We are standing against a system of lies and will file appeals. But the true cases will be fought in the public‘s court and Allah’s court,” he added.
Raja said that Imran would be released when “the people decide on this case”.
Asked about the street movement, the secretary general said that Imran instructed the KP CM to lead it in the province.
“Sohail Afridi is ready and this will occur soon,” he replied, adding that when the time comes, there will be a similar movement in Punjab.
In response to a question about negotiations with the government, Raja said: “These are false reports; Imran has given nobody in the party the power to start talks with the government.
“Only [TTAP chief Mahmood Khan] Achakzai and [Senator] Allama Nasir have the power to do this,” he added. “Achakzai sahib gave his statement during the conference. He said that he will not negotiate with people who break into and rob his house.”
Raja affirmed that the PTI would stand by its principles and their claim that the February 8 elections were “stolen”.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
On Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would remain suspended till February 8.

The latest release includes around 11,000 files containing 30,000 pages of documents, with many redactions, including an email from a prosecutor indicating President Trump had travelled aboard his private jet “many more times than previously has been reported”.
The tranche of materials released on Friday included photographs of former Democratic president Bill Clinton and other famous names.
According to BBC News, these include the likes of pop stars Diana Ross, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson, actor Kevin Spacey, British politician Peter Mandelson and former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, broadcaster Walter Cronkite, French modelling agent Jean Luc Brunel and Virgin founder Richard Branson.
An initial review of the released materials by BBC News and The Guardian yielded three particularly damning pieces of correspondence.
The first was a letter from Epstein to Larry Nassar – the US gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of young gymnasts – ostensibly written while the former was in prison.
“Dear LN as you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home. Good Luck! We share one thing … our love & caring for young ladies at the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch’, whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair. Yours, J Epstein.”
The second is a series of emails between an individual identified as ‘The Invisible Man’ – believed to be an alias of former prince Andrew – and Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
In 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for crimes including conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and sex trafficking of a minor.
Sent on August 16, 2001, the email begins: “I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.“Lower down, the sender asks: “Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?” The sign-off reads: “See ya A xxx.”


An email between Ghislaine Maxwell and a user known as The Invisible Man is shown in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, DC., the US on December 23, 2025. — Reuters

The BBC maintained that the email did not indicate any wrongdoing, but said it had contacted Andrew’s team for a response.
In October 2025, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.
A third email, concerned with Donald Trump, which had both the sender and recipient redacted, is part of an email chain, which includes the subject heading: ‘Epstein flight records’.
The email states: “He is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having travelled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.”
“On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old” - with the person’s name redacted.
It goes on: “On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.

Trump defends ‘innocent people’
For his part, President Trump – who was the one pushing for the release of the files – said on Monday that people who “innocently met” Jeffrey Epstein in the past risked having their reputations ruined by the release.
In his first comments since the Justice Department began releasing the files on Friday, the president also dismissed the furore over Epstein as a distraction from his party’s achievements.
“This whole thing with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,” he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago home.
Former president Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of photos from the Epstein files released by the Justice Department and Trump was asked for his reaction.
“I like Bill Clinton. I’ve always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I hate to see photos come out of him,” he said. “There’s photos of me too. Everybody was friendly with this guy (Epstein).”
Trump said he did not like the release of pictures of Clinton and others, calling it a “terrible thing”.
“Bill Clinton’s a big boy, he can handle it,” he said.

In a statement released by his spokesman, Clinton urged the Justice Department to release any materials in the files related to the former president, saying he had nothing to hide.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA), passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, mandated the complete release of the Epstein files by Friday of last week.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has blamed the delay on the need to redact the identities of Epstein’s more than 1,000 victims from the hundreds of thousands of documents and photos in the government’s possession.
EFTA co-sponsors Ro Khanna, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, threatened over the weekend to bring contempt of Congress charges against Attorney General Pam Bondi for failing to comply with the law.
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution on Monday calling for legal action against the Trump administration for failing to release the complete Epstein files.</p><small>2025-12-23 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23123922f34193d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962796/punjab-cm-argues-against-lhcs-suspension-of-land-protection-law-says-move-will-benefit-encroachment-mafias' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM argues against LHC’s suspension of land protection law. says move will ‘benefit encroachment mafias’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed strong concern on Tuesday on the suspension of the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 by the Lahore High Court (LHC), arguing that the move would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”.
Maryam‘s statement issued by the CM’s Office comes a day after LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum issued an interim order suspending the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, which empowers dispute resolution committees led by deputy commissioners to resolve property disputes.
The ordinance was approved by the Punjab chief minister on Oct 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
The law has been challenged in the LHC, about which Maryam argued that its enactment was aimed at providing “long-awaited relief to millions of citizens suffering from prolonged land and property disputes”.
“The legislation, for the first time, fixed a 90-day time frame for the resolution of land and property cases that have historically dragged on for years and even generations,” she said, terming the law a “major step” toward protecting ordinary citizens from powerful land grabbers and mafias.
Maryam emphasised that the “democratically elected Punjab Assembly had passed the law to free the public from the grip of influential land mafias”.
The legislation, she insisted, empowered citizens to safeguard their legally owned land and properties.
The legislation was “evidence-based and comprehensive”, covering both administrative and legal dimensions to ensure justice for the oppressed, the CM said.
Maryam further maintained that the LHC‘s decision to suspend the ordinance’s operation “is not in line with the settled principles laid down by the superior judiciary”.
Its suspension would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”, and the public would perceive it as state patronage of such elements, she said.
The CM highlighted that progress in cases pertaining to land and property would often be stalled by stay orders for decades, and justice was being denied to rightful owners.
“This law was neither made for my personal benefit nor does its suspension harm me personally,” she said, adding that “real loss” from its suspension would be borne by the poor, widows, the helpless, and other marginalised citizens who were finally beginning to receive relief.
Maryam stressed that “legislation is the constitutional right of the provincial assembly and cannot be obstructed”.
Halting the new property law would “shatter the fragile hope of justice that had been rekindled among the poor and oppressed segments of society”, the CM said.
Ministers defend the law
Punjab Law Minister Malik Sohaib Ahmad Bherth, Information Minister Azma Bukhari, and treasury MPAs strongly defended the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, in the provincial assembly as debate over the suspension of the law intensified in the House.
Bherth maintained that the objective of the law was to make people’s lives easier, as land grabbing remained one of the biggest public grievances.
He credited CM Maryam for initiating reforms, saying that whenever she decided to curb crime, results started to appear.
The law minister claimed that officials received a large number of applications after the passage of the law, and the government started taking action on public grievances.
“So far, the government has retrieved around 5,000 properties from illegal occupants,” he said.
He noted that certain mafias opposed the law and took the matter to the high court.
“When a system is moving towards improvement, it should be allowed to function, and its weaknesses should be corrected rather than derailing it,” he said, stressing that institutions must work together.
Speaking on the matter, Information Minister Azma Bukhari said the law was designed to safeguard legal property owners, as it stood firm against the land-grabbing mafia that operates through an organised network with alleged links to sections of the bureaucracy.
“Under the law, a 90-day timeframe is provided to establish illegal occupation. So far, the officials have announced decisions in 5,044 cases, including rulings on illegal possession,” she said.
She added that committees formed under the law also scrutinised fake and forged property documents during proceedings.
Bukhari said residents of areas where cases have been decided are satisfied, as properties have been retrieved from land grabbers not in months or weeks, but in some instances, within hours.
She pointed out that the LHC currently has 169,000 pending cases, including around 11,000 property-related disputes.
She further stated that similar property protection laws are in force in countries such as China, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States, expressing surprise over a court decision reportedly directing the reversal of decisions already made under the law.
“No victim of the land grabbers was asked which party they voted for,” she said, adding that the chief minister’s sole objective was to stand with the poor.
Earlier, initiating the debate in the assembly, treasury MPA Amjad Ali Javed termed the suspension of the bill “regrettable,” saying it was meant to provide long-denied justice to citizens suffering due to land and property disputes.
He pointed out that overseas Pakistanis’ lands remained under illegal occupation for years due to prolonged stay orders.
“Millions of cases are pending in courts, and citizens spend years seeking justice. Suspension of the law adds to their suffering,” he said, urging the high courts to issue remarks with caution and allow institutions to perform their constitutional roles.
Opposition lawmaker Brigadier (retd) Mushtaq questioned “the government’s hostility toward the judiciary” and alleged that the government sought a weak judiciary while empowering district administrations and the police.
“Despite past grievances, the PTI stands with the judiciary and opposes concentrating all powers in the hands of deputy commissioners,” he added.
While Maryam has defended the law, LHC CJ Neelum expressed her disapproval of the law during the hearing on Monday, saying: “It appears that some people want to hold all powers”.
The judge had further observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights, and judicial supremacy.
“If it were up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Const­itution,” she had said.
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum had asked how a revenue officer could hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.</p><small>2025-12-23 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/231846540e482f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962819/ppp-senator-palwasha-khan-files-privilege-motion-against-aleem-khan-calls-his-conduct-highly-unbecoming' target='_blank'><strong>PPP Senator Palwasha Khan files privilege motion against Aleem Khan, calls his conduct ‘highly unbecoming’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Palwasha Khan on Tuesday submitted a privilege motion in a Senate committee against Communications Minister Aleem Khan for reacting in a manner “highly unbecoming” to hold public office.
A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan last week during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project.
Palwasha blamed Aleem for personal attacks as he reacted angrily to parliamentary scrutiny.
“We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem had responded, saying that he cannot stand the allegations levelled against him.
During a press conference in Islamabad today, the senator, along with other party members, condemned the behaviour of the communications minister.
She emphasised that it was not a personal matter, but a question of the collective dignity of parliament, and that remaining silent on this would not be appropriate.

“If we tolerate and don’t raise our voice against this, it will soon become the norm.” She clarified that she did not blame anyone.
“I had submitted a written question a few months ago under the rights granted to lawmakers. However, the responsible officials never responded, which subsequently led to this question being added to the agenda of the Senate’s Standing Committee.”
Palwasha elaborated that she raised a question over a road built by the National Highway Authority and funded by the taxpayers’ money.
“I asked whether it was built for public benefit or to give an advantage to a specific society.”
“Raising questions on the utilisation of public resources is the fundamental duty of the legislators,” she added.
“Time will decide who was at fault and who was subjected to injustice,” The senator said.
PPP senator thanked her party leadership for “clearly” declaring that the party will never compromise on the “dignity of the parliamentarians and the democratic rights of lawmakers”.
“A Senate committee is not a drawing room; it is the extension of the parliament in which everyone is answerable, where not the voice but the argument should be strong.”
“Unfortunately, people mix up indecency and coarseness with courage,” she indicated.
She further stated that the communication minister’s behaviour was neither “democratic” nor “up to the standards of parliament”.
“The dignity comes through the practices, not the personalities.” She further said, “Politics is not a circus, but it has become one in our country. We will resist this.”
The senator maintained that her party had always defended the dignity of the parliament, women’s rights and democratic values.
“I am not against anyone,” she said. “However, PM Shehbaz Sharif has to consider the attitude of his cabinet members. It is a collective responsibility, and the PM is primarily responsible for it.”
The senator further stated that “disrespecting women cannot become a routine“, and added that she would also release media which will ”further expose the minister“.
She also demanded that the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) be constituted to conduct a forensic audit of all matters related to the Communications Ministry based on the revelations in the IMF report.
The senator also lamented the conduct of the committee chairman for “not giving a ruling or interrupting”.
Earlier, PPP leader Sherry Rehman had said that Aleem must apologise following his heated exchange with Palwasha.
“He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said.
PPP on Sunday also termed the verbal attacks by the minister “disappointing”.
“Humiliation of a party woman is intolerable and the PPP will not sit silent on the matter,” he said. Without naming the minister, the PPP secretary general said: “The arrogance of power was speaking loudly. The sanctity of the (standing) committee was marred,” Mr Khan said.</p><small>2025-12-23 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/231038161f841d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962788/security-forces-kill-8-terrorists-after-attack-on-police-vehicle-martyrs-5-cops-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 8 terrorists after attack on police vehicle martyrs 5 cops in KP’s Karak</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: Eight terrorists were killed in a search operation launched after five cops were martyred when their police mobile came under attack in Gurguri area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak on Tuesday.
The district police spokesman, Shaukat Khan, confirmed the incident and the casualties, saying that all of the martyred personnel were constables.
The martyred policemen were identified as constables Shahid Iqbal, Samiullah, Arif, Safdar and Muhammad Abrar, who was also the mobile’s driver, Khan added.
He said that on the instructions of the Kohat Regional Police Office and the Karak district police officer, a joint operation between the Karak Police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) was launched in the area.
“Eight terrorists were killed as they were pursued through tricky and mountainous terrain,” Khan said. “The bodies of the slain terrorists have been shifted to the hospital for a post-mortem, while the process of identifying them is underway.”
While the exact details of the attack remain unclear, an image shared by the police spokesman showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the vehicle.
Meanwhile, a press release from the Karak Police stated that funeral prayers had been offered for the five martyrs, who were presented with full honours.
“In the funeral prayer ceremony, a decorated contingent of police offered a salute to the martyrs, while flowers were placed on the bodies of the martyrs wrapped in the national flag,” the press release read.
Karak Police added that the funeral prayers were attended by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed, among other civilian and police officials.

The CM and chief secretary “met the relatives of the martyrs, expressed their grief and sorrow and paid tribute to their great sacrifice”, the press release added. “The senior officers also assured the relatives of all possible cooperation, government benefits and welfare facilities.”
The statement further said that IG stated that the martyred police personnel sacrificed their lives for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the public, which will never be forgotten.
He further clarified that the KP police would continue its fight against terrorism with full force, professionalism and determination, vowing retaliation for martyrs’ blood.
CM Afridi was quoted as saying that the sacrifices of martyrs are expensive and that the police have always been on the front line in combating terrorism. He added that the government stands by the police, who are being provided with modern equipment.
“Elements hostile to peace will not be forgiven under any circumstances. The sacrifices of the martyred police personnel are a source of pride not only for the police force but also for the entire nation, and their memories will always live on,” CM Afridi as quoted as saying.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident, expressing deep sorrow and grief over the lives lost and offering prayers for the martyred officers, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office.
He extended his condolences to the bereaved families and assured them of the government’s full support during this difficult time.
The prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police force, stating that police personnel had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism and rendered “unparalleled” services to ensure peace and security in the country.
“The entire nation salutes the martyrs who laid down their lives in the line of duty,” the prime minister said, adding that their sacrifices would never be forgotten.
Reiterating the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan remained fully committed to the complete elimination of terrorism in all its forms.
Separately, district police spokesperson Asif Hassan told Dawn that an assistant sub-inspector, Rehmatullah, and a passerby were injured during an exchange of fire between police and wanted suspects in Lakki Marwat’s Tajori area.
Today‘s attack on the vehicle is the latest in a series of incidents in which police personnel have been targeted in the province. Last week, a police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat.
Earlier this month, a cop was martyred while five others were injured in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Lakki Marwat. In November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Hangu.</p><small>2025-12-23 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23180321d264db7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962815/asif-calls-comparison-of-islamabads-action-against-taliban-with-indias-unprovoked-attacks-wrong-and-inappropriate' target='_blank'><strong>Asif calls comparison of Islamabad’s action against Taliban with India’s unprovoked attacks ‘wrong and inappropriate’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday rejected the comparison between Islamabad‘s actions against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and New Delhi’s unprovoked action against the country in May as “wrong and inappropriate”.







The defence minister‘s remarks come a day after Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman questioned Pakistan’s objection to Indian attacks when the country also allegedly conducted cross-border strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan.







Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted strikes in Afghanistan.
In a post on X, Asif also said that India, to date, has “not been able to provide evidence” of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack, despite Pakistan’s offer of “neutral investigations”.
“The report issued by the United Nations also clarifies that the Indian aggression was illegal and unsubstantiated, and Pakistan’s response was fully justified,“ said the defence minister.
He elaborated that the international community and the United Nations are also concerned about terrorism under the regime of the Afghan Taliban, and maintained that the presence of terrorists formations and terrorists infiltrating Pakistan “are a clear proof of this”.
He further stated that “any doubts raised by India, its proxies, and sympathizers” were addressed by the country “earlier and continue to be addressed today”.
Pak-Afghan relations
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.</p><small>2025-12-23 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23114920aabc624.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition' target='_blank'><strong>‘If they are ready, govt is definitely ready’: PM Shehbaz reiterates offer for dialogue with opposition</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he was reiterating his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“.
He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly.
“If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country.
However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”.

 

The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises.
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
This call for reconciliation among political actors was made at the Khawaja Rafique Shaheed reference in Lahore.
Speaking on the occasion, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar urged a new national political charter rooted in tolerance and dialogue while PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah stressed that political stability could only be achieved through restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.
Recently, a similar proposal was also made by five PTI leaders currently incarcerated in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. In a letter, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed argued dialogue was the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.
After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024, and the release of PTI prisoners.
The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped.
However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI.
Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country.
In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA.
The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.
The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill.
He had again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on November 28 that dialogue was the way to resolve issues.
On December 6, after a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue.
Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock.
He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling.
Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”</p><small>2025-12-23 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23185800d87cba8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962820/cdf-field-marshal-munir-talks-about-security-challenges-highlights-indirect-ambiguous-approaches-used-by-hostile-actors' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir talks about security challenges, highlights ‘indirect, ambiguous approaches’ used by hostile actors</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday warned of “indirect and ambiguous approaches” employed by actors hostile to Pakistan, including the use of proxies, during a visit to Islamabad’s National Defence University (NDU).
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the CDF was briefed by civil and military participants of the ongoing national security and war course about their academic perspectives on challenges to national security.
“The field marshal highlighted that hostile elements increasingly employ indirect and ambiguous approaches, including the use of proxies to exploit internal fault lines, rather than overt confrontation,” the statement read.
“He stressed that future leaders must be trained and remain alert to recognise, anticipate and counter such multi-layered cognitive challenges.”

According to the ISPR, the field marshal outlined the complex and evolving global, regional and internal security environment, noting that Pakistan faces broad and persistent challenges in multiple domains.
“He noted that these challenges span conventional, sub-conventional, intelligence, cyber, information, military, economic and other domains, requiring comprehensive multi-domain preparedness, continuous adaptation and synergy amongst all elements of national power,” the statement read.
Field Marshal Munir also highlighted that clear decision-making amid uncertain conditions and mental resilience are critical for operating in today’s contested and diffused security environment.
He also lauded NDU’s role in developing strategic thinkers capable of translating rigorous training and academic insight into effective policy formulation and operational outcomes.
The field marshal “underscored that professional military education remains central to strengthening institutional capacity, fostering indigenous capability, and ensuring long-term national resilience”, the statement added.
He also appreciated the panel’s analysis and conclusions, urging students to “remain vigilant, adaptive and steadfast in upholding the values of integrity, discipline and selfless service”.</p><small>2025-12-23 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/231643434c2e8ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962814/social-media-posts-case-against-imaan-hadi-prosecution-defence-nearly-come-to-blows-after-heated-courtroom-exchange' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case against Imaan, Hadi: prosecution, defence nearly come to blows after heated courtroom exchange</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Proceedings in the controversial social media posts case against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha took a tense turn on Tuesday as lawyers for the prosecution and defence nearly engaged in a physical altercation after a heated exchange during today’s hearing.
A detailed cross-examination of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency’s (NCCIA) witnesses exposed procedural gaps and triggered heated exchanges inside the courtroom.
The court began recording the statements of prosecution witnesses afresh last Tuesday in compliance with directives issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) the day prior, while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order.
The hearing was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka at the District and Sessions Court in Islamabad, with the couple appearing along with their legal teams.
During cross-examination, NCCIA Naib Qasid Afzal admitted that he did not have copies of his contract or service card and conceded that official letters received on October 16 and 20 did not mention the time of receipt.
Chatha pointed out discrepancies between the signatures on official documents, raising questions about the authenticity of record-keeping.
Another prosecution witness, Wasim, informed the court he had been a contract employee for the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for five years and had served with the NCCIA since its establishment.
However, he admitted that he was carrying only an FIA service card and not an NCCIA card and that the USB provided by the investigating officer was not sealed.
Wasim added that he had no written contract describing his job responsibilities and also stated he was unaware of any FIA circular barring the registration of first information reports (FIR) without prior notice.
The most pointed exchange came during the cross-examination of technical expert Anis, who claimed to have prepared over 5,200 forensic reports and stated that he was the sole technical expert at NCCIA.
He informed the court that his report was prepared using surface analysis techniques on seven screenshots and fourteen posts, based strictly on the scope letter issued by the investigating officer.
Anis conceded that neither the complaint nor the scope letter mentioned the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), Manzoor Pashteen or Ali Wazir, and confirmed that the post under scrutiny dated back to October 31, 2021, while the cited individuals were declared proscribed in 2024.
Despite this, he maintained that the accused were spreading a “state-hostile narrative” by referring to enforced disappearances — a position strongly contested by the defence.
Chatha questioned whether references to enforced disappearances by the Supreme Court, high courts, cabinet members, or even former intelligence chiefs would also be considered anti-state. The witness declined to comment, stating such matters were outside his mandate and could only be assessed if presented to him as a case.
Tempers flared when sharp remarks were exchanged between the prosecution and defence, resulting in an attempt at physical confrontation. Police intervened to restore order.
Judge Majoka directed the prosecution to apologise for using inappropriate language and reminded both sides that objections must be addressed through the court.
After a brief recess, further cross-examination revealed that dozens of other social media accounts had retweeted the same content, yet no investigation was conducted against them. The witness acknowledged that the scope of inquiry was limited to the accused.
The court adjourned further proceedings till January 5, when cross-examination of the technical expert will resume.
The controversy at the centre of the case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025, by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the NCCIA Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca).
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
Consequently, an inquiry was initiated, and following its conclusion on August 22, 2025, a first information report was registered against the two, alleging commission of offences under sections 9, 10, 11 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA).
They were indicted in the case on October 30.
Last Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) stayed trial proceedings against the couple until their pending appeals were decided by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case.</p><small>2025-12-23 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23161058bb02741.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808/bangladesh-summons-indian-envoy-over-protests-targeting-its-diplomatic-facilities-vandalism-at-visa-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh summons Indian envoy over protests targeting its diplomatic facilities, vandalism at visa centre</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned India’s high commissioner in Dhaka to protest what it described as violent incidents targeting its diplomatic facilities in India, including vandalism at visa centres and protests outside its mission in New Delhi.
Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma to convey Dhaka’s grave concern over what it called “regrettable incidents” outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the ambassador’s residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22 by “extremist elements.”
The ministry condemned what it described as premeditated acts of violence and intimidation against diplomatic establishments.
It said such acts not only “endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance.”
Calling for a proper investigation, the ministry said: “Bangladesh expects the Government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments.”
According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters had gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.
India’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that the New Delhi demonstration consisted of “20-25 youths” who were dispersed by police after a few minutes, adding that India was “committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions”.
Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also said that India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.
In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.
The tensions with India come as Bangladesh struggles to deal with domestic unrest over the death of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, who was shot in the head while launching his campaign for February’s parliamentary election last week.
His killing sparked widespread protests that spiralled into arson and vandalism targeting major media outlets and cultural institutions.
Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star previously reported that around 100 protesters had gathered in the Chowhatta area and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice.
“Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’.
Bangladesh has also halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi while the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram has suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there.
Protests in India
In another development connected to the tensions between the two countries, hundreds of people protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi today against the lynching of a Hindu man over allegations of blasphemy.
Factory worker Dipu Chandra Das, 27, was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district last week by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). At least 10 people have been arrested in connection with his death.
Tuesday’s demonstration, called by Hindu groups, involved people clashing with police personnel as they tried to push through barricades set up near the High Commission, television footage showed.
They also chanted slogans and burnt pictures of Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, with some holding posters demanding “boycott Bangladesh”.
“We needed to raise the voice of Hindus in Bangladesh in Delhi, and we have done that … as long as even one Hindu is being harmed there, we will be awake and will not stop,” a protester told broadcaster India Today.
Demonstrations were also held in other parts of the country, as well as in India-occupied Kashmir.</p><small>2025-12-23 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2315560291b00ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962812/corruption-charges-spark-protests-against-albanian-government' target='_blank'><strong>Corruption charges spark protests against Albanian government</strong></a><br><p>Protesters in Albania’s capital of Tirana hurled petrol bombs at the government building housing Prime Minister Edi Rama’s office on Monday, demanding the government’s resignation after prosecutors indicted the deputy prime minister for alleged corruption.
Political tensions in Albania have escalated in recent weeks after accusations were made against Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku. Along with several officials and private companies, she has been accused of using state funds to favour some companies in major infrastructure projects.

         View this post on Instagram            

She referred to the accusations in parliament last month as “mudslinging, insinuations, half-truths and lies,” and stated that she would fully cooperate with the judiciary.
The Special Prosecution Office, tasked with combating corruption and organised crime, has requested that parliament lift Balluku’s immunity this week and allow her arrest. It is not clear when the parliament, where Rama’s ruling party holds a majority, is expected to vote.
As protesters threw petrol bombs on Monday, police in riot gear protected the government building but did not push back the protesters.
“We have had enough because it’s a matter of tens and hundreds of millions of euros stolen, and she isn’t resigning. This is disgraceful,” said protester Arben Sulo.
Balluku also heads the Ministry of Infrastructure, which manages hundreds of millions of euros in projects such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.</p><small>2025-12-23 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2313050250f07fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962798/it-minister-says-spectrum-auction-to-be-completed-early-next-year-will-pave-way-for-better-internet-services' target='_blank'><strong>IT minister says spectrum auction to be completed early next year, will pave way for better internet services</strong></a><br><p>Information and Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja on Tuesday said that the auction of 600 MHz spectrum would be completed early next year, stating that it would pave the way for providing better internet services in the country.
She made the remarks while addressing a press conference alongside Finance Minister Muhammad Aurganzeb in Islamabad. At the outset of the press conference, Aurangzeb said the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) had approved the recommendations of the Spectrum Advisory Committee.
In her remarks, Khawaja said that the recommendations would now be taken to the federal cabinet.
“After that, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) will issue an information memorandum based on which consultations and negotiations will be held with stakeholders and the telecom sector,” she said.
“We are trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February,” she added. Explaining the significance of the development, she said that the internet quality in Pakistan was not at par with international best practices or even the quality in the region.
“The major reason for this is that the spectrum is not available in Pakistan,” she said. The IT minister said that Pakistan’s population of 240 million was operating on a spectrum of 274 MHz.
“This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight, which is why there is congestion, your internet does not work and you face challenges,” she said. “For that reason, the spectrum auction is being carried out.”
She said that during auctions held in the past, around 60MHz of spectrum was acquired. She said that the government was going to auction 600 MHz, making it the largest-ever.
The IT minister said that during the auction, additional bands were being auctioned in Pakistan for the first time, which meant that for consumers, not only 3G and 4G quality would improve, but it would also ensure the rollout of 5G services.
She said the PTA would ensure that all these rollouts would be completed between four to six months of the auction so that services could “visibly” improve after this period.
She said that the government was making efforts to ensure that 5G services would roll out after six months.
The minister stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.
“According to Connect 2030 — which the prime minister will inaugurate soon — we will ensure that over the next five years the minimum connectivity available to users should 100 Mbps.“
In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction presented its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600MHz band.
The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz.
The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.
The report also outlined key policy recommendations, including auction design, methodology, base price, duration and other terms and conditions.</p><small>2025-12-23 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23132026a271832.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962799/international-finance-corporation-announces-first-local-currency-investment-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>International Finance Corporation announces first local currency investment in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the private sector arm of the World Bank Group – has announced its first local currency investment in Pakistan, which it said was aimed at strengthening the agriculture sector.
According to a press release issued by the IFC on Tuesday, its first Pakistani rupee-denominated investment via an unfunded partial credit guarantee of up to Rs33.6 billion would support long-term financing from Standard Chartered Bank Pakistan Limited to Engro Fertilisers Limited.
“The engagement marks IFC’s first local currency investment in Pakistan, thus expanding access to long-term financing solutions in both local and foreign currency, critical for economic growth, particularly in important sectors such as agriculture and micro, small, and medium enterprises,” the press release said.
It added that the financing would enable Engro Fertilisers to strengthen the agri-value chain in Pakistan by mobilising local capital.
“The investment — aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s agriculture sector and bolstering food security — also benefits from a first loss counter guarantee from the IFC-Canada’s Facility for Resilient Food Systems,“ the press release said
It further stated that by leveraging PKR-denominated financing, Engro Fertilisers “is championing the use of domestic capital to enhance operational resilience”.
“The financing will help Engro Fertilisers make capital investments in maintenance of facilities and turnarounds, enabling uninterrupted supply of urea and other fertilisers to meet national demand.
“This financing will enable Engro Fertilisers to strengthen the agri-value chain in Pakistan by mobilising local capital.“
Moreover, the press release added, the funding was also aimed at supporting farmer programmes, ensuring the continuity of initiatives that complemented Engro’s core mission of reliable production.
It highlighted that the agriculture sector in Pakistan was contributing 24pc of the country’s GDP, 70pc of its exports and 40pc of its employment, making it vital for long-term growth.
“Yet systemic challenges—inefficient supply chains, underfunded farmer programs, low literacy, and rising input costs — persist.
“This investment will help address some of these gaps,” the press release said.
It quoted Engro Fertilisers Chief Executive Officer Ali Rathore as saying: “Engro has always strived to solve Pakistan’s most pressing issues meaningfully. Using local capital to strengthen local value chains reflects our commitment to the country and to our farmers — the backbone of Pakistan’s economy — through reliable fertiliser production.
“We are grateful to our partners, IFC and Standard Chartered Bank, for enabling us to advance this mission.”
The press also included remarks by IFC’s Regional Industry Head of Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services in the Middle East and Central Asia, Ashruf Megahed.
He was quoted as saying: “This investment reflects the strength of our partnership with Engro Fertilisers and Standard Chartered Bank and our shared commitment to providing innovative solutions to address challenges in a sustainable manner. Through this project, we are opening new pathways for local currency long-term financing that support growth and financial resilience to manage country risk in a sector vital to the country’s economy.”
Similarly, the press release quoted Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer and Head of Coverage in Pakistan Rehan Shaikh as saying: “At Standard Chartered, we are committed to financing solutions that enable sustainable growth and long-term resilience across Pakistan’s economy.
“This partnership with IFC and Engro Fertilisers reflects our shared vision of strengthening food security and supporting one of the country’s most critical value chains. Standard Chartered is keen to continue working with IFC to replicate this successful structure across its network.”
Today’s announcement by the IFC comes around two months after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) partnered with the IFC to expand local currency financing for the private sector.
The SBP had announced on October 21 the signing of an agreement with the IFC under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) framework, enabling the multilateral institution to invest in Pakistani rupees and better manage exchange rate risks.
Borrowing in hard currencies such as the US dollar while earning revenues in local currency exposes companies in developing economies to considerable exchange rate risks. Addressing this mismatch is essential for strengthening the financial resilience of local businesses and ensuring broader economic stability.</p><small>2025-12-23 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23104102a832653.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962789/highly-respected-general-no-end-in-sight-to-trumps-praise-of-cdf-field-marshal-munir' target='_blank'><strong>‘Highly respected general’: No end in sight to Trump’s praise of CDF Field Marshal Munir</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump, who has now on several occasions in the past praised Chief of Defence Force and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has now called him a “highly respected general”.
The US president’s latest remarks came as he addressed a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. During the press conference, Trump announced a new class of heavily armed warships that will be named after himself — an honour usually reserved for leaders who have left office.
Asked about the progress of talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said that his administration had so far “stopped eight wars” — a claim that he has repeated in the past.
“We stopped a potential nuclear war between Pakistan and India,” Trump said.
“The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more, by getting that war [sic].”
“You know, eight planes were shot down, the war was starting to rage,” he said.

 

“We have solved many wars; the only one we have not solved yet is Russia and Ukraine,” the US president said. He noted that there was a lot of “hatred” between the two nations.
This is the latest in a series of compliments that Trump has given to CDF Field Marshal Munir since their meeting in Washington in June. On June 19, he extended an unprecedented invitation to the army chief for a historic luncheon at the White House.
The US president has since lauded Munir on several occasions, even referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”.
On October 29, Trump praised CDF Field Marshal Munir, calling him a “great fighter” while talking about the Pakistan and India conflict in May.
In his comments, he said: “I’m doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.”
A day prior, he had lauded the role of the CDF in the ceasefire agreement following the May conflict.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”. In November, he stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.</p><small>2025-12-23 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23102438bbaed28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962787/call-of-duty-co-creator-vince-zampella-killed-in-los-angeles-car-crash' target='_blank'><strong>‘Call of Duty’ co-creator Vince Zampella killed in Los Angeles car crash</strong></a><br><p>Vince Zampella, the acclaimed co-creator of video gaming juggernaut “Call of Duty,” has died in a car crash, gaming giant Electronic Arts confirmed on Monday. He was 55.
The developer and executive died on Sunday while driving his Ferrari on a scenic road north of Los Angeles, according to local broadcaster NBC4.
“For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,” the California Highway Patrol said in a statement, without identifying the two victims in the crash.
The CHP added that both the driver and a passenger who was ejected from the vehicle succumbed to their injuries.
Witnesses posted video of the mangled cherry-red Ferarri, engulfed in flames, on the mountain road. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.
His studios created some of the world’s best-selling video games, and Zampella was considered an innovator in first-person military shooter style games.
This year, when his “Battlefield 6” video game set a new sales record for the franchise, Zampella expressed gratitude, saying “we never take moments like this for granted” — despite a long career of success in gaming.

 

The mass-combat game has won over 100 million players in the past two decades, in its various iterations.
And yet, that number isn’t a first.
To this day, “Call of Duty” boasts more than 100 million active players, monthly.
“You have that dream of the game being popular, but I don’t think you’re ever ready for that level of success,” Zampella told gaming site IGN in a 2016 interview.
Profound, far-reaching
Zampella was best known for co-creating the “Call of Duty” franchise and founding Respawn Entertainment, the studio behind “Titanfall,” “Apex Legends,” and the “Star Wars Jedi” games.
After starting out in the 1990s as a designer on shooter games, he co-founded Infinity Ward in 2002 and helped launch “Call of Duty” in 2003.
Activision later acquired his studio.
He left Activision under contentious circumstances and established Respawn in 2010, which Electronic Arts acquired in 2017.
At EA, he eventually took charge of revitalising the “Battlefield” franchise, cementing his reputation as one of the most influential figures in modern first-person shooter games.
“This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” Electronic Arts said in a statement.
“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching,” the company said, adding that “his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment”.
A statement by Respawn, posted on the “Battlefield” X account, praised Zampella “for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Battlefield and the people building it”.
Zampella “championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered”.
“It was a bold, transgressive method of storytelling, of a moment in time that was political, that was violent and that was impactful,” Washington Post video game reporter Gene Park told NBC4.
“He really knew how to create stories and create experiences, that really hit at the heart of human experience — whether it was terror, dread, heroism.
I think he was really able to kindof encapsulate that through the designs of the video games that he made,” Park said.</p><small>2025-12-23 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23093151cad0840.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962785/trump-announces-new-us-warship-class-named-after-himself' target='_blank'><strong>Trump announces new US warship class named after himself</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a new class of heavily armed warships that will be named after himself — an honor usually reserved for leaders who have left office.
Two of the Trump-class ships will be built initially, but that number could grow substantially, according to the president, who said they will be “some of the most lethal surface warfare ships” and “the largest battleship in the history of our country”.
Trump made the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida alongside Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Navy Secretary John Phelan, with images of the planned high-tech vessels on stands nearby.







Asked if the planned warships are a counter to Washington’s rival Beijing, Trump declined to specify, instead saying: “It’s a counter to everybody, it’s not China. We get along great with China.”
He said the ships will weigh between 30,000 and 40,000 tons and will be armed with missiles and guns as well as weaponry still in development, such as lasers and hypersonic missiles.
They will also be capable of carrying atomic weapons in the form of the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, Trump said.
The Trump-class ships will be substantially larger than existing US destroyers and cruisers, but the projected displacement cited by the president is somewhat smaller than the last American battleships — from the Iowa class — which were retired in the 1990s.
‘Most powerful fleet anywhere’
Trump — who has complained in the past about the appearance of US ships — said he would be involved in the design along with the Navy “because I’m a very aesthetic person”.
Trump’s announcement came just days after the Navy publicised plans for another new class of ships — frigates dubbed the FF(X) that it said will “complement the fleet’s larger, multi-mission warships”.
Phelan has said the FF(X) will be based on an existing design from shipbuilder HII that is already in use by the United States Coast Guard, and that the aim is for the first of the new frigates to be in the water by 2028.
The new frigate plans were announced after Phelan said in late November that four of six planned ships from the Constellation class of frigates would be canceled, while two that are already under construction are “under review”.
Washington has fallen significantly behind Beijing when it comes to the number of ships in its Navy, and a report to Congress earlier this year noted that US military officials and other observers are concerned by the pace of China’s shipbuilding efforts.
“We’re going to restore America as a major shipbuilding power,” Trump said on Monday, adding: “We’re going to ensure the USA has the most powerful fleet anywhere in the world, and long into the future, with battleships helping lead the way.“</p><small>2025-12-23 04:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6949fe24f20d2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962753/internal-turmoil-diplomatic-crisis-grip-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Internal turmoil, diplomatic crisis grip Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>• Dhaka suspends consular, visa services in New Delhi; Indian centre in Chattogram reciprocates• Inqilab Moncho threatens to topple interim govt, demands resignations• 17 held as govt promises speedy trial• Journalists protest amid death threats, attacks on media
After student leader Osman Hadi’s assassination, crises on both the external and internal fronts have deepened in Bangladesh, which has halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi, while the nation grapples with unrest stemming from arrests, journalists’ protests, and threats of a government overthrow.
“Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services from the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi are temporarily suspended until further notice,” a notice posted by the Bangladesh mission said. “Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted.”
The move came two days after a demonstration by 20 to 25 people outside the diplomatic mission in New Delhi. Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain told reporters on Sunday that Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah received death threats from the protesters.
However, Indian Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday there was no attempt to breach the mission’s security and that police dispersed the small group within minutes.
The protesters were demonstrating against the killing of a garment worker, Dipu Chandra Das, in Bangladesh and demanding protection for minorities, he said.
Tensions have been reciprocal. On Sunday, the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there. High commissioners for both countries have been summoned by their respective host governments.
The developments indicated increasing friction between the two nations, as The Daily Star noted that these developments point to diplomatic tensions escalating towards a crisis and advised that both Delhi and Dhaka should work towards reducing the tensions.
Threats to interim govt
The turmoil stems from the killing of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in a pro-democracy uprising last year that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has since taken refuge in India. Masked gunmen shot Hadi earlier this month, and he died from his injuries on Thursday.
His death ignited furious protests, with mobs setting fire to several buildings, including the offices of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, two of the country’s leading newspapers, which some protesters perceive as favourable to India.
In response, the student group Inqilab Moncho on Monday threatened a movement to remove the interim government, holding it responsible for Hadi’s death. The group demanded the immediate resignations of the home adviser, his special assistant and the law adviser for failing to provide security.
“Justice must be ensured before the election; no election will take place before that,” Abdullah Al Jaber, member secretary of the group, said at a press conference.
He warned that activists would not leave the streets until Hadi’s killers are brought to justice and would topple the government if their demands were not met.
The group also called for an international investigation by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard. Law Adviser Asif Nazrul responded by announcing the murder case would be tried at a speedy trial tribunal, with a verdict expected within 90 days of the police report being filed.
Journalists’ protest
Meanwhile, journalists in Dhaka held a human chain protest on Monday to condemn the arson attacks and threats against the press. Media leaders said threats have escalated from debates over free expression to concerns for their very survival.
“On social media, we have seen messages saying journalists of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo should be hunted down and killed in their homes,” said Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of The Daily Star. “This is no longer about opinions. These are murder threats.”
He made the remarks while delivering a solidarity speech at a joint protest titled “Bangladesh Under the Attack of Mob Viole­nce”, organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at a hotel in Dhaka.
Nahid Islam, convener of the National Citizen Party (NCP), today said they believe the attacks involved a section of the government and had political backing. “The whole incident was planned,” he said.
AK Azad said about 28 journalists were trapped inside The Daily Star’s office during the firebombing and claimed that pleas for help were ignored until after the attack was over. He said security forces were present but did not intervene.
He also announced plans to hold a conference in Dhaka for journalists from across the country in mid-January, vowing to continue protests until those responsible for recent arson attacks on The Daily Star and Prothom Alo are brought to justice.
Nurul Kabir, editor of the New Age daily, said the attackers intended to kill. “They set newspaper offices on fire and blocked the fire service from entering,” he said. “This clearly shows they wanted to burn people alive simply because they disagreed with them.”
Arrests and violence
Separately, Police said they have arrested 17 people in connection with the newspaper attacks. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner SN Nazrul Islam said officers exercised restraint to avoid casualties among the 4,000 to 5,000 protesters.
“The fact that no human life was lost in such a major incident is what we see as our achievement,” he said, adding that social media misinformation had inflamed the situation.
Political figures from across the spectrum have voiced concern over the escalating violence as the country prepares for general elections in February.
“Today, democracy itself has been attacked,” said Mirza Fakh­rul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the opposition Bangla­desh Nationalist Party. “This is the time for all democratic people to unite.”
The broader unrest was highlighted by a separate incident where Border Guard Bangladesh intensified surveillance along the Benapole border after an NCP leader, Md Motaleb Shikdar, was shot and injured in Khulna.

KARACHI: As political parties from the ruling and opposition camps propose talks to end the political confrontation, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday demanded fresh elections across the country to do away with the governments allegedly born out of rigging.
Positioning himself as the one political figure courted by both the government and the opposition, Maulana Fazl declared that the 2018 and 2024 polls were “rigged and did not reflect the will of the people”.
Standing alongside the government’s key ally, MQM-P’s appointed Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Maulana Fazl questioned the legitimacy of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government while also, without naming it, casting doubt on the past record of the country’s largest opposition party, the PTI.
“Fresh elections must be held,” he responded to a question. “Neither the 2018 elections nor the 2024 polls reflected the will of the people. The governments born out of establishment-backed rigging should come to an end. From Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, these governments should be brought to an end and fresh elections must be held across the country.”
This is not the first time he has demanded snap polls; in fact, less than a week after the Feb 8 elections, his party had rejected its results and demanded fresh polls. The JUI-F chief made a similar call in September last year as his party engaged the PTI as well as the ruling coalition, apparently to make a political comeback. The JUI-F was also instrumental in the passage of the 26th Amendment.

 

Speaking at Governor’s House, where he was conferred an honorary doctorate from Sir Syed University, Maulana Fazl warned that the government’s current actions were “making the Constitution controversial and disputed”. He was referring to the 27th Amendment, which was passed despite opposition from his party.
Responding to a question, Maulana Fazl described the 27th Amendment as legislation passed through a “forced majority,” but at the same time, he defended the 26th Amendment passed last year, in which he had played a key role.
“The 26th Amendment was passed by consensus, so it is not appropriate to make it disputed,” he said. “The 27th Amendment, however, was one-sided. You did not have a majority, meaning the majority was created through force. Then, all those things from which you stepped back in the 26th Amendment were included in the 27th Amendment, which is why the Constitution is now being seen as disputed. We should avoid turning the Constitution into a subject of dispute.”
Tensions with Afghanistan
When asked to comment on recent tensions with Afghanistan, the JUI-F chief questioned the government’s policies and urged the authorities on both sides of the border not to drag people into the internal state matters because of state actions.
“Afghanistan should not be viewed only in today’s context,” he said. “We should discuss 78 years of our Afghan policy. Pakistan has never had a truly friendly government in Afghanistan. Could this be a failure of our own policy? If we build any narrative, we would definitely put the blame on the other side, but we need to take a look at ourselves as well and ask whether our Afghan policy has failed. This should be a matter of debate.”
When asked about his opinion on the proposed deployment of the armed forces in Gaza, he referred to “bitter experiences of the past” and asked the government to “refrain from this and avoid making ourselves controversial”.
“A so-called peacekeeping force is not really about peacekeeping – it becomes a war-fighting force. We should avoid making the mistake of becoming part of an international alliance and then turning our guns on Palestinians. We must refrain from this and avoid making ourselves controversial,” he said in reference to the US-proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
Later, addressing a conference of clerics, Maulana Fazl defended the role of seminaries and warned that any government action to undermine them under any regulatory cover would put the educational fate of thousands of students at risk. He also criticised “attempts to force” seminaries to obtain certificates from the education ministry and called for the independence of religious institutions.
“We announced at the all-parties conference in Lahore that the agreements reached by our senior scholars will not be reopened for discussion,” he said.
Addressing curriculum debates, the Maulana said that scholars have long strived to create a cohesive syllabus, but their recommendations were often ignored. He expressed support for modern subjects alongside religious studies.

Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence company that manufactures F-16 fighter aircraft, has been named the principal contractor.—AFP/file

 
• Lockheed Martin picked as main contractor; $686m deal aims to extend fleet service life until 2040• US Congress was earlier notified of the proposed sale, didn’t raise any objections
WASHINGTON: A US military upgrade package for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter fleet, worth $686 million, has been cleared through a statutory congressional notification process.
Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence company that manufactures the F-16 fighter aircraft, and has long been responsible for its design, upgrades, and sustainment programmes for international operators, has been named the principal contractor for the proposed sale.
The sale was processed under existing authorities provided by the Arms Export Control Act and annual appropriations laws.
These provisions allow the executive branch to obligate and disburse funds once Congress has been formally notified and does not object within the required time period.
The Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) approved Pakistan’s request for a $686 million Foreign Military Sale (FMS) covering F-16 hardware, software upgrades and sustainment support, and formally notified the US Congress of this decision.
Under US law, this approval does not mean the sale bypassed congressional oversight. Once the DSCA issues its notification, Congress is provided a mandatory 30-day review period during which lawmakers may object or introduce a resolution to block the transaction.
If no objection is raised within this timeframe — which is the norm — the sale is considered to have received congressional approval. A separate vote is required only if Congress chooses to intervene.
This process is built into the legal framework governing US arms transfers. The DSCA is authorised to manage such transactions through mechanisms like Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF).
These programmes typically rely on the purchasing country’s own funds, or on US loans or grants that have already been approved at the executive level by the President and the State Department — as is the case with Pakistan’s F-16 package.
Upgrade package
Published on the congressional website last week, the notification states that the proposed sale is intended to extend the service life of Pakistan’s Block-52 and midlife-upgrade F-16 aircraft through 2040, while preserving interoperability with the US and partner forces.
Major defence equipment accounts for $37m of the total value, with the remaining $649m covering sustainment, refurbishment, and modernisation services.
The package includes 92 Link-16 tactical data-link systems and six inert Mk-82 500-pound bomb bodies for integration and testing.
Other elements cover avionics upgrades, secure communications and navigation equipment, cryptographic devices, mission-planning tools, as well as software and hardware modifications.
Training systems, munitions testing and reprogramming equipment, and associated spare parts are also included.
Sensitive components include Mode-5 identification friend-or-foe systems, handheld key loaders, and reprogramming equipment for munitions built-in-test functions. Some items are classified as secret.
Pakistan first submitted its request for F-16 upgrades in 2021-22. While the DSCA consistently supported the proposal, the Biden administration chose not to act at the time, even though the notification mechanism was available. A notification was issued in December 2024, but no further action followed.
A fresh notification was sent to Congress in December 2025 under the Trump administration. Once the statutory notification window closed with no objection raised, the proposed sale was approved in accordance with US law.
US rationale
In its official statement, the DSCA said the sale would support US foreign policy and national security objectives by enabling Pakistan to retain interoperability with Washington and partner forces.
“It will strengthen cooperation in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and help prepare for future contingency operations,” the agency said.
The statement added that refurbishing and upgrading Pakistan’s F-16 fleet would address critical flight-safety concerns and improve integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force during combat operations, exercises, and training.
The DSCA said Pakistan was expected to absorb the articles and services without difficulty and stressed that the proposed sale “will not alter the basic military balance in the region”.
Implementation of the sale will not require additional US government or contractor personnel in Pakistan and will have no adverse impact on American defence readiness.
The US government said it was not aware of any offset agreement linked to the proposed sale; any such arrangement would be determined through negotiations between Pakistan and the contractor.

According to the Reuters news agency, the over $4 billion deal, one of Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons sales, will see arms sold to the Libyan National Army (LNA).
It was finalised after a meeting last week between Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir and Saddam Khalifa Haftar, deputy commander-in-chief of the LNA, in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, officials said.
Although foreign ministry, defence ministry and military did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, military officials called it “historic in terms of size and financial impact”.

A copy of the deal before it was finalised that was seen by Reuters listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets, jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and a number of Super Mushak trainer aircraft, used for basic pilot training.

 

A Pakistani official told Reuters the deal included the sale of equipment for land, sea and air, spread over 2-1/2 years, adding it could also include the JF-17 fighter jets.
Since 2011, the United Nations has imposed an arms embargo on the fractured North African country, which means transfers of weapons and related material require UN approval.
However, senior Pakistani military officials justified the arms sale, saying that many major western and Middle Eastern states have been supplying weapons and equipment to Libya for many years despite the embargo.
Calling it a “paper embargo” which is virtually “non-existent due to multiple reasons”, the sources said the move was in line with the prime minister and army chief’s vision for “an export driven self sustained economy”.
The internationally-recognised Government of National Unity, led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, controls much of western Libya, while Haftar’s LNA controls the east and south, including major oilfields, and does not recognise the Unity government’s authority.
According to Reuters, any arms agreement with the LNA is likely to face scrutiny given Libya’s long-running instability following a 2011 Nato-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and split the country between rival authorities.
The LNA’s official media channel reported on Sunday that the faction had entered a defence cooperation pact with Pakistan, which included weapons sales, joint training and military manufacturing, without providing details.
“We announce the launch of a new phase of strategic military cooperation with Pakistan,” Haftar said in remarks broadcast on Sunday by Al-Hadath television.
Authorities in Benghazi also did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Pakistan has been seeking to expand defence exports, drawing on decades of counterinsurgency experience and a domestic defence industry that spans aircraft production and overhaul, armoured vehicles, munitions and naval construction.
“Our recent war with India demonstrated our advanced capabilities to the world,” CDF Munir was quoted as saying in remarks broadcast by Al-Hadath on Sunday.

In a letter to the prime minister, one of the national representative bodies of trade industry, said year 2025 once again proved to be an extreme challenging year for business and industry.
PBF President Kha­waja Mehboob-ur-Rehman said despite repeated commitments by successive governments, the fundamental demand of the business community for ease of doing business and a reduction in the cost of operations had not been addressed in a meaningful or sustainable manner.
The PBF said that persistently high input costs, soaring energy tariffs, and an increasingly uncompetitive tax regime continued to erode industrial productivity, weaken exports, and discourage both local and foreign investment. “These pressures have significantly reduced Pakistan’s ability to compete with regional economies that actively support their industries through competitive pricing and pro-growth fiscal policies,” Mr Rehman said.

Seeks PM Shehbaz’s intervention amid high input costs, artificial dollar control

The PBF’s letter for revival of business confidence coincided with a statement from Ministry of Finance saying the investor confidence was booming and the stock market had become ‘one of the best-performing markets in the world’. The ministry’s monthly report for November on the other hand, suggested 26pc drop in foreign direct investment in July-October period of current year over same period last year while portfolio investment recorded a 540m outflow and total foreign investment falling by 82.5pc.
Referring to the successful defence of the country by Pakistan’s armed forces in May, PBF said that while the nation demonstrated strength and unity on the security front, the next critical challenge was winning the economic battle. The business community, PBF emphasised, was ready to play its role, provided it was equipped with the necessary competitive tools to operate in regional and global markets.
Among these tools, the forum identified two reforms as absolutely critical — regionally competitive electricity tariffs, and regionally competitive corporate tax rates. “Without alignment on these fronts, Pakistani businesses will remain at a structural disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring countries,” it said.
The PBF expressed serious concern that current economic policymaking, particularly within the Ministry of Finance, remained largely confined to compliance with IMF programme conditions, with insufficient focus on innovative, growth-oriented, and business-friendly solutions. On the other hand, dollar was kept under control artificially on higher side in the whole year despite reserves were on lower side.
PBF argued that sustainable economic recovery could not be achieved without empowering the business community, being the backbone of employment generation, exports, and revenue creation.
PBF also raised alarm over reports suggesting that electricity tariffs may be increased further potentially up to 15 cents a dollar per unit — as a measure to address circular debt. It warned that such an increase would further burden already distressed industries and could result in widespread downsizing or closure of industrial units, deepening unemployment and economic contraction.
Additionally, the forum also expressed disappointment over the recent formation of multiple economic committees and working groups without the inclusion of elected representatives of the business community. PBF emphasised that the absence of industry voices at the policymaking table prevented the government from fully understanding ground realities and crafting effective, implementable solutions.
Looking ahead to 2026, the PBF urged the premier to provide the business community with a clear, credible, and forward-looking economic roadmap. Such clarity was essential to restore confidence, encourage investment, and enable long-term planning. 
It emphasised that if the government provided an initial push through competitive energy pricing, rationalised taxation, and genuine stakeholder engagement, the business community will respond by delivering economic growth, employment generation, and export expansion.

It’s a situation most drivers on Karachi’s major thoroughfares have experienced, especially on weekend nights and public holidays: a ghost motorcycle closing in at breakneck speed. 
At first, it is little more than a blur in the rear-view mirror. Then, as it bears down, the driver finally registers the young man lying flat along the length of the motorcycle, his eyes peering forward just above the handlebar. The speedometer is missing. The rider’s arms are tucked tight to the side — either holding the handle or, in some cases, clutching the suspension on the sides and using shoulders to steer the handlebar. His legs lie flat or are scissored tightly at the ankle, his body locked in an aerodynamic pose. 
Most drivers know what to do when faced with such a motorcycle: hold your line without moving in either direction. Do not brake suddenly. Do not swerve. Almost without fail, the rider veers away at the very last second, zigzagging between vehicles and vanishing in the blink of an eye. 
But it is rarely a lone escape. A swarm of similar motorcycles arrives next, streaking past from every direction, forcing drivers to grip the steering wheel and mutter silent prayers — for the rider’s safety as much as their own. At these speeds, even a minor error — a sudden lane change, a startled brake, a moment’s hesitation — can prove fatal: not just for the motorcyclist but anyone sharing the road. 

Daredevil motorbike riders speeding through the busy roads of Karachi without any protective gear have built up a vibrant subculture around themselves that is sustained often as much through social media as word of mouth. Why does this perilous practice continue to attract thrill-seekers and can it be made less dangerous, not just for the riders but also for those they share the roads with?

These riders, mostly young and often underage, wear no protective gear beyond goggles to keep the dust from blurring their vision. Their motorcycles are stripped to the bare minimum, every unnecessary part removed in pursuit of speed and control. 
On Karachi’s roads, they are known by a single name: Shapatars.

WHAT MAKES A SHAPATAR?
The origins and the exact meaning of the term is unclear, though most experienced motorcycle racers in Karachi suggest it’s a portmanteau of sharp and funter [a local version of the term punter] and refers to those who show street smarts and mastery on two wheels at a young age. 
The term has circulated since the 1990s, sometimes loosely associated with political muscle and petty crime, though racers insist this is no longer representative. 
“Most of us are simply hardworking people who are passionate about racing,” says Muhammad Tariq, a stocky 24-year-old racer popularly known as Tariq 180. He is also a proficient mechanic and now runs a workshop. He left school early and started work as an apprentice in 2009. 
Tariq’s forays into racing started with wheelies on his motorcycle. “Around 2013-14, I bought a CB 180cc bike, which resulted in me getting the name 180,” he says. But Tariq has one major advantage over a majority of his peers: he is not only a rider but also an ustaad, an expert mechanic who understands the ins and outs of a motorcycle and knows how to get the best out of it for any particular race.
But one young man, arguably the most well-known shapatar of Karachi, rose to the top of this illegal racing circuit based solely on his riding skills. His most famous race, also his last, remains shrouded in mystery and, seemingly, adds to his legend.

THE LEGEND OF BABU 70
Like Tariq, Uzaib Mustafa’s love for daredevilry began with doing wheelies on his bicycle while growing up in Gazdarabad (aka Ranchore Lines) in downtown Karachi. Like most young men of his area, which has a large number of motorcycle parts and repair shops, he started hanging out at the workshop of one Rehan Ustaad, according to his brother Murtaza. 
A slightly-built teen, around 5’6” in height, he was the ideal racer. His proficiency in doing wheelies, initially, on his bicycle and, later, on motorcycles, had already established his credentials. He became known as Babu 70, after his father — a former department-level footballer who drove a 70cc bike.
Babu 70 started racing before he had a license, as most shapatars do. His big break came in 2011, at 18, after beating champion racer Bali X. Over five years, he established dominance on Sharae Faisal — the city’s main thoroughfare — and other tracks. By 2016, he was neck-and-neck with Saqib Sanki, Karachi’s reigning shapatar. Their rivalry would culminate in one final, fatal race.
Murtaza, Babu’s brother, says that there was a point when Sanki wanted to back out of the race due to some bad blood between Babu and him, over the verdict of an earlier race. But it went ahead after Babu insisted, citing his planned departure to Dubai two days later, where his friends were helping him set up a business. 
The race was set for 4am in early November 2016. Initially, it was planned as a 12km race on Sharae Faisal, starting from near the airport and ending at the FTC Bridge. But oil on the road meant that the distance was adjusted, with the starting point moved up to the crossing on the Drigh Road Railway Station.
Once the race started, Babu quickly took the lead. It stayed that way well beyond the halfway mark. This is what everyone agrees on. What happened after is contested.
Babu’s brother Murtaza, who was at the race, says that he was hit by a car, but is unsure if it was a sedan or a hatchback. Ali, a young man who is no longer involved in racing, claims it was Sanki’s boys in the vehicle and that Sanki also kicked Babu’s motorcycle.
Tariq 180 dismisses claims of foul play. “Babu’s motorcycle’s engine malfunctioned due to the race and was dripping oil, which fell on the wheel and led to him losing control,” he asserts.
Murtaza says that Babu’s accident took place while victory was just a short distance away. “He got dragged for almost a km and sustained multiple injuries,” he tells Eos at his motorcycle parts shop. 
Babu spent almost four weeks in the hospital before passing away. The family didn’t file any police report over his death, lending credence to Tariq’s assertion that there was no foul play.
Eos made several efforts to contact Saqib Sanki but was informed by his apprentices that he didn’t want to speak to a journalist, even though they regularly upload his videos and races on social media. One reason could be his legal troubles: Saqib is currently on bail in a 2022 dacoity case, with the hearings ongoing. 
Saqib’s legal troubles means he often takes unscheduled breaks from racing. Despite that, he still enjoys a massive following, with his acolytes running multiple accounts dedicated to him on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. 
But there still remain those who think Babu was better than him. “Babu was clearly a better rider and his victory against Sanki would have established him as the undisputed champion shapatar of Karachi,” says Ibrahim, another former racer who knew Babu well. “If you ask young boys who they want to be like, most will say Babu 70,” he adds.
For a few years after his death, Babu’s admirers took out commemorative rallies on his death anniversary. His race videos and exploits continue to dominate digital platforms. Any discussion about the best racers in Karachi or Pakistan invariably sees his name mentioned, with claims and counterclaims on who is the greatest shapatar to ride on the roads of Karachi.

THE RACE, THE RIDER AND THE RIDE
For a rider to achieve greatness, he needs an equally good ustaad, says Tariq. “Yes, it’s the rider who is putting his life on the line, but it is the ustaad who will alter the motorcycle for the race,” he explains.
Despite being mostly uneducated, these riders have an experiential, if not instinctive, grasp of select physics concepts, including aerodynamics and air pressure. The shapatar riding posture is aerodynamically optimal and riding in a vehicle’s slipstream reduces air pressure and increases speed. Tariq even has a GPS meter downloaded in his phone, which he uses to assess the performance of his motorcycle before races.
But it is the ustaad who is likely to have the magical touch. Their understanding is developed over years of trial and error, taking apart motorcycles and putting them back together, tinkering and tailoring with various components. “That’s how a 70cc bike reaches speeds of 150+ [km/h],” says Tariq. “An ustaad can ensure his rider stays unbeatable, but not the other way round,” he adds, saying both the rider and the ustaad are equally important. 
This is why when a rider wants to race against someone, he will mention his ustaad in the challenge — which are now posted on social media groups, primarily on Facebook. Once a challenge is accepted, the two parties decide on a munsif, a judge — mostly a veteran racer and, ideally, one with a fast motorcycle to tailgate the racers and record a video for the final verdict. The race wager — ranging from Rs15,000 to even Rs150,000 or more — is deposited with the munsif to be handed over to the winner.
Race conditions are negotiated in unique terminology: such as “apni hawa” (not entering another’s slipstream) or “CS Alter” (carburetor and sprockets can be modified). The most dangerous format is “freestyle”, where riders can hit, grab and kick rivals. “This has mostly been discontinued following consensus between ustaads,” says Tariq.
Before racing, both parties inspect vehicles to ensure no violations. The munsif can disqualify either party if objections are upheld. 
There are also “showroom-to-showroom” races, in which the two parties acquire motorcycles from a showroom and take them directly to the designated track for the race. This emerged, according to Tariq, because of the innovation in alterations. 
“We have such funtergiri [cleverness] nowadays that even ustaads can’t detect alterations,” he says before adding that most such alterations are done by mechanics in Lahore. “Karachi has better riders, but Lahore has better ustaads.”

THE COST OF DAREDEVILRY
For all the skill, bravado and mythology surrounding shapatars, the risks they take extend far beyond themselves. 
Karachi’s busy and poorly regulated roads are already a menace for commuters, with the city reporting at least 500 road traffic casualties (RTC) last year. The majority of these casualties tend to be motorcyclists. However, this data doesn’t differentiate for motorcyclists.
The Road Traffic Injury Research and Prevention Programme (RTIRPP), initiated by neurosurgeon Dr Rashid Jooma, was the only programme through which data regarding road traffic accidents in Karachi was collected. The programme, which was shut down due to lack of support and funding in 2017, found that there were 9,129 road fatalities from 2007-2014. “Motorbikes as primary vehicles were responsible for 3,871 (44.7 percent) RTC fatalities out of the 8,654, for which this information was available,” it observed in its November 2016 report. 
A conversation with any motorcycle racer will see them list off a litany of names of friends killed while racing or practising for it. Tariq shows off the scar on his head which, he says, required two dozen stitches. He has another one on his back. “Around five, six boys of Mehmoodabad [in Karachi] have died in the last few years, including Ustaad Sohail S-1,” he says.
Traffic police officials say enforcement remains difficult, as races are organised spontaneously and often take place in the early hours of the morning, when roads appear deceptively empty. “These motorcyclists often ride without number plates or safety gear and are difficult to intercept due to their riding skills,” says Pir Muhammad Shah, the deputy inspector general of Traffic in Karachi. Shah tells Eos that they have recently introduced aerial surveillance and hope to crackdown on such elements. 
Most motorcycle racers shrug off concerns over the latest e-challans or crackdown by traffic authorities. They are more concerned with law enforcement, particularly at the time of the start of the race. “When there is a race, even on the highway, riders congregate at the starting point and momentarily block the road, so the racers can have a clear, vehicle-free track,” explains Tariq. “Cops showing up during that time can land the people who are blocking the road in trouble,” he adds.
Nasrullah Khan, a seasoned police officer who served as the station house officer in various localities that were racing hotspots, says that such races are not only illegal, but those who alter motorcycles are also committing a crime. “You pay the government tax of a 70cc bike while your vehicle functions as 150cc,” he points out. 
Khan adds the popular “Devil’s Point” on Sea View was a hotbed of all kinds of races, until the erection of barriers in the middle of the road. “I’d have entry and exit points blocked and conduct raids to apprehend racers, whether in cars or on bikes,” he says, admitting they could only charge them with negligent driving and seize their vehicles over it. 
Khan contends that a lot of motorcycles used in such races are stolen or fitted with stolen parts. Tariq, the racer and mechanic, says that, to avoid such an eventuality, he asks customers to bring their vehicles’ documents with them. 
Both the cop and the racer agree that bike racing will continue, regardless of restrictions or crackdowns.
The only solution, suggests Nasrullah, is to make racing less dangerous — not just for the shapatars but for others on the road. “One possible solution could be to provide them a dedicated area, so they can race there,” says Khan, citing the example of jeep rallies and other races that take place. 
Karachi’s mayor Murtaza Wahab tells Eos that the city administration is open to the idea. “If we could find such a space, it would be on the outskirts of the city and most people don’t want to go that far,” he tells Eos.
Tariq would tell the mayor that most major races are already taking place on stretches of the highway, sometimes as far out as Nooriabad on the outskirts of the city. 
But until they find a space of their own, shapatars will continue to appear in rear-view mirrors across Karachi — a blur closing in at impossible speed, forcing drivers to hold their line and hope. 
On these roads, the distance between legend and tragedy is measured not in kilometres, but in split seconds. And for every Babu 70 who becomes a myth, there are dozens more willing to risk everything for that same fleeting immortality.
