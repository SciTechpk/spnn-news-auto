In an emailed statement, Nasa said around 3,000 employees took part in the second round of its deferred resignation programme, which closed late on Friday.
Combined with the 870 who joined the first round and regular staff departures, the agency’s civil servant workforce is set to drop from more than 18,000 before Trump took office in January to roughly 14,000 — a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
Those leaving Nasa on the deferred resignation programme will be placed on administrative leave until an agreed departure date. An agency spokesperson said the figures could shift slightly in the coming weeks.
“Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organisation and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a golden era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,” the agency said.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration’s proposed Nasa budget put a return to the Moon and a journey to Mars front and centre, slashing science and climate programmes.
The White House says it wants to focus on “beating China back to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars”.
China is aiming for its first crewed lunar landing by 2030, while the US programme, called Artemis, has faced repeated delays.
Nasa is still run by an acting administrator after the administration’s initial pick to lead the agency, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman — endorsed by former Trump adviser Elon Musk — was ultimately rejected by the Republican president.</p><small>2025-07-26 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26183805bdcf04b.jpg?r=184217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926741/pakistan-fully-committed-to-building-secure-prosperous-regional-environment-with-allies-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan fully committed to building secure, prosperous regional environment with allies: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.
Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir met Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.
“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.
The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.
“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.
 






According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.
The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.
“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.
It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”
Pakistan’s role in regional peace was lauded by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.
“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.</p><small>2025-07-26 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261647475ef2a55.jpg?r=165339' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926721/asia-cup-2025-to-be-held-in-uae-from-september-9-28' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup 2025 to be held in UAE from September 9-28</strong></a><br><p>The Asia Cricket Council’s (ACC) Asia Cup 2025 tournament will be held in the United Arab Emirates from September 9-28, ACC President Mohsin Naqvi announced on Saturday.
In a post on X, he said: “I am delighted to confirm the dates for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 in UAE. The prestigious tournament will take place from September 9th to 28th. We look forward to a spectacular display of cricket! Detailed schedule will be out soon.”
 






Naqvi later announced the schedule for the tournament on X, with India and Pakistan set to clash on September 14. In addition to India, the Green Shirts will play Oman on September 12 and the UAE on September 17.
 






Pakistan, India, the UAE and Oman will make up Group A, while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Hong Kong will make up Group B.
The group stage will be followed by a super four stage, in turn followed by the final on September 28.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman’s confirmation came after the tournament was already expected to be hosted in the UAE.
The tournament, originally scheduled to be hosted by India in September, was poised to be relocated due to logistical and political challenges, though India is expected to retain hosting rights.
The decision followed the ACC’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), held in Dhaka on Thursday, which was attended by all 25 member countries either physically or virtually.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after initially threatening to boycott the meeting due to political tensions with Bangladesh, eventually joined the proceedings virtually. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla represented the board at the meeting.
 
 

The Asia Cup must conclude before India begins its Test series against the West Indies later that month. The UAE, having previously hosted the tournament in similar circumstances, had emerged as the most feasible neutral venue, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
Political strain between the two neighbours — further intensified by a military clash in May — has made bilateral cricket engagements increasingly difficult.
With both the BCCI and PCB reportedly unwilling to play on each other’s soil, a neutral venue such as the UAE was viewed as a practical compromise, similar to the hybrid model used during the 2025 ICC events and the 2023 Asia Cup.</p><small>2025-07-26 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2614314625d6539.jpg?r=170410' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926716/psb-mandates-prior-approval-before-indian-event-participation-due-to-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>PSB mandates prior approval before Indian event participation due to security concerns</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on Saturday instructed all national sports federations to seek prior consultation and approval before participating in any sporting events held in India due to ’“security concerns”.
Political tensions bet­ween the two nations over the years have cast a sha­d­ow over bilateral sporting events, causing major tournaments to hang in the balance. The countries’ teams have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, electing to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead.
A circular issued today by the PSB said the decision was taken during the 34th board meeting held on Wednesday. The circular explicitly urged all national federations to strictly adhere to the directive.
“In view of the current security situation, no national federation shall make any commitment or agreement regarding participation in sports events in India without prior permission from PSB,” it said.
The PSB cited prevailing security concerns as a reason for the new directive.
There has been a spike in tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of a terror attack in Pahalgam earlier this year that left 26 tourists dead.
India blamed Pakistan for the attack, an accusation Islamabad denies. The incident triggered a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by the two countries against each other and a military conflict until a ceasefire was announced in May.
 
 

India will host the women’s 50-overs World Cup this year, but Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement made by the International Cricket Council.
India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy this year and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai.
Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players — part of the World Championship of Legends — was called off after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing the tensions between the two nations.</p><small>2025-07-26 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2615514986a61d6.png?r=155248' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926714/info-minister-apologises-to-boxer-shahzaib-rindh-for-unjustified-delay-in-monetary-reward-support' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister apologises to boxer Shahzaib Rindh for ‘unjustified’ delay in monetary reward, support</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday apologised to mixed martial arts player Shahzaib Rindh for the “inordinate delay” in the government’s promised financial reward and support.
In September, Rindh made history when he won the Karate Combat Championship (KC-49) in Singapore, becoming the first-ever world champion from Pakistan after defeating Brazil’s Bruno Roberto De Assis in the final.
Following the win, President Asif Ali Zardari had presented Rindh with a cheque worth Rs100 million, the Balochistan government announced Rs2m as a cash prize, while a former minister had also promised him 25 acres of land.
Tarar’s apology today comes after Rindh, in a post on X on Wednesday, had slammed the government for its “fake promises” of Rs5m in cash and an additional Rs80m to support his training and upcoming matches.
“Our politicians are corrupt,” Rindh alleged, adding that the last time he won, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced rewards for him.
“It was all [a] lie; I never got [a] penny from them. They just take pictures, fake promises and forget shame,” he added.
 


Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued a statement congratulating Rindh and met with him. However, a report on any announcement of a reward could not be found.
Tarar responded to Rindh’s criticism today, apologising for the delay in the promised support.
“There seems to be some miscommunication. We sincerely apologise for this unjustified delay,” the minister posted on X.
“Sportsmen like you are our real heroes and we value your achievements. You have brought great honour to the country and made us all proud.”
He added: “The prime minister has taken a serious notice of this inordinate delay and rest assured, it will be sorted out immediately inshallah.
“The PM has further instructed that such mistakes must never happen in the future. We regret this unjustified delay and the inconvenience caused,” the minister said.
 






In response, Rindh welcomed the “acknowledgement”, saying: “I truly appreciate the prime minister’s attention to this matter and his commitment to supporting athletes like myself.
“Representing Pakistan on the world stage is an honour, and I will always give my all for our country. Inshallah, with your support, we can continue to uplift and inspire the next generation of champions,” he added, saying he looked forward to the issue’s resolution soon.
 






In April last year, Rindh had decried the government’s lack of support, saying it was its “bad luck” that it did not support the country’s heroes after his 2-1 victory over India at Dubai’s Karate Combat 45 event.</p><small>2025-07-26 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261342152f7b1b5.jpg?r=134334' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926710/6-killed-in-courthouse-attack-in-irans-sistan-baluchestan-province-report' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed in courthouse attack in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province: report</strong></a><br><p>At least six people were killed and 22 were injured in an armed attack by the Jaish al-Adl group on a courthouse in Iran’s restive Sistan-Baluchestan province on Saturday, state media reported.
Three attackers were killed, according to the report by IRNA.
Jaish al-Adl confirmed the deaths of its three members in the clashes with security forces in Zahedan, the capital of the far southeastern province bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A toddler and a 60-year-old woman were among those killed, as well as three soldiers and law enforcement personnel assigned to the courthouse, the head of the province’s judiciary told IRNA. He did not identify the sixth dead person.
He said the attackers wore explosive vests and carried grenades. It was not clear if they had detonated them.
Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on its Telegram account, said it had killed at least 30 members of the judiciary and security forces.
It said it targeted judges and court personnel, whom it accused of issuing death sentences and house demolition orders to Baluch citizens.
“We warn all judges and employees of the judiciary that Baluchestan will no longer be a safe place for them and death will follow them like terrifying shadows until retribution,” the group said in its statement.
It blamed security forces for the deaths of civilians, saying they had fired indiscriminately.
Sistan-Baluchestan is home to Iran’s Sunni Muslim Baloch minority, who have long complained of economic marginalisation and political exclusion.
The Baloch human rights group HAALVSH, quoting eyewitnesses, said several judiciary staff members and security personnel were killed or wounded when the assailants stormed the judges’ chambers.
Sistan-Baluchestan is frequently hit by clashes between security forces and armed groups, including militants and separatists who say they are fighting for greater rights and autonomy. Tehran accuses some of them of ties to foreign powers and involvement in cross-border smuggling and insurgency.</p><small>2025-07-26 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2612362663b3edb.png?r=123733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926704/pakistan-urges-ceasefire-de-escalation-in-russia-ukraine-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges ceasefire, de-escalation in Russia-Ukraine war</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for de-escalation and ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war and stressed that “echoes for peace must be heard” as Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed a United Nations briefing.
“Peace in Ukraine is long overdue,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, told the UN Council, which debated the situation in Ukraine on Friday after Russia invaded its neighbour in March 2022.
“The calls for ending this conflict should not be allowed to go unheard or masked by the continued drums of war,” he added, highlighting that the conflict was now four years old.
Pakistan, as a consistent advocate for peace, has called for de-escalation and giving primacy to dialogue over fighting, said Ambassador Jadoon, who at that time was chairing the 15-member meeting.
“Only a sincere and meaningful dialogue which addresses mutual security concerns of all sides, is anchored in the principles of UN Charter and international law, and respects the relevant multilateral agreements can help lead to a peace, which is durable, just and long-lasting,” the Pakistani envoy added.
“Military solution and continued escalation are akin to pursuing a dead end,” he said, adding that continued attacks have only deepened the suffering of people affected by this conflict. “Sustainable peace demands de-escalation, ceasefire, and unwavering commitment to dialogue. “
Despite the diplomatic efforts at the start of this year, including Security Council Resolution 2774 and multiple limited ceasefire understandings, Ambassador Jadoon noted that tangible progress has remained elusive.
“While prisoner exchanges and talks in Istanbul offer a glimmer of hope, it is unfortunate that the ongoing violence, death, and destruction from relentless attacks have continued to cast a shadow over the nascent and fledgling peace efforts.”
In this regard, Ambassador Jadoon underscored the need for the protection of civilians, stating that the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure under any pretext is unjustifiable.
“Sustainable peace demands de-escalation, ceasefire and unwavering commitment to dialogue,” he added.
Asserting that diplomacy was the only path forward, the Pakistani envoy welcomed the talks between Russia and Ukraine.
“These [talks] must translate into tangible de-escalation, and steps such as prisoner swaps should catalyse broader political negotiations, aimed at ending this conflict.”
Pakistan, he added, stands ready to support all regional and international efforts that pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.
At the outset, a senior UN official told the Security Council that the daily barrage of Russian missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and towns has continued to intensify, with devastating consequences for the civilian population.
Miroslav Jenca, assistant secretary-general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, said that civilian casualties in Ukraine reached a three-year high in June, citing the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
According to Ukrainian authorities, Russia has launched at least 5,183 long-range munitions against Ukraine in July, including a record number of 728 long-range drones on July 9.
Recalling that delegations from both countries recently met in Istanbul for the third time in 2025, the UN official urged that ongoing diplomatic contacts be sustained.
However, he urged that they be “reinforced by genuine political will to make tangible progress towards ending the current dangerous cycle of escalation as soon as possible”.
On her part, Joyce Msuya, assistant secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, said, “There is no safe place left in Ukraine,” emphasising that “the use of explosive weapons in populated areas — including long-range missiles and drones — remains a key driver of civilian harm”.
Civilians in Ukraine continue to bear the heaviest burden, struggling to access food, water, power, and healthcare. “Nearly 13 million people need assistance, but limited funding means we can reach only a fraction of them,” she reported, adding: “For many displaced women and girls, safety remains out of reach.”
She also said that the continued use of anti-personnel mines puts civilian lives and livelihoods at daily risk. She noted with alarm “the recent decree by the Ukrainian president announcing his country’s withdrawal” from the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, which prohibits the use of these munitions.</p><small>2025-07-26 11:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26131101d4d3d97.jpg?r=145033' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926705/karakoram-highway-reopened-as-rescue-aid-efforts-continue-in-flood-hit-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Karakoram Highway reopened as rescue, aid efforts continue in flood-hit GB</strong></a><br><p>The Karakoram Highway (KKH) was reopened on Saturday as aid and rescue operations continued in Gilgit-Baltistan after flash floods battered the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On Monday, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many stranded. At least nine people died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.”
He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.
Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.
 


“Floods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,” the official said.
He added that the local government has distributed “hundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people” across the region.
Speaking about the search operation in Babusar, Faraq said, “There may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.”
“The Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,” he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.
Another rescue operation was underway in Fairy Meadows, according to the government spokesperson.

“Four stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,” he added.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.
Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority issued a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country. It advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
GB govt announces free flights for stranded tourists, locals
The GB government has started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.
In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. “A special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,” he added.
He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to “facilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations”.
A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.
The chief secretary further noted, “The main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.”
He said that the cloudburst-induced destructive flood at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving hundreds of tourists and locals stranded.
 
 

“However, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,” he added.
Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.
“The GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,” he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p><small>2025-07-26 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26154846fb61839.png?r=161346' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926719/china-urges-global-consensus-on-balancing-ai-development-security' target='_blank'><strong>China urges global consensus on balancing AI development, security</strong></a><br><p>China’s premier Li Qiang warned on Saturday that artificial intelligence development must be weighed against the security risks, saying a global consensus was urgently needed even as the tech race between Beijing and Washington shows no sign of abating.
His remarks came just days after United States President Donald Trump unveiled an aggressive low-regulation strategy aimed at cementing US dominance in the fast-moving field, promising to “remove red tape and onerous regulation” that could hinder private sector AI development.
Opening the World AI Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai on Saturday, Li emphasised the need for governance and open-source development, announcing the establishment of a Chinese-led body for international AI cooperation.
“The risks and challenges brought by artificial intelligence have drawn widespread attention […] How to find a balance between development and security urgently requires further consensus from the entire society,” the premier said.
Li said China would “actively promote” the development of open-source AI, adding Beijing was willing to share advances with other countries, particularly developing ones.
“If we engage in technological monopolies, controls and blockage, artificial intelligence will become the preserve of a few countries and a few enterprises,” he said.
“Only by adhering to openness, sharing and fairness in access to intelligence can more countries and groups benefit from (AI).”
The premier highlighted “insufficient supply of computing power and chips” as a bottleneck.
Washington has expanded its efforts in recent years to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, concerned that these can be used to advance Beijing’s military systems and erode US tech dominance.
 
 

For its part, China has made AI a pillar of its plans for technological self-reliance, with the government pledging a raft of measures to boost the sector.
In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled an AI model that performed as well as top US systems despite using less powerful chips.
‘Pet tiger cub’
At a time when AI is being integrated across virtually all industries, its uses have raised major ethical questions, from the spread of misinformation to its impact on employment, or the potential loss of technological control.
In a speech at WAIC on Saturday, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Geoffrey Hinton compared the situation to keeping “a very cute tiger cub as a pet”.
“To survive”, he said, you need to ensure you can train it not to kill you when it grows up.
In a video message played at the WAIC opening ceremony, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said AI governance would be “a defining test of international cooperation”.
The ceremony also saw the French president’s AI envoy, Anne Bouverot, underscore the “an urgent need” for global action.
At an AI summit in Paris in February, 58 countries including China, France and India — as well as the European Union and African Union Commission — called for enhanced coordination on AI governance.
But the US warned against “excessive regulation”, and alongside the United Kingdom, refused to sign the summit’s appeal for an “open”, “inclusive” and “ethical” AI.</p><small>2025-07-26 11:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26093232050dde4.jpg?r=094157' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640/dar-rubio-discuss-trade-investment-ties-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Dar, Rubio discuss trade, investment, ties with India</strong></a><br><p>• Foreign minister says Pakistan-US mineral deal to be finalised soon
• Ex-State Dept official Elizabeth Horst made acting envoy to Pakistan
WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.
The meeting — the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years — is being considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US.
On the same day, the US named an acting ambassador in Islamabad.
 






In Washington, Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio held their first meeting since working together in May to negotiate a ceasefire that ended a dangerous military standoff between India and Pakistan.
In a post shared after the meeting, Mr Dar said he discussed bilateral relations with Secretary Rubio.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI, and CT [counterterrorism] cooperation.”
 






Secretary Rubio, in a separate post, highlighted key economic and strategic aspects of the meeting.
“Met with Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister today to discuss expanding bilateral trade and enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals sector,” he said.
Both leaders mentioned discussions on regional developments, an apparent hint at the India-Pakistan relationship and clashes in May.
Mr Rubio said he thanked FM Dar for “preserving regional stability”.
 






In his post, Mr Dar hailed the “constructive role” played by the US in reaching the ceasefire.
According to a statement issued by the Pakistan embassy in Washington, Mr Dar said the US role “helped avert a potential nuc­lear confrontation and restored calm to a volatile region”.
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and ongoing counterterrorism cooperation.
Secretary Rubio recognised Pakistan’s “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a “constructive actor” in efforts to ensure regional stability.
Trade and investment
The talks also addressed the future of bilateral trade and investment.
Both delegations — led by their respective foreign ministers and joined by senior officials — discussed opportunities in agriculture, energy, technology, and critical minerals.
Mr Dar described Pakistan as an “attractive destination” for American investors and voiced optimism about progress in the ongoing trade dialogue.
US engagement in South Asia
Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio also discussed cooperation at various global forums, including the UN Security Council.
The meeting “reaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council,” and exchanged views on “key regional and global developments,” Mr Dar said.
 
 

Later, in a conversation with NBC News’ Dan De Luce at the Atlantic Council, Mr Dar outlined Islamabad’s regional outlook and addressed pathways for managing India-Pakistan tensions.
“For peace in South Asia, we need continued US involvement,” he said, calling for an “open-eyed” policy that “understands the risk of disengagement.”
Mr Dar highlighted the need for “a sustainable mechanism for conflict resolution” in the region, adding that there could be no peace unless India agrees to hold dialogue on all issues, including Kashmir.
He also revealed the US and Pakistan were close to concluding a deal for extracting minerals from Pakistan and an agreement could be finalised in “weeks and days, not months.”
 


Responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration, Mr Dar drew a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, who has spent years in a US prison.
He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”.
Similarly, he said, Mr Khan was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, which followed the due process of law.
“When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.
When asked if Pakistan would continue to buy weapons from China, Mr Dar said the country would go for whoever offered a better deal.
New US envoy
Meanwhile, the State Department has appointed Elizabeth Horst as the acting US ambassador to Pakistan.
Ms Horst, a senior career diplomat currently serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to take charge of her position.
“I am back in Pakistan (where I started my diplomatic career 20 years ago), this time for a short stint as the acting ambassador,” she wrote in a social media post.
“What a joy to visit one of the most magical places in Punjab, the Lahore Fort. I saw how US support is helping preserve this magnificent monument and demonstrate our long-term partnership. The people-to-people ties and cultural bonds are what underpin our work.”
 



Ms Horst’s appointment, though temporary, is seen as both strategic and symbolic.
Her arrival signals Washington’s continued interest in maintaining high-level engagement with Islamabad, even as the Trump administration calibrates its broader South Asia policy.

The decision comes into effect at once.
The Sindh local government department, acting on the directives of the chief minister of Sindh, issued a notification announcing the end of parking fees on public roads throughout the city’s 25 Town Municipal Corporations (TMCs).
As per the new policy, no municipal body or private entity is allowed to collect any parking fee from vehicles parked on roads anywhere in Karachi.
However, the move also granted the councils of the TMCs the authority to designate any ‘specified area’ within their remit as a charged parking space.
According to the notification, the Sindh chief minister “imposed a ban on charged parking fees from roads. The charged parking fees can be collected only on plots / plazas / areas specifically maintained by the specific Councils for such purposes”.

TMCs given authority to designate ‘specified area’ as charged parking space; fee collection will continue in cantonment board areas

Effective immediately, all Town Municipal Administrations (TMAs) have been ordered to stop the collection of parking fees and begin implementation of the policy without delay.
 
 

The local government department has also launched a formal campaign to enforce this directive, with warnings of strict action against violators. Importantly, the ban applies strictly to public roads.
Parking fees will now only be legally permissible in designated parking plazas, private plots, or specific council-approved zones. These areas are expected to be clearly marked to avoid confusion.
“This step has been taken purely in public interest,” said City Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“Karachi’s residents have long demanded and at times suffered at the hands of illegal and arbitrary parking fee collection. This administration has delivered on its promise of transparency and accountability, ensuring that public roads remain public spaces — free to use.”
However, an official clarified that the charged parking would continue within the jurisdiction of six cantonment boards in Karachi. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) sources revealed that the concept of charged parking in Karachi was first introduced in the year 2000.
The initiative was envisioned by the then director general of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), retired brigadier Abdul Haq, as part of a broader strategy to generate municipal revenue. At that time, he was overseeing the city’s infrastructure development and urban planning, and saw paid parking as a potential tool to fund civic services and manage growing vehicular congestion in the metropolis.
In February 2025, Mayor Murtaza Wahab hinted at abolishing the charged parking across Karachi as part of his broader vision to ease the financial burden on citizens.
However, the initiative faced delays due to existing contractual obligations, as several entities held valid charged parking agreements, which were set to expire in June.
 
 

During this period, the KMC continued to generate an average yearly revenue of Rs40 to 50 million from parking fees.
The abolition has been hailed by citizens and commuters as one of the most significant urban relief measures in recent years.
For decades, unauthorised contractors and so-called “parking mafias” had monopolised prime city spots, often charging arbitrary fees without any legal basis or standardised rate.
The KMC, which previously managed parking on 46 main roads, had already suspended such fees under a citywide policy revamp. Now, all 25 TMCs fall under the same directive, having a level playing field across the city.
The decision, the officials say, also reflects growing confidence in the financial stability of the KMC and other urban bodies, who are now able to carry out their operations without resorting to street-level revenue generation tactics that burdened citizens.
“No institution other than KMC in designated areas, and that too under regulation, can now engage in fee collection. The days of extortion in the name of parking are over,” said a KMC spokesperson, adding that the government had also directed all municipal commissioners to ensure compliance, with a clear warning that failure to implement the order would result in immediate disciplinary measures.

Harsh Vardhan Jain, 47, was operating an “illegal West Arctic embassy by renting a house” in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, which neighbours the capital, local police said.
Jain, according to police, claimed to be the ambassador of fictional nations “like West Arctica, Saborga, Poulvia, Lodonia”.
He allegedly used vehicles with fake diplomatic plates and shared doctored photos of himself with Indian leaders to bolster his claims.
“His main activities involved acting as a broker to secure work in foreign countries for companies and private individuals, as well as operating a hawala (money transfer) racket through shell companies,” the police said in a statement following his arrest earlier this week.
He is also accused of money laundering.
During a raid on Jain’s property, police said they recovered $53,500 in cash in addition to doctored passports and forged documents bearing stamps of India’s foreign ministry.
AFP was unable to reach Jain or his representatives for comment.
Westarctica, cited by the police as one of the countries Jain claimed to be representing, is a US-registered nonprofit “dedicated to studying and preserving this vast, magnificent, desolate region” of Western Antarctica.
In a statement, it said it had appointed Jain as its “Honorary Consul to India” after he had made a “generous donation”.
“He was never granted the position or authority of ambassador,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261236547e1cf68.png?r=140935' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926707/pakistan-presents-immense-investment-opportunities-mustafa-kamal-tells-health-moot-in-beijing' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan presents immense investment opportunities, Mustafa Kamal tells health moot in Beijing</strong></a><br><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal urged international stakeholders to explore partnerships in Pakistan’s rapidly evolving health landscape, highlighting the country’s “immense” potential for investment, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Saturday.
Representing Pakistan at Boao Forum for Asia’s (BFA) Global Health Forum in Beijing yesterday, the health minister underscored that Pakistan presents “immense opportunities for collaboration, innovation and investment”.
Established in 2001, the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) is a non-profit international organisation promoting regional cooperation in Asia. It focuses on health issues related to economic development and wellbeing.
The roundtable featured health ministers from all over the world, who discussed equal access to healthcare and sustainable reforms.
 






“Pakistan is ready for partnerships in global health,” Kamal said, highlighting the country’s 250 million population, nursing cooperation and digital reforms.
He pointed out that there were “significant opportunities for global collaboration in the health sector”, according to a post on his X account.
The minister noted that Pakistan could play a role in mitigating a shortage of nurses and paramedics through training and cooperation.
He invited global partners to explore investment avenues, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to providing strong returns, streamlined regulation, and government support.
“Without health, the economy cannot progress,” Kamal said.
 






The health minister also drew attention to the new Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices for the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), which was launched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday.
At the inauguration, the premier noted that the registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan had become a critical issue earlier this year. He expressed hope that the applications for such equipment would now be decided within 20 days.
Last month, Kamal noted that Pakistan’s healthcare system was riddled with fundamental flaws and that the solution lay not merely in building hospitals but in improving the entire environment.
The minister has also called attention towards Pakistan’s high fertility rate, high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and need to eradicate polio.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261253420e8dd3a.jpg?r=130121' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926694/3-key-ttp-terrorists-killed-in-joint-operation-by-swat-ctd-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 ‘key’ TTP terrorists killed in joint operation by Swat CTD, police</strong></a><br><p>Three wanted terrorists and “key operatives” of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during a joint operation of the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in the Barikot tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Friday.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — particularly Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks targeting police stations and posts. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
“Three wanted terrorists have been killed in Barikot in a major win for Swat CTD. Eliminating the enemies of regional peace, the CTD has killed three important operatives of the Fitna al-Khawarij,” KP Police said in a statement today.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.
 
 

Among the terrorists was Ajmal, also known as Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad who was reportedly involved in at least nine terrorism-related cases. He was also involved in the killing of Village Defence Council members and carried a bounty of Rs2 million.
The second individual was identified as Matiullah, also known by the aliases Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, who was wanted in two terrorism cases.
The third slain terrorist was Rahimullah Rehmani, alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah, a resident of Sheray in Afghanistan’s Nuristan province. He, too, was wanted in two separate terrorism cases.
“The terrorists were involved in attacks on security forces and assassinations of police personnel,” said the KP police statement. “A network spreading terrorism with external funding was destroyed, and the terrorists were also wanted in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and extortion cases.”
“This CTD operation is a blow to the operational wings of Fitna al-Khawarij in Swat and adjacent areas,” Malakand Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sher Akbar Khan was quoted as saying. “We are determined to uproot Fitna al-Khawarij.”
 
 

Speaking to reporters, Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan said that search and strike operations against militants would continue across the district. He added that security has been intensified at all entry and exit points of Swat to prevent any possible infiltration of miscreants.
“We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” the DPO asserted.
KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed praised the regional police and Swat CTD for striking the “operational command wing” of Fitna al-Khawarij, according to the police statement.
“Operations against terrorists will be further intensified to establish lasting peace and order in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.
In a series of incidents in KP yesterday, a police official was martyred in the Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in Bannu’s Basyakhel area.
 
 

Earlier this month, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD and the police in Lakki Marwat. This came nearly a week after the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in the same district.
Three terrorists were also killed in Lakki Marwat’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was martyred as well.
A total of 670 terror incidents were recorded in 2024, while 212 militants were killed in counter-terrorism operations, according to a report issued by the CTD.</p><small>2025-07-26 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/260950379fad47e.jpg?r=095055' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926637/govt-sells-obsolete-genco-plants-to-wah-industries' target='_blank'><strong>Govt sells obsolete Genco plants to Wah Industries</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a rare government-to-government (G2G) transaction, Wah Industries — operating under the Ministry of Defence — has acquired about 30 obsolete power plants from public sector generation companies (Gencos) for Rs38.255 billion, following the failure of the government’s ambitious open auction plan.
The Power Division confirmed that under three separate sale agreements, Wah Industries purchased the non-functional plants from Northern Power Generation Company Ltd (NPGCL), Central Power Generation Company Ltd (CPGCL), and Jamshoro Power Company Ltd (JPCL). The agreements were signed on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, respectively.
The sale price marginally exceeded the reserve price of Rs38.224bn, previously set under Wapda’s auction regulations, which stipulate that G2G sales cannot occur below reserve value. With these agreements, the total revenue from both auction phases has reached Rs46.73bn, including Rs9.053bn earned from the March 18 auction of seven plants with a combined capacity of 1,016 megawatts (MW).
A Power Division official disclosed that the relatively better-performing 415MW Guddu thermal power plant was withheld from this transaction due to interest from a leading US firm for its potential refurbishment at a higher price.
In a press release, the Power Division said the State Bank of Pakistan had set a reserve price of Rs45.817bn for 61 outdated units, while the concluded sale fetched Rs46.73bn. In the first phase, 31 units were sold for Rs8.475bn against a reserve price of Rs7.593bn.
The division added that the sold units had been accumulating billions of rupees in annual operational costs. Their disposal is expected to yield substantial public savings. Furthermore, around 3,200 surplus employees from the decommissioned plants have been transferred to distribution companies (Discos), while approximately 774 officers still remain at the sold sites.

Sale raises Rs46.73bn after auction failure; over 3,900 employees reassigned or retained

The G2G deal was finalised under directives from the Prime Minister’s Task Force on Energy, led by Lt Gen Zafar Iqbal, following the second failed auction and delays in realising proceeds from the first round.
As part of broader power sector reforms aimed at reducing ballooning capacity payments and circular debt, the government last year decided to shut down ageing, redundant Genco plants. It initiated an international bidding process to auction obsolete machinery and equipment —  excluding land — to reduce fiscal pressures stemming from salaries, plant operations, maintenance, and capacity charges.
The Generation Holding Company Ltd (GHCL) was given a three-month deadline by the Energy Task Force to complete the auction and transaction. While the first auction round was held on March 18, it failed to attract international bidders. Contractors who secured contracts were required to pay 18pc general sales tax and 10pc income tax to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on the contract amount.
According to contractual terms, the payment was to be made either fully in advance or in four instalments over three months: 30pc within seven days of contract signing (without equipment removal), 25pc after 30 days, another 25pc after the following 30 days, and the remaining 20pc in the final month.
Although dismantling was permitted early on, equipment removal from the sites was restricted until full payment. However, the proceeds from the deal have not yet been fully realised.

In the first incident, a girl in her teens reportedly jumped into the river in the Chew Bazaar area. Her body was later fished out and handed over to her parents after a postmortem at the District Headquarters Hospital.
Any eyewitness, Inamullah, who runs a medical store in Chew Bazaar, told Dawn that the girl was seen buying mantoo (Afghani snack) from a vendor in front of his shop, from there she proceeded to the centre of the bridge and jumped into the river in front of many passersby.
Sub-divisional police officer, city circle, Sajjad Hussain told Dawn that the parents of the deceased had migrated to Singoor village of Chitral town from the Mulkhow tehsil of Upper Chitral.

They all ended their life by jumping into river, say police

He said the immediate reason for her suicide could not be known, while the police had started an inquiry under section 174 of Criminal Procedure Code to ascertain the facts leading to the incident.
 
 

In the second incident, a newly-married young man, identified as Zar Nabi, ended his life in Raman village of Laspur valley of Upper Chitral by jumping into the river.
Mastuj sub-divisional police officer Sher Raja confirmed the incident and said the marriage of the deceased had taken place three days ago. He said the search for the body was in progress.
He said in another incident in Mastuj, a married woman from Nisur Gol ended her life by jumping into the river. Her body was later recovered.
Mr Raja said police had started an inquiry to ascertain the reasons in both cases.
In yet another incident, a girl student of grade-9 in Kosht village of Mulkhow ended her life in a similar fashion. Her body was still to be recovered.
The deceased admitted to a school in Islamabad had come to her village with her parents during the summer vacation.
EXPEDITION: After the first successful trekking expedition to the base camp of Trich Mir, the second expedition left Chitral city on Friday morning, which will trek to the base camp via Oveer village.
Lower Chitral deputy commissioner Rao Hashim Azeem saw the participants off.
To mark the 75th anniversary of the first successful ascent to the highest peak of the Hindukush system of mountains, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has declared 2025 as ‘Year of Terich Mir’ and is arranging and sponsoring expeditions to the base camp.
In this regard, a group of women will also leave Chitral in the first week of August for trekking to Trich Mir base camp.

The administration is in talks with several universities, including Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Brown, the source said, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration is close to striking deals with Northwestern and Brown and potentially Cornell.
A deal with Harvard, the country’s oldest and richest university, is a key target for the White House, the official added.
 
 

A spokesperson for Cornell declined to comment. Other universities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump and his team have undertaken a broad campaign to leverage federal funding to force change at US universities, which the Republican president says are gripped by antisemitic and “radical left” ideologies.
Trump has targeted several universities since returning to office in January over the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled college campuses last year.
Columbia University said on Wednesday that it will pay more than $200 million to the US government in a settlement with the administration to resolve federal probes and have most of its suspended federal funding restored.
The Trump administration has welcomed the Columbia deal, with officials believing the university set the standard on how to reach an agreement, the official said.
Harvard has taken a different approach, suing the federal government in a bid to get suspended federal grants restored.</p><small>2025-07-26 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261047383cd2d81.jpg?r=104951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/death-toll-rises-in-thai-cambodian-clashes-despite-ceasefire-call' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll rises in Thai-Cambodian clashes despite ceasefire call</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia clashed for a third day on Saturday, as the death toll from their bloodiest fighting in years rose to 33 and Phnom Penh called for an “immediate ceasefire”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into intense conflict involving jets, artillery, tanks and ground troops on Thursday, prompting the UN Security Council (UNSC) to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis Friday.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said 13 people were now confirmed killed in the fighting, including eight civilians and five soldiers, with 71 people wounded.
In Thailand, the army said five soldiers were killed on Friday, taking the toll there to 20 — 14 civilians and six military.
The death toll across the two countries is now higher than the 28 killed in the last major round of fighting between 2008 and 2011.
Both sides reported a clash around 5am (3am PKT), with Cambodia accusing Thai forces of firing “five heavy artillery shells” into locations in Pursat province, which borders Thailand’s Trat province.
 
 

The fighting has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, with more than 35,000 driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After the closed meeting of the UNSC in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted a ceasefire.
“Cambodia asked for an immediate ceasefire — unconditionally — and we also call for the peaceful solution of the dispute,” he told reporters.
Border row
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said on Friday, before the UN meeting was held, that Bangkok was open to talks, possibly aided by Malaysia.
“We are ready, if Cambodia would like to settle this matter via diplomatic channels, bilaterally, or even through Malaysia, we are ready to do that. But so far we have not had any response,” Nikorndej told AFP.
Malaysia currently holds the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc, of which Thailand and Cambodia are both members.
Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has warned that if the situation escalates, “it could develop into war”.
Both sides blamed each other for firing first, while Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including a hospital hit by shells and a petrol station hit by at least one rocket.
Cambodia has accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions.
At the UN, Cambodia’s envoy questioned Thailand’s assertion that his country, which is smaller and less militarily developed than its neighbour, had initiated the conflict.
“[The Security Council] called for both parties to [show] maximum restraint and resort to a diplomatic solution. That is what we are calling for as well,” said Chhea Keo.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours — both popular destinations for millions of foreign tourists — over their shared 800-kilometre (500-mile) border.
Dozens of kilometres in several areas are contested and fighting broke out between 2008 and 2011, leaving at least 28 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.
A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the matter for over a decade, but the current crisis erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a new clash.</p><small>2025-07-26 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26101223eccd605.jpg?r=101234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926632/ecc-flags-ghee-profiteering-clears-housing-subsidy' target='_blank'><strong>ECC flags ghee profiteering, clears housing subsidy</strong></a><br><p>• Expresses concern over unjustified edible oil pricing despite global drop
• Approves Rs72bn housing subsidy for 50,000 low-income families
ISLAMABAD: The government raised serious concerns on Friday over 29 per cent illegitimate profiteering in the edible oil and ghee market and approved a subsidised housing scheme for 50,000 low-income families during the current fiscal year.
Presiding over a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb was informed that international prices of edible oil and ghee had declined by 24pc in recent weeks, yet the local industry had failed to pass on the relief to consumers. In some cases, prices were increased by 4-5pc due to weak market oversight.
Officials said the local industry routinely engaged in unfair practices due to a lack of regulation. While the Ministry of Industries and Production assured the ECC of adequate national stock levels, it acknowledged the limited pass-through of international price declines to the domestic market.
The ECC directed strict monitoring to curb price distortions and potential cartelisation, urging the Ministry of Industries to coordinate with the Competition Commission of Pakistan, the National Price Monitoring Committee, and provincial governments.
Subsidised housing scheme
The ECC approved a markup subsidy and risk-sharing scheme to facilitate low-cost housing finance, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expected to formally launch the programme on Aug 14.
Initially planned for 200,000 units, the scheme will now target 50,000 housing units — five-marla houses or 1,360 sq. ft flats — for first-time homeowners. Loans of up to Rs2 million will be offered at a subsidised 5pc fixed rate, and up to Rs3.5m at 8pc for the first 10 years, with market rates thereafter. The tenure will be up to 20 years, with no processing fees or prepayment penalties.
The scheme includes a 90:10 loan-to-value ratio and a 10pc first-loss risk-sharing facility for participating institutions, including commercial, Islamic and microfinance banks, as well as the House Building Finance Corporation. It will be administered by the Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation (PHA-F).
The total subsidy over 20 years is estimated at Rs72bn, with Rs3.93bn allocated for 2025–26. Disbursements are projected at Rs100bn in the first year. The budgetary requirement will peak at Rs7.12bn next year before tapering off to Rs2.26bn by FY36.
The ECC also directed the Ministry of Housing & Works to develop a centralised database of the housing sector in coordination with federal and provincial bodies for better targeting and implementation. Three names have been proposed for the scheme: Apna Ghar-Roshan Mustaqbil, Mera Khwab-Mera Aashiyana, and Mera Ghar-Meri Jannat.
Steel sector policy: The ECC endorsed a Ministry of Commerce report on boosting the competitiveness of the steel sector under the National Tariff Policy 2025–30, aimed at reducing production costs and promoting export-led growth.
RLNG tariffs appeal: The ECC approved a summary for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the Lahore High Court’s decision to grant gas/RLNG tariff concessions to Ghani Glass Ltd. The committee noted that such concessions have been withdrawn from all sectors.
Green taxonomy: Pakistan’s Green Taxonomy was approved to help financial institutions identify climate-aligned projects, enhance transparency in green investments, and mitigate climate-related financial risks.
Skills bond guarantee: To promote skills development through outcome-based financing, the ECC approved a Rs1bn sovereign guarantee for the issuance of the Pakistan Skill Impact Bond (PSIB). The Ministry of Education was advised to explore public-private partnerships and reduce reliance on government guarantees.
Radio-based service charges: The Ministry of IT’s proposal to revise charges for Radio-Based Services was approved, with directives for regular revisions every 3–5 years in line with economic and technological shifts.
Ship-breaking industry status: The ECC formally declared ship-breaking and recycling as an industry. However, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs was asked to coordinate with the Power Division to assess the impact of shifting from commercial to industrial power tariffs.

Police have sought court orders for the exhumation of the deceased’s body to ascertain the cause of her death.
According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.
However, the police will charge them with murder and honour killing only in light of the postmortem report, which is expected after the exhumation of Ms Sidra’s body. The victim, 19, was married in February this year.
 







Seek court orders for exhumation of the deceased’s body to ascertain cause of death after making multiple arrests

Police initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
 
 

As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered an FIR with the police under Section 496A.
Police sources said that the FIR was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow. However, the actual cause of her death will be determined after the exhumation.
“The purpose of registering the FIR for the woman’s abduction was only to avoid a murder investigation,” said a source.
In the FIR, the complainant stated that he was a resident of Pirwadhai and worked as a salesman at a cloth store in Bara Market, Rawalpindi.
He said he married Sidra Gul, 19, on January 17, 2025, and that she had been living with him since then.
On July 11, he claimed, a quarrel broke out between them over a petty issue after he returned home from work. He said he ignored the matter and went to sleep.
He further stated that after he went to sleep, his wife disappeared from the house, taking jewellery, clothes, and Rs150,000 in cash, without informing anyone.
After her disappearance, he said he inquired with her parents and searched for her, but could not find any clue to her whereabouts.
 
 

Later, he claimed he received information from local residents that his wife had a relationship with a man, had eloped with him, and was later illegally married to him, despite already being married.
He stated in the FIR that when he spoke to her family, they did not inform him about the alleged paramour and also refused to return his wife.
According to sources, shocking revelations emerged after the police began their investigation. The suspects had even erased the grave markers to cover up evidence.
Police have arrested around eight individuals in connection with the woman’s death, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary and relatives from both families.

President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, said that borrowing costs in Pakistan are among the highest stifling business growth. He noted that interest rates in Vietnam stand at 6.3pc, followed by Cambodia at 3pc, Indonesia at 6pc, and India at 5.5pc.
He added that Pakistan’s competitiveness is further eroded by steep energy costs, with electricity tariffs hovering around 16 cents per unit compared to 9 cents in Bangladesh, 8 cents in Vietnam, 10 cents in Cambodia and Indonesia, 7.2 cents in India, and just 5 cents in Sri Lanka.
A reduction in interest rates to 5-6pc would provide vital relief to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are disproportionately burdened by high financing costs, he said.
Bilwani also highlighted that over 75pc of domestic credit is consumed by government borrowing, leaving less than 25pc for the private sector. “This imbalance must be addressed through proactive monetary policy,” he added.

Industrialists call for sharp cut in SBP policy rate

He warned that Pakistan remains uncompetitive not only due to high interest rates but also because of elevated electricity, gas, and water tariffs, steep taxation, and one of the highest minimum wages in the region — all while labour productivity remains low. “These elements must be rationalised to lower the cost of doing business,” he said.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry President Junaid Naqi, echoed the demand, pointing out that with inflation dropping to 3.2pc in June and the current policy rate at 11pc, there is no economic rationale for maintaining such a high interest rate.
“Industries are operating below capacity, new investments are stalled, and business confidence is at a low,” he said. “Persisting with outdated monetary policies will only worsen unemployment, depress investment, and cause revenue shortfalls.”
Vice presidents of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Amaan Pracha and Asif Sakhi, along with Faisal Moiz Khan of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry and Sheikh Mohammad Tahseen of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industry, also jointly urged the central bank to bring interest rates down to single digits to spur industrial expansion.
They noted that easing interest rates would reduce pressures on manufacturers and help restore economic momentum.President of the United Business Group (UBG), Zubair Tufail, also called for a 4-5pc reduction in the policy rate, arguing that monetary easing is essential for economic revival.
Offering a differing view, Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry  President Yakoob H. Karim urged an immediate rate cut from 11pc to 9pc  in the July 30 meeting, with a target of 5pc by end-2025 to support  long-term economic growth.

The Punjab government has banned bathing in rivers, canals and storm drains, warning of strict action against violators.
GB faces climate emergency
Meanwhile, the Gilgit-Baltistan government said on Friday that the region is in the grip of severe climate change impacts, as floods triggered by melting glaciers and cloudbursts continue to cause widespread devastation.
People in several areas faced shortages of drinking and irrigation water, electricity, internet, telephone services and road access, as floods, landslides and soil erosion damaged roads, water channels, irrigation systems, power infrastructure and optical fibre networks.
In a media briefing, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza confirmed that nine people, including two women and two children, have died since July 10, including eight in Diamer’s Babusar and Thor valleys and one in Astore.
 
 

He said many areas were cut off due to landslides and mudflows. The Karakoram Highway was blocked again at Chilas, after which C-130 flight operations were started to evacuate stranded tourists and patients to Islamabad. Four tourists were airlifted from Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat.
Floods destroyed 196 homes, damaged another 200 and swept away over 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, agricultural land and other infrastructure, including water channels and communication lines.
Mr Mirza said relief efforts are underway, with tents, food and emergency supplies being delivered. He acknowledged the growing frequency of cloudbursts and glacier melt, attributing the disasters to climate change.
Special flights from Skardu and Gilgit to Islamabad have begun, with 135 people, including 80 tourists, flown out so far. Search operations are underway for 10 to 12 missing tourists in Babusar Valley.
The GB government asked citizens to follow travel advisories and announced plans to review early warning systems, including the UNDP-funded Glof-II project.

• Approves Skill Impact Bond project to provide funds to educational and skill development institutes
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the government is fully committed to implementing the agenda of economic digitisation, rightsizing public institutions, and ensuring merit-based appointments of experts in government departments.
The premier expressed this resolve while presiding over a mee­ting to assess progress on the appoi­ntment of technical experts across federal ministries and departments, and to discuss measures for enhancing foreign investment.
At the meeting, the Publ­ic-Private Part­nership Authority presented a detailed briefing on current initiatives and future plans aimed at streamlining exp­ert appointments and increasing investor confidence.
The prime minister highlighted institutional reforms as a top priority of the federal government.
 






While asserting that there will be no compromise on merit and transparency in the appointment of experts, PM Shehbaz said: “We are fully committed to implementing our agenda of economic digitisation, rightsizing public institutions, and ensuring merit-based appointments of experts in government departments.”
The meeting was earlier briefed that appointments had been made on 15 technical expert positions whereas appointment process was underway for 47 additional technical positions.
“Some 30 candidates have been shortlisted for the appointment of chief executive officers, chief fina­ncial officers, and managing directors in seven key ministries and departments,” the meeting was told.
 
 

The PM was further apprised that initial rounds of interviews for appointments in the petroleum division and national vocational and technical training commission had been completed.
Federal ministries have designated focal teams to formulate strategies for investment and sectoral roadmaps for investment.
Meanwhile, sectoral frameworks related to investment in food security, maritime affairs, minerals, tourism, industry, housing, and energy were in their final stages.
The prime minister was further informed that pitch-books for 18 economic sectors had been prepared to allocate projects for investment from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Qatar and Kuwait.
Skill Impact Bond
PM Shehbaz also approved the country’s first Skill Impact Bond programme, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
Under the programme, funds will be provided to those educational and skill development institutions which will produce skilled professionals.
The initiative is designed to attract private investment for equipping the youth with market-relevant skills to foster sustainable employment.
Under this model, young people will receive training in contemporary skills aligned with industry needs, empowering them to actively contribute to national economic development.
He also instructed officials to offer opportunities for learning local languages of potential host countries, facilitating overseas employment for the Pakistani youth.
He said he would personally review progress of this project every two months.
 
 

The meeting was informed that so far 500,000 people have been registered under the digital youth hub whereas 1.7 million people downloaded the application.
The meeting was apprised that over 500 registered companies, around 47,000 job opportunities in Pakistan and approximately 100,000 in abroad in addition to that more than 2000 scholarships are available.
EU ambassador
Meanwhile, Amba­ssador of the European Union in Pakistan Riina Kionka paid a farewell call on the premier at Prime Minister’s House.
Underscoring the significance of the European Union as one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners, the premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the GSP Plus scheme, which had proved to be mutually beneficial for both sides.
 






Meeting with Dr Fouzia
Also, Dr Fouzia Siddiqui, sister of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, called on the prime minister, who assured her that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of Dr Aafia Siddiqui who is detained in the Unites States.

On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia.
Later, PM Shehbaz welcomed Nawabzada Mohsin Ali Khan, former provincial president of PTI into the PML-N ranks during a meeting at the PM Office.

• Emphasises institutional support for judges while expecting district judiciary to uphold diligence, humility, empathy, and discipline
• Terms ethical integration of AI in court systems top priority
ISLAMABAD: Describing the district judiciary as the most precious jewel in the crown of Pakistan’s judicial system, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Friday unveiled a road map for safeguarding the judges from external influences by empowering, protecting and providing institutional support to ensure independent discharge of their duties.
“It is my dream to see an aggrieved citizen walk confidently into the court of magistrate or a civil court in his own local town instead of being burdened to appr­oach the high court or the Supreme Court for seeking redressal of his grievances,” CJP observed while speaking at a symposium marking the International Day for Judicial Wellbeing under the theme ‘The Human Dimension of Responsive Justice’.
The event brought together judges of the superior and district judiciary, legal experts, development partners, and institutional stakeholders for a landmark dial­o­­gue on judicial wellbeing in Pakistan here at the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA).
In his keynote address, CJP underscored the urgent need to humanise judicial reforms by recognising the emotional, psychological, and institutional pressures faced by judges, particularly at the district level.
The judge who is institutionally supported is always fair, supportive and effectively responsive, the CJP observed but said when the wellbeing of the district judiciary was at the centre stage, it is expected that its members remain committed to the highest ideals of the public service.
 
 

The members of the district judiciary must be diligent, disciplined, respectful, polite, humble and empathetic toward the citizen they serve, he emphasised.
“These standards are not an additional burden but always for them to honour their role – a role that matters not so much to the judiciary but to the entire nation,” CJP observed.
Referring to the superior judiciary, Mr Afridi shared, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) was also seized with the issue and deliberating on how to protect judges from extraneous pressures.
Sharing a number of concrete short- and medium-term reform policies adopted by the National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) — a committee comprising all chief justices of the high courts and headed by the CJP, he said a committee had been formed with the decision that each high court will formulate clear guidelines for members of the district judiciary to follow in case they face any extraneous influences.
Along with the defined response of the high court to counter such instance, he said he had also invited the chief justices of the high courts to consider incorporating the role of CJP in the response framework to ensure strong and unified institutional support.
The message must be clear to all that CJP will stand to support independent, honest and steadfast judicial officers,“ he said.
The CJP also recalled how issues such as the performance evaluation mechanism of district judges, standardisation of their recruitment process, parity in service conditions, and access to international exposure were raised during his meetings with district judiciary members on his visits.
 
 

“Instead of deciding their destiny from the Supreme Court, let the district judiciary deliberate and propose to the apex court what should be done,” he stated.
In this regard, Justice Rehmat Hussain Jaffery — a retired Supreme Court judge with experience in the district judiciary — has been nominated to head a committee, also including Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan as a member.
One of the most critical aspects of the justice system, the CJP emphasised, is the institutionalisation of arbitration. He revealed that 20 trained and expert judges are already available in the judiciary for this purpose.
He announced that one district from each high court’s jurisdiction will be selected to implement this arbitration mandate. Progress will be reviewed after three months, and if successful, the model will be expanded to other districts.
Ethical guidelines for AI use
The CJP recalled how NJPMC discussed on ethical guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
 
 

Undoubtedly given the rise of AI and its benefits, it is our top priority to integrate the concept into the justice delivery system, he said.
He added the the Supreme Court was in contact with the Supreme Court of Peoples Republic of China and that of the Constitutional Court of Turkiye to enter into memorandum of understanding for judicial cooperation for a period of five years.

• Warrants issued for Shibli in capital police attack case
• ATC extends Qureshi’s bail in May 9 cases till Sept 19
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Ale­ema Khan, the sister of former jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, has filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) accusing jail aut­horities of deliberately obstruc­ting her brother’s access to legal aid.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, named the Adiala Jail superintendent and deputy superintendent as respondents.
The petition claimed jail officials had not returned power of attorney (PoA) documents submitted 10 days ago by Mr Khan’s legal team.
These documents are essential to authorise lawyers to file appeals in the Supreme Court against bail rejections, the petition noted.
 
 

The documents are critical as the deadline to file an appeal in the Supreme Court was approaching.
Any further delay would permanently bar Mr Imran from challenging bail denials, the petition argued.
It added that despite repeated requests by four senior advocates, jail officials neither processed the power of attorney nor communicat­ed updates with Mr Khan’s legal team.
The jail authorities’ “arbitrary, malafide, and unconstitutional” actions violated Mr Khan’s fundamental rights to legal representation under Articles 4, 9, 10A of the Constitution.
The petition claimed the delaying tactics were part of a broader pattern where the state instituted “politically motivated cases to suppress dissent”
Mr Khan’s sister requested IHC to order jail authorities to “facilitate Imran Khan’s signatures on the PoA before the limitation period expires, enabling appeals to the Supreme Court.”
Warrants out for Shibli
Separately, a judge in Lahore has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI Senator Shibli Faraz and summoned Mr Khan in a case related to an alleged attack on Isla­mabad police outside Zaman Park.
The case dated back to March 2023, when Islamabad Police had arrived to arrest Mr Khan for skipping court hearings in the Toshakhana case.
However, the force failed to arrest Mr Khan.
The capital’s police lodged an FIR against Mr Khan, Mr Faraz and 150 other party workers for harassing and hurling life threats at the cops.
 
 

The FIR, registered at the Race Course police station, alleged Mr Khan, in connivance with Mr Faraz and other party workers, committed a crime by dodging and barring the Islamabad police from discharging their duty.
On Friday, the judicial magistrate at Cantonment Courts,  Sohail Rafiq, issued a written order regarding the proceedings of the case.
In its decision, the magistrate noted that Senator Faraz did not appear before the court and issued his non-bailable arrest warrant.
The magistrate summoned the PTI founding chairman in the same case for July 30.
Qureshi’s bail extended
The interim pre-arrest bail of PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi in seven cases linked to May 9 violence has been extended until Sept 19.
The cases include attacks on the Lahore Corps Commander House and Askari Tower, arson at the PML-N office and the burning of containers at Kalma Chowk.
ATC Judge Arshad Javed heard Mr Qureshi’s bail applications in five of the cases.
After the arguments, the judge extended the interim bail until the next hearing.
 
 

In the remaining two cases related to the Corps Commander House and Askari Tower attacks, ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill directed Mr Qureshi’s lawyers to present arguments at the next hearing.
All seven bail petitions were filed before Mr Qureshi’s arrest.
While his bail was earlier dismissed due to the detention, they were later reinstated following orders from the Lahore High Court.

• Senate unanimously adopts resolution condemning Israel’s sovereignty claim over occupied West Bank
ISLAMABAD: In a rare move, the attorney gereneral for Pakistan (AGP) has been summoned to appear before the Senate, after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns on Friday about alleged interference in House by judiciary, with some senators demanded immediate appearance of principal law officer in the lower house.
The issue was raised by former deputy chairman Senate and PPP leader Saleem Mandviwalla while Senator Shahadat Awan, also from PPP, was presiding over the session. Mr Mandviwalla voiced concern the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and Lahore High Court (LHC) had recently issued stay orders against proceedings of the Senate standing committees.
He said that throughout his legislative career, he had never witnessed such interference work of committees, which are extension of parliament.
Terming the development ‘alarming’, Mr Mandviwalla urged the chair to summon the attorney general and demand a serious expla­nation. “We have never interfered in court proceedings,” he remarked.
 






While acknowledging that the Constitution and rules do not bar parliament or its committees from discussing sub judice matters, he said such discussions are generally avoided out of respect for the judiciary. However, in this instance, he noted, stay orders were issued despite the absence of any pending court cases.
“This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees. The Attorney General must be summoned and asked what kind of joke this is,” he added.
When Mr Awan pointed out that the law minister was not present and suggested referring the matter to the attorney general via the secretariat for review of the case records, Mr Mandviwalla insisted that the attorney general, not the law minister, was the relevant authority.
 
 

Amid uproar with demands for immediate summoning of the attorney general, Mr Awan agreed to issue a notice to him to address the reservations of the House. “Let the Attorney General come to the House and brief it on the facts so that appropriate legal action can be taken,” he said.
However, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry proposed that the attorney general be called to the Senate chairman’s chamber.
Violation of Article 69
Referring to Article 69(1) of the Constitution, PPP Senator Zameer Ghumro said, “The validity of any proceedings in Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) shall not be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure.” He criticised the stay orders as violations of the separation of powers principle.
“Have we ever interfered in the working of any institution?” he asked.
Senator Dilawar Khan said the parliament was supreme and there was no justification for any instruction to meddle in its affairs.
PTI senator Saifullah Abro criticised Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar over passage of controversial amendments meant to make judiciary a “toothless body” and demanded that the attorney general be immediately summoned in the House.
JUI-F senator Kamran Murtaza also deplored the interference of judiciary in the matters of parliament and said displeasure should be conveyed to the judiciary.
Under Article 57 of the Constitution, the attorney general has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of either House, or a joint sitting. It, however, remains a question if the attorney general would make a rare appearance before the House or not. Sources in the Senate said the secretariat would send verbatim of the proceedings to him and sought a report, which would then be placed before the Senate chairman who would then decide future course of action.
Resolution on Palestine
Separately, the Senate also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the Israeli parliament’s decision to assert sovereignty over the occupied West Bank.
The resolution was moved in the House by Senator Palwasha Khan, terming the Israeli parliament’s resolution illegal, illegitimate, and null and void under international law, United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the Geneva Conventions.
Allegations against ex-minister
A contentious issue cropped up during Question Hour, when Dr Chaudhry, the minister for parliamentary affairs, claimed a former finance minister had increased the allocation for BISP Nashounuma Programme to around Rs 20 billion at a time when a company owned by him was the sole supplier of specialised nutritional food under the programme.
Mr Chaudhry claimed the company owned by Miftah Ismail was awarded the contract without following the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and food valuing Rs97bn had been procured.
He also claimed that no competitive bidding process, which is required under PPRA regulations, was undertaken at the time.
While senators questioned why no action was taken earlier, the presiding officer, Senator Irfan Siddiqui, referred the matter to a Senate standing committee for consideration.
Later, In a post on X, Mr Ismail challenged his former PML-N colleague, Dr Chaudhry, to bring present evidence for his claims and proceed against him in NAB or FIA.
“Ismail Industries has been supplying the World Food Program (WFP) for over twenty years. The BISP programme was started before I became a minister and continued after I left and continues to this day,” said Mr Ismail.
“Every packet that WFP buys from us is according to an international tender under UN protocols and guidelines and we supply to WFP at the same rate globally. Besides Pakistan we supply to many other countries.,” the former finance minister wrote.
