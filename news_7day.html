Military Lands and Cantonment Director General Maj Gen Irfan Ahmad Malik unveiled a new initiative of Internal Audit Framework for Cantonment Boards across the country to ensure enhancing transparency, accountability and operational excellence.
According to a press release, external audits are already being conducted by the Directorate General Audit Defence Services (ADS), the need for an internal mechanism had long been felt to ensure corrective measures are taken in time and to reduce the number of audit observations during external reviews.
The newly-instituted system has been designed with clear objectives: Transparency and Uniformity in auditing practices, accountability at all levels of field offices, preventive and remedial action to identify irregularities or unwarranted practices at their earliest stage.
A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) devised by Director Headquarters Dr Saima Shah, has been formulated, providing well-defined processes for conducting inspection audits in a fair and competitive manner.
This initiative standardises practices across boards, ensures compliance and creates a strong foundation for proactive governance. This reform emphasises the institution’s commitment to strengthening internal checks.
The framework will serve not just as a set of guidelines but as a pledge to build trust, ensure financial discipline and deliver impactful results at the grassroots level.
The Internal Audit Framework is primarily preventive, remedial and curative in nature. By identifying and addressing acts of omission, commission, irregularities or illegalities at the initial stage, the system curbs unwarranted practices before they escalate.
This strengthens the financial systems of cantonment boards, ensuring optimal output through adherence to rules and procedures. The Military Lands and Cantonments Department affirms that this initiative will not only streamline audit processes but also boost the overall credibility and performance of cantonment boards, reinforcing their role in service delivery and good governance.

Israel attempted to kill the political leaders of Hamas with an attack in Qatar on Tuesday, a strike that risked derailing US-backed efforts to broker a truce in Gaza and end the nearly two-year-old conflict.
The attack was widely condemned in the Middle East and beyond as an act that could escalate tensions in a region already on edge.
Trump expressed annoyance about the strike in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought to assure the Qataris that such attacks would not happen again.
Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani were joined by a top Trump adviser, US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Great dinner with POTUS. Just ended,” Qatar’s deputy chief of mission, Hamah Al-Muftah, said on X.
 






The White House confirmed the dinner had taken place but offered no details.
The session followed an hour-long meeting that al-Thani had at the White House on Friday with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
A source briefed on the meeting said they discussed Qatar’s future as a mediator in the region and defence cooperation in the wake of the Israeli strikes against Hamas in Doha.
Trump said he was unhappy with Israel’s strike, which he described as a unilateral action that did not advance US or Israeli interests.
Washington counts Qatar as a strong Gulf ally. Qatar has been a main mediator in long-running negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and for a post-conflict plan for the territory.
Al-Thani blamed Israel on Tuesday for trying to sabotage chances for peace but said Qatar would not be deterred from its role as mediator.
Israel’s assault on Gaza since October 2023 has killed over 64,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials, while internally displacing almost all of Gaza’s population and setting off a starvation crisis.
Multiple rights experts and scholars say Israel’s military assault on Gaza amounts to genocide.
Israel has rejected that determination.
It launched its latest and ongoing offensive in Gaza after an attack by Hamas in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Israel has also bombed Lebanon, Syria, Iran and Yemen in the course of the Gaza conflict.</p><small>2025-09-13 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1310502645cace8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941588/indian-hardliners-give-religious-twist-to-nepal-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Indian hardliners give religious twist to Nepal protests</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: Protesters in Nepal ousted the prime minister and set parliament ablaze over the government’s ban on social media and corruption allegations, but in India the violence is being misrepresented online as something else entirely: a religious uprising.
While some claim that the demonstrations are a demand for a “Hindu state”, others say the opposite — that they are an attack on the faith.
Fuelling the narrative are allegations from Indian broadcasters and politicians that rioters vandalised Nepal’s Pash­u­pa­ti­nath temple, a revered Hindu site.
“Some rioters, hiding within the crowd of protesters, attempted to vandalise the temple, and it was only after this incident that the army was deployed,” an anchor for the right-wing Zee News channel said in a report featuring a clip of people climbing onto the temple’s gate and violently shaking it.
 
 

Jivesh Mishra, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar state, which shares a border with Nepal, told reporters on Wednesday: “An attack on a temple is an attack on (the) Hindu faith.”
Right-wing influencers also amplified the claim to their thousands of followers.
But fact-checkers traced the footage to a religious ritual called Naxal Bhagwati Jatra, filmed weeks before the violence.
K. N. Swami, a renowned monk in the temple, also posted clips on social media to refute claims it had been attacked.
“I am currently inside the temple, and everything is peaceful here,” he said.
Nepal’s demonstrations began in the capital Kathmandu on Monday, driven by angry young protesters and now dubbed the “Gen Z” movement.
The protests escalated into an outpouring of rage nationwide, with government buildings set ablaze after a deadly crackdown. Sharma Oli quit as prime minister shortly after demonstrators set fire to his house.
 


‘Instigated and funded’
Hundreds of social media posts have clai­med without evidence that the protests were “instigated and funded” by “anti-Hindu forces and Islamists” to attack religious sites. Nepal, a secular republic since 2008, has witnessed frequent demonstrations by groups demanding a return to Hindu statehood.
Old visuals of the rallies resurfaced online this week, misleadingly presented as the current protests.
 
 

Footage of protesters calling for a Hindu monarchy in the past was falsely shared as evidence that Nepal’s “Gen Z” movement is more about religion than corruption.
Another image circulated with a claim that demonstrators wanted India’s firebrand Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath as Nepal’s prime minister.
‘Hindu nation’
Hashtags in favour of a “Hindu Nation” — a popular catchphrase of the BJP — have trended across social media platforms in India.
The posts warn the country to “prepare for similar youth uprisings”.
“The urge to break news fast in India is higher, and that led to misinformation from their side,” said Prashant Das, a research fellow at South Asian University.
“What is rife now are speculations and rumours, which are natural responses of people in such situations.”

The Group A match in Dubai is the first clash on the cricket field between the countries since a military conflict four months ago took relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours to their lowest point in decades.
India resisted calls to boycott the match between the pair, who have not played in any bilateral series since deadly attacks in Mumbai 2008.
“Enjoy, it’s a game of cricket,” legendary left-armer Akram told AFP of the match, which potentially could be the first of three high-octane meetings between the countries in the T20 tournament.
“Forget about everything other than cricket. One team will win, and one team will lose,” he said.
“Just enjoy the moment if you win the game. Pressure will come, enjoy that and show discipline because this is just a game. It’s for both teams and for both sets of fans.”
A full house of 25,000 is expected at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium and Akram recalled how he thrived in such pressure situations during his 19-year international career.
“I enjoyed every game against India, and so did players from the opposition,” said Akram, who led a Pakistan touring team to India in 1999 despite threats from extremists.
The 59-year-old was also part of Pakistan’s 1987 tour during which the two countries came close to war.
 
 

Akram advised an inexperienced Pakistan team to think of the bigger picture and not get carried away by the hype of playing T20 world champions and arch-rivals India.
“Pakistan have a chance as they won a tri-series last week,” said Akram, referring to a T20 series with Afghanistan and the UAE.
“They should not think that we just need to win against India, think of winning the Asia Cup,” he said.
“You can lose to a big team but even then, stand up and play well in the tournament.
“I don’t think the match will be one-sided like India against UAE,” said Akram of India’s opening romp on Wednesday, where they needed just 4.3 overs to reach their target after dismissing the hosts for 57.
“Anything can happen in this tournament.”
Pakistan beat Oman by 93 runs in their opening match on Friday.
Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh are in Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four. The Asia Cup final will be in Dubai on September 28.</p><small>2025-09-13 05:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/13092943831b3bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941605/nepra-imposes-rs248m-penalty-on-two-discos' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra imposes Rs248m penalty on two Discos</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday imposed a fine of Rs248 million on Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) for overbilling based on faulty meters and loadshedding on commercial grounds, in violation of laws and regulations.
In two separate orders issued after proceedings spanning over three years, the regulator imposed Rs200m on Gepco for overbilling consumers on the pretext of slow meters and Rs48m on Sepco for disrupting power supply to consumers based on aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses — an illegal practice.
Nepra said it had initiated proceedings against Gepco in August 2022, following complaints from 1,298 consumers regarding overbilling for a prolonged period, allegedly due to slow meters. The matter proceeded through investigations, a show-cause hearing, and other proceedings.
 
 

“Keeping in view the submissions of Gepco, the evidence available on record, provisions of relevant laws and applicable documents, the authority rejects the response of Gepco… and imposed a fine of Rs200m,” it said.
It directed Gepco to immediately ref­und or adjust all the bills charged to the affected 1,298 consumers over and above two billing cycles on account of slowness of energy meters, as was confirmed by Ge­­pco’s own report of Sept 9, 2022 within 30 days of receipt of this order, failing which an additional fine of Rs100,000 per day shall be imposed for continued violation.

Gepco fined Rs200m for overbilling and Sepco Rs48m for loadshedding

It said Gepco had charged consumers heavily through ‘detection bills’ on account of the slowness of energy meters for more than two billing cycles, with effect from January 1, 2021. The Gepco report, confirmed on September 9, 2022, stated that 1,298 consumers were charged detection bills due to slowness, in violation of the relevant provisions of the Consumer Service Manual (CSM).
Nepra had earlier directed Gepco in February 2023 to adjust the supplementary bills issued due to the slowness of energy meters for more than two billing cycles in future billing of the affected consumers, which was not implemented.
“Charging of supplementary bills on account of slowness for more than two billing cycles is blatant disregard of relevant provisions of CSM and has also caused serious harm to the reputation of licensee and unwarranted financial burden on the affected consumers,” Nepra held, adding that Gepco failed to comply with directions of the regulator for revision of supplementary bills charged on account of slowness of metering equipment in violation of provisions of CSM.
Illegal loadshedding
On the other hand, it imposed about Rs48m at the rate of Rs100,000 per day since April 4, 2024, on Sepco when it was directed by Nepra to stop ATC-based loadshedding for being illegal and against the regulations.
Sepco took the position on record that the ATC-based loadshedding was started in March 2014 upon the directions of the Ministry of Energy and the categories or slabs of the losses were defined by a subsidiary of the said ministry.
 
 

Nepra finally rejected Sepco’s position and directed it to “immediately cease and refrain from continuing AT&C-based load shedding in contravention of the Authority’s directives and the applicable legal framework”. Furthermore, the regulator also imposed a fine of Rs 100,000 per day on Sepco for each day of persistent contravention, effective from the date of Nepra’s original order dated April 4, 2024, until the violation is rectified. It asked Sepco to deposit the fine within 15 days.
“Failure to comply shall entail recovery of the outstanding amount under Section 41 of the Nepra Act as arrears of land revenue or through any other appropriate legal means, in addition to any further legal action.
The regulator observed that Sepco had been violating its own so-called AT&C policy and carrying out excessive load shedding as compared to the scheduled one. Moreover, a few feeders were randomly selected. It was observed that Sepco had failed to make improvements in the technical and financial health of those feeders over the last four years despite allowing colossal amounts under the O&M head by Nepra and continuing their operations in the status quo, due to which, even good-paying consumers were suffering a lot.

It is a solemn recognition of the existential threat posed by a rapidly changing climate. More importantly, it represents a fleeting window of opportunity to enact fundamental reforms that are long overdue.
This is the moment to move beyond symbolic gestures and address the deep-seated vulnerabilities that have made our nation a recurring victim of climate-triggered disasters.
The recent floods have laid bare the catastrophic consequences of climate inaction, worsened by a legacy of poor governance and unsustainable practices.
While the term ‘emergency’ doesn’t grant the government a blank cheque for extraordinary constitutional powers, it does provide the political mandate to push through reforms that might otherwise be stalled by bureaucratic inertia and/or political expediency.

While the term ‘emergency’ doesn’t grant govt a blank cheque for extraordinary constitutional powers, it does provide the political mandate to push through reforms that might otherwise become stalled

The real power of this declaration lies in its ability to force a national consensus and prioritise action. It is a powerful signal to the public, the provinces, and the international community that we are not merely reacting to a crisis; we are committing to a transformative journey.
 
 

It is not a moment of despair; rather a wake-up call that demands a fundamental re-evaluation of how our nation is governed, how we manage our resources, and how we build our communities.
By acting decisively on five pillars — water management, decentralised governance, resilient construction and land-use planning, agricultural reform, and financial resilience — Pakistan can transform this crisis into a tipping point.
This is an opportunity to forge a new path towards a more equitable and prosperous future, proving that resilience is not just about withstanding shocks, but about emerging from disasters stronger than before.
Pakistan is not alone in declaring a climate emergency; countries like Bangladesh, Canada and the UK have used similar ‘emergencies’ to fast-track climate action and raise international awareness.
Bangladesh’s ‘planetary emergency’ declaration in 2019 reinforced its national adaptation plan, while the UK’s parliamentary motion spurred local councils and pressured the government to adopt a legally binding net-zero target.
In Canada, a similar motion provided political support for accelerating carbon taxes. These examples demonstrate that such declarations are powerful mechanisms for justifying institutional and legal reforms, translating political will into concrete policy changes.
Four reform pillars
To tackle our climate vulnerabilities, the government must focus on five key areas of reform.
Water management: The devastating floods were worsened by illegal construction on riverbeds, blocking natural water flow. A nationwide campaign must be launched to remove these encroachments before the next monsoon season, using the Canal and Drainage Act of 1873 as the legal North Star. This should be paired with a new, volume-based water pricing system to encourage conservation and generate funds for water infrastructure.
Locally-led development: Centralised plans often fail to meet local needs. Empowering local governments with the authority to conduct land-use planning and implement local adaptation strategies will ensure that resources reach the most vulnerable communities and that plans are tailored to specific regional risks, bridging the gap between national policy and local action.
Resilient infrastructure: The government should immediately enforce new, climate-resilient construction standards for both public and private sectors. This emergency also provides the political will to curb urban sprawl, which consumes vital agricultural land. While initial costs may be higher, the long-term savings in disaster relief and reconstruction will be immense.
Agricultural overhaul: We must promote climate-resilient farming practices on a national scale. This includes developing and distributing drought and flood-tolerant crops, incentivising crop diversification away from water-intensive varieties, and establishing a subsidised crop insurance programme. This will protect farmers and ensure national food security in an unpredictable world.
Financial resilience: A crucial strategy for governments to enhance anticipatory social protection is to collaborate with provinces on risk transfer and insurance mechanisms.
This partnership would enable a shift away from sole reliance on post-disaster cash transfers, which are often not sustainable. By pooling resources and leveraging expertise, the federal and provincial governments can develop risk-pooling schemes and disaster insurance programmes tailored to the specific vulnerabilities of each region.
 
 

These mechanisms can provide rapid, pre-arranged financing triggered by specific events, such as extreme weather forecasts, reducing the need for emergency aid.
This approach not only provides quicker support to affected communities but also allows for more strategic investments in resilience-building initiatives, such as improving infrastructure and early warning systems.
Ultimately, this collaboration creates a more proactive and fiscally sustainable framework for managing the impacts of predictable shocks.

In fact, there might be more. One of the questions, I suspect, may revolve around why such critical cases are being treated so uncritically.
Another would pertain to the reasons that compelled the Supreme Court to prioritise infructuous matters, or matters of dissimilar import, over those which hit the court’s credibility and integrity. Another may orbit around how the judiciary can even talk about judicial reform when it cannot decide the limits of its own judicial form.
Finally, one may ponder over what justice the Supreme Court can hope to deliver to others, when it evidently is unable to deliver justice to itself. All or any of these questions may be considered critical, and it can be debated which one deserves to be answered first. But what is beyond question is the silence of the court when it comes to answering any of them.
 
 

Whichever way one looks at it, the problem in the curious case of the challenges to the 26th Amendment lies in its very fundamentals. In essence, the changes brought about by the amendment appear to touch upon the very scheme of the Constitution it seeks to amend. The Supreme Court has itself referred to this ‘scheme’ in different ways on different occasions — as a ‘basic structure’, or as ‘salient features’, or ‘prominent characteristics’.
Whichever permutation you prefer, the gist of the argument remains the same: the Constitution retains certain fundamental features that make it what it is, and without them, it would perhaps no longer be the Constitution of Pakistan. In layman’s terms, the salient features are the Constitution, or at the very least, it’s soul.
While there may be many salient features, democracy, a parliamentary form of government, and independence of the judiciary are three definite ones. A long history of cases previously has acknowledged the presence of such features in one form or the other. However, on whether a constitutional amendment itself can be struck down on the touchstone of the same, the case law has been less enthusiastic.
 
 

Interestingly, Pakistan’s courts have traditionally been seen as more resistant to striking down a constitutional amendment on the basis of the doctrine of salient features, as opposed to Indian jurisdiction’s accommodating and more welcoming position on the issue.
This, however, seems to have changed in 2015, when the Supreme Court, hearing matters relating to the vires of the 18th Amendment, along with the 19th and 21st Amendments, specifically addressed this question. Out of a total of 17 judges, 11 not only upheld the presence of salient features in the Constitution in one form or the other, but also acknowledged and upheld the judicial review of a constitutional amendment on the basis of an infringement of the same. This is not to say that the judiciary retained unlimited powers to undo such amendments, which would be an overstatement.

Judicial independence is called a ‘principle’ of law for a reason.

However, in the context of the changes in the judicial appointment mechanism, as made by the 18th and 19th Amendments, and which revolved around the composition and functions of the judicial commission and parliamentary committee, the Supreme Court provided certain insightful observations.
In the context of Article 175-A of the Constitution, the court held that the litmus test for judicial independence appears to be that the power to initiate, as well as the primacy and decisiveness of the final outcome of the appointment process, must vest in the chief justices and members of the judiciary. Essentially, the judiciary must be given a decisive role in making such appointments and initiating them.
 
 

Earlier, in relation to the challenges to the 18th Amendment, and prior to the enactment of the 19th Amendment, the Supreme Court had articulated how the Constitution envisions a judiciary which is free from executive influence or oversight, and free from the shackles of legislative blackmail. It delineated such a principle on the basis of the constitutional provisions relating to a fair trial, separation of the executive from the judiciary, and securing an independent judiciary. It was actually in light of these principles that the need for the 19th Amendment was felt, which had whittled down the 18th Amendment in order to ensure that the executive and legislature would lack undue influence in judicial processes overall.
In my opinion, such influence would not merely be limited to considering the ratio of judicial officers to non-judicial representatives in the judicial commission, but would also have to consider the number of members, judicial or otherwise, being directly or indirectly appointed by the executive or legislature.
When the current challenges to the 26th Amendment are seen from this prism, the amendment does not seem to fulfil the above-mentioned litmus test or preserve the Constitution’s salient features. And that is perhaps why no one wants to deal with these cases. They have the potential to be messy, comes at an undesirable time, and is — for a lack of a better word — inconvenient.
 
 

That said, judicial independence is called a ‘principle’ of law for a reason. A ‘principle’ is a position one takes and stays committed to even in difficult times. If you remain committed to your principles only when it is convenient, it isn’t a principle, but a trend. In the past, the judiciary typically chose the path of least resistance when dealing with critical constitutional issues such as these, thereby being seen as facilitating power. Over the decades, it garnered criticism and lost much face.
One hopes that this time round, unlike its chequered past, it treats judicial independence as the principle it should be, and not as the trend it is now becoming.

One is the news that the personal and sensitive data of millions of Pakistanis is being sold publicly for a small amount, including that of the interior minister! Second is an investigative report by Amnesty International detailing the expansive technology-enabled state surveillance in Pakistan. The common thread between the two revelations is that they are both illegal and violate the fundamental rights of dignity and privacy in Pakistan.
The leaks of personal data that can be bought online include national identity card details, passport data, travel history, location etc. This is extremely alarming, as apart from privacy, this is a security failure. This can enable criminal activity, blackmail, fraud and even worse occurrences against anyone. How is sensitive personal data that citizens are forced to trust the state with so easily accessible?
 
 

What are the privacy and data protection protocols at Nadra, FIA, telecom companies and other government institutions that store this data? Why is it not stored in encrypted form with limited authorised access? And what consequences will those who sold this data in the black market face — especially the ones who enabled these leaks from the government databases?
Similarly, the Amnesty report details the level of mass surveillance that the state is carrying out. Citizens’ phones and computers can be turned into listening devices; conversations, emails and location data can be accessed without oversight or judicial authorisation, and there is no legal redress for those targeted.
Though the audio leaks case in the Islamabad High Court brought to the fore the Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS) that snoops on citizens’ phone conversations, the Amnesty report tells us that the technology was developed by a German company, Utimaco, and supplied thr­ough a UAE company called Datafusion.
The Web Monitoring System (WMS) was supplied by a Canadian company Sandvine (now AppLogic Network) in 2018, but has been replaced by “new technology from China-based Geedge Networks, utilising hardware and software components supplied by Niagara Networks from the US and Thales from France … to create a new version of the firewall”.

The state’s surveillance certainly has a chilling effect.

These details show how a sophisticated system — which resulted in slower internet speeds by almost 40 per cent in 2024 and grave economic losses — acquired from multiple countries has created these illegal and unconstitutional surveillance systems in Pakistan.
 
 

The report details that LIMS is mandated by the Pakistan Tele­communications Authority (PTA) to be installed across telecommunication networks by private companies, allowing security and intel forces “to tap into it and access consumer data”. The report further details that the WMS also “allows authorities to block VPNs or any website deemed to be ‘unlawful’ content by the authorities”, showing the technical and logical link between surveillance and censorship.
This surveillance certainly has a chilling effect, as it is used to target political opposition, activists, journalists, and anybody the state deems worthy of snooping on, with complete impunity. The frequent incidents of financial scams and frauds that citizens have been reporting further prove the leaks of data that have become routine, and there seems to be little redress for these crimes once financial fraud has occurred against citizens.
The National Cybe­rcrime Investigation Authority must play its role of spreading awareness but also ensure that culprits of financial fraud are punished in order to deter such common practices of fraud. The PTA must ensure that no surveillance system is misused against citizens as LIMS is reported to be doing, and PTA’s licensees must also respect the laws and the Constitution rather than becoming accomplice in mass surveillance.
Whereas the state carries out surveillance under its perceived notions of security, the lack of legal cover for these invasive surveillance systems and the leaks of data that make personal details into a market commodity show how insecure and unsafe these systems really are.
 
 

A data protection law is a fundamental necessity to govern the right to privacy of Pakistanis that is afforded under Article 14 of the Constitution, and further expanded by several precedents in the superior judiciary, such as in the Benazir Bhutto case in 1988, the Ghulam Hussain case in 2010 and the Justice Qazi Faez Isa case in 2024. The Fair Trial Act, 2013, permits digital surveillance only after a warrant from a magistrate is granted; not the kind of mass surveillance that we are experiencing now.
The Amnesty report also highlights the violation of United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights which require both states and companies to respect human rights, including in their exports. The sale of spyware and surveillance technology shows how states such as the US, France, Canada, the UAE and China violate these principles by allowing export of technology that carries out mass surveillance with no regard for citizens’ fundamental rights.
As the Amnesty report recommends, there is a dire need for a comprehensive legal framework that regulates surveillance to ensure that it is targeted and proportionate, and subject to independent oversight. Parliament must play its role in conducting a transparent inquiry into the illegal surveillance systems in Pakistan, and legislate to regulate this industry under its oversight. Parliament must also move forward on the Personal Data Protection draft that has been debated since 2020 but has not yet reached a stage where it can be enacted.
 
 

The leaks will also have a dire impact on the business community, which could, instead, have benefited from a strong data protection regime that, in turn, would have encouraged more foreign investment in the IT sector, as well as enabled the security of the vast amounts of data stored and processed by businesses, organisations, hospitals and educational institutes.
A state that surveils without oversight and leaks without consequence erodes the trust of its citizens. The security of citizens must be paramount for the state. And a post-26th Amendment judiciary must act to safeguard citizens’ rights if it is serious about disproving allegations of being controlled by the executive.

The concerns came from office-bearers of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists during an emergency meeting at the National Press Club.
According to a statement, the participants expressed their dismay over the indictment of senior journalist Shahbaz Rana by a local court, despite the fact that he had filed the report based on official records.
They announced that the journalist community would hold a protest against what they called a biased trial. The case against Rana is based upon a complaint of an FBR official, who alleged that the journalist’s report was defamatory and scandalous.
However, the meeting reviewed the report and noted that not only was the information available in the official record, the report had proven to be true based on factual evidence.

“This step has been taken for the necessary maintenance of special Boeing 777 long-range aircraft that cross the Pacific Ocean,” a PIA spokesperson said on Friday.
In a statement issued here, the spokesperson said these aircraft had the capability to fly continuously for 17 hours without stopping.
“Both long-range aircraft will undergo a three-week process of technical inspection and replacement of parts, which becomes essential every 10 years.
“The purpose of this maintenance is to ensure the aircraft are fully prepared ahead of the expected passenger rush in the coming month,” he said.

And yet, instead of resolving their differences and setting some rules of engagement, both sides continue to cross lines that should not be crossed. In jail and with the walls seemingly closing in, former prime minister Imran Khan has taken an increasingly combative position against the authorities.
 
 

It appears that the recent arrest of his nephews, who have since been released on bail, has greatly provoked him. In statements attributed to him and shared from his X account on Thursday, the jailed PTI leader has directed the KP government as well as provincial lawmakers to resist the military operations being conducted in the province to clear it of terrorists. This is a dangerous and problematic position to take, especially given the social sensitivities involved.
Mr Khan seems to believe that the military operations are merely a tool to politically hurt his party, which rules the province. He has also asserted that they are being conducted “merely to please foreign powers”. However, these positions are contradicted by the ground realities in KP, where militancy is visibly resurgent and repeated attacks by terrorists have claimed many lives and spoilt what hard-fought peace had been achieved in previous years. There is, indeed, strong local opposition to security operations as well, because kinetic operations invariably entail the displacement of civilian populations and subsequent economic losses due to disrupted livelihoods.
However, the citizenry seems equally wary of the growing influence of terrorists and other violent actors and does not want them to gain a foothold either. In such a situation, a national leader should propose a middle-ground solution that protects citizens’ interests while recognising national security imperatives. Unfortunately, Mr Khan seems to be letting anger get the better of his judgement.
 
 

It would be amiss not to point out the failings on the other side as well. Perhaps due to the way politics, justice and governance have shaped up under the present regime, the powerful seem to be operating under the assumption that their will can be imposed on the people without consequences. This is a dangerous presumption.
Decisions that can drastically affect citizens’ lives cannot be taken behind closed doors. There needs to be political ownership of such choices, which can only happen if those who are to be affected by them have been adequately heard and their concerns accommodated. Pressing ahead without public consent can prove disastrous in case unforeseen challenges end up complicating operational aims.
Hence, there should be a much greater focus on attaining political buy-in, and if making certain concessions can help achieve it, they should be considered. There needs to be some give and take.

In its session held at Parliament House and presided over by Senator Farooq Hamid Naek, the committee passed the Pakistan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which was moved by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, which raises the minimum value of diyat from 30,663 grams to 45,000 grams of silver.
The adjustment aims to reflect current economic realities and ensure fair compensation for the heirs of victims in line with inflation.
 






Senator Zehri said the amendment was framed strictly under Islamic injunctions, while Senator Kamran Murtaza voiced dissent, warning that the higher amount could disproportionately burden less privileged convicts.

Senators endorse bills piloted by Samina Zehri as ‘pro-women’

The committee chairman defended the move, calling it essential for deterrence and “a step towards upholding the sanctity of life”.
The committee also adopted the Family Courts (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024, another initiative by Senator Zehri, which mandates that maintenance amount for divorced women and their children must be fixed at the very first hearing. If the defendant fails to pay maintenance amount by the 14th of each month, the defence will be struck off and the case decided on available evidence.
 
 

“This amendment ensures timely relief and upholds the dignity of vulnerable families,” Senator Zehri said, noting that divorce cases often drag on for years to the detriment of women and children.
Members of the committee strongly endorsed the reform as pro-women and public-friendly legislation, though Senator Murtaza raised concerns over its compatibility with Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a fair trial.
Meanwhile, the Constitu­tion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, introduced by Senator Mohammad Abdul Qadir and proposing changes to Article 27, was withdrawn by the mover after the committee observed that the measure was redundant in view of a recent Supreme Court ruling and existing constitutional safeguards.
The meeting was attended by Senators Shahadat Awan, Kamran Murtaza, and Samina Mumtaz Zehri, alongside officials from relevant ministries and departments.

In applications, filed under Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the couple sought an urgent hearing for their pending criminal revision petitions. The filings highlight a critical disparity between the pace of the trial court and the high court.
The petitioners argued that their pleas against the dismissal of acquittal pleas have been pending since January 2024, while the trial court is proceeding with “unprecedented and extraordinary speed,” conducting hearings on a strict day-to-day basis.
This “breakneck pace” of trial, presided over by the Special Judge Central in Islamabad, is severely prejudicial to their rights to a fair trial and due process, they contend.
They expressed a “grave and well-founded apprehension” that the trial court may conclude the case even before the IHC hears their challenge, which they said would render their legal right to revision “infructuous, nugatory, and a mere academic exercise.”

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mini Mazda Truck Owners Association President Latif Gul said Afghan authorities have not allowed the trucks to return, leaving hundreds of Pakistani drivers and conductors stuck across the border in difficult conditions.
“Our drivers have been away from their homes for a month, while truck owners have already exhausted their earnings to meet daily expenses,” he added.
Latif Gul said that delays at the border have increased operational costs, resulting in higher fares for vehicles travelling to Afghanistan. He warned that under such conditions, truck owners and drivers would no longer be willing to transport passengers to Afghanistan.
He further cautioned that if the issue is not resolved immediately, the association would be compelled to block Ring Road in Peshawar and halt the movement of all containers bound for Afghanistan.
He urged both the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure the immediate repatriation of stranded vehicles and drivers.

Earlier, Additional District & Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the proceedings, with the prime minister appearing via a video link.
During the hearing, PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday objected to several questions posed by Advocate Muhammad Hussain Chotia, the counsel for the defendant.
At the outset, the prime minister objected to the late arrival of the defendant’s lawyer, saying he had returned from an official visit to Qatar for the case. He asked the judge to proceed strictly in accordance with law.

Meetings on ongoing flood situation cited as reason for the request

Later, PM Shehbaz took oath to speak the truth and admitted that the receipts of the legal notice bore the name of his lawyer but did not specify who received them.
He maintained that the legal notice had been issued on his instructions, although he could not recall the complete text of the notice. The prime minister read the legal notice aloud in the court.
The defendant’s counsel pointed out that the defamation suit mentioned the Panama Papers but the legal notice did not.
However, PM Shehbaz said that he had repeatedly clarified that he had no connection to the Panama Papers.
“It is very clear in the suit and there is no need for further questions on this point,” he pressed.
Advocate Ramday also objected, calling the questions posed by the defendant’s counsel irrelevant and meaningless.
The judge adjourned further hearing till Sept 16 to continue the cross-examination of the prime minister.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him.
He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.
The former prime minister had filed his reply to the suit with a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends told him that someone known to him and the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama Papers case.
The former prime minister said he disclosed the incident for the consumption of the public at large and an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation. Mr Khan said he did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.

• Suspends eight cash and support centres due to Taliban ban on female staff
• Appeals for $259m to sustain life-saving assistance
ISLAMABAD: The top official of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Afghanistan has called on Pakistan to uphold its long-standing humanitarian approach towards Afghan refugees and extend the legal stay of those still in need of international protection, particularly groups at heightened risk if forced to return.
In a statement issued from Geneva on Friday, UNHCR Representative to Afghanistan Arafat Jamal said the agency stood ready to support Pakistan in developing practical mechanisms to identify vulnerable individuals and expand regulated migration pathways for Afghans.
He also urged regional countries to ensure that all returns remain voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable, stressing that no one should be forced back to danger or to a country already stretched to absorb new arrivals.
“Without additional funding, we will not be able to sustain life-saving assistance for Afghan families facing these overlapping crises. We have updated our regional appeal for returns in light of recent events and are calling for $258.6 million,” Mr Jamal said.
As Pakistan resumes implementation of its “Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan”, more than 554,000 Afghans have returned since April, including 143,000 in August alone.
In recent weeks, the pace has surged further: in the first week of September alone, nearly 100,000 people crossed back from Pakistan, stretching capacities to the limit.
Together with partners, UNHCR is providing returnees with immediate assistance — cash support, protection and other essential services — both at border points and in their areas of return, to help families begin rebuilding their lives.
However, in recent days, UNHCR has been forced to temporarily suspend operations at its cash and support centres across Afghanistan, as the de facto authorities have been preventing national female UN staff members from entering UN compounds.
“This is a problem affecting the entire UN, including UNHCR, and any agency head would tell a similar story. It is not possible to serve women without female staff. We reiterate our call for the immediate lifting of these restrictions and for an urgent solution to be found,” the statement said.
Mr Jamal said the agency closed eight centres providing cash and other support to returnees on Sept 9 because of the ban on female aid workers.
“This was an operational decision. It is not a decision taken to punish anyone or to make a statement, but it simply demonstrates that we cannot work without female workers in certain circumstances,” he told a Geneva press briefing by video link from Kabul, according to Reuters.
“It is a huge step, and it is creating an enormous amount of suffering for these people,” he said, adding that these centres typically helped around 7,000 people a day.
The work at the centres involves personal interviews and biometrics, which he said cannot be done by men on Afghan women, he added.
Restrictions on women
Meanwhile, the United Nations in Afghanistan has called on Taliban authorities to lift restrictions barring women national staff from entering its premises, APP reported.
“These measures are putting life-saving humanitarian assistance and other essential services for hundreds of thousands of people affected by a recent deadly earthquake at risk,” the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) warned in a statement.
 
 

The UN Refugee Agency cautioned that a “crisis within a crisis” was emerging, as forced returns from Pakistan coincide with devastating earthquakes in many of the same areas where returnees are arriving.
Since the start of the year, about 2.6 million Afghans have returned from neighbouring countries, many against their will. Some have not set foot in Afghanistan for decades, while others are being brought into the country for the first time.
The agency “remains grateful to governments, companies and individuals who have already stepped up to support UNHCR’s work in Afghanistan and across the region. But our resources are running out quickly”, Mr Jamal cautioned.
Meanwhile, in the earthquake-affected areas, UNHCR has met families who had only just returned from Pakistan before losing their homes once again. “We are distributing thousands of tents and other relief items, including in some of the most remote locations, while also scaling up protection assessments and programmes already in place in these provinces for returnees,” he added.

LAHORE: Evacuation eff­orts continued across central and south Punjab as exceptionally high flood levels persist between the Panjnad confluence of Chenab-Ravi-Sutlej and Guddu Barrage in Sindh, creating a severe humanitarian crisis, inundating low-lying areas, displacing large populations, and destroying hundreds of acres of standing crops.
The overflowing Indus has also inundated parts of Sindh, with areas in Dadu and Lar­kana witnessing widespread displacement in riverine areas.
Residents of flood-hit areas are also facing widespread electricity and mobile service outages, leaving them cut off from authorities and relatives, while trapped by rising waters.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said 97 people had lost their lives as Punjab faced the “biggest flood in history”. He reported that 2.45 million people from 4,500 villages along the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers had been affected, and that 1.9m cattle had been moved to safe locations.
 
 

The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has warned of a very high flood at Head Panjnad, Sidhnai, and Ganda Singh Wala, while high flood levels persist at Head Sulemanki, Head Islam, and Mailsi Syphon.
According to FFD data, released at 1am on Saturday, Punjnad Headworks recorded a flow of 651,572 cusecs, while the outflows at Guddu Barrage were steady at 537,392 cusecs.
Breaches
A total of 19 controlled breaches were carried out on Friday to mitigate the flood threat to Jalapur, Alipur, while efforts to repair the damaged dyke in Shujabad continued in earnest.
In Shujabad, a dyke collapsed at Mouza Dhundwala, flooding several villages and sending water towards the city. The administration and irrigation officials are trying to reinforce the Bakhto Wah canal dyke to protect the town, but several villages have already been submerged.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who toured several flood hit areas on Friday, also visited the breach site and directed officials to seal it.
However, three workers sent to repair the breach in Shujabad were swept away by the rising waters. Two of them were rescued, but their third colleague could not be traced and was feared dead.
Authorities also made controlled breaches on Uch Sharif Road to divert floodwaters away from Jalalpur city, with Multan police chief Sadiq Ali Dogar saying the decision was necessary as pressure on temporary dams was not easing.
In Alipur, the administration breached Seetpur Road at 18 locations to disperse water flowing towards the city, submerging several villages and trapping thousands on rooftops.  Here, a rescue boat capsized in Darabpur village when a man tried to climb on it, causing it to lose balance. However, all passengers were rescued.
‘Calamity-hit’ Alipur
Marriyum Aurangzeb also visited Alipur to monitor flood relief operations. She declared Alipur tehsil a calamity-hit area.
People gathered around her to report that six members of a family were missing after a rescue boat capsized in Seetpur. Many residents were stranded on rooftops, and boats were not available for evacuation.
The government also deployed drones in the flood-affected areas of Seetpur city to distribute food items. The drones carried supplies and delivered them to people stranded on rooftops.
Malik Riaz, a resident of Seetpur, told Dawn that he had been without food and water for the last two days and that the drone delivery provided much-needed relief. He added that hand pumps were emitting dirty water, which was unsafe for drinking.
Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that 18,130 people have been rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala, 11,700 from Liaqatpur in Rahim Yar Khan, and 6,400 from Alipur. In the last 24 hours across Punjab, 19,946 people were rescued from flood-affected areas, including 1,955 from Bahawalpur, 1,715 from Pakpattan, 1,407 from Lodhran, 830 from Okara, 823 from Bahawalnagar, 659 from Jhang, 585 from Kasur, 558 from Vehari, and 545 from Toba Tek Singh.
Dadu flooding
In Sindh, floods inundated parts of Dadu as the Indus River overflowed near the Dadu-Moro Bridge, submerging more than 30 villages in the riverine areas. The rising waters have displaced large numbers of residents and triggered outbreaks of waterborne and other infectious diseases.
 
 

The Health Department, People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative and Rescue 1122 have set up medical camps to provide urgent care.
According to Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah, medical camps have been established along the protective embankment, while mobile ambulances are operating to assist the affected population. Boats have also been deployed to help stranded residents. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely and have urged the residents to cooperate with rescue teams and follow precautionary measures.
PM praises relief efforts
Separately, PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday praised all four chief ministers, as well as the governments of GB and AJK, for carrying out prompt and effective flood relief operations across the country.
The prime minister specially commended his niece, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, saying: “She is leading from the front.”

The PPP chairman said it was “beyond comprehension” as to why the Centre had not sought international assistance despite a disaster of this scale. “This is standard practice for disasters of this scale internationally. It was done for the last floods when I was foreign minister, before that, the 2010 floods and the 2005 earthquake.
Countries all over the world do the same within the first 72 hours of such disasters,” he said on his X (formerly Twitter) account.
“There is no excuse to cut off the millions affected from this assistance,” he said.
 







Sherry Rehman moves resolution in Senate, urges govt to use BISP to help survivors

Mr Bhutto-Zardari welcomed the government’s decision to announce a climate and agricultural emergency and called for the announcement of relief through the Benazir Income Support Programme for flood-impacted areas. He also expressed support for the agricultural community, calling it the “most devastated sector” due to the recent floods.
Resolution
The resolution submitted to the Senate, moved by Senator Sherry Rehman, emphasised that immediate humanitarian relief was critical, including the waiver of electricity bills for the millions of vulnerable citizens now displaced or affected.
 






Key points of the resolution included acknowledging the current crisis as a climate, flood, agricultural, and humanitarian emergency, and emphasising that delays in mobilising support were unacceptable, regardless of the pace of international response, said a statement issued by the PPP.
The destruction of crops and displacement of communities had created a multi-faceted emergency, requiring both immediate national action and robust international support.
 
 

The federal government must expedite direct cash transfers to displaced families and affected farmers via the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), following the successful model of 2022, the resolution said, besides emphasising the urgent need for basic medical care and medicines.
“There is a need for a renewed call for the government of Pakistan to launch an international flash appeal through the United Nations to enable swift donor mobilisation,” it added.

Despite the approval, federal and regional officials face significant funding challenges, with financial responsibility for the new posts placed on the “resource-strapped” Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) government and construction funds deferred until the next fiscal year.
A Central Development Working Party (CDWP) meeting, held on July 25, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commi­ssion, reviewed the GB government sponsored pro­ject “Raising of Cou­nter Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) in GB”, which carries a cost of over 1.5 billion rupees.
The initiative follows a directive from the prime minister, who during a visit on Nov 6, last year, ordered the establishment of the CTD in GB within six months.
The project aims to enh­ance the capacity of the GB Police by addressing “critical gaps in human and technical reso­urces, enabling effective res­ponses to terrorist incidents and the conduct of comprehensive investigations”.
While the CDWP approved the civil works component of the project — the construction of a CTD HQs in Gilgit and a regional office in Chilas at a cost of Rs720.50 million — it noted the allocation would not be made until the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the 2026-27 fiscal year.
 
 

The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions will sponsor the project.
The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives cited “reduced fiscal space in PSDP” and a “substantial” existing financial commitment to GB as reasons for the delay. It told the GB government to either execute the project using its own resources or approach the Finance Division for recurring budget support.
The planning division’s chairman told the meeting that the PSDP is meant for development, while expenses like arms and ammunition are recurring costs that should be covered by the current budget.
The GB Home Department informed the forum that its own regional budget has no room to accommodate new projects and that it is already facing a shortage of resources, a situation exacerbated by ongoing floods.
It said the Finance Division is considering a reduction of Rs40 billion from the already approved SDP, This reduction would limit the PSDP to funding only ongoing strategic projects.
Separately, the Federal Finance Division concurred with the creation of the 613 posts for the new department. However, in a letter to the GB Home and Prisons Department, it attached strict conditions.
“I am directed to… convey the concurrence of Finance Division for the creation of 613 posts for CTD, Gilgit-Baltistan,” the letter from Section Officer Babar Nazir stated.
It stipulated that the “additional financial implications shall be met out by the GB government from their available resources and no additional funds will be provided for this purpose”.

WASHINGTON / ISLA­M­ABAD: A rare and public rift emerged among Israel and its closest Western allies during Thursday’s emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, as the US, France and UK voiced differing views on its airstrike against Qatar.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 Security Council members in condemning the strike.
Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea described the operation as “counterproductive” and said it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals“, while emphasizing the importance of de-escalation and support for Qatar, a key mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations.
For a Security Council statement to be issued, all 15 members must sign off on the text. The United States has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
France’s Ambassador to the UN, Jérôme Bonna­font, condemned Israel’s strikes as a violation of international law. He stressed that “a political solution based on the two-State framework is essential,” emphasizing recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state with reformed governance.
 






UK ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward said: “We wholly condemn the strikes on Qatar which will do nothing to deliver peace in the Middle East, or to help safeguard Israel’s long-term security.”
 






Trade barbs
But Israel’s UN Amba­ssador, Danny Danon, made no effort to read the room. Instead, he underscored the double standards of those Western allies who criticised Tel Aviv’s action.
Drawing parallels to the US operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Danon said: “When bin Laden was eliminated in Pakistan, the question asked was not why target a terrorist on foreign soil… The same question must be asked today. There’s no immunity for bin Laden and there can be no immunity for Hamas.”
He also turned on France and Britain, recalling French action against terrorists in Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, and Mau­ritania, and London’s airstrikes against the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.
 






At that, Pakistan immediately exercised its right of reply, with Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmad rejecting the analogy as “unacceptable” and “ludicrous” and accusing Israel of attempting to deflect attention from its own “illegal act­ions and violations of int­ernational law“.
“It [Israel] is an occupier, a serial violator of the UN Charter and international law, that threatens the international community, humanitarian org­anisations, and even the United Nations itself — and does so with impunity,” Mr Ahmad said. “Despite being the aggressor, it pretends to be the victim. But today, it stands fully exposed.”
 






Following Pakistan’s res­ponse, the Israeli amb­assador returned to the floor, accusing Pakistan and others of applying double standards.
In its weekly briefing on Friday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also condemned the Israeli aggression against Qatar and expr­essed complete solidarity with the brotherly state, calling on the international community to hold Israel accountable for this unprovoked and unlawful aggression.
Qatari PM’s address
In his address under Rule 37, Qatar’s prime minister strongly deno­unced the Israeli attack in Doha. He said the attack targeted a residential compound allocated for negotiating teams, housing Hamas representatives and their families, and terrorised residents.
“It is a violation of the UN Member State’s sovereignty,” he said. “Israel — led by bloodthirsty extr­emists — has gone beyond any borders, any limitation when it comes to behaviour among states and individuals.
Have you heard of any state that is attacking the mediator this way? A state that is attacking the negotiating teams that are hosted by Qatar?”

Banners of Haruka Kitaguchi, Japan’s javelin star, are plastered on the walls of the mazy metro stations in the Japanese capital. On the buildings in Ginza, digital billboards have the Japanese athletics team on display.
After a spectator-less Olympics four years ago during the Covid-19 pandemic, Tokyo is geared up to host a global athletics extravaganza beginning from Saturday.
It was an emotional memory for Japanese athletics chief Yuko Arimori, who teared up when asked at the opening press conference on Friday what it meant to finally have fans in attendance at the championships.
“Sports aren’t just for athletes but for everyone to enjoy,” the former marathon runner said as she recalled being cheered on by fans at her international debut at the 1991 Tokyo World Championships.

The stadium is sold out on most nights, and as of Friday evening, nearly 500,000 tickets have been sold for the nine-day event featuring more than 2,000 athletes from 200 countries.
“This will be an athletics display of the ages,” World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said at Friday’s press conference, highlighting Usain Bolt’s presence at the World Athletics Ultimate Championships countdown party a day earlier.
“Sports have the unique ability to touch the hearts, minds and lives of young people.”
A Covid-delayed, spectator-less Olympics pushed World Athletics and the athletes to become more creative, better connected and grasp the use of advanced technology. “The athletes came back stronger, more mentally resilient,” Coe said.
He also defended World Athletics’ decision to cap off the season with the championships rather than it being the crescendo amid a stacked Diamond League season.
When asked, Coe brushed off any downside to two big-ticket events like the men’s and women’s 100 metre being scheduled for the same night, saying “it’ll work well”.
Several Olympic champions are headlining day one of the championships. It’s almost a given that Sweden’s Armando Duplantis will win gold and break another world record — his own — in the men’s Pole Vault, although that much-awaited display will come later, as Saturday is just the qualifying round.
US’ Valerie Allman, Olympic champion in Paris, leads the field in the women’s discus throw, while countrymate Ryan Crouser makes his season’s debut in Tokyo after battling injury. Crouser is the world record holder in the men’s shot put, a three-time Olympic champion and two-time world champion, his accolades almost guaranteeing the US a medal in the event.
Yet another US superstar to take the spotlight — which he absolutely adores — is Noah Lyles. The 28-year-old showman is the Olympic and defending champion in the men’s 100m, but currently holds the third fastest time this year with 9.90. Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson is the world lead with a sensational 9.75 run at the Jamaican Championships this June.
USA’s Kenneth Bednarek isn’t too far behind with 9.79 at the US Championships last month. Lyles and Bednarek will renew their rivalry in the 100m after Bednarek shoved Lyles following a heated showdown at the USA Track and Field Championships.
The women’s 100m comes with its own set of year-long rivalry. US’ Melissa Jefferson-Wooden arrives undefeated this year with a 10.65, the same time that won teammate Sha’Carri Richardson gold in Budapest 2023.
Jamaican twins Tina and Tia Clayton have taken the sprinting world by storm this year. Unfortunately, only national champion Tina will compete in the 100m dash this year after Tia suffered an injury during the Jamaican trials.
Five-time world champion and sprint goddess Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce will be ending her career “on her own terms” after Tokyo, which marks her ninth world championships. The 38-year-old Jamaican is an eight-time Olympic medalist and undoubtedly considered one of the greatest sprinters of all time. She’s the third-fastest woman in the world, with a 10.60 clocked in 2021.
The women’s 400m will be anyone’s game. Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser comes in with a 48.67 world lead set in the Zurich Diamond League final last month, while Dominican sprinter Marileidy Paulino is the defending and Olympic champion with a 48.81 this season.
Hurdles superstar Sydney Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone is focusing on the 400m flat this time. The 26-year-old won the US title in 48.90 earlier this year, just 0.16 shy of her personal best.</p><small>2025-09-13 02:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/122258520985b92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941468/pakistan-open-asia-cup-with-thumping-93-run-win-over-oman' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan open Asia Cup with thumping 93-run win over Oman</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan beat Oman by 93 runs after electing to bat first in their opening Twenty20 International (T20I) encounter of the men’s Asia Cup 2025 in Dubai on Friday.
The Green Shirts will face India next on Sunday — the arch-rivals will clash in a geopolitically-charged contest in Dubai. It will be the first cricket match between the sides since four days of military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Player of the match Mohammad Haris top-scored with 66 of 43 deliveries after being sent at his preferred position of one down for a change after a string of failures down the order in the tri-series.
Oman restricted the Pakistani batters to 160-7 after the Green Shirts were 85-1 at the halfway mark of the first innings.
However, their batting reply fell apart against the quality of the Pakistani bowling attack — getting bowled out for a paltry 67 on a typical Dubai wicket.
Speaking after the match, skipper Salman Ali Agha said: “With the bat we still need to work [to improve], but the bowling was outstanding — I’m very happy with them as a bowling unit.”
Talking about the next match against India, Salman said that his side was playing good cricket and if they execute their plans they could beat any team.
 






Speaking at the post-match presser, Haris said the pitch played better than the Sharjah pitch as the ball spun less.
“I worked with the batting coach on my game, and am continuing to work on my calmness while batting and how to tackle spin,” he said.
Saim Ayub was the first to fall for the Green Team in the first innings when pacer Shah Faisal trapped him lbw on the third ball of the innings — the opening pair failing to get a good start again.
Opener Sahibzada Farhan was given a reprieve in the very next over when he was dropped at point off the bowling of left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed.
Haris went after spinner Aamir Kaleem in his very first over — taking 16 off the 6th over with two boundaries and a six as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 47-1.
Haris’s 50 came up with a huge six over the midwicket boundary off the bowling of Sufyan Mehmood — taking 32 deliveries to reach his second 50-plus score in T20Is.
Pakistan were 85-1 at the halfway mark of the innings, with both Haris and Farhan set at the crease on a pitch that did not spin prodigiously across both innings.
 






However, Kaleem got a chance at redemption when he caught Farhan in the very next over off his bowling — after dropping him earlier in the innings when he had scored only 2.
The left-arm spinner continued on his redemption arc as he got the well-set Haris and skipper Salman off consecutive deliveries in the 13th over.
Haris got bowled while attempting a switch hit off Kaleem, while Salman hit a full-toss straight to deep mid-wicket — the Pakistani skipper getting out for a golden duck.
Kaleem ended with figures of 3-31 and was ably supported by his fellow left-arm spinner Ahmed — who conceded just 17 runs of his quota of 4 overs.
The duo kept the Pakistani batters in check through the middle overs after the loss of Salman’s wicket.
Hassan Nawaz was the next man to fall for the Green Shirts as he got caught at the cover boundary off a slower ball by the Dir-born Faisal.
Player of the match in their win against Afghanistan — Mohammad Nawaz brought the momentum back to the Green Shirts’ innings — hitting 3 boundaries in the first five balls that he faced.
However, Oman’s bowlers did not let the match get away from their hands — keeping Pakistan from getting a huge total in the first innings.
Oman’s chase unravels
Oman lost their first wicket courtesy a carrom ball by Saim after he bowled the opposition captain Jatinder Singh in the second over of the innings.
After scoring multiple boundaries off Shaheen Afridi’s second over — first innings hero Kaleem got out lbw trying to sweep Saim in the 4th over.
Oman managed to reach 40-2 at the end of the powerplay, but after losing Mohammad Nadeem to what was essentially a bouncer by left-arm leg-spinner Sufyan Moqeem — their innings unravelled — getting bowled for 67 in 16.4 overs.
The Pakistan bowlers shared the wickets with Sufyan, Saim and Faheem picking up two wickets each.
 


Captain Salman, speaking at the toss, had said: “The team has been playing good cricket for the last two to three months and we will look to continue that form.”
There were no changes in the playing eleven from the team that won against Afghanistan.
The Green Shirts were clear favourites going into this encounter against Oman, who are ranked 20th in the International Cricket Council T20I rankings and last played competitive T20I matches more than six months ago in February — when they lost thrice in a row to the USA.
White-ball head coach Mike Hesson dismissed concerns about the national squad’s batting performance on Thursday ahead of the upcoming clash with India.
Questioned during a pre-match press conference in Dubai about the team’s batting performance and judgement, Hesson said he was “not quite sure” where the concerns were arising from, saying the team had played against the “best wrist spin attack” in the world and won by over 70 runs against Afghanistan in the tri-series final.
The eight-nation T20 tournament began on Tuesday with Afghanistan beating Hong Kong by 94 runs. India crushed the hosts, the UAE, by nine wickets on Wednesday.
Pakistan, India, Oman and UAE are in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh form Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four stage.
The top two teams will then play the September 28 final in Dubai.

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.
Earlier this week, the party announced moving a petition before the Supreme Court regarding her health. In a statement, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram claimed that prison authorities were obstructing Bushra Bibi’s treatment despite her deteriorating health in defiance of court orders.
Last month, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking Imran’s monthly medical examinations from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. It cited concerns over possible health complications for the 72-year-old founder of the party, who has reportedly lost weight during his detention.
In a post on X today, PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari said two formal urgent appeals were submitted to the UN special rapporteur on torture on Imran’s behalf by his sons — Sulaiman Khan and Kasim Khan — and on Bushra Bibi’s behalf by her sister.
 






A press release by international law firm Perseus Strategies said: “The filings request her to investigate their cases and press the Pakistani government to cease any further torture or ill-treatment of Mr and Mrs Khan immediately.”
 
 

It said the couple’s international legal team had previously secured a judgment from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UWGAD), finding Imran’s detention arbitrary, in violation of international law, politically motivated and calling for his immediate release.
“Both appeals detail a pattern of severe abuses in detention, including prolonged solitary confinement, physical abuse, denial of medical care, contaminated food and the persistent denial of access to legal counsel and family that together amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
“The filings emphasise that these acts violate Pakistan’s obligations under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and they urge the special rapporteur to act swiftly to protect the physical and mental integrity of Mr and Mrs Khan,” the press release said.
It pointed out that Imran now faced a “cumulative 14-year prison sentence on fabricated charges”.
It added that despite the UNWGAD’s finding that his detention was arbitrary and intended to bar him from political life, Imran remained imprisoned under “inhuman conditions”.
 
 

“Mr Khan is currently confined at Adiala Jail in a tiny isolation cell with no natural light, an open toilet under 24-hour CCTV surveillance, and has endured severe sleep deprivation, extreme heat due to power cuts, grossly inadequate food and water, and other harsh conditions. He is also held at times in solitary confinement for 22 hours or more a day with no access to exercise or meaningful human contact.
“Mrs Khan, the former first lady of Pakistan, has likewise been targeted with politically motivated charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. Since her detention in 2024, she has been subjected to conditions of detention that amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including being served food contaminated with hydrochloric acid, confinement in unsanitary and insect-infested cells, denial of medical care and long periods of isolation. Her imprisonment is part of a campaign to break both her and her husband, and to apply psychological pressure on Imran Khan by targeting his wife.”
The press release quoted Jared Genser, international counsel to the couple, as saying that neither of them should be in prison in the first place, “let alone be subjected to torture and ill treatment”.
He further said: “This combination of illegal detention and horrific mistreatment is intolerable under international law, and the United Nations and governments worldwide must act now to protect their rights and secure their release.”
 
 

The law firm said that Imran had received “international recognition for the abuses he is facing while imprisoned”, saying that Amnesty International had warned of health risks given his age and conditions, and the US State Department had publicly stressed the importance of ensuring his safety in custody.
The firm said the UN special rapporteur on torture reported to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and had the authority to intervene when credible allegations of torture were presented, adding that the mandate included communicating with governments to demand they respect the right to physical and mental integrity of detainees, conducting fact-finding visits and submitting reports to both the UNHRC and the UN General Assembly.
“The United Nations has already found Imran Khan’s detention to be arbitrary and Mrs Khan’s imprisonment rests on equally spurious charges.
“Their continued solitary confinement, denial of adequate medical care and exposure to contaminated food all violate Pakistan’s binding obligations under international law. The government of Pakistan should take immediate steps to release Mr and Mrs Khan and improve the conditions of detention for all those still detained,” the press release quoted Jacob Bogart, international counsel to the couple, as saying.
The law firm said that the continued “arbitrary detention” of Imran and Bushra Bibi “threatens to deepen social and political divisions at a time when Pakistan faces a myriad internal and external challenges”. It argued that their release was “imperative not only because of the grave injustices they face, but for the sake of Pakistan’s stability and democratic progress”.
The firm pleaded that the UN should not turn away from the case and “should instead stand with Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi and democracy in Pakistan”.
The press release also quoted Bukhari as saying that in the filing the urgent appeals, “we are making clear that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are not forgotten.
“They are enduring unlawful imprisonment and degrading treatment, but they remain symbols of courage and peaceful resistance. The world must not look away — silence only emboldens those who seek to crush democracy in Pakistan.”
Separately, Kasim said his father was in prison because “he stood up for democracy”.
Reiterating his previous concerns about his father’s state, he said Imran was “held in solitary confinement, denied access to his doctors and restricted from meeting his lawyers and family.
“At the same time, members of his family and thousands of his supporters have been abducted or dragged before military courts. This is not justice — it is political revenge.
“Pakistan’s democracy is at stake, and I call on all who believe in human rights and democracy to stand with us so that the people’s voice is heard and the rule of law is restored.”

The text was adopted by 142 votes in favour, 10 against — including Israel and key ally the United States — and 12 abstentions. It rebukes Hamas and demands that it surrender its weapons.
 






Although Israel has criticised UN bodies for nearly two years over their failure to rebuke Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, the declaration, presented by France and Saudi Arabia, leaves no ambiguity.
Formally called the New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, the text states that “Hamas must free all hostages” and that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) condemns “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians on October 7”.
It also calls for “collective action to end the war in Gaza, to achieve a just, peaceful and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the effective implementation of the two-state solution”.
The declaration, which was already endorsed by the Arab League and co-signed in July by 17 UN member states, including several Arab countries, also goes further than rebuking Hamas, seeking to fully excise it from a role in Gaza.
“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,” the declaration states.
 
 

The vote precedes an upcoming UN summit co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris on September 22 in New York, in which French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to formally recognise the Palestinian state.
‘Shield’ against criticism
“The fact that the General Assembly is finally backing a text that condemns Hamas directly is significant” even if “Israelis will say it is far too little, far too late”, Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“Now at least states supporting the Palestinians can rebuff Israeli accusations that they implicitly condone Hamas,” he said, adding that it “offers a shield against Israeli criticism”.
In addition to Macron, several other leaders have announced their intent to formally recognise the Palestinian state during the UN summit.
The gestures are seen as a means of increasing pressure on Israel to end the fighting in Gaza.
The New York Declaration includes discussion of a “deployment of a temporary international stabilisation mission” to the battered region under the mandate of the UN Security Council, aiming to support the Palestinian civilian population and facilitate security responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority.
Around three-quarters of the 193 UN member states recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed in 1988 by the exiled Palestinian leadership.
However, after two years of fighting have ravaged the Gaza Strip, in addition to expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the stated desire by Israeli officials to annex the territory, fears have been growing that the existence of an independent Palestinian state will soon become impossible.
Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,656 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
“We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Thursday.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, may be prevented from visiting New York for the UN summit after US authorities said they would deny him a visa.</p><small>2025-09-12 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12220519afa0ff9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941449/nepal-ex-chief-justice-sushila-karki-becomes-pm-after-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Nepal ex-chief justice Sushila Karki becomes PM after protests</strong></a><br><p>Nepal’s former chief justice Sushila Karki was sworn in on Friday to lead the transition as the country’s next prime minister after deadly anti-corruption protests ousted the government.
The 73-year-old Karki, Nepal’s first woman chief justice, was sworn into office by President Ram Chandra Paudel, after the previous prime minister quit on Tuesday as parliament was set ablaze.
“Congratulations! We wish you success, wish the country success,” Paudel said to Karki after the small ceremony in the presidential palace, attended by diplomats and some former leaders.
The Himalayan nation of 30 million people was plunged into chaos this week after security forces tried to crush rallies by young anti-corruption protesters.
At least 51 people were killed in the worst violence since the end of a civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.
The military took back control of the streets on Wednesday, enforcing a curfew.
The appointment of the judge, known for her independence, comes after two days of intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and Paudel, including with representatives from “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
Thousands of young activists had used the online app Discord to debate the next steps — and name Karki as their choice of next leader.
Karki, dressed in a red sari dress, took the oath but did not make a further speech. She smiled and bowed with her hands pressed together repeatedly in traditional greetings.
“It is a moment of victory … finally, the power vacuum has ended,” said Amrita Ban, a Gen Z protester.
“We did it,” key youth protest group Hami Nepal posted on Instagram, calling for unity.
“Honour the lives of those who sacrificed themselves for this moment”.

Presidential press adviser Kiran Pokharel told AFP that “a council of ministers will be formed after, and other processes will be taken from there”.
Known for her insistence on integrity, the 73-year-old has often spoken about the need for transparency and independence in a judiciary frequently under intense political pressure.
Karki emerged as the leading candidate by many “Gen Z” representatives — the loose umbrella title of the protest movement.
She told Nepali media that the Gen Z protesters had told her that “they believe in me” to lead for “a short time for the purpose of doing elections”.
“She is a credible choice to lead the interim government,” Anil Kumar Sinha, a former justice of the supreme court who worked with Karki, told AFP.
“Her integrity has never been in doubt, and she is not someone who can be intimidated or easily influenced. She is courageous and not swayed by pressure.”
‘In favour of youth’
In a speech broadcast on Nepali media earlier this year, she spoke of ingrained corruption.
“We see it everywhere but we don’t speak — now we need the youth to speak up, take the lead and stand in elections,” she said.
“What I have seen in the last 35 years does not work, I am 100 per cent in favour of youth coming forward.”
Her tenure as chief justice, from 2016 to 2017, was brief but significant — challenging gender stereotypes and facing down politicians over corruption.
Karki came of age in a society where women rarely entered the legal profession.
Born in 1952 in Biratnagar, an industrial town in eastern Nepal, she earned degrees in political science in India and in law in Kathmandu.
She began her career as a lawyer in 1979, and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless advocate, often taking up cases others avoided.
Defiant
In 2012, Karki was one of two presiding Supreme Court judges who jailed a serving government minister for corruption — a first at the time for Nepal in its battle against a culture of graft.
In 2017, the government tried to impeach her as chief justice after she overturned its choice for chief of police.
The United Nations called the impeachment “politically motivated” and the move was blocked. She stepped down from the post at her retirement.
Nepal emerged from a brutal decade-long Maoist insurgency in 2006, and in 2008, the end of the country’s 240-year-old Hindu monarchy.
The transformation to a federal state was marred by political infighting and successive governments have dragged their feet on bringing perpetrators of abuses committed during the civil war to justice.
But it was under Karki’s watch as chief justice that a court in 2017 sentenced three soldiers to 20 years in jail for the murder of a teenage girl, at the time only the second conviction for crimes committed during the war.
She will be Nepal’s first woman prime minister, but not its first woman leader — Bidya Devi Bhandari held the largely ceremonial role of president for two terms from 2015 to 2023.
‘Make a better Nepal’
The army patrolled the largely quiet streets of the capital, Kathmandu, for a third day today after the protests and nationwide chaos that included a mass breakout of prisoners.
“I was very afraid and stayed locked inside my home with family and didn’t leave,” said Naveen Kumar Das, a painter-decorator in his mid-40s. He was among many ordinary residents of Kathmandu who took advantage of a brief lifting of the curfew in the morning to stock up on supplies.
Food stores, tea stalls and pharmacies bustled with customers after people spent days inside.
“It was a really tense time and we just stayed indoors,” said Laxmi Thapa, 32, on a motorbike as her husband filled its fuel tank. “We came out as things have improved.”
At least 21 protesters were among those killed, mainly on Monday during a police crackdown on demonstrations against corruption and poor governance that was sparked by a ban on social media.
Protesters set the parliament, major government buildings and a Hilton Hotel on fire on Tuesday. KP Sharma Oli, 73, resigned as prime minister, and the army then took charge of the streets.
Nepal’s army said today that it had recovered more than 100 guns looted in the uprising, during which protesters were seen brandishing automatic rifles.
More than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails across the country during the chaos “are still at large”, police spokesman Binod Ghimire told AFP.

Protests fed into longstanding economic woes in Nepal, where more than two-fifths of people are aged between 16 and 40. A fifth of people aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447.
Discussions are still heated among Gen Z ranks as they seek a radical political transition. James Karki, 24, who was among the protesters, said he was hopeful for change.
“We started this movement so we could make a better Nepal,” he said. “And I am positive that the army will listen.“</p><small>2025-09-12 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/122007471d5a255.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941465/utah-man-suspected-in-charlie-kirk-murder-taken-into-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Utah man suspected in Charlie Kirk murder taken into custody</strong></a><br><p>A young Utah man suspected of killing influential United States conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university in the city of Orem was in custody on Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox told reporters.
“We got him,” Cox told reporters.
The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, had confessed to a family friend or “implied that he had committed the murder” to that friend and that person in turn had contacted the Washington County sheriff’s office on Thursday.
A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political recently and spoke in a disparaging manner about Kirk, Cox told reporters. Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after Kirk’s murder, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel said at the press conference.
Kirk, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single bullet as he spoke onstage at an outdoor amphitheatre at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.
Previously, US investigators said they had found the bolt-action rifle believed to have been used to kill Kirk and released images of a person of interest.
Investigators spoke to Robinson’s roommate, who showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord, a chat and streaming platform popular with gamers, discussing retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then leaving the rifle in a bush wrapped in a towel. This matched the description of the gun that authorities recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus.
Ammunition found at the scene had been inscribed, Cox said.

The messages on the casing included: “What’s this”; “Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao”; “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO” and “Hey fascist, catch!” Cox told reporters.
Trump earlier said that authorities had captured the suspect.
“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,” Trump said on Fox News programme ‘Fox and Friends’. “Everybody did a great job; we worked with the local police, the governor.”
The president claimed that the suspect was turned in “by somebody very close to him”, noting that the authorities had “very good pictures but not great, not perfect”.
“Somebody very close to him said, ‘Oh, it’s him’,” Trump said. “Essentially, they went to a US marshal, and the person involved was involved with law enforcement and a person of faith. The father convinced the son, ‘This is it’.”
 






Additionally, Trump backed a call by Cox to give the suspect the death penalty if the suspect is found guilty.
“This trial will start in two, three, [or] four years. In certain places that do it differently, they have what’s called ‘quick trial’. You have a fast trial and fast verdict,” the president said.
  @dawn.today A suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been taken into custody, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, ending an intense manhunt that followed what Trump described as a "heinous assassination." Kirk's killer had eluded police and federal agents for more than 24 hours after Wednesday's shooting, in which a sniper fired a single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, during an appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem. "I think we have him," Trump told the "Fox and Friends" show in an interview, adding that a person who knows the suspect had turned him in.

“If he’s guilty, we’ll need to keep him, feed him, take care of him … like for 50 years,” Trump added. “In Utah you have the death penalty. The governor … is very intent on the death penalty in this case, and he should be.”
The father-of-two used his audiences on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to build support for anti-immigration policies, outspoken Christianity and gun ownership, and to spread carefully edited clips of his interactions during debates at his many college events, according to AFP.
Kirk, a well-connected activist, author and podcast host, helped build support for Trump and the Republican Party among younger voters.
Kirk was the co-founder and president of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and appeared at Utah Valley on Wednesday as part of a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” of US college campuses. His killing stirred outrage and denunciations of political violence from Democrats, Republicans and foreign governments.
Kirk had 5.2 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio programme, ‘The Charlie Kirk Show’.
Additionally, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau warned on Thursday that Washington may take action against foreigners “praising, rationalising, or making light” of Kirk’s killing, adding he had directed consular officials to take appropriate action.
“In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said in a post on social media platform X.
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”

On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.
Today, he provided a clarification regarding the matter, saying that his words were presented “out of context”.
During the hearing of a case on a plea filed by a citizen named Abdul Jabbar — who sought the removal of his name from the Exit Control List — Justice Dogar addressed the matter, saying that Mazari was “just like a daughter” to him, and he was only explaining things to her yesterday.
“Being the chief justice and an elder, I was trying to make her understand.”
He went on to say that his remarks were presented out of context and “a storm brewed up”.
The IHC CJ maintained that during his exchange with Mazari, he had told her that she could disagree with his decisions, but she should have avoided making her criticism personal.
At one point, he reiterated: “I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights?”
Moreover, it has been reported that during yesterday’s exchange, Justice Dogar also addressed Mazari’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
However, he clarified today that he did not say anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari.
“I did not say that I will get hold of her, [but] this [reported remark] is being circulated since yesterday. Hadi sahib was standing [there], so I asked him to take her away or I would initiate contempt of court proceedings.”
Later, Chattha maintained in a post on X that the judge had in fact made the reported remarks.
 






He accused the judge of lying and misconduct before referring to Justice’s Dogar remarks from today’s hearing.
The IHC CJ said during today’s hearing that in case of contempt of court proceedings, Mazari’s career would suffer.
Reacting to that, Chattha said Justice Dogar was “not eligible to hold judicial office” and that he had held “the entire high court hostage”.
Mazari’s response
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, posted on X after yesterday’s hearing that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She added that her client’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
Following Justice Dogar’s clarification today, she again criticised him on X for making “sexist” remarks and accused him of harassing her.
“First, the chief justice misbehaved, harassed me at my workplace and threatened me openly in the court … Today again, he is passing sexist remarks.”
She asserted that she was neither his daughter nor a child. “I am a professional lawyer”.
 






Lawyers condemn
Multiple lawyers’ bodies also issued condemnatory statements today, with the  Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) demanding the removal of Justice Dogar from his post.
In a press release — which Mazari shared on X, thanking the association — the LHCBA said the body’s president, vice president and secretary “strongly condemn” Justice Dogar’s exchange with Mazari.
 






The statement said that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity was to be prioritised just as those of respected judges who were working within the bounds of law and the Constitution.
It added that Justice Dogar’s “dictatorial behaviour is a gross violation of the judge’s code of conduct and it is immensely important to keep any such judge away from court proceedings”.
The LHCBA urged the Supreme Judicial Council — the highest forum responsible for disciplinary proceedings against judges of the superior judiciary — to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also issued a statement saying that it “strongly condemns the highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
“The association notes with deep concern that instead of maintaining judicial dignity and impartiality, the chief justice resorted to derogatory remarks and threats of contempt proceedings against the counsel. Such behaviour undermines the sanctity of judicial forums, intimidates members of the bar and is contrary to principles of justice,” the statement read.
It emphasised that lawyers had the right to represent their clients “without fear or harassment, and any attempt to suppress this right cannot be tolerated”.
Expressing solidarity with Mazari, the KBA urged the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Supreme Court and Pakistan Bar Council to take notice of the incident.
“The judiciary must remain above personal remarks and coercive conduct; respect between bar and bench must always be mutual to protect the integrity of our justice system,” the KBA stressed.
 






The Balochistan Bar Council also issued a similar statement as the KBA, calling on the SJC to dismiss Justice Dogar from his post.
 






Separately, a group of female lawyers also became signatories to a condemnation of Justice Dogar’s remarks, terming them “sexist, threatening and unbecoming of a judge”.
The condemnatory statement said Justice Dogar’s remarks “reflect a deeply patriarchal attitude, and the threats are a source of concern. The purpose of contempt laws is to uphold the administration of justice, not for judges to hold a sword over the head of lawyers”.
