According to the World Bank, borrowing in foreign currencies exposes clients to the risk that debt and debt service payments (as measured in local currency) increase when the local currency depreciates. However, by converting to local currency, clients are able to address that risk.
The statement released by the central bank today said that the agreement, signed under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) framework, would enable the IFC to “manage currency risks more effectively” and increase its investments in Pakistani rupees.
“This is an important step towards unlocking financing for critical sectors of the economy and creating jobs across the country,” the SBP statement said.
 






It also quoted SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad as saying that promoting private sector growth in Pakistan was “paramount to successful, sustainable economic development of the country”.
He added that the partnership with the IFC was aimed at enhancing financing opportunities for the private sector.
John Gandolfo, IFC vice president and treasurer for treasury and mobilisation, said: “With currency volatility posing significant risks to developing economies, access to local currency financing has never been more important.”
He said promoting this type of financing was a “strategic priority” for the World Bank Group and a catalyst for economic growth in Pakistan.
The statement noted that exchange rate risks remain a major challenge for companies in developing economies that borrow in hard currencies such as the US dollar while earning revenue in local currencies.
“The IFC is committed to leveraging innovative financial instruments and strengthening partnerships to address the growing need for local currency financing in emerging markets. Through this partnership with IFC, the SBP aims to bolster economic resilience, promote private sector development and improve foreign exchange liquidity in Pakistan,” the statement said.
The development comes after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, during a week-long visit to Washington, discussed private sector investment, infrastructure financing, and development cooperation in meetings with senior officials of the IFC and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).
During his meeting with Riccardo Puliti, IFC regional vice president, the minister had highlighted Pakistan’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the importance of strengthening IFC’s partnership with the country.
“We value IFC’s role in scaling up private sector investment, particularly through multi-billion-dollar commitments under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework,“ he had said.
Both sides had agreed to work toward early financial closure of IFC’s flagship Reko Diq project, and the minister welcomed IFC’s new regional set-up, including a regional office in Islamabad, describing it as a “significant step to deepen collaboration and support sustainable investment in Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-10-20 11:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201522590eef26c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948885/financing-clean-air' target='_blank'><strong>FINANCING CLEAN AIR</strong></a><br><p>AWARENESS, action, the required funding for the said action, implementation, and, finally, the results of the said action — these are all very different things. A case in point is the air pollution in Pakistan. The air we breathe has been foul for decades. Among the earliest measurements of air pollution in Pakistan was a study conducted in Lahore in 1978, cited in the International Journal of Advances in Sustainable Development. The metric used was Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), a broader measure that predates today’s more precise focus on particulate matter. The study recorded an average SPM concentration of 332μg/m³ in Lahore’s commercial core — an extremely high level of particle pollution by any standard. And, yet, it is only in recent years that the idea of combatting the noxious air we all breathe has come into focus. For many of us, growing up, the extent of our knowledge was limited to ‘plant more trees’.
So, what exactly is wrong with the air we breathe? Before financing questions can be addressed, the pollutants themselves must be understood. As energy expert Ammar Habib Khan explains, it comes down to particles and gases — carbon, nitrogen oxides, or a toxic mix of both — released largely from two sources: industry and mobility. On the mobility side, poor quality fuel combines with aging, inefficient engines that churn out more smoke than power. Tackling this is squarely a regulatory issue. “Private capital will always chase the lowest-cost solution even if that means more pollution,” he points out. Industrial emissions are no different. Cleaner, lower-emission machinery can certainly be financed, but unless the state enforces environmental laws, there is little incentive for industries to switch.
Globally, too, outdoor air pollution has lagged as a priority. Climate change has been the popular currency for some time now, but outdoor air pollution remains massively underfunded compared to other development areas. Between 2018 and 2022, it received only one per cent (1pc) of international development funding, according to the Clean Air Fund. This underfunding persists despite air pollution being the largest environmental threat to public health worldwide, with severe health, climate and economic impacts.
In Pakistan, the problem may have continued to go unnoticed had Lahore’s smog not made an invisible threat visible. That visibility is part of what has spurred action today. In 2025, the World Bank extended a $300 million loan for Punjab’s Clean Air Programme, supporting the province’s Smog Mitigation Action Plan to strengthen air quality management and improve public health.

INCENTIVISING DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES TO FINANCE A PUBLIC GOOD THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO DIRECTLY ACCRUE BALANCE SHEET BENEFITS IS TRICKY. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT REALLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ANY MEANS.

But the scale of the challenge is enormous. Environmental expert Dr Kulsum Ahmed estimates that 128,000 lives are lost every year in Pakistan due to poor air quality, shaving 4.3 years off the average life expectancy. Air pollution, she stresses, does not discriminate between rich and poor: a recent study shows that the precautions taken by the rich, such as household air purifiers, have not saved them from catching airborne diseases. The very large number of hospitalised cases in Karachi testify to this.
Despite the magnitude of the problem, private finance has barely entered the picture. In 2021, only 5pc of Pakistan’s climate finance came from the private sector — far below the regional and global averages of around 49pc, according to the UN’s 2024 Climate Financing and Policy Recommendations.
This gap reflects not only the neglect of air pollution in global climate finance, but also the specific risks faced by investors in Pakistan: policy uncertainty, shifting subsidies and pricing mechanisms, and high foreign exchange risk given the mismatch between hard-currency investments and local-currency revenues. There is also a lack of education, data and investable use cases to give confidence to potential investors.
At the core lies a deeper paradox: clean air is a public good. There is little incentive for the private sector to finance solutions when benefits are dispersed and non-excludable. Khan argues that private capital can opt for targeted interventions in equipment to minimise pollution footprint, but without stricter fuel standards and tighter controls, technology shifts alone will not suffice. In other words, regulation is the missing piece — a theme that recurs throughout expert opinions.
This regulatory gap is confirmed by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC). For most companies, air quality management begins and ends with compliance, argues one of its reports. The lack of senior management involvement makes it clear that businesses still do not see dirty air as a financial risk. While onsite monitoring is carried out, there is little interest in how operations affect the wider airshed that communities actually breathe.
Nazish Shekha, Head of Initiative, Centre of Excellence in Responsible Business at PBC, highlights the hotspots: “Sometimes, it is as specific as a single roundabout or an intersection with too many traffic signals.” During rush hour, when cars idle longer, air quality dips sharply.
Construction adds another layer.
But beyond identifying causes, the bigger challenge remains structural: why should companies spend money fixing something that does not deliver direct shareholder returns? Yet, the impacts are already creeping into balance sheets — damaged facilities, eroded employee health, disrupted travel, etc. Smog in Punjab has even grounded flights and shut down motorways, delaying both goods and staff.
As urban residents in Pakistan become more aware of air quality through the availability of free data from monitoring platforms and weather updates, the private sector can potentially begin to be held liable for poor air quality onsite and in adjacent neighbourhoods. As a precursor to future financial risks, companies can begin following international guidelines for air quality and advocate for improved management in their supply chains, according to the PBC study.
Furthermore, investors have now become focused on certain aspects of Environmental-Social- Governance (ESG) approach with an increased emphasis on occupational health — not only workplace injuries, but the overall health of employees, both emotional and physical. A World Bank 2021 publication estimates that the global cost of health damages associated with exposure to air pollution is a whopping $8.1 trillion.
A somewhat dated report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that by 2060, the annual number of lost working days is projected to reach 3.7 billion globally. The 2016 OECD report had estimated the number of lost working days annually was around 1.2bn for the world at the time. In the long run, companies that voluntarily implement measures to improve air quality will benefit from a healthier workforce, according to the PBC report.
Even real estate offers a clue. From a valuation perspective, investment returns are higher on properties surrounded by parks and cleaner air. Subconsciously or not, markets are already signalling that cleaner air carries value, notes the PBC report. The question, then, is how to align public responsibility with private incentives. One way could be for the government to enforce strict regulations, but also reward early compliance. Tax incentives, for instance, could nudge companies to meet air quality benchmarks ahead of schedule — turning regulation into a financing opportunity, rather than just a compliance burden.
The economics make the case clear. A 2011 US Environmental Protection Agency report estimated that every $1 spent on improving air quality yields $30 in monetised benefits, mostly through health improvements. For Pakistan, where the pollution levels are much higher, it is possible the returns are proportionately higher as well. But incentivising domestic industries to finance a public good that will not directly accrue benefits is another story altogether.
There are precedents, though. In Bangladesh, where brick kilns, construction and vehicular emissions mirror Pakistan’s air pollution sources, the World Bank-backed Bangladesh Environmental Sustainability and Transformation (BEST) project is working to gather private capital. Central to this is a $170 million Green Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), financed by the World Bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), and private-sector contributions (around 70pc). The CGF supports investments in reducing emissions from brick kilns, improving waste management, and promoting rooftop solar.
For Pakistan, a similar model could be transformative. There are financial tools on the table that could help direct more money into clean air projects, but most remain underused. Green bonds, social bonds and results-based financing, for instance, could improve efficiency and draw in long-term private capital if deployed more strategically. As noted by the ‘State of Global Air Quality Funding 2023’ report, by sharing risk across governments, development partners and private investors, these instruments could unlock far greater investment in cleaner air.
Everyone breathes air. And there is a strong economic case for making sure it is clean.
Regulations and incentives can push private sector entities into policing themselves, but the proof is in the pudding — implementation of policies.

The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Today, petitioner Muhammad Akram Sheikh, one of the founding leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and its former president, presented his arguments in the case. Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi, a former Lahore High Court judge, also began his arguments. The hearing was adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail asked Sheikh whether he was appearing on behalf of other petitioners in the case, to which the senior advocate replied that he was only representing himself.
Justice Mandokhail noted that Sardar Latif Khosa was stated as Sheikh’s counsel, at which the lawyer sought the judges’ permission to present his own arguments, saying he had the right to do so.

Justice Aminuddin then asked Sheikh to apprise the bench of a “constitutional path to form a full court”.
“We are bound by our oath. So far, not a single lawyer has presented their arguments as per the Constitution. One sahib also said to keep the Constitution aside,” the judge remarked.
Upon Justice Aminuddin asking Sheikh what a full court meant in his opinion, the latter termed the question a “futile debate”.
Then, as opposed to the other requests made so far for a “pre-Amendment” full court, Sheikh sought a full court comprising “all 24” of the present SC judges.
“This Constitutional Bench cannot hear this case,” he asserted, at which Justice Aminuddin noted that the question was how to include a “non-Constitutional Bench judge” in the proceedings.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Are you saying that even if there are 24 judges, it should not be called a Constitutional Bench but the Supreme Court?”
Calling the 26th Amendment “controversial”, Sheikh said that none of the “dictators” had “dented” the Constitution as much as the 26th Amendment.
The lawyer contended that the CB judges had two roles at the moment, out of which one was “controversial”. “I hope that God gives you the courage to strike down this Amendment,” he said.
Sheikh argued that the current eight-member CB was not eligible to strike down the 26th Amendment as it was constituted under the same legislation.
He added that it was a set principle that a smaller bench could not reverse the ruling of a larger bench.
Here, Justice Mazhar remarked, “The matter is new now. The Constitutional Bench has been formed. Give arguments based on the new circumstances.
“You say that this Constitutional Bench cannot strike down the 26th Amendment as it would be a conflict of interest. On the other hand, you say that a full court comprising all 24 judges should be formed. Will that full court of all 24 judges not have a conflict of interest?” Justice Mazhar asked.
In February, six judges were elevated to the SC — namely Justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq, and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.
Justice Mandokhail also wondered whether having all 24 judges in the bench would mean that they would have the power to change an older decision.
Sheikh replied, “You yourself said that all Supreme Court judges may be nominated as members of the Constitutional Bench. […] I was glad that you have an all-inclusive approach. […] Whatever decision the Supreme Court will take, whatever collective wisdom of the honourable Supreme Court will prevail, that shall be acceptable.”
The ex-SCBA president further said, “There is an impression that the standard of the judiciary’s independence in Pakistan does not meet international standards.
“There was an election in our country. Some people thought that the election would be scrutinised. Then, a commission was made to prevent accountability, to prevent scrutiny. Background is relevant. […] As a result of which, this Constitutional Amendment came [into existence],” Sheikh claimed.
The lawyer recalled that he opposed the 18th Amendment in 2010 before the SC, because the advocate general and the law minister, being a part of the executive, should not have the right to vote in the JCP. He added that in 2015, India’s Supreme Court had struck down the 99th constitutional amendment, which aimed to give politicians and civil society a final say in appointing judges to higher courts, on a similar argument.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail told the lawyer to present his arguments on the Amendment later on, as first the CB had to decide which bench would hear the case.
“You keep talking about matters around the world, but haven’t said a word about the bench’s constitution,” Justice Aminuddin quipped.
Justice Mandokhail asked who would issue orders for the formation of a full court even if Sheikh’s argument that the CB could not hear the case was accepted.
Justice Hassan also questioned Sheikh about which bench had the power to strike down the 26th Amendment if the CB did not, to which the lawyer replied that the SC had to decide about the Amendment.
“Unless you prove that this bench is not eligible to hear the case, we cannot accept your request,” Justice Aminuddin remarked.
The bench then directed Sheikh to read out the Constitution’s Article 191A, under which the CBs in the apex court were introduced.
Justice Aminuddin remarked that some petitioners had asked the court to “refer” the matter ahead, while others had sought an “order”. Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Sheikh if he wanted the CB to issue an “order that the  Supreme Court hear the case”, the lawyer replied in the affirmative.
Sheikh reiterated his request for a full court comprising all 24 judges, and added that if “any judge had any unease or burden on their conscience”, they could recuse from hearing the case.
The lawyer also voiced his support for the arguments of Advocate Munir A. Malik, who represented the Balochistan High Court Bar Association.
“Can the parliament go against the salient features of the Constitution? Can the parliament abolish an organ of the state? Can the parliament go against the basic structure of the Constitution?” Sheikh asked.
 
 

Justice Hassan responded that these questions will be reviewed in the main case.
In his arguments, retired Justice Rizvi also requested that the SC, which is “made by combining Article 176 (constitution of SC) and Article 191A (CBs of the SC)”, hear the case.

Justice Aminuddin then asked how the CB could issue an order for the formation of a full court. Rizvi replied that the CB was a part of the SC even if it was formed under Article 191A, and like any other bench of the apex court, it could refer the case to the CJP or the Practice and Procedure Committee.
Justice Mandokhail then questioned: “Even if the Practice and Procedure Committee constituted a full court, what about Clause 3 of Article 191A, according to which no other bench [besides the CB] has the jurisdiction to hear constitutional cases?”
Rizvi responded, saying, “This is a matter of the independence of Pakistan’s judiciary; this bench will have to bear the pain.”
 
 

He contended that the judges in the CB were SC judges first and hence nominated for the CB, and that Articles 176 and 191A of the Constitution should be considered together.
Justice Mazhar remarked, “The Constitution is very clear that no bench other than the Constitutional Bench can hear constitutional matters.”
The retired judge again asked that the case be presented before the SC as constituted under Article 176.
Justice Ayesha asked Rizvi whether he was in favour of a bench as per the number of judges before the 26th Amendment or after it, with Justice Mazhar wondering the same. Rizvi replied that he had no objection to all 24 judges hearing the case.
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow (Tuesday).
The petitions
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, BHCBA’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have presented their arguments.
They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-20 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201406071178cda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950149/ihc-gives-police-3-days-to-recover-nccia-deputy-director-after-alleged-abduction' target='_blank'><strong>IHC gives police 3 days to recover NCCIA deputy director after alleged abduction</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday gave police a three-day ultimatum to recover the deputy director of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), who was allegedly abducted earlier this month.
The court issued the directives while presiding over the hearing of a plea filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband Muhammad Usman, who she has alleged was taken away by four armed individuals on October 14.
IHC Justice Muhammad Azam Khan heard the petition while Advocate Raja Rizwan Abbasi appeared in court on behalf of the wife.
During the hearing, the court directed that if police failed to recover the official within three days, the NCCIA central director and the Islamabad inspector general should appear in court in person.
Meanwhile, Abbasi told the court that he was unaware of the whereabouts of his client. “I don’t know where the petitioner is; I fear she may have also been abducted,” Abbasi told the court.
He added that the petitioner had called him saying she was being pressured to withdraw the petition.
“The petitioner’s husband was working on important cases and was kidnapped in a white Corolla,” the advocate said, adding that now the petitioner’s phone was also off and there had been no contact with her. He urged the court to summon the NCCIA director and Islamabad police chief.
Abbasi further contended that the CCTV footage showed that Usman was allegedly abducted in a vehicle which had a fake number plate.
To this, Justice Khan asked, “If the vehicle’s number plate is suspicious, how was it being driven around in Islamabad?”
He termed the situation a “very serious matter”, adding that there were checkpoints and CCTV cameras in the capital. He directed that calls being made to pressure the petitioner be traced using call data records.
Meanwhile, the assistant attorney general told the court that a case pertaining to the incident has been registered. He urged the court to give police time to carry out the investigation.
Petition
In the petition, Rozina had named the government of Pakistan via the interior ministry secretary, the NCCIA director general and NCCIA central director, the Islamabad police chief,  the sub-divisional police officer and station house officer of Shams Colony Police Station — where a case has been registered — and the state as respondents.
The petition, and a copy is available with Dawn.com, was filed through Advocate Abbasi under article 199 (Jurisdiction of High Court) of the Constitution.
Rozina contended that she had not received any call or message pertaining to her husband, adding that it was the “talk of the town that it is the malicious act of some of the state agencies who transgress their jurisdiction”.
The petitioner added that while the confinement and abduction of any individual was unlawful and created “some sense of insecurity”, for it to happen with a government official spread more fear and insecurity.
She pleaded that it was the responsibility of the Islamabad police chief, and the sub-divisional police officer and station house officer of Shams Colony Police Station to trace the whereabouts of her husband and set him free if he had not committed any offence or to produce him before a court if he had. She also said that she had filed an application at the Shams Police Station but no action had been taken thus far.
She urged the court to summon the interior secretary in person and direct him to adopt every possible endeavour for her husband’s recovery.
A first information report of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered at the Shams Colony Police Station on October 14 on Rozina’s complaint under section 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

The present
Pakistan’s targeted strikes on December 4, 2024 on the training camps of the self-styled Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the Birmal area of eastern Paktika province of Afghanistan have brought Afghanistan’s irredentist policy out in the open. The strikes came after a string of terrorist attacks by the TTP on Pakistan’s security forces. The TTP, an internationally designated terrorist group, is hosted by the self-declared Afghan Interim Government on Afghanistan’s soil. The AIG — described herein as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan (TTA) — has, despite multiple requests and démarches by Pakistan, refused to rein in the TTP.
The TTA’s strategy has been to alternately dismiss (a) Pakistan’s position that the TTP is using Afghanistan’s soil to mount attacks inside Pakistan, (b) claim that this is Pakistan’s internal affair and (c) ask Pakistan to talk to the TTP bilaterally.
TTA’s position is bogus on all counts but it is well thought-out from the group’s perspective. Two facts are known and obvious: the presence of the TTP on Afghanistan’s soil and the refusal by the TTA to act against the terrorist group. The presence is clear from statements by TTA leaders during Pakistan’s multiple attempts to get the TTA to deal with the TTP and by Pakistan’s own several rounds of official talks with the TTP held in Kabul during late 2021 and 2022.
TTP’s presence in Afghanistan and links with the TTA are also clear from reports by the United Nations’ Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, which has described the “link between the Taliban and both Al-Qaeda and the TTP” as “strong and symbiotic.” The report also says that “A range of terrorist groups have greater freedom of manoeuvre under the Taliban de facto authorities. They are making good use of this, and the threat of terrorism is rising in both Afghanistan and the region.”
In multiple meetings with Pakistani civil and military officials, the TTA leadership has acknowledged the presence of TTP leaders and fighters but expressed their inability to directly deal with them because of old bonds developed during the Afghan Taliban’s insurgency against the United States- led coalition. This is also borne out by the fact that when the talks initially began, the TTA assured Pakistan that if Islamabad were to talk to the TTP the TTA would facilitate the talks in good faith.
After August 15, 2021, when the TTA captured Kabul, Pakistan immediately moved to get the issue of the TTP sorted out with the TTA leadership. In the months following, the Haqqani Network (HN) fighters even clashed with and killed some TTP fighters and leaders (information based on interviews with some high-level officials). But even the HN leader Sirajuddin Haqqani insisted that Pakistan work out the problem amicably, citing TTP help during their struggle against the US-led invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Simultaneously, there was a power struggle among the TTA’s three main factions: the Haqqanis, the Kandaharis and the Helmandis. Another group, though less significant, can be loosely referred to as the non-Pakhtun Taliban in the north, from east to west. But let’s return to where the situation stands now.
Pakistan’s strikes have got the genie out of the bottle. Predictably, Afghanistan has condemned the strikes and the Afghan Foreign Ministry summoned Pakistan’s head of mission in Kabul to deliver a formal protest note to Islamabad.
But leaving aside these pro forma moves, two other developments are more important. Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, TTA’s Minister of Information and Culture, stated that the TTP were TTA’s “guests” and the TTA would not stop helping the group. Allied with this, the TTA Ministry of Defence put out statements (including on the social media site X), calling the Pakistan- Afghanistan border a “hypothetical line.” Earlier in January 2024, TTA Minister for Borders and Tribal Affairs, Mullah Noorullah Noori, had called the recognised international border an “imaginary line.”
This is the point where we return to how the TTA’s position, despite being bogus and fraudulent, is part of a thought-out strategy. Like previous Afghan entities governing Kabul, the TTA refuses to accept the legitimacy of the border. In the case of the TTA, however, the Pakhtun nationalism is also coloured by sectarian religiosity. This is facilitated by the near-free movement across the border of tribesmen and groups since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
TTP is TTA’s leverage against Pakistan. While the TTA leadership acted as a facilitator for the talks, it (TTA) continued to set the conditions through the TTP to pressure Pakistan. The talks were also meant to provide legitimacy to the TTP as a party vis-a-vis the Government of Pakistan. One central example should suffice: the TTP’s demand to reverse the merger of erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the return of TTP cadres to those territories and for Pakistan to have little-to-no administrative-legal control in those territories. In simple terms, the TTA, through the TTP, wanted to capture these territories — the first part of its salami-slicing tactic. Why?

The recent strikes by Pakistan on Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan sanctuaries inside Afghanistan have inflamed Afghan rhetoric once again about sovereignty. However the basic issue that keeps coming up, as it has for the past 77 years, is the issue of the Pak-Afghan border and Afghan efforts to delegitimise it. Ejaz Haider examines the history of the contested ‘Durand Line’ and its implications for Pakistan-Afghanistan relations and Pakistan’s security and foreign policy framework

This is where one has to go into history because as Jocasta, the mother and wife of Oedipus, says in Sophocles’ play Oedipus Rex, a man of sense must use his past experience to judge the present.
The past
Since the formation of Pakistan as a successor state to the Government of India, Afghanistan has wanted to “reclaim” Pakistani territory up to the east of Indus River, what’s described in geographical terms as cis-Indus. To be sure, Afghanistan’s state practice has been uneven with Kabul accepting the border at crucial points in Pakistan-Afghanistan history. But the irredentism has continued to lurk across decades, reminding one of T.S. Eliot’s lines from Burnt Norton: “What might have been is an abstraction/ Remaining a perpetual possibility/ Only in a world of speculation.”
I quote these lines not merely for embellishment but to indicate, as vehemently as one must do, that the existing international border is internationally recognised and undisputed. The Afghan idea of a border stretching to the western banks of the Indus River (and even parts of Balochistan) is an unfortunate abstraction that has done much harm, not only to Afghanistan itself but also Pakistan-Afghanistan relations.
The point of mentioning this history is to debunk Kabul’s claims and to point to the need for Pakistan to reformulate its Afghanistan policy. As should be obvious, the wheel has come full circle on the policy to get Kabul to accept the border, refrain from interfering in Pakistan’s western and northwestern districts through overt and covert actions and to keep the border soft to help the tribes on both sides through positive engagement. That, unfortunately, has not happened and Pakistan has had to take measures to curb movement because of continued Afghan mischief.
History and myth, especially religious mythology, can wreak much havoc on the peoples. The settler-colonialism of Zionists is an ongoing tragedy with its roots in a mythological past inflaming the present and singeing constructive future possibilities.

If pre-nation state histories were to determine present-day realities, there would be no Afghanistan pre-Ahmad Shah Abdali (Durrani) because this was an area contested among whoever ruled India, Central Asia and Iran. History did not begin in 1747. But even if we were to consider for the sake of our present argument that it did, the Durrani dynasty was gone in what 19th century lawyer and historian William Fraser-Tytler called “five and forty years.”

“[T]he Afghan people as a whole [had not] acquired that stability of purpose which would have enabled them to consolidate control of the vast dominions acquired by Ahmad Shah, or to found an enduring dynasty to replace the dying empire of the Moguls. Such a task was too great for a people who were still largely tribal, resembling in their composition rather the clans of the highlands of Scotland in ancient days…”
Fraser-Tytler knew. He was Scottish! But let’s get to an overview of the situation in the run-up to the Indian Subcontinent’s Partition.
With the Durrani dynasty losing out to the Barakzais (Muhammadzais) and its territorial reach reduced, there was much strife. Nor did the fall of the Durrani dynasty in 1818 bring about calm. It was not until 1826 that Dost Muhammad, the youngest of Painda Khan’s sons, finally prevailed over his brothers and lay claim to what remained of the Durrani empire. There was little left.
Writes Fraser-Tytler: “During the years of anarchy and of internecine strife, which had continued for upwards of a quarter of a century, one province after another had broken away from the central authority.” Sindh, Balochistan, the entire southern country from the Persian border to Ghazni and Balkh in the north had seceded.
Into this mix came a bigger problem: the Sikhs. In the later years of his rule, Ahmad Shah Durrani had resigned control of central Punjab to the Sikh Federation. During his grandson Zaman Shah’s reign the Sikhs killed the Afghan representative. The incident forced Zaman Shah to personally return to Punjab to re-establish his authority. He is also said to have tinkered with the idea of moving his seat of power from Kabul to Lahore. That didn’t happen because his tribal chieftains didn’t want to leave Kabul. He then chose to have a Sikh governor in Lahore rather than an Afghan plenipotentiary. Enters Ranjit Singh.

The canny Singh entrenched himself and began to take advantage of the growing weakness of the Durrani dynasty. By 1818, “he held all the northern Punjab between the Indus and the Sutlej.” Between 1820 and 1823 he chipped away at the Afghan possession west of Attock in the Battles of Attock and Nowshera. The Nowshera battle brought all of Peshawar valley under the Sikh rule. “While retaining his rights as suzerain of the country to the east of the Khyber Pass, [Ranjit Singh] entrusted the governorship of Peshawar to Sultan Muhammad Khan on the payment of a small tribute.”
By the time of the Battle of Jamrud between the forces of Ranjit Singh and Dost Mohammad in 1837, Dost, facing internal strife in his territories within Afghanistan, wanted British mediation between Afghanistan and the Sikh kingdom. This is why, despite having defeated the Sikh force, including killing Hari Singh Nalwa, the famous Sikh general, he did not venture towards Peshawar. The letter to Lord Auckland, who had recently arrived in India, “opened the door to British intervention in Central Asia.”
Dost Mohammad corresponded frequently with the British (the Library of Congress has multiple volumes on Dost Mohammad Khan’s life) and sought their intervention. He also signed two agreements with the British in March 1855 and January 1857, respectively. The texts of these agreements clearly indicate and confirm his acceptance of the existing frontiers between Afghanistan and British India. By then the Afghan frontier’s eastern outreach was Ali Masjid Fort at the entrance to Khyber Pass. The Frontier Corps now maintains a company-strength in the fort.
It is important to mention these agreements because they preceded the Durand Treaty of 1893 and clearly show that Afghan rule did not extend to the Indus River much before the 1893 Treaty was signed. If anything, there’s no indication after 1849 of an Afghan army setting foot anywhere near Peshawar. The 1857 agreement also stipulated 4,000 muskets and a monthly subsidy of 100,000 Indian rupees for Dost Mohammad Khan.
Another treaty which precedes the much-touted and maligned 1893 Treaty was the 1879 Treaty of Gandamak, following the first campaign of the second Anglo-Afghan War. Dost Mohammad’s son, Sher Ali Khan, fled after the British invaded Afghanistan and his son, Yaqub Khan, sued for peace.
According to Article 9 of the Treaty, Yaqub relinquished Afghan sovereignty over Sibi, Kurram and Pishin as assigned districts and also accepted British sovereignty over the “Khyber and Michni Passes, which lie between the Peshawur and Jellalabad Districts, and of all relations with the independent tribes of the territory directly connected with these Passes.” (Quote from the Treaty)
The peace treaty did not last long. The British mission led by Louis Cavagnari was massacred by some Afghan soldiers and the treaty got interred with their bodies. There are other details until the ascension to the Kabul throne of Abdul Rahman but those are not relevant to our purpose, except that Rahman was told that Kandahar would not be part of his dominion.
The British position in Kandahar became untenable after a British army was defeated in the Battle of Maiwind by Yaqub’s younger brother, Ayub Khan, who was the governor of Herat. Incidentally, Ayub Khan is considered a national hero in Afghanistan. He died in Lahore in 1914 and is buried in Peshawar. Another interesting bit is about how the Taliban used the reference to the Battle of Maiwind in their tarani [songs]. (See ‘The Battle of Maiwand and the Taliban’s Tarani’ by Roshan Noorzai.)
Durand Treaty 1893
It’s time to get to 1893. Rahman entered into a treaty with the British delimiting the Indo-Afghan frontier, and their respective “spheres of influence.” Maps were attached to the treaty and Amir Abdur Rahman relinquished Afghanistan’s sovereignty over the frontier districts of Bajaur, Swat, Chitral and Chagey. In the bargain he got Asmar, Kafiristan and the Birmal tract, areas over which Afghanistan had exercised almost no control previously. Further, the Government of India undertook to “increase by the sum of six lakhs of rupees a year the subsidy of twelve lakhs now granted to His Highness.”
Many Afghan writers and politicians make false claims that Afghanistan lost most of the territory between the Indus River and the Durand Line because of the Durand Treaty. That territory, as our historical overview shows, was lost three decades before the treaty between 1810s and 1870s. As Afghan academic Arwin Rahi argues, “In fact, through the Durand Treaty, Afghans would cede some territory to the British for the last time, not for the first time.”
The second false claim made by Afghans and many Indians is about a 100-year time-limit on the Durand Treaty. There is nothing in the text of the Treaty — available to anyone interested — which gives even a hint of a 100-year time-limit. Afghans claim that the text of the treaty given to Rahman had this clause. There’s no evidence of such a text.
Yet another claim made by the Afghans is that Rahman signed the treaty under duress. As British historian and barrister Bijan Omrani writes, “The negotiations lasted a month, and a stream of correspondence between Sir Mortimer Durand and the Government of India shows that there was a genuine process of negotiation over this period: the British conceded to the Government of Afghanistan that a number of areas should fall on the Afghan side of the Durand Line which they had originally wished to fall on the Indian side.”
Contemporary accounts suggest that even if Abdur Rahman had mixed feelings about the agreement, his assent was not brought about by duress, though one can make the point that in those days there were no international law provisions against annexation, which is also obvious from Afghans’ own forays into then-India and occupation of territories. Also, treaties were generally signed after territorial conquests. As the German jurist Lassa Oppenheim states, “Coercion in the signing of peace treaties ‘was a necessary corollary of the admissibility of war as an instrument for changing the existing law.’” (Quoted by Omrani from Oppenheim’s treatise, International Law.)
The 1893 frontiers under the treaty were also reaffirmed by Rahman’s son and successor Amir Habibullah in the 1905 Kabul Treaty, including accepting the Durand Line as the frontier with India. Interestingly or perhaps for our present purpose, ironically, it was a victory for Habibullah since the Government of India had sought more concessions from Habibullah after Rahman’s death and even stopped the subsidies to Kabul. After three months of negotiations with Louis Dane, Habibullah got his way with the arrangements under the 1893 Treaty. The Kabul Treaty was to be repudiated by Amanullah Khan in 1919, resulting in the third Anglo-Afghan War.
Resultantly, the treaty, signed in Rawalpindi, is short and curt. It not only got Amanullah to accept the border but under Article 5 stipulated “early demarcation by a British Commission of the un-demarcated portion of the line west of the Khyber, where the recent Afghan aggression took place, and to accept such boundary as the British Commission may lay down.” Articles 2 and 3 of the treaty also withdrew certain privileges to Afghanistan and the subsidy to the Amir.
The 1919 Treaty was followed by the 1921 Treaty in Kabul which also reaffirmed the previous arrangements regarding the border in addition to other matters related to trade and setting up of diplomatic missions etc. This treaty, however, has a withdrawal clause in Article XIV. It was nonetheless reaffirmed in 1930 by Mohammad Nadir, then monarch of Afghanistan. The situation stood as it were until 1949 when Kabul claimed that it had withdrawn from the 1921 Treaty, a step very different from irredentist claims made under the Durand Treaty.
And this brings us to 1947.
Post-independence past
Afghanistan cast a negative vote against Pakistan in September 1947, arguing that Pakistan’s northwest frontier “should not be recognised as a part of Pakistan until the [Pakhtuns] of that area had been given the opportunity to opt out for independence.” However, it withdrew the negative vote in October 1947 and both sides exchanged ambassadors in February 1948.
Zahir Shah sent his uncle, Sardar Shah Wali Khan, as ambassador to Karachi. Wali spoke Urdu and is said to have stated at one point that while Afghanistan might have had a claim on Pakhtun-majority areas of Pakistan, it would forgo such claims.
In reality, as American diplomat James Spain who had served in Pakistan noted, “Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have come to be centred on one issue.” That issue was Afghanistan’s demand for ‘Pashtunistan’ and Kabul’s repeated attempts to subvert the Pakhtun (and later the Baloch) through covert and overt actions.
The ‘Pashtunistan’ issue, couched in the right of self-determination for the Pakhtun, was actually irredentist. It was clear that if such an “independent” state were to actually come into being, it would not be able to survive and would be subsumed into Afghanistan, satisfying Kabul’s idea of Greater Afghanistan.
In a 1963 article for Asian Survey, titled ‘The Pak-Afghan Detente’, George Montagno, who served as a visiting professor of American history at the University of Karachi, wrote that Afghan agents operated among Pakhtun tribesmen for many years, distributing large amounts of money, ammunition and even transistor radios in an effort to sway loyalties from Pakistan to Afghanistan, and to develop sentiments for the ‘Pukhtoonistan’ cause.
Montagno also noted that Kabul had made no mention of including any Pashto-speaking areas of Afghanistan in a future ‘Pukhtoonistan’. This silence would indicate that the Afghan plea has probably been one “prompted by a veiled irredentism.”
It’s important to note that this article mentions a period of detente following the May 1963 Tehran agreement to normalise relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Relations had nosedived because Afghanistan’s prime minister and King Zahir Shah’s cousin, Sardar Muhammad Daoud, had sent an Afghan army into Bajaur in September 1960. It took Pakistan and Bajauri tribesmen an entire year to evict the Afghan elements. Daoud was a vocal opponent of the border and a hardliner on the issue of ‘Pashtunistan’. Pakistan had also challenged Afghanistan to hold a referendum in its own Pakhtun areas to see if the Afghan Pakhtun wanted to live in Afghanistan or join Pakistan.
There is a vast literature on how Kabul did everything to keep the border issue alive both through overt and, later, covert actions. This space does not allow for a full treatment but two points must be made: one, the negativity that mostly defined Pakistan-Afghanistan relations was the doing of Kabul; two, Pakistan’s Afghanistan policy, as indicated above, has been defined by Kabul’s irredentism and its linkages with India, Pakistan’s adversary in the east.
Sardar Daoud overthrows Zahir Shah
On 17 July 1973, Sardar Daoud ousted Zahir Shah and declared Afghanistan a republic. The putsch was bloodless and Daoud was supported by a large number of military officers. Daoud also revived the ‘Pashtunistan’ campaign and began supporting Pakhtun and Baloch separatists. At home, his campaign against conservatives led to purges and a number of future Afghan leaders fled to Pakistan. Some important names included Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Abdur Rab Rasul Sayyaf, Burhanuddin Rabbani, Ahmad Shah Massoud et al.
The late Maj Gen Naseerullah Babar, then a brigadier, was Inspector-General Frontier Corps. He apprised Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the situation. As Barnett Rubin notes in The Fragmentation of Afghanistan: State Formation and Collapse in the International System, “The influx of Islamist refugees after 1974 was a welcome opportunity [for the Bhutto government]… Pakistan covertly organised and supported the attempted uprising by the Islamists in 1975 which, together with pressure from the Shah [of Iran], had the desired effect of bringing Daoud to the bargaining table over his support for [Pakhtun] and [Baloch] separatism in Pakistan and other regional issues.”
In 1998, I interviewed the late Maj Gen Naseerullah Babar while writing a long report for the Regional Centre of Strategic Studies at Colombo. Babar told me — and this is corroborated by other writers — that these Afghan leaders were paid stipends through the Frontier Corps’ acquittance roll (British term for military payroll, a system then used by Pakistan and Indian armies). Babar had also arranged for a team of Special Services Group (SSG) to train the Afghan exiles in basic infantry tactics.
There was no involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. The arrangement, according to Babar, was only known to three other top officials in the system: Prime Minister Bhutto, foreign minister Aziz Ahmed and army chief Gen Tikka Khan. Later, in 1994, Babar was to play the role of facilitating the Taliban to open the southern route to Turkmenistan, though his claim that he created the Taliban was bogus.

It is clear from reports and analyses of the time and later that Pakistan’s policy of reverse-pressure on Daoud’s Afghanistan was not an attempt to meddle in Afghanistan’s internal affairs but to use Daoud’s troubles to get him to settle the border and end his irredentist policy.
To cut a long story short, for a number of reasons Daoud began moving away from the Soviet Union and towards the United States, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and Gulf states like Saudi Arabia. Books by Barnett Rubin, Diego Cordovez — then Under-Secretary General for Special Political Affairs who co-authored Out of Afghanistan with Selig Harrison — Angelo Rasanayagam, another United Nations diplomat who also served as the Director of UNHCR in Peshawar and many others note that Daoud had come round to putting an end to the “Durand Line” issue. [This was also corroborated to the writer years ago by the late Riaz Khokhar, former foreign secretary who was a young notetaker during Bhutto’s meeting with Daoud.]
Bhutto visited Kabul in June 1976 and Daoud visited Islamabad in August, indicating his willingness to accept the Durand Line as an international border in return for Bhutto’s undertaking to release the imprisoned National Awami Party leaders.
It is interesting to note that by 1975 Bhutto had also become wary of Soviet actions in West and South Asia. Bhutto’s three letters to the then US President Gerald Ford (June to August) are intriguing, especially the August 17 letter in which Bhutto, quite presciently, speaks of how the Kremlin was likely to focus on West and South Asia after the centre (Europe) was stabilised through the Helsinki Final Act signed on August 1, 1975. Bhutto’s argument was that “assured of security in Europe, the Soviet Union will relentlessly exert pressures on the smaller states of Asia and on Pakistan in particular, with a view to achieving its purpose of establishing an unchallengeable sphere of influence in this continent.” The text of these letters is available at the online Ford Library Museum.
Ford’s response basically ignored this point. The US would in about four years come to appreciate the developments that would lead to the Soviet tanks rolling south of Amu Darya.
What Bhutto was not counting on was a coup at home. The positive development with Daoud was, however, picked up by General Ziaul Haq after he removed Bhutto in July 1977. Zia latched on to the diplomatic push since he knew the outlines of the Bhutto-Daoud discussions and he had, ironically, opposed Bhutto’s decision to release the Baloch and Pakhtun leaders. After removing Bhutto, he pursued the latter’s policy and engaged Daoud, visiting Kabul in October 1977. Daoud had a reciprocal visit in March 1978.
Cordovez and Harrison write that when Daoud was asked at a farewell press conference “whether the Durand Line was discussed, he replied that ‘everything was discussed, and with the passage of time everything would fall in place.’”
The two writers also mention that Daoud had begun to mould public opinion at home and met Pakhtun and Baloch leaders who had taken refuge in Kabul and told them that “all of their eight thousand activists and guerrillas from Pakistan… should leave by April 30 [1978].” Cordovez and Harrison also quote the late Ajmal Khattak, a NAP/ANP leader, on this meeting and what Khattak said to Daoud about being “either a fool or a knave and we would not go [back to Pakistan].”
Denouement awaits
April 30 proved a date too far. Daoud and his family were murdered in a coup by officers belonging to the Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) on April 27, 1978. There were many reasons but the tipping point was the killing of Mir Akbar Khyber, a prominent Left intellectual belonging to the Parcham faction of PDPA and Daoud’s attempt to quell the protests and arrest PDPA leaders.
The PDPA took over. True to Afghanistan’s history, resistance by tribal solidarity groups emerged to central control and suppressive “reforms” by the communists. The situation got to a point where the USSR’s General Secretary of the Communist Party, Leonid Brezhnev, an emotive alcoholic with failing health, took the decision to get invited (read, invade) Afghanistan to stabilise the PDPA. On December 24, 1979, Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan. Just over a decade later, on February 15, 1989, the last Soviet military column crossed north to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.
That was the end of the communist misadventure. That was also the beginning of an entire era of new troubles for the region and Pakistan. Pakistan’s primary policy objective, the acceptance by Kabul of the international border, had earlier died with Daoud. Pakistan calculated that supporting the mujahideen would help settle the issue. That was a miscalculation. The Soviet withdrawal led to a civil war and the rise of the Taliban. Even Taliban 1.0 did not accept the border. Now the problem has recrudesced. While the border is recognised by the world, the western neighbour remains irredentist and, this time, also religiously charged.
The way forward
This space does not allow a full treatment of Pakistan’s current policy options. What should be obvious though, and urgent, is that the situation requires a thorough review of relations with Afghanistan and recourse to an array of non-kinetic and kinetic means.
This article has not gone into the international law perspective on the border for two reasons: the border is recognised and there’s no real need to revive a dead mule. Even so, at some point, Pakistan might have to underpin the need for kinetic action with recourse to recognised legalities.
For instance, the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties states that succession of states cannot impact (a) international border agreed upon in result of an agreement, and (b) rights and obligations concerning international border created through an agreement. This is also in line with the International Court of Justice judgments under what is referred to as uti possidetus juris [as you possess under the law], meaning new sovereign countries should inherit the borders of the dependent area as they were before gaining independence. Pakistan also has the right under animus occupandi, meaning Pakistan occupies and exercises sovereignty over the area and that is also reflected in state practice over seven decades.
Any policy review must also revisit the two prongs of counterterrorism action against the TTP — at home and in Afghanistan — and state action against the TTA where and when required. Both prongs would require their own detailed tactics and strategies.
But most importantly, a comprehensive policy review and its consistent implementation would require a constitutional compact within Pakistan, since facing the outside world prerequisites internal harmony.

Diwali is a colourful festival involving lighting candles, worship, celebrations and prayers. It is celebrated to mark the day when Lord Rama returned home after his 14-year exile. It is a five-day festival and during this time, houses are cleaned and windows are opened to welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.
According to Radio Pakistan, the president said that the festival of Diwali “reminds us of the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil”.
He noted that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights and complete freedom of religion to all citizens.
“Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah envisioned a Pakistan where minorities would enjoy equal rights and opportunities,” he added. Zardari also lauded the services of Hindu community in education, commerce, and public service.
 
 

In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended his “heartfelt greetings” to the Hindu community in Pakistan and around the world, wishing them a happy Diwali.
“As homes and hearts are illuminated with the light of Diwali, may this festival dispel darkness, foster harmony, and guide us all toward a future of peace, compassion, and shared prosperity,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
“The spirit of Diwali that embodies light over darkness, good over evil, and hope over despair inspires our collective resolve to overcome the challenges confronting our societies, from intolerance to inequality.”
He called on people to work together to ensure that all citizens could live in peace and contribute to progress, regardless of their faith or background.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also extended his warm greetings to the Hindu community and around the world, calling Diwali the “festival of lights, hope, and renewal”.
In a press release issued by Bilawal House Media Cell, Bilawal said Diwali reminded us that “light always triumphs over darkness, and truth, peace, and love prevail over hate and division”.
 
 

He reaffirmed that in line with the vision of his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto, and grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP remained committed to building a “progressive and inclusive Pakistan where all faiths coexist in dignity and harmony”.
The PPP MNA lauded the Hindu community’s “invaluable contributions to Pakistan’s cultural and national life and urged all citizens to embrace Diwali’s true spirit of compassion, unity, and hope”.
Bilawal expressed the hope that the Hindu community’s lives “shine brightly — like the lights of Diwali — with happiness, harmony, and prosperity”.
 






Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also extended greetings to the Hindu community.
According to state-run APP, they said in their separate messages that Diwali was a festival of joy, lights, peace, and love.
The two also emphasised promoting interfaith harmony.</p><small>2025-10-20 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201123186a2caf4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950137/anger-after-israeli-police-cancel-tel-aviv-derby-amid-chaotic-scenes' target='_blank'><strong>Anger after Israeli police cancel Tel Aviv derby amid chaotic scenes</strong></a><br><p>There was anger on Monday in Israel after police banned the Israeli Premier League’s Tel Aviv derby amid chaotic scenes, triggering complaints from the clubs and political opposition.
The crowd trouble at Sunday’s abandoned match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv comes amid tensions over a ban preventing Israeli fans from attending an upcoming Europa League away game against English side Aston Villa.
The match in Tel Aviv was called off after what a police spokesman described as “disorderly conduct, riots, the hurling of objects, smoke grenades, fireworks, injured officers and damage to the stadium infrastructure”.
Speaking to public broadcaster KAN, he said: “This is not a soccer game: this is severe disorder and violence.”
After the police order, the Bloomfield Stadium, the home ground for both teams, was evacuated, with police on horseback intervening to control the 30,000 fans.
Hapoel’s management was infuriated by the police decision and tactics.
“From the preliminary discussions before the game, it seemed that the police were preparing for a war rather than a sports event,” the club said in a statement published on social media.
“Everyone saw the harsh videos, children trampled by horses, police officers beating fans indiscriminately,” it said, accusing the police of taking over the sport and demanding football authorities regain control.
 






Opposition leader Yair Lapid also seized upon the incident to attack Israel’s far-right interior minister.
“To the endless list of failures of the incompetent minister Itamar Ben Gvir, tonight was added the inability to facilitate a soccer game in the State of Israel,” Lapid posted on social media.
 






Maccabi Tel Aviv was less outspoken. The club was already embroiled in disagreements over the upcoming match in Birmingham, where a local safety committee has tried to ban Israeli away fans from Aston Villa’s stadium.
The UK government is trying to reverse the ban, which has been criticised by Israeli ministers, the UEFA football governing body and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said: “We will not tolerate anti-Semitism on our streets. “</p><small>2025-10-20 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201218561db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950144/notices-issued-to-adiala-jail-superintendent-others-on-kp-cms-plea-seeking-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Notices issued to Adiala jail superintendent, others on KP CM’s plea seeking meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday removed the registrar’s objections on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s plea seeking a meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and issued notices to the Adiala jail superintendent and others for October 23.
Afridi had filed the plea on Oct 17, two days after he was sworn in as the provincial chief executive on Oct 15. He had gone to Adiala jail — where Imran has been imprisoned since September 2023 — after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court on Oct 16. However, he was denied the meeting; Afridi has stated that he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran. He had then filed a plea with the IHC, however, the registrar’s office had objected to the maintainability of the plea.
Today, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir took up the matter and overruled the objections of the registrar office.
Afridi’s lawyer Advocate Ali Bukhari said that the registrar’s office had raised the objection that the petition was filed “without the provincial cabinet and government’s decision”.
“This objection has no standing as the cabinet has not been constituted as yet,” he contended.
Subsequently, the court removed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, the Punjab Home Department secretary, the Punjab inspector general of prisons and the Adiala jail superintendent for Oct 23.
The petition filed by Afridi had contended that the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow a meeting with Imran, but no approval was granted.
The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Meanwhile, in its objections the IHC registrar’s office had noted that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.

Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Islamabad High Court had issued a notice to the Punjab inspector general of police. However, the notice has been issued to the Punjab inspector general of prisons. The error is regretted.</p><small>2025-10-20 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20124135dbb404f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939877/heavy-vehicles-are-killing-hundreds-in-karachi-why-does-no-one-seem-to-care' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy vehicles are killing hundreds in Karachi. Why does no one seem to care?</strong></a><br><p>At the far corner of a garage near Karachi’s Water Pump Chowrangi, two isolated trunks sit open, their stomachs half full with embroidered shalwar kameez, fancy sandals and henna. At the top are two boxes: a 62-piece dinner set and a six-piece bath set, with ‘Mahnoor’ scribbled on them with a pencil.
“This is the dowry we had been collecting for Mahnoor,” her uncle Zakir said. “We were to visit the groom’s house tomorrow to finalise the wedding date.”
But then, tragedy struck. On August 10, a wayward dumper truck, driven way above the allowed speed, crushed Mahnoor and her youngest sibling, leaving their father critically injured. Following the accident, a mob gathered and torched a total of seven dumpers in protest.
The garage at her house, which previously served as a stockroom for the 22-year-old’s upcoming wedding, has since been converted into a visiting area. Her father, Shakir, bandaged from head to toe, lay on a charpoy at the centre of the room. He drifted in and out of consciousness as a swarm of people surrounded him. When he is awake, all he talks about is the screams of his children moments before they were crushed by a dumper truck.
 

The dowry Shakir and his family collected for Mahnoor’s wedding.

“Mahnoor shouted ‘papa’ …  Ahmed screamed in shock,” the father, 47, cried. “When I looked back, neither of them was on the motorcycle … before I could register what happened, my bike lost balance,” he recalled. Shakir passed out on the road, which was almost deserted at 3am. He woke up at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where he found out that his youngest and eldest children were no more.
While he narrated the incident to Dawn.com, Shakir kept saying: “Main barbad hogaya (I am ruined)”. Beside him, Alishba and Hamza — the remaining two siblings who survived — wept profusely as the family’s elders moved forward to comfort their father.
Shakir’s loss is part of a much larger pattern — one that has claimed hundreds of lives in Karachi this year alone.
The city has witnessed a steep rise in traffic accidents over the last several months, particularly those involving heavy vehicles, such as dumper trucks and water tankers. According to official data, at least 538 people lost their lives in traffic accidents across the city during the first seven months of the year. The victims included 274 motorcyclists, 179 pedestrians, 51 women, and 68 children.

In the first half of this year, the numbers have significantly risen compared to 2024, when a total of 771 citizens were killed in 9,000 traffic accidents.
When tragedy strikes
Shakir’s two-storey house is a witness to the trend — in the last year, his family has lost four people, including children, to road accidents, particularly those caused by dumper trucks.
“Every time, a group of officials came to our house and left after making empty promises,” said Zakir, now the head of the house, as he instructed some boys seated nearby to make arrangements. The head of the Karachi Dumper Truck Association, along with the police and local leaders, was coming over to meet the barely conscious Shakir.
Soon, they arrived with an entourage of private guards and gathered around Shakir in a circle, hands raised as they prayed for the deceased. They offered condolences to Shakir, who did not open his eyes once in their presence.
When they left, Zakir told Dawn.com that the first information report of the accident had been registered by the state. “We no longer have a fight left inside us … we just want Shakir to recover,” he resigned. The FIR was not brought up again.

Shakir’s tragedy is not isolated — across Karachi, families like his have been torn apart by the city’s heavy vehicles, while others have narrowly escaped with their lives.
At Ali Zeeshan’s house, most of the conversations centre around the FIR and the “dumper mafia”. He and his wife are among those fortunate enough to have come out unscathed from an accident on Rashid Minhas Road earlier in February this year, when a dumper truck descending from the Jauhar Flyover hit multiple vehicles.
“At first, we thought an explosion had taken place nearby,” said Zeeshan, whose newly bought car, an MG SUV, was rammed from the rear by the dumper truck. “The second time it hit us, the windshield burst, airbags in my car flew open, and there was smoke everywhere,” he said. The couple was on the way to the airport to pick up a relative.
Zeeshan recounted that the first thing he told his wife was to get out of the car. “When I opened the door, I saw a pool of blood everywhere,” Faiza said. “As I got out, I saw a woman’s lifeless body in the middle of the road.”
A motorcycle and a rickshaw had been hit in the accident as well. Unfortunately, none of those aboard the two vehicles survived.
“There was a commotion in the area,” Zeeshan recalled to Dawn.com. “Scores of people had gathered at the accident site … some of them were filming videos of the incident, others were helping the injured.” So Faiza was sent home, and Zeeshan headed to the Sharea Faisal police station for a car fitness check and registration of an FIR.
By the time he came back home, he was tired and shaken, but more so, disappointed at the police apathy — the state registered the FIR, there was no compensation for his loss, and he was “actively discouraged” from pursuing the matter. “Aap jaise log kahan thaanon aur katcheri ke chakkar lagayen gain (people like you can’t keep going between the courts and police stations),” Zeeshan was told.
The dumper truck driver, on the other hand, was arrested a week after the incident and subsequently granted bail.
‘Just an accident’
Unlike Shakir, Zeeshan was fortunate to have remained unhurt in the accident, which took the lives of three people that day. “One can only imagine the agony of their families,” he sighed.
According to a 2018 World Health Organisation report, road accidents in Pakistan result in 14.3 deaths per 100,000 population. For Karachi’s 20.3 million population, this amounts to at least 2,800 fatalities annually. These are not just 2,800 funerals, but also 2,800 broken families whose entire lives have been upended.

But for the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, Karachi, these incidents are “just” accidents. “They are natural, they happen,” said Sardar Hameed, the body’s president. He had just got back to his one-room office in the Sohrab Goth area after a day-long hearing at the city court, on an accident that took place in Malir.
“They [the accidents] are not in control of the drivers,” he went on to add. “They are from God. We try our best, but it is out of our control.” Hameed insisted that dumper trucks were responsible for the least number of accidents in the city, claiming that the public’s attention was brought to them after “some people in power made irresponsible statements”.
“So now, the finger is just pointed at us,” he said, highlighting the recent incidents where citizens set dumper trucks on fire. “These accidents used to take place earlier as well…”
Yet, Hameed continued, the association has implemented a new set of rules for its vehicles and drivers, one of them being installing trackers inside the trucks to monitor their location and speed, which should be under the speed of 40km/hr — the data for which is collected in real time at the traffic police control room.
He explained that around 400 to 500 dumper trucks operate across Karachi every day, for two reasons: to deliver construction material (crush, sand, cement) and to dump garbage, the contract for which was given by the government. The men behind the steering wheels, who Hameed said hailed from all ethnicities, work shifts from 10pm to 6am, from which they earn Rs3,000 per day.
Earlier this year, the government imposed a ban on heavy vehicles after Karachiites took to the streets against the rise in fatal accidents caused by dumper trucks. Consequently, the government decided that heavy vehicles in the city would only operate at night. Initially, for two months, but later the order was extended.
However, dumper trucks are a common sight for commuters in the city throughout the day, which again raises the question of whether the government orders were actually implemented. “I got into the accident at around 5pm on a public holiday — Feb 5. We were coming down the busy Rashid Minhas Road flyover when it occurred,” recalled Zeeshan.
“The truck must have been at a speed of 50km/hr-60km/hr.”
He recollected how, after hitting his car, the truck driver tried to flee and, in the process of escaping with the vehicle, recklessly hit more people. “What were these trucks doing there during peak traffic hours? Why didn’t the police stop them? Do these drivers even know how to drive?” Zeeshan questioned.
Dawn.com made several attempts to contact Traffic Police DIG Pir Muhammad Shah to get answers to some of these questions, but failed to get a response.
Money for blood
For his part, Hameed said all dumper truck drivers hold a heavy transport vehicle driving license, which was why they were able to secure bail in case of an accident. In such a scenario, when the driver possesses a driving license, the case may be dealt with under Section 322 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The law states: Whoever commits qatl bis-sabab shall be liable to diyat. A person is said to commit qatl bis-sabab when they, without any intention, cause death or harm to another person.
The person who commits such an offence is liable to diyat, a form of compensatory punishment — a practice that is very common in the city. Case in point: when members of the dumper truck association visited Shakir’s residence, they announced a compensation of Rs500,000 for the grieving family.
 

Heavy vehicles parked outside the office of the dumper truck assocation in Sohrab Goth.

Meanwhile, when the driver causes an accident due to irresponsible driving, they are charged under Section 320 of the PPC — punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving. Per the law, any person who unintentionally causes a person’s death by rash or negligent driving shall be punished with imprisonment for a term that can extend to 10 years, in addition to paying diyat (blood money), taking into account the case’s specific facts and circumstances.
Drivers without a license are primarily charged under this section if their negligence leads to a fatality, alongside other relevant PPC sections.
However, the offence is bailable, and thus, the grief of hundreds of families who have lost their loved ones in these accidents rarely finds justice. Only recently did the government move to change that when, in August, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Interior approved a significant amendment, declaring Section 320 non-bailable in cases where a person dies due to reckless driving.
But the amendment is part of a proposed legislation — Criminal Law Amendment Bill 2024 — which is awaiting final approval and thus implementation. Until then, perpetrators charged under Section 320 of the PPC continue to secure bail.
The FIR registered for Zeeshan’s accident invoked the same section. “Within a few days of the incident, the driver’s family began reaching out to me, insistent that I forgive him in exchange for diyat,” he said. “But they weren’t even ready to pay half of the total cost of damages.”
There was back and forth for some days, but when Zeeshan refused to budge, they began harassing him and his family. “They visited my house at odd hours and kept tabs on my children,” he added. And so eventually, he decided to take a step back.
The practice of visiting the victim’s house is protocol for the association. As Hameed explained, “We try our best to be there for the bereaved families, so we visit them and offer a helping hand, whether through money or anything else.” There is a widespread sentiment among dumper truck drivers and owners of being wrongly “targeted” and “misunderstood”, both by the government and the people.
They lay the blame on motorcyclists and rickshaw drivers. “We are tired of them … they try to pass through even the tiniest of spaces, lose balance and crash,” said Zaman Khan, a dumper truck driver who came to Karachi from his hometown of Dera Ismail Khan in 1998. “I have been driving for at least the last 20 years, and not once have I gotten into an accident. But I have seen many, and in most of them, the motorcyclist is at fault.”
“Yet, we are the ones who are blamed, our vehicles are burnt down, and we are beaten up by the public,” Zaman told Dawn.com.
Hameed, the president of the dumper truck association, agreed, adding that illegal parking and encroachments on roads across the city were another factor contributing to traffic accidents. “Shops, garages, and showrooms sit on main arteries and cars are parked right in the middle of the roads … so if we are driving at the speed of 40km/hr, even abrupt brakes cannot save us from an accident.”
Here, he pointed out, it was the responsibility of the government to enforce adherence to the law.
Dawn.com also reached out to Sindh Minister for Transport Sharjeel Inam Memon, but he did not respond to requests for comment.
However, during a Sindh Assembly session held after public outrage over Shakir’s accident grew, Memon said that only the dumpers equipped with trackers and cameras would be allowed to enter the metropolis, and the complete record and licence of every driver, regardless of which city they came from, would be checked.
More than just rash driving
On the flip side, experts say Karachi’s traffic chaos is rooted not only in reckless driving but also in systemic failures — neglected road infrastructure, weak enforcement, and mismanaged traffic flow.
At a dialogue, titled “Traffic and Transport Issues in Karachi — Proposed Solutions”, organised by the Concerned Citizens Alliance (CCA) earlier this year, architect and urban planner Arif Hasan said all these issues were part of a larger cultural attitude “sab chalta hai [everything works]” which affects laws and their enforcement as well as the proper execution of projects.
He said there were no management and maintenance plans in place for Karachi and stressed that a special management system was needed to resolve traffic and transport issues in the metropolis.
According to senior academic and researcher Prof Dr Noman Ahmed, the primary issue behind the rising number of fatal accidents is the overall status of roads across the city. “The condition of most roads is such that there are potholes at every corner and the asphalt is uneven, which is hindering the routine operations of heavy vehicles.”

He explained that asphalt played a key role in creating friction during contact with the tyre, so the better the asphalt, the stronger the brakes. Such anomalies are prevalent on major arteries across the city, raising questions regarding their maintenance and operability.
Then there are some main thoroughfares where a different set of challenges occurs, such as the University Road and Shahrah-i-Sher Shah Suri, located in the North Nazimabad town, where major projects — Green and Red Line — have been under construction for years now. This has left the roads in a state of perpetual disrepair. The NIPA flyover and Civic Centre traffic sections are another two visible examples.
Residents and urban planners alike point out that Karachi’s road problems are persistent, with poor quality control ensuring that even new projects quickly deteriorate. “This is because we have very poor quality control,” Dr Noman pointed out. “Even when roads are reconstructed, they are back to a dilapidated state as soon as the first raindrop of the monsoon season drops.”
Secondly, there was a need to construct major arteries in a way that could sustain the everyday movement of heavy vehicles. This must also be implemented in neighbourhoods where construction work is underway because that is where most dumper trucks are headed.
For example, a lot of houses are being built in DHA Phase VIII, and so there are a lot of dumper trucks travelling in and out of the area to deliver gravel, sand and other materials. But the roads of these areas are not built in a way that they can withstand the daily movement of heavy vehicles.
 
 

Another big challenge in Karachi that Dr Noman highlighted was the lack of safety infrastructure on the city’s roads. “Leaving a few arteries, you may not find any road here with proper lane markings,” he said, explaining that these markings are essential for road safety because they guide drivers, cyclists and pedestrians while also improving traffic flow and helping to prevent accidents by providing clear instructions.
Hence, they are critical for navigation.
Similarly, we have plenty of traffic signals, but how many actually do work? “Most of them are made dysfunctional, and then a traffic constable takes their place, which creates more chaos because signals are synchronised and can be timed according to peak and off-peak hours.” They don’t just reduce human labour but are also efficient in traffic management.
Another problem is black spots — specific and limited stretches of roadway that have an unusually high frequency of road accidents due to poor road design or lack of surveillance. Many of these spots are found in District South, particularly DHA. Identifying and rectifying these spots is a crucial aspect of road safety management, involving detailed investigations to diagnose the causes and implement engineering solutions, said Dr Noman.
Misplaced speed breakers also contribute to accidents. “It has become quite a nightmare,” he said, referring to speed breakers built on main roads instead of neighbourhood lanes. “You don’t make speed breakers on main roads; they should instead be on secondary streets and neighbourhood lanes.”
For throughways, speed neutralisers can be used — they are very small speed breakers placed in quick succession. “So even if a vehicle is speeding, it will automatically slow down, and the neutralisers act as warnings. This won’t just protect the citizens but also their vehicles, whether big or small,” Dr Noman added.
Finding hope in a haystack
Karachi’s crumbling infrastructure — from broken roads to dilapidated buildings — is a daily reminder of systemic neglect. For residents like Lubna, Mahnoor and Ahmed’s mother, this neglect translates into constant grief. “Living in this city is akin to living in tragedy. All the time,” she said.
Experts, however, stress that solutions exist — if only the will to enforce them does.
 
 

“First of all, we have to undertake a kind of profiling and categorisation of heavy vehicles,” Dr Noman said. This involves looking at the number of heavy vehicles moving through Karachi and their destinations, which would help in their management. Once this happens, authorities would be able to find out which vehicles are used predominantly in the morning, and then they could be assigned specific routes.
These routes can thus be marked for commuters. What can also be done is that heavy vehicles involved in the functioning of daytime enterprises — such as dumper trucks carrying construction material or waste and water tankers — can be assigned out-of-city routes.
Then come the drivers, who must be given some kind of training. Hameed, the president of the dumper truck association, mentioned that drivers first have to spend three years as conductors, during which they learn the tricks of the trade. But formal training was still missing.
“A common observation is that when a heavy vehicle is loaded, it has a stipulated velocity at which it should be operated because the braking systems of the vehicle are affected by the weight it is carrying, especially when it climbs a slope and comes down from the bridge,” said Dr Noman.

Here comes engineering, because it teaches how vehicles have their own operational considerations. The driver should not just be limited to the brakes, clutch or the gear; they should also be aware of the vehicle’s vulnerabilities and critical areas.
Here, Dr Noman stressed, motorcyclists are also an important stakeholder because there are four million of them in Karachi and they are the most vulnerable to accidents. Shakir and his children, too, were on a motorcycle when they were hit.
“If you look at this figure, it would be very difficult to expect that all these motorcyclists would have received any kind of proper training about traffic rules and regulations.” And a chunk of this responsibility falls on the traffic police, which is slacking when it comes to proper surveillance.
“The biggest problem is that when they execute their regulatory checks, their emphasis is more on documents, based on which fines are imposed. But they are not looking at how big a crime is being committed. Ultimately, there is rarely any accountability,” the academic pointed out.
He suggested that cameras must be installed for road surveillance, and along with that, special attention should be paid to black spots, so that the physical arrangement of traffic can be improved.
“Without these changes, the fatalities from traffic accidents will continue to rise,” he warned.
Back in the garage at Shakir’s house, Mahnoor’s dinner set waits in its taped box. The FIR is filed, the association has offered Rs500,000, and the trucks still roll past Lucky One day in and day out. Until Karachi can slow them down, fix its roads and enforce its own rules, those boxes will keep outliving the people they were meant for.

The ceasefire was agreed early yesterday morning during talks between Afghan and Pakistani delegations in Doha with the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye. A next round of negotiations between the two sides is scheduled to be held in Istanbul on October 25.
A statement posted on the Saudi foreign ministry’s X account said it “expresses the kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s welcome of the signing by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan of an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries, during the round of negotiations held in Doha.”
 






“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security that achieves stability and prosperity for the brotherly peoples of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This kingdom hopes that this positive step will lead to an end to tensions on the border between the two countries,” the statement said.
Saudi Arabia — which signed a defence pact with Pakistan last month under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both —  also appreciated the “diplomatic efforts and constructive role” of Turkiye and Qatar in mediating the ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul.
Yesterday, Turkiye’s, Oman’s and Qatar’s foreign ministries had also issued statements welcoming the ceasefire.
Border clashes
The skirmishes on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan began on the night of October 11, when Afghan forces launched an attack on Pakistani border posts. According to the media affairs wing of the Pakistani military, its 23 troops were martyred in the clashes that continued into Oct 12 while over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants were killed.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Later, clashes again broke out on the night of Oct14 along the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram sector. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said
the Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khawarij — the term state has designated for the banned  terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack Pakistani border posts in the area but the attacks were effectively repulsed.
Subsequently on Oct 15, the ISPR said security forces had repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban.
However, the Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid alleged earlier in the day that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Later in the day, state media reported citing security sources that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghan capital Kabul and the province of Kandahar, targeting terrorists’ hideouts and leadership.
This was a little before a 48-hour ceasefire was announced between the two sides. Dawn reported that it was the second ceasefire between the neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. It quoted diplomatic insiders as saying that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
The ceasefire was extended on October 17.
While delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan were expected to meet in Doha for talks to end border hostilities, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Oct 17, according to a Dawn report.
It said incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
This development followed a gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan.
The border clashes had erupted against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, since the TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government and vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations.</p><small>2025-10-20 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201053431ec83e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950131/trump-vows-to-keep-massive-tariffs-on-india-until-russian-oil-imports-cease' target='_blank'><strong>Trump vows to keep ‘massive’ tariffs on India until Russian oil imports cease</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told him India will stop buying Russian oil, while warning that New Delhi would continue paying “massive” tariffs if it did not do so.
“I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India, and he said he’s not going to be doing the Russian oil thing,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Asked about India’s assertion that it was not aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump, Trump replied: “But if they want to say that, then they’ll just continue to pay massive tariffs, and they don’t want to do that.”
Russian oil has been one of the main irritants for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases.
The US government has said that petroleum revenue funds Russia’s war in Ukraine.
India has become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump on Wednesday said Modi had assured him that day that India would stop its Russian oil purchases.
 






India’s foreign ministry said it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the leaders that day, but said that New Delhi’s main concern was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer.”
A White House official said on Thursday that India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
The sources said Indian refiners already placed orders for November loading, including some slated for December arrival, so any cut may start showing up in December or January import numbers.
India’s imports of Russian oil are set to rise about 20pc this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, according to estimates from commodities data firm Kpler, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries.</p><small>2025-10-20 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20082547f481156.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950082/climate-change-support-surges-to-34pc-in-pakistan-world-bank-survey' target='_blank'><strong>Climate change support surges to 34pc in Pakistan: World Bank survey</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Climate change along with water and sanitation have become higher priorities in Pakistan, while perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors, according to the results of ‘Pakistan Country Opinion Survey for Pakistan’, commissioned by the World Bank.
The survey found that support for climate change initiatives increased from 5 per cent in fiscal year 2021 to 34pc in fiscal year 2025. Similarly, support for water and sanitation rose from 9pc to 35pc in the same period.
While the World Bank Group’s (WBG) work in pandemic preparedness, gender equity, and disaster risk management received the highest effectiveness ratings, the overall perception of its support has decreased significantly since 2021 in other areas, especially for governance, education, and water and sanitation.
In qualitative comments, respondents called for the WBG to deepen its local engagement in Pakistan, “moving beyond federal-level interactions to more meaningful collaboration at the grassroots, provincial, and community levels to better understand local needs and ensure effective implementation”.

Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors

The survey showed that financial resources were considered the WBG’s greatest value to Pakistan at 48pc, followed by knowledge products (33pc), technical assistance (32pc), and capacity development (24pc).
While ratings for many key performance indicators remained largely consistent with 2021 findings, the survey noted that the only rating to show a significant improvement was the perception of the WBG’s effectiveness in achieving development results in Pakistan.
More than half of respondents felt that the WBG has strengthened its work in improving people’s lives (52pc) and in being easy to work with (51pc).
Additionally, just under half believed the Bank has somewhat or significantly improved the technical quality of WBG-supported projects and partnered with others to increase development finance (49 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively).
A government institution respondent stated that “capacity building of the local stakeholders and impact assessment of the projects should be necessary in the project design”.
A parliamentarian suggested the WBG “develop people-to-people contact, and engage civil society along with the government for better results of project implementation.” The parliamentarian added that Parliament and local body members “must be taken in decision and implementation of projects”.
Collaboration with the national government received the highest ratings this year, but this perception has decreased significantly since fiscal year 2021. At the same time, perceptions of effective collaboration with civil society have improved significantly.
However, the group’s collaboration with the parliament and local government received relatively lower ratings, with stakeholders from the office of a parliamentarian giving some of the lowest ratings.
Respondents were most familiar with the WBG’s and the United Nations’ work among development institutions. The survey found the WBG to be one of the most trusted institutions in Pakistan, alongside the UN and the Asian Development Bank.
Significant differences emerged in how various groups perceive the WBG. Respondents from bilateral agencies and government institutions were more positive about WBG staff accessibility than those from the offices of parliamentarians, civil society, and academia.

Officials said a team of 60 investigators were working on the theory that the raid was planned and executed by an organised crime group.
In France, it reignited a row over the lack of security in France’s museums, which the new Interior Minister Laurent Nunez acknowledged on Sunday was a “major weak spot”.
The thieves arrived between 9:30 and 9:40am Sunday, shortly after the museum opened to the public at 9:00am, a source close to the investigation said.
They used a furniture hoist to get access to the Apollo Gallery, home to the royal collection, and cutting equipment to get in through a window and open the display cases.
A brief clip of the raid, apparently filmed on the phone of a visitor to the museum, was broadcast on French news channels.
The masked thieves stole nine 19th-century items of jewellery, one of which — the crown of the Empress Eugenie — was dropped and damaged as they made their escape.
Seven-minute raid
Eight “priceless” items of jewellery were stolen, the culture ministry said on Sunday. The list they released included an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife Empress Marie Louise.
Also stolen was a diadem that once belonged to the Empress Eugenie, which has nearly 2,000 diamonds; and a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France. It has eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, according to the Louvre’s website.
The whole raid took just seven minutes and was thought to have been carried out by an experienced team, possibly “foreigners”, said Nunez.
The intervention of the museum’s staff forced the thieves to flee, leaving behind some of the equipment used in the raid, said the culture ministry in a statement.
The loot would be impossible to sell on in its current state, said the president of the leading auctioneer Drouot Patrimoine, Alexandre Giquello.
National ‘humiliation’
It was the first theft from the Louvre since 1998, when a painting by Corot was stolen and never seen again.
Sunday’s raid relaunched a debate over what critics says is the poor security at the nation’s museums, far less secure than banks and increasingly targeted by thieves.
Last month, criminals broke into Paris’s Natural History Museum, making off with gold samples worth $700,000.
The same month, thieves stole two dishes and a vase from a museum in the central city of Limoges, the losses estimated at $7.6 million.
Sunday’s robbery sparked angry political reactions.
“How far will the disintegration of the state go?” said far-right National Rally party leader Jordan Bardella on social media, calling the theft “an unbearable humiliation for our country”.
President Emmanuel Macron said on social media that “everything is being done” to catch the perpetrators and recover the stolen treasures.

Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi has taken oath on October 15 but since then the provincial government has been functioning without cabinet.
He has said time and again that he would announce names of his team members with the consultation of Imran Khan.
 
 

On the second day of his oath-taking, Mr Afridi rushed to Adiala Jail to meet his incarcerated ‘boss’ and take instructions from him about future line of action but he was not allowed to meet him.

Provincial govt working without cabinet since Oct 15; participants of a recent party meeting say protest march on Islamabad to be ‘last option’ for Imran’s release

Sources in PTI told this scribe that some leaders of the party told Mr Afridi during a recent meeting that ‘corrupt’ ministers and ‘people with bad reputation’ should be kept away from the new cabinet.
The meeting was also attended by PTI provincial president MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, general secretary Ali Asghar, central leader and former speaker of National Assembly Asad Qaiser, MNAs Atif Khan and Shahram Tarakai and former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra.
Sources said that during the meeting, it was discussed that fair people should be inducted in the new cabinet.
It is pertinent to mention here that making frequent changes in the previous cabinets of the PTI governments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained its hallmark.
Recently ministers for elementary and secondary education department and public health engineering department resigned from Ali Amin Gandapur’s team while the ministers of several other departments were reshuffled.
Besides formation of new cabinet, sources said, the release of Imran Khan from jail and volatile law and order situation were also discussed in the meeting.
They said that the new chief minister and party leadership discussed in detail how to resolve the issue of law and order situation and bring peace in the province.
They said that they discussed in detail prospects about the release of Imran Khan. When asked whether PTI would march on Islamabad by the end of November, sources said that the date was not decided yet.
They said that protest march on Islamabad would be the last option with PTI and before the march, the party would take other steps for the release of Imran Khan.
Sources said that election of Sohail Afridi as chief minister was an indication to deal things with the federal government and powers that be with aggression. They said that all organisations of PTI were fully supporting their new chief minister.
In another development which took place on Sunday, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan directed general secretary Ali Asghar to issue show-cause notices to district presidents for not holding protest demonstrations against the alleged killing of workers of Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan. PTI founder Imran Khan had given the call to stage protest demonstrations at district level on Friday last.
Sources said that most of the district organisations of PTI staged protests while reportedly several of them did not obey the directives of Imran Khan.
A senior PTI leader told Dawn that strict action should be taken against such district presidents because holding demonstrations was not a big task rather the protest was peaceful and there were no probabilities of registration of FIRs and any other action against them by police or government.

• Officials say Ajrak-themed plates for those who applied in June are ready
• Claim over 50,000 plates lying uncollected at Civic Centre
KARACHI: As the deadline for vehicle owners to obtain new number plates draws near, those who applied months ago are thronging the Civic Centre to collect their retro-reflective plates, only to be returned disappointed due to a backlog of at least four months.
Many of these people had appl­ied months ago for the replacement of their old number plates with the new Ajrak-themed ones. However, they had to return empty-handed from the offices of the Excise and Taxation Depar­tment after being informed that their plates had not yet been delivered.
During visits to the Civic Centre and Executive Centre in Clifton, Dawn saw a large number of people arriving either to collect their number plates — those who had applied after January — or to complete the process of transfer of ownership.
Officials and visitors said the main reason for the rush was the deadline announced by the Excise Department, which expires on Oct 31.
However, if not extended, acco­rding to the department, both the buyer and seller will be required to appear in person at the centre for biometric verification to complete the transfer process.
An excise official told Dawn that number plates for vehicle owners who had applied for replacements by June have either been delivered to the respective centres or collected by vehicle owners. However, he said that over 50,000 plates were still lying uncollected at the Civic Centre.
“I had applied for the number plate in January but have come to collect it now,” said a vehicle owner waiting for his turn to collect new Ajrak-themed number plates at the centre.
He acknowledged that he had already received a message from the excise department, but only decided to obtain the plate after learning that the traffic police would begin issuing challans from the last week of October against vehicles not affixed with new number plates.
However, another vehicle owner, who had also come to collect his number plate, claimed that he had not received any message from the department. He said he was informed by a traffic police officer during a routine check that his number plate had already been delivered to the centre.
“I had applied two months ago for ownership transfer and for the replacement with the new Ajrak-featured plate, but while the file has been received, the number plate has still not arrived,” a vehicle owner said.
Number of applicants surges to 10,000: official
A senior official in the department told Dawn that number pla­t­es for those who had applied for replacements by June had already been delivered to the centres or collected by the respective vehicle owners. Without giving a specific time frame, he claimed that the remaining backlog would be cleared soon.
He also claimed there was no backlog in the issuance of Ajrak-featured number plates for newly registered vehicles.
The official said that while around 300 to 400 applications or receipts were being received daily initially, the number has now surged to over 10,000 per day. Complaining about the situation, he added that more than 50,000 plates remain uncollected, causing “space constraints at the centre”.
He further said that over 650 new Ajrak-featured number plates were being delivered to the centre daily.
Responding to a question about what applicants should do if their replacement plates have not yet been delivered, the official said they are required to visit the centre.
“If their number plates have not been delivered, a stamp reading ‘number plate not issued’ will be placed on their receipt,” he explained.

• Calls for ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI’s Kisaan Wing (PTI-KW) has urged the federal and provincial governments to prioritise the restoration of agriculture sector, which suffered large-scale devastation due to the recent floods across the country, calling for the immediate formulation of a ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’.
This demand was made through a unanimous resolution passed at the PTI-KW meeting held on Sunday. The meeting was chaired by PTI-KW Organiser and MNA Sheikh Waqqas Akram, and attended by Central Information Secretary Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich, PTI Kisan Wing Punjab President Major (R) Ghulam Sarwar, General Secretary Muhammad Ijaz Shafi, MNA Khurram Shahzad Virk and a number of office bearers from various farmers’ organisations.
 
 

Briefing the media after the meeting, PTI-KW spokesperson Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich expressed deep concerns over the authorities’ handling of the post-flood situation. He said the recent floods caused a large-scale destruction across the country, resulting in estimated losses exceeding Rs822 billion. “The federal government’s preliminary flood damage assessment report admitted this loss, but the actual losses could be even higher as a detailed post-disaster assessment is still underway”, he added.
Mr Sadhraich said the meeting expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s post-flood relief and rehabilitation measures, terming them “highly disappointing” for the affected people, particularly farmers. He noted the initial estimates put the losses in agriculture sector alone at around Rs430 billion, excluding livestock and damage to the canal system.
“With the Rabi season fast approaching, helpless farmers have no access to basic inputs for sowing their crops, while they are being offered a mere Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 as compensation against losses worth millions,” he said.
The meeting emphasised the urgent need for rebuilding the destroyed agricultural infrastructure and called on the government to give the matter top priority. It also stressed the immediate formulation of a National Agriculture Restoration Policy and the creation of a committee comprising senior government officials and farmers’ representatives to rebuild the country’s agricultural economy, Mr Sadhraich concluded.

• 95 bank accounts identified; parleys continue over fate of seminaries administered by the group
LAHORE: Authorities in Punjab claim to have traced the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the Muridke crackdown.
A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
The official said following the crackdown, several teams comprising senior officers from Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies had been tasked with tracking down the TLP chief and his brother.
He said Saad Rizvi and his brother were first spotted walking away from the protest camp in Muridke, and then fleeing on a motorbike.
At that time, an emergency message was circulated among the LEAs that a motorcycle rider carrying the TLP chief and his brother had moved towards nearby streets.
The three suspects, however, managed to dodge law enforcement personnel, any many rumours started to surface on social media regarding possible injury to them.
The officer said the special teams eventually traced the last location of the TLP leaders somewhere in AJK and sought the regional government’s help for their arrest.
It may be recalled that the Punjab government has formally sought the proscription of TLP and has sent a summary in this regard to the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Federal Inves­tigation Agency also traced nearly 95 bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi, the official said.
Of them, 15 were interest-bearing accounts, and the FIA was trying to get more details from the relevant banks to check the transactions made by the TLP chief, he added.
TLP seminaries
As a part of a wider crackdown on the radical outfit, the Punjab government also identified 61 seminaries run by the TLP across the province. The issue of these seminaries also came up during a meeting of Sunni clerics with the provincial authorities, as both sides discussed proposals about the fate of these institutions.
During the meeting, two proposals came under discussion to decide the future of these seminaries. It was suggested in the meeting that these seminaries be given under the administrative control of the Punjab Auqaf Department — this suggestion, however, was opposed by the majority of the participants who feared such a move would aggravate the situation. They said this action may create controversies in the future, particularly due to the huge financial expenses.
The second proposal pertained to handing over these seminaries to the moderate Sunni clerics – a move deemed workable. However, the authorities said in such a case, the clerics would run the TLP seminaries without the element of ‘militancy’. But a final decision on the fate of these seminaries is yet to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Multan district administration sealed 10 TLP seminaries and handed several over to the Auqaf department in line with the Punjab government’s orders. These seminaries were located in Multan, Shujabad, and Basti Malook.

• Urges overhaul of slow, debt-heavy climate finance system
ROME: Climate finance is being held back by bureaucracy rather than a lack of funds, Adviser to the Prime Minister Dr Syed Tauqir Shah told a global forum last week, stressing that frontline countries like Pakistan have been left struggling to access vital support.
Addressing the FAO’s Rome Water Dialogue, where he presented Pakistan’s national statement to an audience of leaders, ministers and civil society representatives, Dr Shah said, “Water crises are no longer an abstract policy discussion but an existential challenge for many countries in the Global South.”
 






He said Pakistan is among the wor­ld’s most climate-vulnerable nations and has now crossed the threshold into official water scarcity, with national food security threatened by extreme weather and chronic resource stress.
The crisis, he noted, manifests both as “devastating abundance” — the 2022 floods that affected over 33 million people, destroyed four million acres of crops and left 10 million without safe drinking water, with this year’s floods “equally catastrophic” — and as crippling scarcity, with total storage limited to about 30 days’ supply.
“Our need is clear and urgent: we require massive, timely investments in climate-resilient water infrastructure. This must be a mix of traditional, high-storage solutions alongside nature-based solutions like restoring floodplains, developing resilient irrigation techniques, and implementing watershed management,” he added.
Calling out the global climate finance institutions, Dr Tauqir said Pakistan requires an estimated $7-14 billion annually for adaptation efforts alone by 2030. “Yet, we are met with a global finance architecture that has turned the required investment into a paradox,” he said.
 
 

While building a case for reform of glo­bal climate finance institutions, he opined that the current global climate fund mechanism is characterised by critical failings that directly hamper our ability to invest and innovate in water resilience.
He said that despite the staggering national need, Pakistan has been unable to fully utilise available global climate funds because international criteria often demand highly specific, technically complex and “bankable” project proposals, requiring a level of institutional capacity that takes years to build.
He further highlighted that even once approved, funds are subject to slow disbursement rates and multi-year legal processes.
Criticising the climate finance modalities, Dr Shah said, “We find that the maximum available climate finance takes the form of debt and concessional loans, with only a small fraction available as grants.”
He lamented that debt is being loaded onto vulnerable economies that are already struggling with macroeconomic stability.
Citing the Green Climate Fund, he said the average time from concept to board approval is 24 months or more, and stressed that the first disbursement typically takes months after approval.
He referred to the GCF Independent Evaluation Unit’s finding that internal processes are “complex, fragmented and marked by bottlenecks”.
He said major climate funds are criticised by development experts for sluggish processing, excessive bureaucracy and disbursement delays.
“We call upon our global partners to shift the paradigm from an architecture of complexity and debt to one of speed and trust,” Dr Tauqir Shah said. “We need a financial innovation component which focuses on leveraging blended finance, green bonds, insurance mechanisms and incubation programmes to de-risk private investment and increase access to finance for smallholder farmers.”
While flagging the 2030 global development agenda, Dr Shah said, “The Sus­tainable Development Goals, especially SDG 6 (clean water) and SDG 2 (zero hunger), will remain beyond reach unless we confront this challenge head-on.”

Party officials said Pun­jab Chief Minister Mar­yam Nawaz also joined the meeting, where subjects such as the ongoing talks with Afgha­nistan, a crackdown against the TLP, as well as the forthcoming local government polls in Punjab also came under discussion.
According to reports, PM Shehbaz briefed his elder brother on the ongoing talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
During the meeting, Nawaz Sharif reaffirmed that “no one will be allowed to look at Pakistan with malicious intent”, adding that “Pakistan is our red line, and the sons of this nation are defending their motherland without regard for their own lives”.
Views were also excha­nged on the party’s strategy to ensure the victory of its candidates in the local government polls, following the Ele­ction Com­m­ission of Pak­istan’s decision to hold the long-delayed elections in December.
They said that as the first phase of the electoral exercise in which 9-member panels will be elected in each union council, will be party-less giving the winning candidates 30 days to join a political party of their preference, the meeting discussed holding the second phase of the polls in selected districts first where the PML-N has a strong following.
It was decided to take other party leaders onboard for selecting districts for the second phase of polls.
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met with Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the minister briefed the premier on the law and order situation in the country, as well as ongoing development projects in Islamabad.

• Remarks come as credit agencies, banks seek clarity on country’s security outlook
WASHINGTON: Cur­bing militancy is essential for financial stability, Fin­ance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said as he wrapped up a week-long visit to Washington.
Officials accompanying the minister to the World Bank and IMF annual meetings said the security-economy link surfaced repeatedly in many of the delegation’s 65 meetings during the seven-day visit.
“From credit rating agencies to commercial banks, everyone wanted to understand whether Pakistan’s security environment is now aligned with its economic recovery,” one official said.
In a media briefing, Mr Aurangzeb acknowledged that sustained stability and investor confidence depend on internal peace and political cohesion. “From a financial angle, this action is necessary,” he said, a rare admission that the country’s economic prospects are inseparable from its ability to curb extremism.
His remarks came at a time when Pakistan’s strategic significance is being increasingly recognised in world capitals. Under US President Donald Trump’s second term, Islamabad has regained Washington’s attention after years of estrangement.
 
 

Mr Trump’s unconventional approach has brought former adversaries into dialogue, and Pakistan has leveraged this moment adroitly.
Earlier this week, Mr Aurangzeb held an exclusive meeting with US Congressman French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee — the first time a Pakistani finance minister met the head of this key congressional panel.
Mr Aurangzeb used the meeting to stress the importance of enhancing economic ties between Pakistan and the US.
 






As the finance minister emphasised the link between geopolitics and economics, Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz told CNN that Pakistan’s ability to defend itself against a much larger adversary has impressed the US leader.
“Trump likes winners,” he said, noting that the US president sees the Pakistan army chief as “a winner who is willing to make quick decisions”.
That rapport, and the growing security cooperation — from rare earth exports to US arms sales — form a new strategic backdrop for Mr Aurangzeb’s economic diplomacy.
 
 

Michael Kugelman of the Asia Pacific Foundation added, “The current global moment does benefit Pakistan due to its geographic proximity to the Gulf and its close partnerships with key stakeholders there.”
Analysts say Washington’s renewed interest in Pakistan is shaped by both geopolitical convenience and economic opportunity.
Fiscal credibility
Against this evolving backdrop, Mr Aurangzeb’s Washington visit served to consolidate a narrative of fiscal stability and policy credibility. Pakistan’s credit ratings have improved, with Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global all upgrading their outlooks. The IMF’s recent staff-level agreement for a $1.2 billion disbursement further signalled institutional confidence in the country’s reform trajectory.
The IMF’s World Economic Outlook projected 3.6 per cent growth for FY2025, though it noted that the economic impact of this summer’s floods is still being assessed.
Still, global investors are beginning to return. Institutional funds, banks and advisory firms that had long viewed Pakistan as high-risk are reopening conversations — a shift attributed by senior officials to consistent fiscal signalling and a more stable security environment.
Privatisation
Mr Aurangzeb’s meetings with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) and JP Morgan reflected a focus on diversification and modernisation of Pakistan’s financing instruments. He briefed ADCB executives on the launch of the Panda Bond and the refreshing of the Global Medium-Term Note (GMTN) programme.
At a news briefing, the minister expressed optimism about the accelerated privatisation of the national carrier and disclosed that the government was close to achieving financial close on the Reko Diq project. He urged ADCB to expand its participation in Pakistan’s financial markets and trade flows.
At JP Morgan, Mr Aurangzeb discussed the forthcoming Green Panda Bond in China and the federal cabinet’s approval of the government-to-government sale of First Women Bank to a UAE conglomerate.
He also emphasised emerging digital cooperation with Saudi Arabia through the GO AI Hub and growing US interest in the Reko Diq mining venture.

The minister assurance came while presiding over a meeting to address the bottlenecks faced by meat exporters in exporting meat to Malaysia.
The meeting was attended by secretary of industries and production, Saif Anjum, along with representatives from both the public and private sectors.
The meeting discussed issues and recommendations related to meat exports to Malaysia. Exp­orters identified main challenges including feed quality, livestock breed, high production costs, lack of cold chain facilities, limited banking support, and documentation hurdles.
Exporters emphasised that the banking sector is not providing adequate support, forcing them to make cash payments in cattle markets. They also highlighted the absence of cold storage facilities at airports, compelling them to store meat in vehicles.
Representative of meat exporters pointed out that while India exports meat at USD 3.5 per kilogramme, Pakistan’s export cost stands at USD 5 per kilogramme. They further said that Pakistan currently exports meat to Taji­kistan at the same rate. The minister acknowledged the concerns raised by exporters and affirmed that Pakistani meat is of superior quality and capable of competing in international markets.

Police said in a statement that terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)  — tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance.
However, it added, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement using the “latest technology”. As a result, the statement said, the terrorists couldn’t come near the police station and fled.
According to police, “residents from nearby areas also fired at the attackers” and helped law enforcers.
The statement did not mention any loss of lives or property in the incident, which was earlier confirmed by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan. He told Dawn.com that the attackers had used a hand grenade to target the police station.
“Unidentified attackers threw a hand grenade toward the police station, but it fell at a distance, causing no damage,” he said.
The RPO added that the attackers fled after the attempt and a search operation to hunt them was under way.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Friday night, police intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.

The development comes against the backdrop of the Punjab government tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a restrictive permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid soaring prices and wheat shortage there.
According to the PMO statement, a high-level meeting was held yesterday (Saturday) to discuss the 2025-26 wheat policy. It was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The statement said a representative of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM was also present at the meeting while the Azad Jammu and Kashmir PM and relevant stakeholders also attended the meeting.
It quoted PM Shehbaz as saying that Pakistan was an agricultural economy, for which wheat was of key importance.
“Wheat is not just a staple food item for the people of Pakistan but also the biggest source of earning for the farmers of the country,” he said, adding that the government was well aware of the difficulties of the farmers.
He assured that the all possible efforts were being made for the welfare of the farmers, the PMO statement said, further stating that the premier termed farmers the “backbone of the economy”.
PM Shehbaz told the participants of the meeting that the the government had consulted all stakeholders, including provincial governments, farmers’ associations and industrialists, over the wheat policy.
“We appreciate the cooperation of the provinces for this policy based on consensus,” PM Shehbaz stated.
He said the policy was aimed at safeguarding people’s interests while ensuring profits for farmers and hoped that it would contribute to progress in the agriculture sector.
The PM asserted that the policy would result in an increase farmers’ incomes and play an important role in in ensuring food security in the country.
According to the PMO statement, the meeting was told under the new policy, the federal and provincial governments would be able to acquire “strategic reserves of about 6.2 million tonnes” from wheat harvest in 2025-26.
It added that wheat would be procured at Rs3,500 per maund (40 kilogrammes), in accordance with the international import price.
“This measure will ensure market competitiveness along with fair prices and profits for farmers,” the PMO statement said, citing the briefing given to the meeting.
It further stated that the national food security would head committee, which would oversee the policy’s implementation. It would include representatives from all provinces and and meet every week, the statement said, adding that it would directly report to the prime minister.
According to the statement, the meeting’s participants were assured that fair pricing would be ensured for farmers and the government would by sufficient stock to ensure their security as well as “stable reserves”.</p><small>2025-10-19 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1922520051acfad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949968/manchester-united-stretch-liverpool-losing-streak-to-four-games' target='_blank'><strong>Manchester United stretch Liverpool losing streak to four games</strong></a><br><p>Liverpool slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in 11 years as Manchester United won 2-1 on Sunday to end their near decade-long wait for victory at Anfield.
Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header secured back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time in Ruben Amorim’s tenure as United boss.
Twelve minutes from time, Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s opener after just 61 seconds.
Defeat leaves Liverpool four points adrift of Arsenal at the top of the table and Arne Slot still searching for answers in how to get the right blend after splashing out nearly £450 million ($604 million) on new players in the transfer market.
United close to within two points of their historic rivals and up to ninth in the table to ease the pressure on Amorim after his biggest win in nearly a year in charge.
Liverpool had only lost one of the previous 14 Premier League meetings between the sides and United had not tasted victory at Anfield since the early days of Jurgen Klopp’s reign in January 2016.
However, the Reds are in a state of flux after transforming the squad that stormed to the title last season and the tragic loss of Diogo Jota, who died in a car accident in July.
After three consecutive defeats for the first time in Slot’s reign, Liverpool could barely have imagined a worse start.
Mbeumo sped past Virgil van Dijk with ease before firing past Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo’s pass after barely a minute.
The home side and support were furious that play was not stopped in the build-up after Alexis MacAllister went down with a head injury, inflicted by his own captain Van Dijk.
Slot left £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench for the second consecutive game as he looked in vain to find the right balance between defence and attack.
Gakpo should have levelled for the defending champions when he hit the post from Mohamed Salah’s through ball in Liverpool’s one flowing move of the first half.
However, it was United who should have been further in front by half-time.
Bruno Fernandes spurned a glorious chance to double the Red Devils’ lead when he hit the outside of the post when unmarked from the edge of the area.
At the other end, Senne Lammens was rarely troubled in the first 45 minutes, but produced a big save when called upon to deny Alexander Isak his first Premier League goal since joining Liverpool for a British transfer record £125 million.
A Gakpo deflected cross then came back off the post and the Dutchman rattled the woodwork for a third time early in the second half.
Slot turned to his near £200 million in forward options off the bench as Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike were introduced on the hour mark to join Salah, Gakpo and Isak in a five-man attack.
Salah has scored more goals than any other player in this fixture, but his lack of form showed in a wild finish to slice wide with just Lammens to beat at the back post.
Liverpool’s wealth of attacking talent finally broke the door down when Federico Chiesa, who had replaced Isak moments earlier, drilled in a low cross that Gakpo converted from point blank range.
Yet, their defensive frailties meant parity only lasted six minutes as Maguire was left unmarked to head in Fernandes’s looping cross.
Gakpo should still have rescued a point when he headed wide with the goal gaping from Jeremie Frimpong’s inviting delivery.
But Liverpool fell to their first league defeat at Anfield in over a year in another blow to their hopes of usurping United with a record 21st English top-flight title.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191917017424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949953/lahore-ranks-second-most-polluted-city-in-world-in-terms-of-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ranks second most polluted city in world in terms of air quality</strong></a><br><p>Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality on Sunday, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI reading for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
 


Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were measured at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time last year, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘smog guns’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”</p><small>2025-10-19 15:46</small></div><hr>
