The alliance’s spokesperson said on Wednesday that the delegation would depart on a three-day visit to Lahore as part of the opposition’s “street mobilisation”. He said the TTAP leaders will organise “political and social meetings” in Lahore, adding that the politicians will also hold meetings at Zaman Park, Imran Khan’s residence in the provincial capital.
A post shared by the TTAP on X at around 11am said that the delegation, headed by the alliance’s head Mahmood Khan Achakzai, had left for Lahore.







At around 1:30pm, another post on the alliance‘s account said that the delegation had reached Jhelum. The post also had a video, in which TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbasi alleged that the people’s mandate in the 2024 elections had been stolen.
“There is economic exploitation now […] and the political crisis is intensifying. We have taken to the streets to end cruelty, […] for the fundamental rights of the people, for the poor, labouerers, unemployed and farmers and for all those who are oppressed,“ he said, standing alongside Achakzai.
The senator said the alliance would take to the streets against “cruelty” across the country on February 8.







Earlier, the alliance alleged that the Punjab police had arrested “several” PTI workers and had taken action against its camp in Rawalpindi’s Gujar Khan.
It also shared videos showing a police van from the Gujar Khan station and men in police attire carrying batons.







In a separate video before his departure to Lahore, Achakzai said, “We are not going to Lahore to conquer, curse at anyone or throw rocks at them; our slogan is that we are setting out to end oppression and cruelty.”
Achakzai, who has been nominated as the next opposition leader in the National Assembly, called on the public to stand with the opposition against a Parliament “thrust upon” Pakistan.
The TTAP chief stressed that the country was suffering from “endless issues because of ill-intended decisions”.
“The government itself knows that it is invalid,” Achakzai said.
“In this regard, the TTAP has appealed to people from all walks of life to protest on Feb 8 and come stand with us,” he said, calling on people to “close their shops, rickshaws, and taxis”.
“We are starting a peaceful movement and we are here to end oppression,” he reiterated.







Standing alongside Achakzai was the opposition leader of the Punjab Assembly, Moeen Qureshi, who extended his welcome to the TTAP chief.
“There are a lot of MPAs present here who will accompany Achakzai sahib to Lahore,” he said.
He warned Punjab authorities against treating the TTAP delegation the same way as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was treated during his visit to Lahore last month.
He also reiterated that the movement would be peaceful.
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik, in a post on X, welcomed the TTAP leaders to Lahore. She said that her party would accord a “grand welcome” to the guests at nine locations on GT Road.
“This peaceful struggle is a struggle for the Constitution and the law,” she wrote.







In a post on TTAP’s X account, the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai, termed the visit a “practice match for the larger movement”.
Yousafzai voiced optimism that the visit would give “hope to the PTI workers in Punjab”. The spokesperson also added that PTI leader Asad Qaiser would hold a press conference later today.







At a recent national conference organised by the TTAP alliance, KP CM Afridi had announced the observation of a “black day” at the national and international levels on Feb 8, which will mark the second anniversary of the general elections under which the existing parliament has been functioning.
The conference had also highlighted the need for a new Charter of Democracy — agreeing that the option of talks should never be closed — and put forth demands including an “independent” judiciary and election commission, as well as the release of “political prisoners”, which it believed were necessary for restoring stability in the country.
Meanwhile, as proposals for talks between the government and the opposition remain in limbo, a clique of politicians — under the banner of the ‘National Dialogue Committee’ (NDC) — on Wednesday called for the release of all political prisoners to reduce acrimony and pave the way for reconciliation.</p><small>2026-01-08 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08104947dbbfdab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965793/cdf-field-marshal-munir-emphasises-armys-zero-tolerance-policy-towards-threats-to-national-security' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir emphasises army’s zero-tolerance policy towards threats to national security</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Thursday emphasised the army’s zero-tolerance policy towards any threats to national security, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement said CDF Field Marshal Munir made the remarks while addressing officers during a visit to Lahore Garrison. He also reaffirmed the military’s resolve to respond to evolving challenges with professionalism and determination, it added.
“He said the armed forces remained committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal stability, while promoting discipline, excellence and selfless national service,” ISPR said.







During the visit, where he was received by the Lahore corps commander, CDF Field Marshal Munir was given a comprehensive briefing on the formation’s operational preparedness, training standards and key initiatives to enhance combat efficiency, it said.
The statement added that he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies, underscoring the army’s emphasis on innovation, adaptability to match the dynamic future battlefield”.
He also inspected sports and recreational facilities being provided to troops, highlighting their importance in maintaining physical fitness, morale, and overall well-being, it said.
CDF Field Marshal Munir also visited a care centre at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Lahore, lauding the efforts of the medical staff and administration in establishing a fully equipped, state-of-the-art healthcare facility, it added.
The CDF‘s remarks come after the military’s spokesperson stated that Afghan­istan had become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors, declaring the ruling Taliban “the mother organisation” which had been harbouring such groups since 2021.
In a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, he also spoke at length about souring relations with Afghanistan, the belligerence being witnessed from India, as well as levelling criticism against the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Imran Khan, without explicitly naming the latter.
Last month, the army’s top leadership had also warned political forces against undermining national unity through agitation or rhetoric, besides vowing to deal sternly with what it described as India-sponsored proxies involved in terrorism.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0813262663afa70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965807/when-people-stop-taking-weight-loss-drugs-they-pile-back-on-kilos-four-times-faster-than-they-would-after-ending-diet-study' target='_blank'><strong>When people stop taking weight-loss drugs, they pile back on kilos four times faster than they would after ending diet: study</strong></a><br><p>When people stop taking the new generation of weight-loss drugs, they pile back on the kilos four times faster than they would after ending diet and exercise regimes, new research found Thursday.
But this was mostly because they lost so much weight in the first place, according to the British researchers who conducted the largest and most up-to-date review of the subject.
A new generation of appetite-suppressing, injectable drugs called GLP-1 agonists have become immensely popular in the last few years, transforming the treatment for obesity and diabetes in many countries.They have been found to help people lose between 15-20 per cent of their body weight.“This all appears to be a good news story,” said Susan Jebb, a public health nutrition scientist at Oxford University and co-author of a new BMJ study.However, recent data has suggested that “around half of people discontinue these medications within a year,” she told a press conference.This might be because of common side effects such as nausea or the price — these drugs can cost over $1,000 a month in the US.So the researchers reviewed 37 studies looking at ceasing different weight-loss drugs, finding that participants regained around 0.4 kilograms a month.Six of the clinical trials involved semaglutide — the ingredient used in Novo Nordisk’s brands Ozempic and Wegovy — and tirzepatide used for Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound.While taking these two drugs, the trial participants lost an average of nearly 15 kilograms.However, after stopping the medication, they regained 10 kilograms within a year, which was the longest follow-up period available for these relatively new drugs.The researchers projected that the participants would return to their original weight in 18 months.Measurements of heart health, including blood pressure and cholesterol levels, also returned to their original levels after 1.4 years.People who were instead put on programmes that included diet and exercise – but not drugs – lost significantly less weight. However, it took an average of four years for them to regain their lost kilos.This meant that people taking the drugs regained their weight four times faster.
‘Starting point, not a cure’
“Greater weight loss tends to result in faster weight regain,” lead study author Sam West of Oxford University explained.But separate analysis showed that weight gain was “consistently faster after medication, regardless of the amount of weight lost in the first place,” he added.This could be because people who have learned to eat more healthily and exercise more often continue to do so even as they regain weight.Jebb emphasised that GLP-1 drugs “are a really valuable tool in obesity treatment — but obesity is a chronic relapsing condition.”
“One would expect that these treatments need to be continued for life, just in the same way as blood pressure medication,” Jebb said.If this were the case, it would impact how national health systems judge whether these drugs are cost-effective, the researchers emphasised.
“This new data makes it clear they are a starting point, not a cure,” said Garron Dodd, a metabolic neuroscience researcher at the University of Melbourne, not involved in the study.
“Sustainable treatment will likely require combination approaches, longer-term strategies, and therapies that reshape how the brain interprets energy balance, not just how much people eat,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0812440131752b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965804/in-meeting-with-air-chief-saudi-defence-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-promoting-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with air chief, Saudi defence leadership lauds Pakistan’s role in promoting regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s air chief met high-ranking Saudi defence officials, the military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday, adding that the latter appreciated Islamabad’s “constructive role” in promoting regional peace and stability.
A statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Pakistan Air Force Air (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu called on Royal Saudi Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Turki bin Bander bin Abdulaziz and Saudi Armed Forces’ Chief of General Staff General Fayiadh bin Hameed Al-Rowaily during a visit to the kingdom.
“During the meetings, matters pertaining to bilateral defence cooperation, regional security environment and future avenues of collaboration were discussed,” it said.
It added that the Saudi defence leadership “praised the professionalism, operational excellence and combat readiness of [the] PAF and expressed strong interest in enhanced joint training and operational collaboration, particularly in the domain of multi-domain operations“.
“They also appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability,” it added.
“Both sides expressed satisfaction over the existing level of cooperation and agreed to further enhance engagement through joint training, operational collaboration and exchange of professional expertise, while highlighting the Pakistan–KSA Defence Agreement as a symbol of mutual trust and enduring brotherly relations,” the statement added.
It said ACM Sidhu highlighted during the exchanges the “historic and fraternal ties between the two countries and reiterated his commitment to strengthening military-to-military cooperation through bilateral and multilateral exercises”.
He also underscored the transformation of the PAF into a robust multi-domain force, integrating space, cyber, electronic warfare and artificial intelligence capabilities, demonstrated through its operational performance.
It further stated that the ACM’s visit “underscores the depth of the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reflects the shared commitment of both nations to further strengthen cooperation in the defence and aviation sectors”.
The visit comes as reports emerge about talks between the two countries to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal.
A day ago, Reuters reported a source as saying that discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced by the former.
The report quoted another source as saying that the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.
“The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion,” the report stated.
The development was reported months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08125002589cd5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965805/direct-bangladesh-pakistan-flights-to-resume-after-14-years' target='_blank'><strong>Direct Bangladesh-Pakistan flights to resume after 14 years</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh and Pakistan are to resume direct flights after more than a decade, Dhaka’s national airline said on Thursday.
Biman Bangladesh Airlines is scheduled to fly its first Dhaka-Karachi flight on January 29 and will be operated twice weekly, the first regular flights since 2012.
“We are relaunching the Dhaka-Karachi route with two weekly flights,” airline manager Bosra Islam told AFP on Thursday.
“The resumption of direct flights will significantly improve connectivity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, supporting business travel, tourism, and family reunions,” Biman Bangladesh Airlines said in a statement.
Travellers between Bangladesh and Pakistan must currently use connecting flights through Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha.
Cargo ships had resumed sailing from Karachi to Bangladesh’s key port of Chittagong in November 2024.
Last month, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider had expressed the hope that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka would start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus.
Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly.
Recently, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq travelled to Dhaka for the funeral of the country’s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia in December.
In August 2025, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also visitd Dhaka and met Yunus.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/081021570c6d998.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965792/killing-of-woman-by-us-immigration-officer-sparks-protests-in-minneapolis' target='_blank'><strong>Killing of woman by US immigration officer sparks protests in Minneapolis</strong></a><br><p>A US immigration officer shot and killed an American woman on the streets of Minneapolis on Wednesday, leading to huge protests and outrage from local leaders who rejected White House claims she was a domestic terrorist.
The woman, identified in local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was hit at point blank range as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car, which they said was blocking their way.
Footage of the incident shows a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fire three times into the Honda SUV, which then hurtles out of control and smashes into stationary vehicles, as horrified onlookers hurl abuse at the federal officers.
Her bloodied body is then seen slumped in the crashed vehicle.
US President Donald Trump’s administration moved quickly to claim Good had been trying to kill the agents, an assertion Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called “bullsh**” and urged ICE to get out of his city.
Thousands of protesters took to the frigid streets of Minneapolis after the shooting, holding signs reading “ICE out of MPLS”, a common abbreviation for the city.

 

ICE’s federal agents have been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation drive, despite the objections of local officials.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment campaign last summer to add 10,000 additional ICE agents to the existing 6,000-strong contingent.
That sparked criticism that new officers in the field were insufficiently trained.
DHS chief Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but called the incident “domestic terrorism” and said Good “had been stalking and impeding (ICE’s) work all throughout the day”.
“She then proceeded to weaponise her vehicle,” she said.
Wednesday’s incident came during protest action against immigration enforcement in the southern part of Minneapolis, located in the midwestern state of Minnesota.
The Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, said on X the victim had tried to run over its officer who fired “defensive shots”.
Grisly scene
Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz called the federal government’s response to the incident “propaganda” and vowed his state would “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation”.
Witness Brandon Hewitt heard “three shots”.
“I got a bunch of video of them carrying the body to the ambulance,” he told MS NOW.
Another witness interviewed by local station FOX9 described a grisly scene.
“The surviving passenger got out of the car covered in blood,” the witness said.
He recounted seeing a man who identified himself as a doctor attempting to reach Good but being refused access by officers.
Anti-ICE protests
There have been passionate protests against immigration operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are “millions” of undocumented migrants.
The DHS called the violence a “direct consequence of constant attacks and demonisation of our officers”.
The officer who opened fire, who was released from the hospital following the incident, was rammed and dragged along a road by an anti-ICE protester in June, Noem said.
The victim’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that her daughter “was probably terrified”.
Good was “not part of anything like” challenging ICE officers, Ganger added.
Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas.
ICE — which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump — has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants.
US authorities said up to 2,000 officers were in Minneapolis for immigration sweeps.
A US immigration enforcement officer shot dead an undocumented immigrant in Chicago in September after federal authorities alleged the man tried to resist detention by driving his car into the official.</p><small>2026-01-08 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08120706e89d0f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965800/in-pictures-anger-in-us-over-womans-killing-by-immigration-officer' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Anger in US over woman’s killing by immigration officer</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of protesters took to the frigid streets of Minneapolis after a woman was shot dead by a US immigration officer on Wednesday.
The killing triggered widespread outrage, with city and state leaders rejecting White House claims that the victim was a domestic terrorist and calling for a full investigation.
The woman, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was shot at point-blank range as she apparently tried to drive away from ICE agents crowding around her car.
Opponents of Trump have called for protests in several American cities, raising the risk that the killing could become a national flashpoint over his deployment of federal officers to Democratic-led cities and states.

Let me give two answers here.
The first answer is that, in all honesty, the kind with hand on heart, nobody is really interested in solutions in Pakistan. They all just want to hear what they believe to be true. If you don’t tell them what they want to hear, they tune out. To some extent, this is the result of an algorithmically generated reality that more and more people are living in. Algorithms are very keenly tuned to what the user wants to see, hear, read or who the user wishes to interact with. They then serve this up and the user grows increasingly accustomed to receiving processed thoughts in easily digestible form that most closely approximate the user’s own preferences.
My experience is that when you tell people things they don’t want to hear, they either tune out, start arguing, interrupt with a stream-of-consciousness-style monologue of their own diagnosis and solutions or, especially seen among the young on social media, react viscerally, usually with hate, abuse, mockery and derision. This is the cognitive impairment of an algorithmically conditioned mind. People are losing the ability to engage with views different from their own.
Helpfully though, there are still enough people who don’t suffer from this syndrome that a meaningful conversation can be carried out. To those people I say my second thing: what problem are you trying to solve?

 

Whenever talking about solutions, it is critical to first have clarity on the problem, because the obvious question is, ‘solution to what?’ When it comes to the economy, for example, are we asking for a solution to the economy’s inability to earn foreign exchange in quantities sufficient to pay for its import requirements? Or are we asking for solutions to the inability to raise revenues in quantities sufficient to pay for the expenditure requirements of the state, without running up unsustainable levels of debt? Speaking of debt, is our envisioned solution to pay this debt down or to raise the state’s capacity to carry the burden of servicing this debt? Are we talking about how to pump growth, or how to bring about a kind of growth that is sustainable, and that lifts people out of poverty, creates opportunities for the young and, overall, secures the livelihoods of the citizenry?

When talking about solutions, it is critical to first have clarity on the problem.

I could go on but you get the point hopefully. You cannot answer ‘all of the above’, because then the solution becomes a philosophical one: we must learn to be better human beings first. We must root our power in the legitimate aspirations of the people before embarking on any transformative enterprise on a broad front. We must learn to respect the opposition, build consensus the hard way through structured dialogue, build institutions that discharge their obligations with vigour and rigour (pardon the flourish there, please) and, very importantly, that stay within the bounds they are designed for. For broad-based solutions, it is better to have a broad-based mandate.
In the absence of this, the ambition to solve Pakistan’s problems should remain confined to a narrow pragmatic corridor. And this would be my advice to those running the country: focus on a few things that can be done, where success carries the promise of cascading change, where known metrics for success can be developed.
There are two areas in particular where the focus can lie. Both are technology-based, and both promise cascading change across the economy as success rolls on. One is digital payments and the second is renewable energy, especially solar plus battery solutions.
Both of these areas have the potential to free the country from a long-standing problem that has been hobbling growth for decades. Digital payments can help document the economy. Solar can help free us from rising energy costs and the circular debt. In both areas, known performance metrics can easily be developed.
Here is an interesting statistic regarding digital payments: 90 per cent of retail transactions are being made via digital channels now, but these account for only 33pc of the total value of retail transactions. No doubt, there is rapid and growing adoption of digital payment channels. For example, in the first quarter of this year, close to Rs55 trillion were cleared via digital channels compared to Rs10tr via cheques and paper instruments. This shows growing adoption of digital payment channels, but most of the economy still remains stuck in old-fashioned cash.
The prime minister is trying to advance this process with a steering committee and some announcements about making Islamabad cashless. But the real challenge is at the retail level, and encouraging adoption there means making digital transfers faster, using QR codes, perhaps. Digital has displaced paper clearing, but has not made much of a dent in cash-based settlements. Once two-thirds of all retail transactions, by value, are being processed via digital channels, we will potentially have a different economy, with enough potential to unlock the next generation of business opportunities. Until then, it will still be a ‘general store’ model of the economy that we’ll be stuck with.
It is the same with solar plus battery. The first thing to do here is to ignore the bureaucrats’ ent­reaties to put the power system’s ‘fixed costs’ at the centre of their policy effort. Something along the lines of what was done with PIA needs to be done with the circular debt and the dead, white elephants we are carrying in the power sector. Phase them out and look to solar plus battery to power the future instead. Once freed from the grid, people’s entrepreneurial energies will take over, because with new forms of business enterprises that become possible with flexible energy generation and distribution systems that solar makes possible, the sky is the limit. Focus on the possible, and focus on those areas that carry a transformative potential. The rest works itself out.

The nervy hosts saw wickets tumble as they chased their 160 target, which they reached after lunch on day five with Cameron Green not out 22 and Alex Carey on 16.
“That’s Ashes cricket. Everyone got tense,” said Carey who hit the winning runs.
“Usman is going to be missed. A great career and a great way to finish.”
Australia lost openers Travis Head (29) and Jake Weatherald (34), along with captain Steve Smith (12) and Khawaja who made six in his final knock before retirement.

         View this post on Instagram            

“It means a lot. So much has gone into it. The only thing I wanted was a win, as much as I wanted to hit the winning runs,” said Khawaja, who was almost in tears as he walked off to a standing ovation after being bowled by Josh Tongue.
“The whole Test match I found it hard to control my emotions,” Khawaja added after his 88th and final appearance on the Test stage.
“I’m grateful I’ve had the career I’ve had. I have full gratitude,” he said, adding that Australia were relieved to have got over the winning line.
“It definitely got a bit too tight. You never count your chickens. We got the job done though.”
Marnus Labuschagne, dropped on 20, compiled 37 before needlessly running himself out to give Ben Stokes’s men a flicker of hope as they reduced Australia to 121-5.
But victory was never seriously in doubt after England were dismissed for 342 on the back of Jacob Bethell’s stylish 154.
England horror show
Defeat ended a long tour for the visitors that quickly turned into a horror show when they lost the opening two Tests in Perth and Brisbane by eight wickets and the third at Adelaide by 82 runs.
Stokes’s side had arrived confident they could win their first series in Australia since 2010-11 amid taunts about the hosts having their worst side in 15 years.
Facing heavy criticism over their preparations, discipline and ultra-aggressive “Bazball” style of cricket, they rallied to pull off a stunning four-wicket comeback win in the fourth Test in Melbourne.
It was their first victory in 18 Tests on Australian soil and restored some pride, but another loss in Sydney, albeit close, will see them face a tough inquisition on their return home with coach Brendon McCullum’s job on the line.
Australia achieved their success despite being without pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood for the series and Pat Cummins for all but one Test, while veteran spin king Nathan Lyon played a limited role.
Nearly 860,000 fans watched the series with a record 211,032 through the turnstiles in Sydney.
Tempers flare
Tempers flared earlier when Weatherald survived a review for caught behind on 16 despite the controversial Snicko technology, which has been unreliable all series, appearing to indicate a faint murmur.
An angry Carse had to be pulled away from complaining to the on-field umpire by Stokes and the bowler exchanged heated words with Weatherald.
England finally got their reward when Head swiped Tongue to Carse at midwicket and Weatherland top-edged the same bowler to Matthew Potts.
Smith was bamboozled by a turning ball by spinner Will Jacks and Khawaja, after being given a guard of honour by England when he walked out for the final time, played on.
England resumed on 302-8 with a 119-run advantage and added 40.
Precocious number three Bethell, trumpeted as the future of English cricket, padded up on 142 with Potts yet to score.
He reached 150 before edging Mitchell Starc to wicketkeeper Carey to end a breakthrough innings, with his marathon 265-ball stay including 15 fours.
Tongue was the last man out for six, again to Starc, with Potts unbeaten on 18.
It was Starc’s 31st wicket of the series, more than any other bowler.
Australia were all out for 567 in their first innings on Wednesday on the back of centuries from Head and Smith in reply to the tourists’ 384, built on Joe Root’s 160.</p><small>2026-01-08 04:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695f1790b806f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965744/remittances-boon-or-bane' target='_blank'><strong>Remittances: boon or bane?</strong></a><br><p>CONCERNS are often expressed about the expanding role of workers’ remittances in the ec­­onomy. They typically focus on the perceived risks of brain drain, excessive consumption, imp­ort leakage, exchange-rate overvaluation and the possibility of Dutch Disease. In contrast, empirical evidence shows that remittances contribute substantially to socioeconomic development. A stable source of external inflows, they help build foreign-exchange buffers, reduce dependence on external borrowing, support financial sector deepening and enhance macroeconomic stability by easing pressure on the current account. They play a critical role in poverty reduction, narrowing income inequalities and strengthening human capital by financing education, healthcare and housing. In times of economic stress, they are vital lifelines for households.
There’s also evidence of skill upgrading among those preparing to migrate and among returnees, resulting in brain gain effects. Studies show that overseas job opportunities have encouraged the Philippines to train more nurses and India to produce more computer scientists, actually increasing the stock of skilled workers at home.
Misconceptions about remittances largely stem from the way workers’ remittances are treated statistically and methodologically under WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services and IMF’s Balance of Payments (BOP) framework. GATS classifies services according to the service provider’s nationality. Under Mode 4, a service supplier is considered foreign, irrespective of the duration of stay abroad. But the IMF defines workers’ services on a residency basis. If an individual lives abroad for over a year, he/she is treated as the host country’s resident, and transactions between residents are excluded from exports of services in the current account, being recorded, instead, under secondary income.
BOP treatment also creates inconsistencies with System of National Accounts, under which gross national savings consist of: a) gross domestic savings — household, corporate and public-sector savings; b) net transfers from abroad. In FY2025, Pakistan’s gross national savings amounted to 14.1 per cent of GDP, and gross domestic savings only 6.3pc. With net foreign savings positive, reflected in a current-account surplus of 0.5pc of GDP, a substantial share of domestic investment was effectively financed by savings of overseas Pakistanis. Recognising this gap, a UN technical subgroup on the movement of persons is working to integrate BOP services accounts with remittances for a more complete representation of workers’ services.

Absorbing new labour force entrants domestically is increasingly difficult.

Conceptually, Pakistan’s labour market can be segmented in the same way as goods markets — one serving international and the other domestic demand. If labour services exports are added to other service exports using the GATS framework, our total export of goods and services would amount to around $79 billion rather than $41bn under the IMF’s definition, without altering the overall current-account balance.
It is useful to examine the main concerns regarding remittances more closely. First, the issue of brain drain. Pakistan adds nearly two million new entrants to its labour force each year; around half migrate. Available data indicates that only 2.6pc of the 832,000 migrants are highly qualified and 5.3pc highly skilled. Despite this outflow, unemployment and underemployment continue to rise. Graduate unemployment is estimated to range between 23 and 33pc. If labour supply were genuinely shrinking, real wages should have increased. Instead, studies over the past decade show a decline in real wages across all categories, with the sharpest among degree holders. Notably, during Covid, when migration slowed, real wages showed upward movement.
Given Pakistan’s large youth population, absorbing new labour force entrants domestically is increasingly difficult under current growth trends. In contrast, aging economies such as Japan, Korea and Germany face rising dependency ratios and labour shortages. So, it’s natural for labour-surplus countries to supply manpower to labour-deficient economies. Our policy response should focus on negotiating country-specific labour agreements and aligning training programmes with overseas demand. This requires investment in technical, vocational, language, and lifestyle skills besides work discipline and ethics. International accreditation from recognised institutions such as City & Guilds should be pursued and professionals encouraged to qualify through international exams in engineering, medicine, IT, accountancy and architecture.

 

Second, evidence doesn’t support concerns that remittance-receiving households indulge in excessive consumption and stimulate imports. Surveys and field observations show that recipients invest in better education for their children, improved nutrition, immunisation, and healthcare; switch to cleaner cooking fuels; upgrade housing conditions; and improve access to electricity and potable water. These changes lead to better social indicators, reduced poverty, and narrower income differentials. Districts such as Jhe­lum, Chakwal, and Rawalpindi — major sources of overseas workers — now rank high in literacy, school enrolment, and poverty reduction. Food expenditure accounts for about 40pc of total household spending, while a significant share of remittances goes towards housing improvements, farmland, real estate and consumer durables. Many returnees from GCC countries use their capital and skills to establish small businesses, contributing to domestic economic activity.
Third, remittances are often blamed for exchange-rate appreciation through the Dutch Disease effect. However, Dutch Disease arises from unearned rents or windfall gains from natural resources rather than incomes earned through labour services’ export. Evidence doesn’t support this concern. In FY2025, remittances increased by 22pc, yet the exchange rate was stable and foreign-exchange reserves increased. Similarly, Bangladesh has not experienced a sustained loss of export competitiveness despite rising remittance inflows. Exchange-rate appreciation occurs primarily when reserve accumulation is not sterilised, leading to the monetary base’s expansion.
Finally, studies indicate that remittances do not have a significant or sustained impact on domestic inflation. The outcome depends largely on country-specific economic structures. Gains in small-scale agriculture and livestock can expand supply and offset demand pressures. As households rise above the poverty line, increased consumption is directed primarily at domestically produced goods — meat, milk, poultry, fruit, vegetables — rather than imports.
In Pakistan, import demand is driven mainly by structural and policy-induced constraints rather than remittance inflows. These include deindustrialisation; failure to develop base industries that supply raw materials to downstream sectors; inefficient allocation of natural gas towards domestic consumption instead of industrial use; excessive protection through high tariffs; inability to save nearly $10bn annually by substituting imports of food and cotton; overregulation and excessive taxation; and underinvestment in agricultural research and development.

KARACHI: Amid a surge in dog-bite cases across Karachi, Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday signalled that the situation was approaching a tipping point and openly suggested culling as a possible option if the people demanded immediate relief.
Responding to questions during an interaction with the media in Ittehad Town, the mayor said public opinion on the issue varied sharply across neighbourhoods, but warned against allowing a small group to dictate policy for a city of over 25 million people.
“If I ask people here in Ittehad Colony what should be done about stray dogs, they will say that the dogs should be killed. But if I go to Clifton, there are 10 to 15 people who say, ‘No, this should not happen.’ Those 10 to 15 people impose their way of thinking on 25 million people,” he said.
Emphasising the democratic will, Mr Wahab said he believes that “the will of all the people must be considered,” adding, “a handful of individuals cannot be given supremacy over everyone else.”
Highlighting the limitations of neutering, he said the method requires time to show results and questioned the criticism faced by authorities when attacks continue during that period.
“If neutering is to be done, its impact will take time to appear. Then people should not criticise when dogs bite,” he said. “If the city wants quick results, then culling will have to be carried out.
“We are prepared for both options. Hundreds of people have been bitten in just a few days. I appeal to critics to listen to victims and their families before objecting to decisive measures.”

 

Mayor Wahab also pointed to legal hurdles, saying that a small group repeatedly approaches courts to block action and then cited an example from India. “This issue also came up in the Indian Supreme Court, and it resolved it. The court said that instead of neutering, culling should be done,” he said.
He questioned whether those opposing culling truly understand the suffering caused by dog attacks. “Ask those people who have actually gone through this experience what they want — culling or neutering?,” he said.
Uplift work initiated in West, Keamari districts
Earlier, the mayor laid the foundation stones for two major infrastructure development projects in district West and district Keamari, aimed at improving road connectivity, drainage and overall civic facilities in the city.
In district West, he inaugurated a mega infrastructure project for the rehabilitation of Hub River Road to Tori Bangash Road in Ittehad Town.
The project, with an estimated cost of Rs8 billion, is one of the largest road development initiatives in the area.
Speaking at the ceremony, attended by city council members, elected representatives and a large number of locals, the mayor said the project reflects the Karachi Metro­poli­tan Corporation’s (KMC) commitment to inclusive and sustainable urban development.
Under the project, Hub River Road will be converted into a 12,500-foot-long dual carriageway, a move expected to significantly ease traffic congestion in District West.
A modern drainage system spanning 8,000 feet has been incorporated into the design, along with the installation of more than 21,000 feet of RCC drainage pipelines to improve stormwater management.
The completion of the project will eliminate flooding issues in the area, he added.
Separately, the mayor also laid the foundation stone for the reconstruction of Sparco Road in District Keamari.
The project is being executed at a cost of approximately Rs56m and is described as an important milestone in the city’s urban development efforts.
The scheme includes 48,000 square feet of paver blocks and 65,000 square feet of asphalt wearing course, along with a modern sewerage system and a high-quality road structure.

The launch was marked by a seminar held to review and audit vulnerable public infra­­structure and buildings.
The initiative is aimed at ensuring coordinated nationwide implementation of the Infrastructure Audit Prog­ra­mme 2026 by bringing fede­ral and provincial stakeholders onto a single platform.
At the seminar, the NDMA presented the approved concept note establishing the na­­tional framework for the In­­frastructure Audit Program­­me, which has received formal endorsement from the Prime Minister’s Office for implementation across both federal and provincial levels.
Pakistan has repeatedly incurred heavy human and economic losses due to floods, earthquakes, and climate-in­duced disasters, said Federal Minister for Housing and Works Mian Riaz Hus­sain Pirzada while addressing the seminar as chief guest.
He said the losses were largely attributable not only to natural hazards but also to vulnerable and inadequately prepared infrastructure. He emphasised the urgent need to transition from a reactive, post-disaster response model to one focused on early identification of structural weaknesses and timely mitigation.
Mr Pirzada commended the NDMA for initiating this forward-looking programme in the national interest and said the Infrastructure Audit Programme represented a paradigm shift from respon­­se to prevention and from assumptions to evidence-based decision-making.
He said that systematic inf­rastructure health asse­ss­me­nts under the programme wou­­ld help identify risks in critical buildings, safeguard public assets, and enable inf­ormed planning and investment. He reaffirmed his ministry’s complete support to the NDMA in advancing the national initiative.
Speaking on the occasion, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said the seminar aimed to initiate co­­ordinated nationwide implementation of the Infra­stru­cture Audit Programme 2026 by bringing federal and provincial stakeholders onto a single platform.
He said the focus was to build a shared understanding of the audit framework, clarify roles and responsibilities, and align strategies and timelines to ensure systematic assessment and strengthening of critical infrastructure across the country during disasters and natural calamities.
Participants were briefed on the programme’s rationale, scope, and phased implementation plan, including prioritisation of high-occupancy and high-risk buildings, adoption of standardised audit methodologies such as visual inspections and non-destructive testing, development of digital reporting and decision-support systems, and incorporation of resilience indicators into infrastructure planning.
The seminar was attended by senior officials from federal and provincial governments, representatives of building control and development authorities, technical experts, engineers, academia, and development partners.

Informed sources told Dawn that the federal cabinet, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has linked the ECC-sanctioned Rs2.56 per litre additional bounty to the oil industry’s retail business for complete supply chain digitisation.
On Dec 9, Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb presiding over the ECC meeting approved an additional build-up of Rs2.56 per litre on petrol and diesel prices in two phases to improve the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and their dealers.
The ECC announced that it had approved a proposal to revise the margins of OMCs and petroleum dealers on petroleum and high-speed diesel, adjusting them in line with the national Consumer Price Index for 2023-24 and 2024-25, with increases capped between 5pc and 10pc. “It also decided that half of the increase in the margins will be paid immediately, while the remaining half will be conditional on the digitisation progress, with the Petroleum Division to report back by June 1, 2026”, it said.

PM links commissions and margins to full digitisation of petroleum supply chain

Under the decision, ECC had allowed Rs1.22 per litre increase in profit margins for OMCs and Rs1.34 per litre for petroleum dealers, in two equal installments. The first increase of 61 paise per litre in sale margins for OMCs and 67 paise per litre for dealers was to come into force with the following fortnightly price revision on Dec 15 or 31. This was to immediately take the OMCs’ margin to Rs8.48 per litre, while that of dealers was to rise to Rs9.31 per litre.
The second equivalent increase was scheduled to come into force on June 1, 2026 subject to digitalisation of their sales and stocks network and its live connectivity to the government entities like the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, the Federal Board of Revenue and Petroleum Division. With that increase, the OMCs would have charged Rs9.10 per litre while dealers were to get about Rs9.98 on sale of every litre. At present, OMCs are paid Rs7.87 per litre and dealers Rs8.64.
However, the government did not change revised rates for dealers and OMCs in two subsequent quarterly pricing revisions on Dec 15 and 31, although product prices were reduced significantly. When contacted, an official said the prime minister who had been personally pushing Digital Pakistan Initiative besides digitalisation of the entire petroleum sector from production to consumption stage and facilitated passage of an enabling law, opposed the two-phased hike in retail margins and linked implementation of ECC decision to 100pc digitisation, potentially with effect from June 1, 2026.
This followed a law passed in August last year by the parliament for digital tracking and monitoring of all petroleum products from import and production stage to storage, transportation and sales at retail outlets to minimise the menace of smuggling and adulteration, causing an estimated Rs300-500bn annual revenue loss besides associated environmental and engine degradation.
The Petroleum (Amendment) Act 2025 envisaged new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb the smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All the local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding individually and from their collective forums from the government to take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sales to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused revenue loss to the government.

Trump has frequently employed the US military — which is currently funded at record spending levels — since returning to office, including strikes on Yemeni rebels, Iranian nuclear sites and alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as a brazen special forces raid to abduct Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.
“I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump said on Truth Social.







“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” the US president said.
Trump said the increase is possible due to revenue from the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on friend and foe alike.
The United States is already by far the world’s biggest military spender, and a hike to $1.5 trillion would push Washington’s financial outlay on its armed forces even farther ahead of its rivals China and Russia, though it could also spark an arms race with such countries.
Trump slams defence companies
Trump’s announcement on boosting the US military budget comes after Nato allies committed last year to increase their defence spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035 in response to pressure from the US president.
Even as he announced a budget goal that would be a major boon to defence contractors, Trump took aim at them in posts on Truth Social.
Defence contractors are “issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” while pay packages for defence executives are “exorbitant and unjustifiable,” Trump said.







The president said salaries should be capped at $5 million and that he would prohibit stock buybacks and dividends “until such time as these problems are rectified,” without specifying how he would do so.
The announcement took the markets by surprise, sending US companies in the defence sector — such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics — more than four per cent lower. Northrop Grumman lost more than five per cent.
Trump took aim at Raytheon specifically, saying the Defence Department told him the company was the “least responsive” to its needs and the “slowest in increasing their volume”.







Raytheon must boost its investments in plants and equipment, Trump said, threatening it with a loss of US government business if it does not comply.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/080728395e68664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965740/us-says-it-needs-to-control-venezuelan-oil-sales-indefinitely-to-drive-change' target='_blank'><strong>US says it needs to control Venezuelan oil sales indefinitely to drive change</strong></a><br><p>The US needs to control Venezuela’s oil sales and revenue indefinitely to stabilise that country’s economy, rebuild its oil sector and ensure it acts in America’s interests, top US officials said on Wednesday.
The comments reflect the importance of crude oil to US President Donald Trump’s strategy in Venezuela after US forces abducted and deposed the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a raid on the capital Caracas on Saturday.
“We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,” US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech & Utilities Conference in Miami.

 

He said the revenues would be used to stabilise Venezuela’s economy and eventually to repay oil majors Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips for losses when their assets were nationalised by former president Hugo Chavez nearly two decades ago.
US Vice President JD Vance said that controlling Venezuela’s oil meant controlling the country.
“We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime: ‘You‘re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America‘s national interest; you‘re not allowed to sell it if you can‘t serve America‘s national interest,” he told Fox News.







“And that’s how we exert incredible pressure on that country without wasting a single American life, without endangering a single American citizen,” he said.
Democratic lawmakers criticised this approach, which Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy equated to stealing Venezuela’s oil at gunpoint, while industry analysts warned about political instability as the country treads a fine line between denouncing Maduro’s abduction and appeasing the US.
The OPEC member nation sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves but accounts for only about one per cent of global supply after decades of underinvestment eroded production.
Stored oil moving to market first
US Energy Secretary Wright said the US would market stored Venezuelan oil first and then sell ongoing future production indefinitely with revenues deposited into accounts controlled by the US government.
Such sales already have begun and the US has engaged “the world’s leading commodity marketers and key banks” to execute and provide financial support for them, according to a statement from the US Department of Energy.

 

Wright added he was speaking to US oil companies to learn what conditions would enable them to enter Venezuela to help boost the country’s production in the longer term.
“The resources are immense. This should be a wealthy, prosperous, peaceful energy powerhouse,” he said.
On Tuesday, Washington announced a deal with Caracas to initially export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a sign the government of interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez is responding to Trump’s demand that it open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump said on Wednesday in a post on Truth Social that Venezuela has agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to purchase American-made goods.
“A wise choice, and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela, and the United States,” he wrote.







Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA said it was progressing in negotiations with the United States for oil sales. PDVSA board member Wills Rangel told Reuters the US will need to buy cargoes at fair market prices.
Shares of US refiners Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy were up between 2.5pc and 5pc.
White House meetings
Trump is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela’s oil production.
Representatives from Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron — the top three US oil companies — would be present, according to a source familiar with the planning.
Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson will represent that company at the meeting, another source said.
The companies, all of which have experience in Venezuela, have declined to comment.
Wright said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday afternoon that he spoke with the CEOs of all three companies immediately after Maduro was seized, and expected them to be engaged in rehabilitating Venezuela’s oil sector.
“Are they going to put billions of dollars into building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not,” he said. “But they want to be productive advisers and helpers in that process.”
Wright also told CNBC that some of the proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales could eventually be used to repay ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil for losses when they exited the country, but only after Venezuela’s economy is stabilized.
Chevron is the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Venezuela was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s. But mismanagement and limited foreign investment have since led to a huge drop in annual production, which averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year.
Wright said he believed Venezuelan production could be increased within a short period with an infusion of equipment and technology, but that a bigger recovery to past production levels would take years.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695edec2242bd.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965716/us-seizes-oil-tanker-linked-to-russia-in-north-atlantic' target='_blank'><strong>US seizes oil tanker linked to Russia in North Atlantic</strong></a><br><p>• White House says crew will be prosecuted; Hegseth asserts naval blockade in full effect ‘around the world’• Trump boasts of getting ‘30-50m barrels’ of crude; energy secy claims US will control Venezuelan oil ‘indefinitely’
WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after pursuing it from off the coast of Venezuela, in an operation that incensed Moscow.
Washington claims the tanker is part of a so-called ‘shadow fleet’ that carries oil for countries such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran in violation of US sanctions, and seized it despite the ship even though it was escorted by a Russian naval submarine.
The vessel had thwarted an earlier attempt to board it last month near Venezuela.
“The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court,” the US European Command, which oversees American forces in the region, said in a statement on X.







After the seizure of the Russian oil tanker, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth posted that the US blockade on Venezuelan oil was in full effect “anywhere in the world”.







Later, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the crew of the seized oil tanker was subject to prosecution.
“The vessel had a judicial seizure order… so that means the crew is now subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution, if necessary,” she said.
Russia slams US action
Russia’s Transport Ministry slammed the oil tanker’s seizure, saying “freedom of navigation applies in waters on the high seas, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states”.

 

“In accordance with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation applies in waters on the high seas, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,” Russia’s transport ministry said in a statement.
The vessel — which changed its name from Bella-1 to Marinera — had received “temporary permission” to sail under the Russian flag on December 24, the ministry said, adding that “contact with the ship was lost” after US naval forces boarded it “in the open sea, beyond the territorial waters of any state”.
The US military also announced a second sanctioned tanker ship had been seized in the Caribbean Sea.
Last weekend, US special forces had seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from Caracas in an unprecendented raid, and took them to New York “to face trial on drug charges”.
Since then, President Donald Trump has said that the US will “run” Venezuela and US companies will control its critical oil industry.
He is due to meet with US oil executives on Friday (tomorrow) over plans for Venezuela’s oil sector.
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said that 30-50 million barrels of “high quality, sanctioned” Venezuelan crude will be shipped to US ports, with the revenue — perhaps more than $2 billion at current market prices — placed under his personal control.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright later added that Washington would control sales of Venezuelan oil “indefinitely”.
It was not clear whether Venezuela’s new ruler — interim president Delcy Rodriguez — has agreed to hand over the oil, how the plan would work, or what its legal basis would be.
China may switch to Iranian crude
Meanwhile, Chinese refiners are expected to switch to heavy crude from sources including Iran in coming months to replace Venezuelan shipments halted since the US kidnapped the country’s president, traders and analysts said.
China, the world’s biggest crude importer, is a major buyer of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.

According to a notification issued late on Wednesday night, the regulator has determined separate consumer-end tariffs for each distribution company (ex-Wapda Discos) in view of their differing revenue requirements and permitted levels of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.
For CY26, the national average tariff has been set at Rs33.38 per kWh, down from Rs34.00 per kWh in 2025-26.
The Gujranwala, Quetta, Multan, Sukkur, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Tribal Areas and Hazara electric power companies had filed multi-year tariff petitions for the period 2025-26 to 2029-30, which have now been determined by the regulator.
In line with policy guidelines issued by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) and following the federal cabinet’s approval of the annual rebasing of consumer-end tariffs with effect from Jan 1, Nepra rebased the tariffs and issued its determination for the calendar year January-December 2026.
The determined tariffs have been communicated to the federal government for submission of the uniform tariff application.
The total revenue requirement of ex-Wapda Discos has been projected at Rs3.379 trillion, comprising Rs2.923tr for power purchase costs and Rs456.15 billion for distribution companies’ margins and prior-year adjustments, based on projected sales of 101,234 gigawatt-hours during CY26.

Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as special representative to Afghanistan during the first Trump administration, tweeted on Wednesday that it was “a misunderstanding… to think that the agreement covered Afghanistan-Pakistan issues”.
In a post on his X account, he also attached the text of the agreement, which — among other things — contained a commitment to prevent the soil of Afghanistan being used by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies.
However, he posited that “a similar agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan… would serve the interests of both countries”.







Expanding on the idea, Mr Khalilzad said that the accord should be one “in which both countries commit to not allow any individual or group including ISIS and TTP to use its territories to threaten the security of the other, and in which they accept third party monitoring of such.”
“Based on recent conversations with Taliban leaders, I believe they are prepared to negotiate such an agreement. And it could be game-changing for the relations between these two neighbours,” he wrote on X.
Mr Khalilzad, who facilitated negotiations between Kabul and Washington to secure the freedom of US citizens being held in Afghanistan, is viewed by both capitals as an invaluable interlocutor.
In Washington circles, Mr Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.

The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East.
The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region.
One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.
The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.
The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal.
Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday.
Tested in combat
Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets.
He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.
The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told Reuters, adding that it’s also cost-effective.
The aircraft was deployed during the conflict with India last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.
The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond.
The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.
Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.
In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn support package for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.
Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.
Arms sales outreach
Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.
Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.
Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.
On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.
“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News.
Pakistan is currently under a $7bn IMF programme, its 24th, which followed a short-term $3bn deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695ed4b727dab.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965675/centre-provinces-green-light-action-plan-to-enrol-out-of-school-children' target='_blank'><strong>Centre, provinces green light action plan to enrol out-of-school children</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a show of unity, the federal government, provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) have approved the ‘National Education Action Plan’ to tackle the issue of out-of-school children (OOSC) during the 38th Inter-Provincial Education Ministers Conference (IPEMC).
UN agencies, including Unicef, say that more than 25 million children are out of school in Pakistan, placing the country among those with the highest number globally. The situation is exacerbated by economic hardship, climate-related events and inadequate funding for education.
The meeting, chaired by Federal Minister for Education Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, unanimously endorsed and approved the plan along with its provincial components and other key education-related initiatives following extensive consultations. Sources said participants set targets to reduce the number of out-of-school children over the next five years.
A press release issued by the Ministry of Education said that Minister of State for Education Wajiha Qamar, Federal Parliamentary Secretary Farah Naz Akbar, Federal Secretary Education Nadeem Mahbub and provincial ministers Rahila Hameed Durrani, Muhammad Ismail Rahoo, Rana Iqbal Sikandar and Arshad Ayub Khan attended the meeting.

UN agencies including Unicef say over 25 million children are out of school in Pakistan, placing the country among those with the highest number globally

Heads of federal education bodies, including the chairman of the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secodry Education and the executive director of IBCC, were also present.
During the session, participants were briefed on a special federal ‘Challenge Fund’ aimed at bringing out-of-school children back into the education system, with the federal government extending support to all provinces to address the issue.
The statement said that provincial representatives shared progress reports. 
Punjab’s Education Minister Rana Sikandar announced the outsourcing of 10,000 schools. 
Sindh’s Muhammad Ismail Rahoo confirmed the merit-based recruitment of 93,000 teachers, while Balochistan’s Rahila Hameed Durrani reported the restoration of 3,200 closed schools, bringing 140,000 children back to classrooms.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported a six per cent increase in enrolment along with the recruitment of 10,000 teachers. AJK Minister Malik Zafar highlighted the allocation of Rs7 billion for 10,000 new classrooms. Gilgit-Baltistan also shared initiatives related to special funds for out-of-school children and the expansion of the ‘School Meal Programme’.
Federal Secretary Education Nadeem Mahbub said all endorsed and approved projects would receive final ratification from the Education Emergency Task Force chaired by the prime minister. He also invited provinces to benefit from the federal board’s reform programme and stressed the need to align matriculation and inter-tech programmes with global standards.
PIE DG Dr Muhammad Shahid Saroya informed the forum that the National Action Plan was developed over six months of stakeholder consultations to address the challenge of 25 million out-of-school children.
The conference concluded with the unanimous approval of several key agenda items, including technical education initiatives presented by DG FED Syed Junaid Akhlaq, the Education Emergency Task Force terms of reference, a data regime by PIE, modern curriculum reforms by Director NCC Tabassum Naz, and a character-building strategy presented by Chairman National Rahmatul-lil-Aalameen Authority Khurshid Ahmed Nadeem.
In his closing remarks, Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui congratulated stakeholders on the successful conduct of the conference, calling it a milestone in national harmony. He said the participation of all federal units on one platform reflected a strong commitment to overcoming educational challenges.
He added that sustaining this coordination is essential to meeting evolving global standards, noting that informal education, outreach to remote areas and the mainstreaming of madrasa students remain key priorities.

While addressing the House GOP (Grand Old Party) Members’ Retreat, Trump recounted a meeting with Modi, stating that Modi had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the US and had waited five years.
“Prime Minister Modi came to see me. [He said] ‘Sir, may I see you, please?’ Yes,” Trump recalled.
“I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now, because they’re not doing the oil,” he added, referring to India halting imports of Russian oil.
Trump also noted that the US is “getting rich because of tariffs”.
Meanwhile, India’s opposition Congress party took to X and uploaded a caricature of the scene, showing a timid Modi.







In a separate post in Hindi, Congress claimed that Modi went to the US uninvited to meet Trump after he took office last January, quoting the Indian PM’s request to meet him.
“You must remember - among the world‘s leaders, Modi is the only one whom Trump did not come to receive at the gate,” the party wrote, attaching a video of Trump’s remarks.







In response to the remarks, Indian lawmaker Priyanka Chaturvedi took to X and wrote, “His (Trump’s) condescending tone for India’s PM is demeaning. The GoI’s (Government of India) silence to all his insulting statements is bizarre because it reflects poorly on our nation.”
Former Indian minister Subhramanian Swamy shared this post.







The US is imposing 50 per cent tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil, causing tensions to rise between the world’s two largest democracies and strategic partners.
A punitive 25pc tariff was imposed due to India’s purchases of Russian oil, adding to Trump’s prior 25pc tariff on many products from India. It took total duties as high as 50pc for goods such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals — among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and China.
However, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One that he could raise the tariffs already in place.
“Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday.
“They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.</p><small>2026-01-07 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0720241898d923b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965640/shadab-abrar-sahibzada-star-as-pakistan-beat-sri-lanka-in-first-t20i' target='_blank'><strong>Shadab, Abrar, Sahibzada star as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka in first T20I</strong></a><br><p>Featuring for Pakistan for the first time since June last year, Shadab Khan impressed with the ball, teaming up with Abrar Ahmed as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the opening fixture of the three-match Twenty20 International series at the Rangiri Dambulla Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.
The all-rounder took two wickets, while Abrar hunted three victims to restrict Sri Lanka to a paltry 128-run total before Sahibzada Farhan’s half century helped Pakistan chase down the target with 20 balls to spare.
Shadab gave away only 25 runs in his four overs, bagging both his wickets in his very first over and could have gone on to take a third had it not been for a dropped catch later on.
Coming into bowl in the seventh over, after Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza’s pace — that accounted for a wicket for each — saw Sri Lanka post 35-2 in the powerplay, Shadab trapped a sweeping Kusal Mendis lbw and induced an inside edge off Dhananjaya de Silva’s bat for wicket-keeper Usman Khan to take a good catch.
With Sri Lanka looking to break the stranglehold while at 59-4 by the halfway stage, it was an opportunity for Abrar to pounce on. The mystery spinner deceived Charith Asalanka into playing a googly across, only to be caught behind, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 72-5 halfway through the 12th over.
The incoming Wanindu Hasaranga initiated a counterattack of sorts lofting Abrar for a boundary in the 14th over.  Liyanage joined in a slap off Mohammad Nawaz through the covers before dispatching the left-arm spinner past long-on, bringing up the 100-run mark for Sri Lanka.
Luck followed for Liyanage as an edge flew off his bat for another boundary as 16 runs came in the 15th over.
Hasaranga targetted Abrar once again, clubbing him straight down the ground for another four, but holed the spinner to Fakhar Zaman at deep cover to depart for 18 off 12, ending the only partnership that looked to threaten Pakistan.
Liyanage (40 off 31) followed suit in the 18th, finding Nawaz in the deep off Abrar (3-25) as he tried to clear the long-on fence. 
Salman Mirza (3-18) returned to dismiss Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka and the incoming Dushmantha Chameera before Wasim (2-7) wrapped up the first innings proceedings.
Pakistan, in response, took off with a flurry of brilliant attacking shots by openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada lead the side to a 59-1 by the end of the powerplay, with Saim departing on the penultimate ball of the sixth over.
The left-hander was castled by Theekshana but only after having hit three fours and a six — a lofted drive over cover — for his 18-ball 24. Sahibzada, on the other end, had used brute power to dispatch Chameera for sixes down the ground and over square-leg.
Sahibzada continued the onslaught, welcoming Chameera back with a straight drive for four more before captain Salman Ali Agha, having just joined him, danced down the ground to play Hasaranga’s leg-spin over his head for another boundary.
The skipper pushed Theekshana for his second boundary in the next over as Pakistan posted 92-1 by the halfway stage, but holed a juicy full toss by Hasranga to long-on to depart for 16 off 10.
Sahibzada (51 off 36) brought up his third half century in five matches with a cut for three off Chameera in the 12th over, reaching the milestone in 35 balls. But the right-hander perished three balls later, finding Shanaka at mid-off off Chameera.
Pakistan received yet another blow when Fakhar was stumped off Dhananjaya de Silva with 23 runs needed off 40 balls.
The incoming Shadab (18 not out off 12), however, brought Pakistan within touching distance of a win with a square-drive and a pull for consecutive boundaries off Chameera in the 15th over before Pakistan crossed the finish line with 20 balls to spare.</p><small>2026-01-07 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071852092a28ee9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965642/kp-cm-calls-for-policy-shift-urges-consultation-with-province-on-counter-terrorism-measures' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’, urges consultation with province on counter-terrorism measures</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday sought a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terror policy-making.
Federal authorities have criticised the PTI-led KP government for failing to ensure security in the province, with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi saying that the party was in disarray and unable to achieve any of its policy goals.
In a speech at Peshawar University’s convocation ceremony, the CM said that the people of KP had warned about the resurgence of terrorism in the province, but were brushed off as propaganda.
“We would issue warnings that they (terrorists) were in the mountains and they were coming, that they had reached our markets and homes,” CM Afridi said. “We were told that we are spreading propaganda.”
He highlighted that if there was going to be a military operation, then the people of KP needed to be taken into confidence and made part of the policy process.
“There needs to be a policy shift, but not behind closed doors,” he explained. “It [policy] needs to be formed after consulting KP’s government, people and stakeholders.“
“A clear policy formed in this manner will play a role in lasting and enduring peace; a decision made behind closed doors will leave our people suffering, as they have for the past 17 years.”
The CM noted that the KP government and the government had “different intentions”, adding, “If they wanted to eradicate terrorism, then they would have sat with us and formed a policy.
“We came out of our homes, so they committed that they would give Rs400,000 to people whose homes have been lost to terrorism,” he said. “Imagine hearing that after sacrificing so much. They still have not received that money.”
Highlighting the impact of military operations, CM Afridi noted that families would lose breadwinners in collateral damage or terrorist attacks, causing them to suffer economically.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence.
Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.”
Meanwhile, on January 2, KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police thwarted hundreds of terrorism-related incidents, particularly in southern and merged tribal districts, while police personnel risked their lives but stood firm against the enemy.
Last year, the police neutralised 459 terrorists in several engagements and arrested over 1,300 militants, including 29 with head money, in 3,277 intelligence-based operations across the province.
The police said a large quantity of hand grenades, explosives, pistols, various weapons and ammunition was recovered.</p><small>2026-01-07 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071215403da7749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965621/social-media-posts-case-imaan-hadi-file-application-seeking-to-summon-dg-ispr-as-a-witness' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Imaan, Hadi file application seeking to summon DG ISPR as a witness</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, submitted an application in an Islamabad court on Wednesday seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in a case registered against them over their social media posts.
In the case, registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca), Mazari and Chattha have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On Wednesday, the two submitted a written application to Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka during the hearing of the case, referring to a press conference addressed by the military spokesperson on January 6.
The application said the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. During the press conference, “references were made to matters directly pending trial before this learned court”.
“This is the exact prosecution case that is pending adjudication before this learned court,” the application said.
Mazari and Chattha contended that their request was a “clear requisite of natural justice in line with the Constitutional protection safeguarded for the accused persons with respect to the right to fair trial and due process”.
The court subsequently directed that a copy of the application be provided to the prosecution and said a decision on the request would be made after it heard the prosecution.
Later, the court said it was issue a decision on the application after the statements of the accused were recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
During the proceedings, prosecution witness Shahroz Riaz was also cross-examined. He made several admissions regarding the manner in which the inquiry in the case was initiated and the collection of social media content.
The hearing has been adjourned till January 8.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-07 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695984802c752.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964939/essay-airports-as-mirrors' target='_blank'><strong>ESSAY: AIRPORTS AS MIRRORS</strong></a><br><p>I am an airport person — not because I travel often, but because I love their peculiar atmosphere: the sense of transition, the emotion of crossing borders. Yet I have come to recognise another dimension: airports often capture the essence of the society that built them. 
Earlier in October, I booked my flight from Berlin to Karachi after completing my postgraduation in Germany. This was not my first time travelling the Berlin-Doha-Karachi route and, like every time, I looked forward to my three-hour layover at the Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. 
DOHA’S DOUBLE-EDGED LUXURY
A brief stay at this airport feels like a delight for the senses; an artificial tropical garden, endless dining options and other curated attractions look like something from a fairytale. 
I realise that my liking sits at odds with my sociological leanings. The Doha airport represents all that I dislike about the region’s neoliberal culture: hyper-consumerism, late-stage capitalism and an undue fixation on aesthetics. 
Yet the airport’s commercial excess coexists with a highly efficient service apparatus. The wait times at immigration and baggage claim in Doha are virtually nonexistent. It is difficult not to appreciate the passenger experience, but anyone critical of the neoliberal paradigm is forced to confront certain questions: who built these terminals, who cleans the facilities, and who helps achieve such a high level of service? 

What do airports reveal about the societies that build them? Comparing Doha’s opulent excess, Berlin’s democratic modesty and Karachi’s perpetual stagnation offers unexpected insights

The answer is clear: migrant workers from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa form the backbone of Gulf infrastructure. They work long hours constructing these expansive environments, while living under conditions marked by vulnerability, if not outright abuse.
In 2022, the kafala [sponsorship] system, which tied workers’ legal status to their employers, was officially abolished in Qatar. Nevertheless, the overall labour rights conditions are still far from adequate. The large migration of workers from other countries also speaks to a reality about where they come from: the lack of employment opportunities and survival options available to Pakistanis, Indians, Filipinos and Ethiopians compel them to migrate to the Gulf.  
BERLIN’S OLD SCHOOL
In contrast to Doha airport, Berlin’s Brandenburg Airport, though modern and efficient, is considerably smaller, with fewer shops and only two or three dining options per terminal. Just like its airport, there is certainly nothing in Berlin approaching the scale of luxury found in Gulf megacities. 
My two years as a student in Berlin surprised me on several fronts: remarkably few shopping malls, dated infrastructure and the metropolis seemed to be perpetually under construction, with dug-up roads and building sites scattered across neighbourhoods. 
Local friends explained that this was due to long-delayed government development projects, as a result of which fibre-optic cables were only now being laid beneath the city. For me, this reflected Germany’s adherence to older systems and strict bureaucracy.
The story of Brandenburg Airport has parallels to these characteristics: the airport, which was scheduled to open in 2012, missed seven scheduled opening dates and finally opened in 2020. 
Yet Berlin’s pace of modernisation isn’t just about the challenges of the scale of reconstruction. The city residents, too, have made a choice. Time and again, they have resisted the capitalist development model that prioritises profit over public access. 
REFLECTION AND COMPARISON
Unlike Gulf cities, Berlin resists excessive consumerism. Leisure isn’t gatekept by wealth: museums offer free entry days, galleries and exhibitions operate on donation, making cultural participation possible. 
The political systems of the two regions come into play here. As a strong democracy, the German state, which charges high taxes from its citizens, is also accountable to them. Gulf states, as described by UK-based Adam Hanieh, the author of Capitalism and Class in the Gulf States, operate as capitalist monarchies. By channelling their oil wealth into urban development, the ruling regimes have successfully built tourist economies, cultivated international investment hubs and, most recently, expanded toward knowledge economies.
Without elections or citizen-funded taxes, accountability does not operate through the public. Instead, the state strictly regulates chosen domains: food businesses face hefty fines for violations, littering incurs penalties. The resulting order and efficiency create comfortable conditions, selectively benefitting white-collar expats and wealthy natives. 
HOMECOMING REALITIES
When I landed at the airport of my home city after a 12-hour journey, I was overcome with nostalgia for a few seconds, as Karachi is the city where I spent my early childhood. 
But as my nostalgia faded, I felt the contrast between Karachi airport and any other international airport, including those of Doha and Berlin. The infrastructure was dated and the stores felt like relics of a bygone era. I saw my suitcase after nearly an hour of waiting, although there were only three flights at 7am on a Saturday. 
Why does the transport hub of Pakistan’s largest city feel frozen in time? What has prevented its renovation or the construction of a contemporary facility? Jinnah Airport, which opened in 1992, has remained unchanged since its founding. It is, in many ways, a microcosm of Karachi itself: perpetually stuck between what it actually is and what it struggles to become. 
Major governance challenges dominate Karachi’s urban landscape, where crumbling infrastructure frequently results in life-threatening accidents. Unchecked projects are often abandoned with little consequence. A clear blame rests on the shoulders of negligent authorities, but it is no less true that the general public in Karachi also suffers from an almost criminal lack of civic sense. 
Yet for all its flaws, Karachi is a city whose capacity to receive, absorb and sustain people from all walks of life is remarkable. Home to at least 21 million people, Karachi has, for generations, accepted people from across Pakistan. Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis, Baloch, Mohajirs, and Bengalis have all found their way here to seek opportunity, refuge, or simply to survive, and the city has given them space to build lives, however precarious.  
much said about the need for Pakistan to have an international-standard airport, there is a story to be told about the new Islamabad airport, too. When it was opened in 2018, the Islamabad International Airport, described as ‘world-class’ and ‘state-of-the-art’, was a celebration for Pakistanis. After years of unpleasant experiences at the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport, the consensus was that Islamabad deserves a transportation facility that offers, at the very least, a positive first impression of the capital city. 
Admittedly, the new airport is a significant step up from its predecessor; it is much larger, better-designed and more efficient. Yet one cannot help but notice the substandard quality of construction and other characteristics that fall short of qualifying it as a truly ‘world-class’ airport. The roofs have a tendency to leak when it rains and the elevators accommodate barely four passengers. 
A 2025 case study by Dr Bilal Karim, Engr Muhammad Arif and Engr Zafar Ali Khan deemed the airport a “project success” for meeting budget and schedule, but a “business failure” for missing air traffic projections. I contend it fails as a project, too. Aesthetically, the truck art offers a slight saving grace, as it shows an appreciation of the creative labour of local painters and calligraphers.  
With ample to complain about on the infrastructural front, in truth, my relationship with Karachi — my birthplace — and Islamabad, where I’ve lived, is more fundamental in shaping how I feel about their respective airports. Many hellos and goodbyes have been said here, and my associations are about personal memories, and significant life moments more than anything else.
So yes, I’m still an airport person — though the term now encompasses many different meanings.
