PM Shehbaz reached Doha today on a one-day visit, where he met Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to express solidarity and regional unity after the attacks, state media reported.
“The prime minister emphasised that Israel’s ongoing aggression in the Middle East must be stopped and the Muslim world needs unity in its ranks to confront Israeli provocations,” according to a statement by state broadcaster PTV on X.
 






The statement said the prime minister strongly condemned the Israeli attack as a “blatant violation” of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stated that the leadership and people of Pakistan were deeply concerned about the attack, which was contrary to international laws.
“Reaffirming the historical and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, the prime minister said that both countries stand with each other. “In this spirit of brotherhood, Pakistan has stood shoulder to shoulder with his highness the emir of Qatar, the royal family and the brotherly people of Qatar during this difficult time.”
He assured the Qatari leadership of Pakistan’s complete solidarity and support against this unjustified provocation, statement said, adding that he also expressed deep sympathy over the loss of precious lives in Israel’s brutal and heinous attack and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated Qatar’s “responsible and constructive mediation role” in efforts to establish peace in Gaza, stressing that Israeli actions, such as the Doha strikes, “clearly aim to undermine regional stability and jeopardise ongoing diplomatic and humanitarian efforts”.
Doha and Egypt have also been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
According to Hamas sources, the group’s representatives were targeted in Doha by Israel on Tuesday while they were discussing United States President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. Qatar had condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
In today’s meeting with the Qatari emir, PM Shehbaz recalled that Pakistan had called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss recent developments in the Middle East at Qatar’s request.
He also welcomed Qatar’s decision to host an Arab-Islamic Summit on September 15, saying that Pakistan had expressed its willingness to co-sponsor and co-organise the summit with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
“The prime minister also thanked his highness the emir for Qatar’s strong support for Pakistan during India’s unjustified aggression against Pakistan earlier this year. The emir of Qatar thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for visiting Doha to express solidarity.
“Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination in promoting regional peace, upholding international law and supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. During the visit, both leaders reaffirmed the deep brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar and their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the statement concluded.
The prime minister later departed after wrapping up his visit. He was received earlier today and seen off by Deputy PM and Minister of State for Defence Affairs Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman bin Hassan Al Thani.
 






The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi and others.
The Foreign Office earlier said that the visit underscored Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East”.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
Earlier this month, the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and stability during a meeting between Pakistan’s top military official, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the Qatari military leadership on his visit to Qatar.</p><small>2025-09-11 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11161236b25a863.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941216/pti-senators-resign-from-standing-committees-in-compliance-with-imrans-orders' target='_blank'><strong>PTI senators resign from standing committees in compliance with Imran’s orders</strong></a><br><p>Several PTI senators have resigned from their respective senate standing committees on Thursday, saying that they had made the move in line with the instructions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
So far, seven senators have quit the Senate standing committees, including Dost Muhammad, Zeeshan Khanzada, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Muhammad Azam Khan Swati, Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Falak Naz and Aon Abbas Buppi.
The development comes two weeks after the PTI claimed some 30 of its lawmakers resigned from the membership of parliamentary committees, although the National Assembly Secretariat only confirmed the receipt of 20 resignations.
The resignation letters of all seven senators, seen by Dawn.com, stated that the decision was made “voluntarily” upon the orders of Imran.
They resigned from all their respective standing committees, decrying Imran’s incarceration as well as the “disintegration of democratic norms” in the wake of the recent disqualification of PTI lawmakers.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
“I can no longer in good conscience serve on Senate committees when the state is the foremost violator of the very rights and protections these committees are meant to safeguard,” Swati wrote in his letter.
Citing the recent disqualification of PTI lawmakers, he stated that the authorities were “systematically dismantling” the foundations of democracy, the judiciary, and basic rights of citizens.
He pointed out that the “breakdown began with a deeply flawed judgment authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa,” stripping PTI of its symbol — the bat, followed by the “abuse of Form-47” during the 2024 general elections.
“This resignation is an act of protest not just on behalf of my party, but to faithfully follow the decision of my party leader Imran Khan, the Law of this great country and the Constitution of Pakistan, which today stands orphaned, dishonoured, and ignored.”
Swati urged parliamentarians, jurists, and citizens to speak up “before the space for dissent is completely extinguished.”
Meanwhile, both Senator Khanzada and Dost Muhammad stated in their letters: “The deliberate denial of Justice has compelled both him and myself to take this step as an expression of protest.”
Buppi, Afridi, Mohmand, and Falak Naz, in their letters, said that they were also resigning following the directions of Imran Khan.
Mohmand, in his statement, criticised the state, saying that “the lawful avenue through which we can register [our] complaint has been blocked,” citing the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
The senators resigned from the following committees:

Swati — cabinet secretariat, economic affairs, law and justice, national health services, regulation and coordination, and rules of procedure and privileges.
Dost Muhammad — government assurances, human rights, national food security & research, poverty alleviation and social safety, and railways.
Khanzada — Overseas Pakistanis & human resource department, foreign affairs, finance, commerce, and privatisation.
Afridi — commerce, federal education and professional training, inter-provincial coordination, industrial and production, and power.
Buppi — Industries & production, poverty alleviation & social safety, religious affairs and interfaith harmony, defence production, and information and broadcasting.
Mohmand — parliamentary affairs, human rights, national health services and regulation, water resources, information technology and telecommunication.
Falak Naz — federal education & professional training, economic affairs, climate change, and problems of less developed areas.

Last month, PTI lawmakers resigned from membership and chairmanship of all standing committees in the National Assembly as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023, riots against Imran’s arrest, sparking protests in the NA.</p><small>2025-09-11 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111643336c9b9ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941228/quetta-atc-extends-byc-chief-mahrang-balochs-physical-remand-by-15-more-days-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC extends BYC chief Mahrang Baloch’s physical remand by 15 more days: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Thursday extended the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group on the police’s request, according to her lawyer.
Advocate Israr Baloch told Dawn.com: “The arrested leaders of the BYC were presented before Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen of Quetta ATC -1, who extended their physical remand in police custody for 15 more days on the police’s request,” adding that apart from Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Gulzadi and Beberg Baloch were presented in the court as well.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Its chief Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Mahrang was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order —  for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.
While in custody, Mahrang and other BYC leaders’ remand has been extended multiple times.
Last month, an ATC in Karachi issued a non-bailable warrant for  Mahrang in a case pertaining to sedition.</p><small>2025-09-11 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11102022e453ee4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941167/security-forces-kill-19-terrorists-in-3-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 19 terrorists in 3 separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that an intelligence-based operation was conducted in KP’s Mohmand district upon the reported presence of terrorists there.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s* location, and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that another intelligence-based operation was conducted in the general Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan district, where, during the ensuing fire exchange, four more terrorists were neutralised by the security forces.
In another encounter that took place in Bannu district, one more terrorist was killed, the statement added.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the successful counter-terrorism operations.
According to Radio Pakistan, President Zardari, in a statement, said the courage and professionalism of Pakistan’s brave soldiers continued to protect the nation from the scourge of terrorism.
“He emphasised that such operations demonstrate Pakistan’s unshakeable resolve to confront and defeat Indian-sponsored terrorism,” the report said.
Per the report, PM Shehbaz said, “The war against terrorism will continue until this scourge is completely eradicated from the country.”
“Officers and personnel of the Pakistan Army are tirelessly engaged day and night to foil the nefarious designs of the Khawarij and the Fitna of Hindustan,” he was quoted as saying.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan.  In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Last week, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
In August, security forces neutralised 50 terrorists during a four-day operation in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-11 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1116364686ae62d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941229/governor-kundi-condemns-punjab-govts-arbitrary-ban-on-wheat-supply-to-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Governor Kundi condemns Punjab govt’s ‘arbitrary ban’ on wheat supply to KP</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday condemned the Punjab government’s reported ban on wheat supply to his province.
Kundi had last week expressed his regret over reports that wheat supply from Punjab had been suspended. However, Punjab officials tasked with maintaining supplies of commodities and regulating their prices denied there was any ban on the grain’s inter-provincial movement.
“The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi said on X.
The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”.
 






The KP governor further noted: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation.
“On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban,” he added.
Stressing that food security cannot be “compromised by provincial barriers”, Kundi also called on the PTI’s KP government to “urgently provide wheat quotas to flour mills to stabilise prices and protect the rights of our people”.
Yesterday, the KP Assembly unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province.
The sharp rise in prices is evident in branded flour, with some millers raising the cost of a five-kilogramme bag of fine flour to Rs700, up from Rs500 on August 1 and Rs600 on September 1, despite the arrival of the new wheat crop earlier this year.
 
 

The issue came to light earlier this month, when the KP chapter of All Pakistan Flour Mills Association said the Punjab government had imposed a ban on the interprovincial movement of wheat and called it “unconstitutional”.
Some market analysts believe the ongoing wheat crisis is unrelated to the recent floods in Punjab and other regions, as the new wheat crop was harvested in March/April. However, hoarders, stockists and investors are reportedly holding substantial wheat stocks, waiting for further price hikes driven by supply and demand dynamics.
On Tuesday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced a three-day grace period for all wheat hoarders to voluntarily declare their inventory or face action.
The government has also recently unveiled a new roadmap for the ‘National Wheat Policy and Wheat Management Strategy’ for 2025-26 and onwards that will serve as a long-term plan to ensure food security, safeguard farmers’ livelihoods, protect consumers and build resilience against market disruptions and climate-induced emergencies.</p><small>2025-09-11 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111236008398eb0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941168/the-day-kathmandu-burned' target='_blank'><strong>The day Kathmandu burned</strong></a><br><p>The week of September 8, 2025, was just another week for RC Gautam, an errand boy at Kantipur Television. During two decades of his employment at the station, he had seen several street protests, dire political situations, a civil war, shootouts, violence and even an attack on the channel’s headquarters. But September 9 panned out a bit differently for him.
“I can’t even begin to tell you how many people stormed our station. It all happened so quickly,” he told me over the phone.
An irate mob rushed into the Kantipur TV building on Tuesday, set fire to three buildings on its premises, torched two dozen bikes and over a dozen cars. The station was just one of the hundreds of buildings and homes that came under attack in the wake of what is being dubbed the ’Gen Z’ protests in Nepal, which quickly spiralled out of control on September 8.

Triggered by a recent social media ban, the demonstrators took to the streets against corruption and nepotism. Every day, about 2,000 Nepalis leave for the Gulf, Malaysia and other countries for work, and while the country runs on a remittance economy, the children of leaders and politicians lead lavish lifestyles — something the Gen Z have been criticising on social media.
When the protesters took to the streets on Monday, they had expected it to be peaceful. Initially, there was music and dancing as well, and some local celebrities showed up to support the movement. But things quickly spiralled out of control when some of the older men in the crowd targeted the parliament.
Thus began the rioting. Subsequently, the Kathmandu chief district officer issued orders to open fire, resulting in the deaths of 22 protesters. The numbers have since risen. Some of the protesters who died were in school uniforms. By September 10, a total of 30 people were reported dead. More than a thousand people injured in the protests are being treated in hospitals.
But the figures on casualties are being called conservative estimates. Many people remain missing and unaccounted for in similar events in different parts of the country.
The inferno
On September 9, violence escalated as groups of arsonists showed up on the streets, vandalising and torching private homes of ministers and businesses connected to those in power. Entire ministerial quarters, government buildings, police stations, the Supreme Court and the country’s main administrative block, Singha Durbar, were among those set on fire.
On Tuesday, Kathmandu burned and smelled of rage. The air was so thick, it was choking.
When smoke started filling the air in the Budanilkantha area, the north of the capital, where I live, and army choppers encircled the sky above me relentlessly, my instinct as a former reporter made me step out.

The Deuba residence, the home of former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife, former minister Arju Deuba, had been attacked. A plume of smoke rose from their residence and lifted towards the Shivapur hill. Choppers made several rounds attempting to airlift the couple, who had been manhandled by the mob, but didn’t succeed. Gunshots were heard, and neighbours said two men had died — their deaths, not verified. The Deubas, injured, were eventually evacuated through the back door.
On the street across from where I live, smoke rose towards the sky — the air stank.
When I arrived at the scene, the arsonists had just left, and the public had open access to former President Bidhya Bhandari’s house, which was blazing. The crowd outside lingered and engaged in a tone of chit-chat. What I overheard:
“What did you take?”
“I didn’t really get my hands on anything.”
“There were 240,000 Nepalese rupees, and some USD. Some people took it.”
“Someone took a mattress.”
“I only took a cake.”
On my evening walks, going past the Bhandari home, I would often quickly scan the former president’s house, and the guards would be stationed at the security posts, armed. On Tuesday, as the house burned and the residents had been evacuated, the guards were still there outside the gate, waiting.
“This is our duty,” they said.
The scene at the Bhandari home was a common one across Kathmandu as arsonists ventured from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, torching and plundering the homes of ministers and administrators, beating them, stripping them.
Kathmandu was an inferno on September 9, as the fire brigades were forbidden to move by the police for security reasons. Even if they had been mobilised, they were never prepared for fire on such a great scale. No one had foreseen the violence and unrest of the nature that transpired.
The lull of sleeplessness
Most Nepalis have slept poorly since the killings on September 8. Most are seething or grieving. Or tired and scared. While the anger initially was directed at the KP Oli government and the ruling coalition for killing unarmed protesters, emotions had cascaded into confusion by the next day.
People no longer knew who was backing the arsonists or who seemed to be targeting specific homes and establishments as though they had been operating by a list, exercising what appeared like premeditated attack tactics.
Men on motorcycles were going door to door, causing arson and leaving behind a trail of what sounded like victory cries during battles. Some of them wielded guns they had stolen from police stations they had stormed. In Maharajgunj Chakrapath, the neighbourhood I grew up in, a high-ranking policeman was beaten to death by the mob. Some policemen were rescued and airlifted by army choppers on a sling.

This was the station my family and neighbours had looked to for security.
By the time the ‘Gen Z’, who were the ones to launch the protest in the first place, called for calm on social media and absolved themselves of responsibility for the riots, too much damage had been done. Their call had been for peaceful protests against corruption. But they no longer had control over the situation. Their movement had been hijacked.
When the Nepali army chief’s address was delivered on the evening of September 9, offering security — coupled with prohibitory orders — people sensed some form of respite in knowing that at least the rampage would stop if nothing more. Army trucks patrolled the city, but people still spent the night in fear. Unknown groups broke into private residences in some places; looting was reported in others. Prisoners had escaped en masse in different parts of the country.
As the mayhem unfolded, I was texting a young journalist friend who’s from outside Kathmandu and lives in the capital for work and studies. She said she felt scared. I told her I would probably sleep with a pair of scissors under my pillow, just in case. There were rumours that there had been stray incidents of men entering homes and raping women, something confirmed by the army later in an announcement.
Media during anarchy
During the attack on Kantipur TV on Tuesday, my former colleague, RC Gautam, was able to get away to safety. But with the army clampdown and curfew in place, he still hasn’t arrived home as I write this, and is instead sheltering with an acquaintance nearby.
“What will happen next, didi?” He asked me. “How am I going to feed the kids? How will I educate them? The office I worked at is gone.” I didn’t have an answer to give RC, but I mourned with him the loss of my former place of work, among many other things that have been lost to us within two days.
Kantipur TV, the biggest private legacy media, was known as an institution that stood its ground. And while media houses are also about their owners and their advertisers, they’re mostly about the journalists who run them. Especially the non-partisan ones, who give their lives to journalism so they can uphold high standards. Kantipur Media Group has had many journalists like that over the years, who’ve taken stands when the nation and the people needed it.

During the April 2006 street protests, hundreds of people had stopped outside the Kantipur complex in Tinkune to clap and show gratitude for the good journalism it had done. Those of us who worked there at the time looked outside the window, and some of us had tears of gratitude streaming down our faces.
The same establishment received a different kind of treatment. For many journalists who worked at Kantipur, their work was their home from where they launched treatises into the world, asked difficult questions and urged the Nepali people to think. The burning of Kantipur also points towards a troublesome point in Nepal’s history, where dedication to journalism has been vilified. Sure, some journalists take shortcuts, and all legacy media is funded by businesses, but they’re also run by journalists who believe in truth-telling. Free and fair journalism is the foundation of democracy, and pulling down a media house like Kantipur signals the close of a period that trusted independent media.
Questions abound
If one of the things this movement is demanding is the restoration of freedom of speech, then taking down a media house is a symbolic contradiction.
Which brings me back to the basics. Where does Nepal go from here? There’s no intel on this right now. Are there foreign elements at play? Vested interests of dormant political groups? Who instigated the riots? Who should lead next?
By the night of September 10, the Gen Z had spent an entire day discussing and closing in on who their choice of an interim leader could be. But discord and constitutional hurdles riddled their choices, as the nation listened in. Nepal is steeped in questions right now, and even though the answers are aplenty, none of them are right or wrong.

As of now, the country’s former chief justice, Sushila Karki, has claimed to have accepted the Gen Z protesters’ request to lead the interim government. “When they requested me, I accepted,” Karki told Indian news channel CNN-News18. “Gen Z” representatives told reporters that they met army officials later and proposed Karki as their choice to head an interim government.
International media and friends want to know what’s happening. Our DMs are flooded with messages of both care and mere curiosity, but the people are too tired right now. We’ve seen homes burn, we’ve watched loved ones die suddenly and quickly, our colleagues have been shot at, beaten up, and our friends and family robbed. We’ve also seen men brandishing guns and khukuris, threatening innocents.
Who are these men? Who is mobilising them? Where have the former ministers fled? Where are the ones who got away safely and went into hiding? Who is being sheltered at the army barracks? What is the army move likely to morph into? Who will the nation pick as its new leader? Will the president call for snap elections? Will the Constitution be amended? Who will comfort the mothers whose children died in the protests? What will happen to all the people who have lost their jobs because the buildings they worked in are now gone? Questions abound.
But for now, just in this moment, these queries must take a step back. Because right now, Nepalis need rest, support, and the strength to build back when all of this chaos ends and the air has cleared.

“While three recent events — the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and the two most recent ICC Women’s T20 World Cups — have featured all-female match official panels, this is the first time in the history of the Women’s World Cup the feat will be achieved,” the ICC said a statement.
The 13th edition of the Women’s World Cup is set to be held in India and Sri Lanka from September 30.
The tournament would be overseen by a group of 14 umpires, including Claire Polosak, Jacqueline Williams, Sue Redfern, Lauren Agenbag and Kim Cotton.
The ICC statement mentioned that Polosak, Williams and Redfern “will be appearing at their third Women’s World Cup” this year while  Agenbag and Cotton “will be at their second World Cup”.

The all-female panel of match officials for the World Cup also includes four match referees, namely Trudy Anderson, Shandré Fritz, GS Lakshmi, and Michell Pereira, who “will all bring varying levels of experience in the role” to the tournament.
The statement by the global governing body for cricket further stated that chairperson Jay Shah “believes the all-female panel is a historic moment for women’s cricket and thinks it will help lead to many more success stories around the world in the future”.
It quoted him as saying: “This marks a defining moment in the journey of women’s cricket, one that we hope will pave the way for many more trailblazing stories across all facets of the sport.
“The inclusion of an all-women panel of match officials is not only a major milestone but also a powerful reflection of the ICC’s unwavering commitment to advancing gender equity across cricket.”
He further said, “This development goes beyond symbolic value. It is about visibility, opportunity, and the creation of meaningful role models who can inspire future generations. By highlighting excellence in officiating on the global stage, we aim to spark aspiration and reinforce that leadership and impact in cricket know no gender.
“We are honoured to recognise a new chapter in the growth of the women’s game. We believe the influence of this initiative will resonate far beyond this tournament, motivating more women worldwide to pursue officiating careers and helping redefine what’s possible within the game.”
Earlier this month, the ICC also announced a staggering increase in the prize money for the Women’s World Cup.
“The overall prize money at the eight-team marquee tournament totals $13.88 million — a monumental rise of 297 per cent from $3.5m at the last edition held in New Zealand in 2022,” ICC said in its announcement.</p><small>2025-09-11 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1113180404441ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941208/pakistan-must-shape-its-clean-energy-future' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan must shape its clean-energy future</strong></a><br><p>In the hot summer sun of southern Punjab, the roof of Lucky Cement’s factory glints with solar panels soaking up rays. Below, inside a quiet control room, sit rows of lithium-ion batteries made by Chinese company CATL.
While the plant usually draws from the national grid when possible, these batteries can power it during the blackouts that have become an almost daily problem.
Across Pakistan’s busy industrial zones – from Faisalabad’s textile mills to food processing units in Sindh – an increasing number of businesses are turning to solar panels paired with batteries.
They, along with wealthier households, are trying to cope with soaring electricity prices and frequent load shedding, where power is shut off to parts of the grid to ease the strain on power stations. Helping drive this change is an unexpected factor: China producing more batteries than it can use.
But rather than continuing to rely on Chinese battery and solar products, Pakistan needs policies that promote their manufacture domestically, that make this tech accessible to poorer communities, and encourage safe recycling.
China has, Pakistan needs
China has, over the last few years, massively expanded its battery-production capacity to meet the needs of its electric vehicle (EV) industry and government green-energy goals. Over three-quarters of the world’s batteries are produced in China, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). However, EV sales in Europe and other markets have recently slowed, leaving Chinese companies with a surplus.
Pakistan, meanwhile, has been facing a growing energy crisis marked by regular power outages and unaffordable electricity. The main causes are underinvestment in infrastructure and reliance on expensive fossil-fuel imports. Pakistan is therefore an ideal market for Chinese battery manufacturers, who are now exporting their products at lower prices.
Though the precise proportion is not publicly available, Pakistan currently imports the majority of its lithium batteries from China, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The price of lithium-based battery packs fell by 20% in 2024, partly driven by competition among Chinese companies, according to the IEA. Data from IEEFA indicated a significant uptick in Pakistan’s lithium battery imports in the first two months of this year. If that trend continues, imports could nearly double in 2025 compared to 2024.
Solar + Battery = win?
Pakistanis have been using solar panels for years, especially in rural areas. However, without proper storage, the benefits can only be felt during the day. Now, the combination of solar panels with battery-storage systems is transforming how power is managed. In the nine months between July 2024 and March 2025, Pakistan imported 12.7 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV – astonishing given its total installed power generation capacity from all sources of 46.6 GW.
If they already have solar panels, people are connecting them to Chinese lithium batteries to store the power they generate. Meanwhile, commercial consumers and people in newly electrifying areas are purchasing combined solar-battery systems.
These new solar-battery systems make power available at night or during outages. For factories, shops and offices that need a constant power supply, and usually rely on diesel generators, this is a major improvement.
In Faisalabad, a textile mill owner told me that he cut his diesel consumption by 70% after installing a 1.5 megawatt-hour battery system. “It cost us a lot upfront,” he said, “but we expect to recover the investment in three years. More importantly, we are no longer at the mercy of the utility company”.
In wealthy urban neighbourhoods of Lahore, developers are now offering houses with built-in solar-and-battery systems as standard features. In Sindh, some wealthier farmers are using solar-powered tube wells with battery backup to pump water even at night.
This silent revolution is happening across the country. From cold storage units in Balochistan to small IT firms in Islamabad, solar-battery combos are helping people stay productive during hours-long power cuts.
The powerless
But while businesses and wealthier families are benefiting, many poorer communities are being left behind. Solar-battery systems are still expensive, and government support for clean energy is minimal. Microfinance loans for solar installations are hard to come by, especially in rural area and informal urban settlements. Underprivileged people often lack land papers or collateral, making banks and microfinance groups hesitant to issue loans.
Asad Mehmood, a development specialist in Islamabad, warns this trend could worsen inequality. “When clean energy becomes a luxury for the few, you risk deepening social divisions. Energy access is a right, not a privilege,” he says.
In many katchi abadis (informal settlements), people still rely on illegal electricity connections. Poorly ventilated diesel generators are also common, exposing people to high energy costs and health risks.
Meanwhile, small shopkeepers and farmers, already struggling with inflation, find it difficult to invest in solar setups even though it would save them money long term. Without policy support, clean energy may remain out of reach for the people who need it most.
Dumping ground or development partner?
There is also growing concern among energy experts that Pakistan might become over-reliant on Chinese manufacturers.
On condition of anonymity, an energy researcher at the Lahore University of Management Sciences says: “Yes, we are getting affordable technology, but we are also becoming extremely dependent on one source. What if China changes its export policies or battery prices go up again?”
There is also the growing need to properly recycle or dispose of batteries. Currently, Pakistan has a 0% e-waste collection rate, according to the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership. Most lithium-ion batteries end up in landfills or are dismantled by informal workers without any safety measures. This can lead to chemical pollution, fire hazards and severe health risks.
In 2020, Pakistan pledged to generate 60% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. By 2023, the proportion was 40% if nuclear is included and 26% if not, according to Ember. Solar-battery systems could help achieve the 60% target faster than large-scale dams or wind farms, which often face delays and political hurdles.
But right now, this green shift is happening without proper rules or planning. There are no dedicated national standards for battery installation, storage or safety. There is no clear integration of small solar-battery systems into the main power grid. Most of the transition is being driven by private individuals and businesses acting out of necessity.
A chance to rethink energy
Pakistan’s move to solar-battery systems offers a real chance to address the country’s energy problems while helping the planet. But we must be careful. The current shift is happening more because of market pressure than proper planning.
If Pakistan wants this energy shift to truly benefit everyone, several important steps need to be taken.
The government must create proper battery-recycling laws to safely manage electronic waste and prevent environmental damage.
Clear standards must also be set for the quality of products and installation practices to avoid accidents and substandard equipment being imported.
Subsidies and accessible loan options should be introduced, to make solar-battery systems more accessible, especially for small-scale farmers, shopkeepers and low-income families.
Lastly, Pakistan should invest in developing local industries to produce key components domestically, reducing reliance on foreign imports and strengthening energy independence.
We need national policies that make clean energy fair, safe and lasting. We must build a system that supports both businesses and poor households. And we must ensure the technology we import today doesn’t become waste that we can’t handle tomorrow.
As the sun continues to shine on the rooftops of Pakistan, solar panels and batteries are quietly powering homes, shops and factories. But they are also raising an important question. Are we shaping our energy future, or are we just reacting to what the world gives us?

Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar — already among the poorest performers in press freedoms — posted the biggest falls, the report by the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) said.
The fourth-biggest drop was in South Korea, it added, citing “a spike in defamation cases initiated by the government and its political allies against journalists, and raids on journalists’ residences”.
“The current state of democracy in the world is concerning,” IDEA secretary general Kevin Casas-Zamora, secretary general told AFP.
More than half of countries in the world (54 per cent), registered a drop in one of the five key democracy indicators between 2019 and 2024, the report said.
“The most important finding in our report is the very acute deterioration in press freedom around the world,” Casas-Zamora said.
Between 2019 and 2024, it saw “the biggest drop over the past 50 years”.
“We’ve never seen such an acute deterioration in a key indicator of democratic health,” he said.
Press freedoms declined in 43 countries across all continents, including 15 in Africa and 15 in Europe.
 
 

“There’s a toxic brew that is coming together, which involves, on the one hand, heavy-handed interventions on the part of governments,” some of them “legacies of what happened during the pandemic”.
On the other hand, “you have the very negative impact of disinformation, some of which is real disinformation and some of which is used as a pretext by governments to clamp down on press freedoms”.
The think tank is concerned about the consolidation of traditional media worldwide, as well as the “disappearance in many countries of local media which plays a very important role in supporting a democratic debate”, Casas-Zamora said.
The report only covers the period 2019 to 2024 and does not include the first effects of US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January.
But “some of the things that we saw during the election at the end of last year and in the first few months of 2025 are fairly disturbing”, Casas-Zamora said.
“Since what happens in the US has this ability to go global, this does not bode well for democracy globally,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-11 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11120756d52de67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941189/2-dead-4-injured-in-kps-mansehra-as-vehicle-plunges-into-ravine' target='_blank'><strong>2 dead, 4 injured in KP’s Mansehra as vehicle plunges into ravine</strong></a><br><p>Two women were killed, while four people were injured after the jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mansehra district, police said on Thursday.
Shenkiari Station House Officer Muhammad Saqib told Dawn.com that a jeep heading towards the Jabori area fell into a ravine due to landslide debris following heavy rains on the road.
“The local people rushed to the scene after the accident and retrieved the victims from the ravine. Two of them were [found] dead,” he said, adding that four others were injured in the incident, including three children and a driver.
He also said that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Shenkiari Rural Health Centre, while two of the injured were later taken to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital for further treatment.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
Earlier this month, two people were killed and 24 others sustained critical injuries when a wagon carrying participants of a wedding procession skidded off the road and plunged into a deep ravine in Balakot.
At least two local tourists were killed in an accident after their car plunged into a ravine in the Kaghan area in June.
In April, five people were killed and eight others were injured when a passenger jeep plunged into a ravine in Mansehra’s Jabori area of Siren Valley.</p><small>2025-09-11 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111208381f02ec9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941041/uzbekistan-airways-to-increase-flights-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Uzbekistan Airways to increase flights to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As part of efforts to deepen ties, enhance economic diplomacy and boost tourism cooperation, Uzbekistan Airways is increasing the number of regular flights between the two countries.
The Uzbek embassy in Islamabad said on Wednesday that Uzbekistan and Pakistan continued to strengthen their friendly relations and expand cooperation across multiple sectors. In this process, transport and logistics, particularly air connectivity, played a crucial role.
Starting October 28, the frequency of flights on ‘Tashkent-Islamabad-Tashkent’ route will be doubled, from once a week to two flights per week.
Currently, Uzbekistan Airways operated flights twice a week — on Wednesdays and Fridays — on the ‘Tashkent-Lahore-Tashkent’ route, and once a week (on Saturdays) on the ‘Tashkent-Islamabad-Tashkent’ route.
Due to consistently high demand, with flights running at full passenger capacity and tickets selling out several days in advance, the airline had decided to expand its flight schedule.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said increase in flight frequency would not only provide greater convenience for travelers but also foster closer trade and economic cooperation, encourage business partnerships and support more frequent exchanges between the two nations.
The embassy said these additional flights would also strengthen cultural and humanitarian ties between the brotherly peoples of Uzbekistan and Pakistan.
 
 

Furthermore, the expansion of flights offers significant advantages for international travelers. Tashkent International Airport serves as a strategic transit hub, providing convenient connections from Pakistan to destinations across Europe, North America, and Asia. This made Uzbekistan Airways an attractive option for passengers seeking smooth and efficient travel to global destinations.
According to the Uzbek embassy, the regular expansion of flight frequencies was a strategic step for both Uzbekistan and Pakistan, reflecting the growing partnership between the two nations and taking bilateral relations to a new level of cooperation and connectivity.

Vice President JD Vance was expected to attend memorial events at Ground Zero in Manhattan, where the World Trade Centre’s twin towers were destroyed in coordinated attacks that also saw a jetliner crash into the nerve centre of American military power, the Pentagon in Washington.
Another jet, Flight 93, crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside when passengers overran the hijacker and took control of the aircraft.
This year’s gathering takes place against a backdrop of sharp political division both in the city and nationally.
New York is in the grip of an unprecedented mayoral election campaign in which socialist Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing off against former governor Andrew Cuomo and sitting mayor Eric Adams.
 
 

New Yorkers go to the polls on November 4.
It was unclear which of the mayoral candidates would attend the ceremony, which is always attended by the sitting mayor as well as community leaders.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Mamdani, a Muslim and naturalised US citizen, calling him a “communist lunatic”, while one Republican lawmaker has called for the race’s frontrunner to be deported.
Mamdani holds a 22-point lead in the race, according to the latest polling from The New York Times and Siena.
“It was this horrific day that was also for many New Yorkers the moment at which they were marked an ‘other,’” Mamdani told The Times, describing the surge in Islamophobic attacks that followed 9/11.
It was unclear if Trump would attend New York’s commemorative events as he has in years past.
The United States has faced a rash of political violence in recent months, with the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk following the targeted killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and the firebombing of a Democratic governor’s residence.
 
 

New York will mark a citywide moment of silence at 8:46am (5:46pm PKT), the time that hijacked Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Centre.
Places of worship across the city will sound their bells to mark the impact as families of the victims read the names of those killed at ground zero.
The official death toll was 2,977, including the passengers and crew of the four hijacked planes, victims in the twin towers, firefighters, and personnel at the Pentagon. The death toll excludes the 19 Al-Qaeda hijackers.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11113512bfef699.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941184/china-inside-how-chinese-ev-tech-is-reshaping-global-auto-design' target='_blank'><strong>‘China Inside’: How Chinese EV tech is reshaping global auto design</strong></a><br><p>When Audi executives first saw the Zeekr 001 in 2021, a long-range electric vehicle with European aesthetics, it was a wake-up call for the premium German auto brand — if it wanted to compete with the Chinese, it needed their technology.
“The Zeekr 001 back then shocked quite everyone,” said Stefan Poetzl, president of SAIC Audi Sales and Marketing. “We needed to do something about it.”
To boost its EV lineup for Chinese consumers, Audi built the AUDI E5 Sportback in just 18 months using technology provided by Chinese partner SAIC, including batteries, electric powertrain, infotainment software and advanced driving assisted systems.
Audi expects to start delivering the $33,000 EV to customers in China this month and its global rivals are now also looking to use Chinese intellectual property to roll out new models rapidly.
Toyota and Volkswagen have joint development plans for China-dedicated models with technology from Chinese partners GAC and Xpeng, respectively.
Renault and Ford want to go one step further and develop global models on Chinese EV platforms, sources said. Renault did not respond to a request for comment. Ford declined to comment.
Such licensing deals make up relatively small but growing revenue streams for Chinese EV makers and, for now, offer a new quid-pro-quo. Global automakers need Chinese technology to leapfrog development hurdles and launch new EVs quickly.
Meanwhile, Chinese companies desperately need additional revenue amid a bruising price war at home and intensifying trade war abroad.
“It is a very smart, win-win solution,” said Will Wang, General Manager of Shanghai-based consulting firm Autodatas, which provides teardown reports of best-selling EV models.

‘China Inside’
This new strategy resembles the “Intel Inside” campaign of the 1990s — where US chipmaker Intel used state-of-the-art components to transform computers into premium products.
In this case, Chinese automakers sell EV technology in a box: the underpinnings for ready-to-build, white label battery-powered cars suitable even for low-volume manufacturers with small budgets.
Leapmotor has partnered with Stellantis to sell its EVs outside China and is talking to other brands to license its technology, CEO Zhu Jiangming told Reuters.
Using a ready-made Chinese EV chassis and software could save billions of dollars and years of development time and help traditional automakers catch up with Chinese rivals, auto industry experts say.
Renault was an early adopter, building the low-cost Dacia Spring EV on a platform from China’s Dongfeng for sale in Europe starting in 2021.
Renault has gone one step further with the new electric Twingo under development at its research centre in Shanghai, with a Chinese EV engineering firm Launch Design providing technical support in developing an EV platform, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Launch did not respond to requests for comment.
Other “China Inside” models could be coming soon. Ford is seeking a Chinese partner to provide EV platform technologies, said two people with knowledge of the matter. CEO Jim Farley has frequently tested Chinese EVs and recently praised Xiaomi’s SU7 electric sedan.
Volkswagen has expanded plans to develop China-dedicated models of all fuel types based on platforms co-developed with Xpeng, using the latter’s layout designs of electronics and software.
Analysts say legacy automakers typically struggle to develop agile EV systems that can be rapidly updated, due to complicated organisational structures.
That is why Volkswagen wants to see if Xpengs EV technologies can complement or replace Volkswagen’s own, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. If it works in China, Volkswagen could apply the strategy globally, Zhang added.
A Volkswagen China spokesperson told Reuters its collaboration with Xpeng was focused on China for now.
Xpeng’s He Xiaopeng has said the two automakers want to expand their partnership beyond China. That would boost Xpeng’s revenue without building plants overseas, said Autodatas’ Wang.
Oliver Wyman analyst Marco Santino said traditional automakers could use “firepower” of fierce Chinese EV competition to jump ahead of the development curve.
“You get a much more quality-proof product in the market in a shorter timeframe,” Santino said.

More choice?
Inspired by Tesla, China’s EV makers have developed modular platforms that cut costs and accelerate development and lower barriers of entry.
“They are quick learners from Tesla,” said Forest Tu, a former executive at Chinese battery giant CATL who founded consulting firm Mapleview Technology.
That advantage is now big enough to sustain “licensing and royalty service” as Chinese EV makers expand overseas, Tu said.
CATL adopted that approach with Ford, licensing its technology for a battery plant. Exporting Chinese technology could help less-industrialised countries build their own “national EV brands,” Tu said.
Abu Dhabi-based CYVN Holdings, a strategic investor in Nio, has developed its own premium EV model using the Chinese EV maker’s chassis and software.
CYVN bought British sports car maker McLaren in April and now plans to sell its EV using the McLaren brand, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But future models will incorporate far more McLaren “DNA” and less Chinese technology, one source said.
Nio declined to comment. CYVN did not respond to a request for comment.
CATL’s new EV chassis, meanwhile, will allow consumers to “decide what an EV looks like, rather than having giant automakers decide what to sell,” its executive president Hu Guoliang said.
CATL said it would ramp up chassis production in the next three years after signing with several domestic automakers. Its Bedrock Chassis debuted in Europe this week at the IAA Mobility show in Munich.
Whether the mutual benefits of China’s EV technology last over the longer-term, however, remains a key question.
Former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer said while there were savings in R&D, automakers should avoid over-reliance on third-party technology. “In the long-term you’re screwed because you’re just a retailer,” said Palmer.
Oliver Wyman’s Santino said the big risk for traditional automakers is that using someone else’s technology means “your capability to differentiate your brand is really limited.”
By blending in their own technology, automakers can “limit the risk,” Santino added.

The Tokyo Olympic champion, Chopra, and his successor in Paris, Nadeem, will line up at the athletics world championships for their first encounter since the nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in a four-day conflict in May, their worst since 1999.
Chopra, who took Olympic silver behind his great rival a year ago, had often spoken about his friendly relations with Nadeem despite the tensions between their countries.
After Nadeem won gold and Chopra stood alongside him on the podium in Paris, Nadeem’s mother Raziah Parveen said: “Winning and losing is part of sport, but they are like brothers.” Chopra’s mother Saroj said she took some solace in Nadeem beating her son because the Pakistani “is also our boy”.
But publicly at least that changed after the conflict.
The 27-year-old Chopra, who will defend his world title in Tokyo, said that they were “never really close friends”.
Nadeem, 28, also played down any friendship with Chopra.
“When he won, I congratulated him, and when I won the gold, he returned the same courtesy,” Nadeem told AFP by telephone en route to Tokyo.
“[Just as] in wrestling, one wrestler wins and the other loses — it’s part of the game.”
Invitation withdrawn
Nadeem, who is returning to competition after calf surgery in July, hails from a farming village.
He became an overnight sensation when he gave Pakistan their first Olympic gold in 40 years with a Games-record throw of 92.97m.
Nadeem has competed only once since Paris, winning the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea in May when Chopra did not participate.
The last time the pair clashed was at the Paris Olympics.
In April, the Indian star invited Nadeem to India for his ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ javelin event but the Pakistani declined, saying it clashed with his training schedule.
Chopra then withdrew the invitation after an attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir on April 22 killed 26 people.
India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.
In the conflict that followed more than 70 people were killed.
“I want to clarify that I don’t have a particularly strong relationship with Nadeem, we were never really close friends,” Chopra said afterwards.
“But because of the current situation, things will not be as they were. That said, if someone speaks to me with respect, I always respond in kind.”
Fine form
Chopra became a national hero in India after his Tokyo gold, earning million-dollar endorsement deals with his boyish charm, changing hairstyles and infectious smile.
He won the world title in Budapest in 2023 and has been in fine form since joining Czech javelin great Jan Zelezny’s coaching group ahead of the 2025 season. He went past 90m for the first time when he threw 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League meeting in May, but finished second to German Julian Weber.
At the Zurich Diamond League last month, Weber once again stood on top of the podium, with a throw of 91.51m. Chopra was second with 85.01m. Along with Weber, also in Tokyo will be two-time world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada.
The world championships start on Saturday, with the men’s javelin final on September 18.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11090241a08b1c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941079/nepals-former-cj-accepts-request-to-lead-interim-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Nepal’s former CJ ‘accepts request’ to lead interim govt</strong></a><br><p>• Soldiers guard parliament, patrol streets after two days of deadly protests
• Kathmandu airport reopens; over 13,500 prisoners escaped during unrest
KATHMANDU: Soldiers guarded Ne­­p­al’s parliament and patrolled deserted streets on Wednesday with the capital Kathmandu under a curfew, as the country’s former chief justice Sushila Karki claimed to have “accepted Gen Z protesters’ request to lead interim government” after two days of deadly anti-corruption protests forced Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign.
The upheaval in the poor Himalayan nation was unleashed by a social media ban that was announced last week but was rolled back after 19 people were killed on Monday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to control crowds.
The death toll from the protests had risen to 25 by Wednesday, Nepal’s health ministry said, while 633 were injured.
Nepal’s army said that relevant parties were coordinating to tackle the situation after the protests and resolve the issue. Media also said preparations were being made for authorities and protesters to hold talks, without giving details.
Most of the protesters were young people voicing frustration at the government’s perceived failure to fight corruption and boost economic opportunities, leading to the demonstrations being dubbed the “Gen Z protests”.
The young agitators want former chief justice Karki as the interim prime minister, said Raman Kumar Karna, the secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Associ­a­tion, who was consulted by the protesters.
“When they requested me, I accepted,” Karki told Indian news channel CNN-News18.
“Gen Z” representatives told reporters that they met army officials later and proposed Karki as their choice to head an interim government.
Ministers’ homes set ablaze
Burnt-out vehicles and twisted metal littered the area around parliament, where army firefighters battled to douse a blaze in the main hall, while the building’s exterior was charred after protesters set it ablaze on Tuesday.
TV footage showed youths cleaning up some damaged buildings and clearing debris from roads and the areas near parliament.
Several other government buildings, from the supreme court to ministers’ homes, including Oli’s private residence, were also set ablaze in the protests, with the unrest subsiding only after the resignation.
Armoured vehicles kept vigil in streets that were largely deserted, with shops and markets shut. Firefighters were engaged at different locations, while the process of clearing roads was also under way, army spokesman Raja Ram Basnet said.
“We are trying to normalise the situation first. We are committed to protect the life and property of people,” Basnet said, adding that prisoners had set Kathmandu’s Dilli Bazar Jail on fire before the army controlled the situation.
Nepali police said on Wednesday that more than 13,500 prisoners broke out of jails across the country during anti-government protests this week.
The main airport in Kathmandu also reopened on Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said, more than 24 hours after flights had been suspended.
Army warns of ‘strict action’ In a post on X, the army said prohibitory orders imposing a curfew would remain in force until Thursday morning.
“Any demonstrations, vandalism, looting, arson, and attacks on individuals and property in the name of protest will be considered punishable crimes and strict action will be taken by security personnel,” the post said.
For years a lack of jobs has driven millions to seek work in countries such as Malaysia, the Middle East and South Korea, mainly on construction sites, so as to send money home.

Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people.
The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later.
State police issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.
“There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals,” the statement said. “There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.”
In a video message taped in the Oval Office and posted to Trump’s Truth Social online platform, the president vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.
“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it,” Trump said.
Cellphone video clips of the killing posted online showed Kirk addressing a large outdoor crowd on the campus, about 40 miles (64 km) south of Salt Lake City, around 12:20 pm MT (18:20 GMT or 23:20 PKT), when a gunshot rang out. Kirk moved his hand toward his neck as he fell off his chair, sending onlookers running.
In another clip, blood could be seen gushing from Kirk’s neck immediately after the shot.
Jeff Long, chief of the university police department, said he had six officers working the event and coordinated with the head of Kirk’s private security team, which was also on site. Trump ordered US flags flown at half-staff until Sunday in Kirk’s honour.
The killing was the latest in a series of attacks on US political figures, including two assassination attempts on Trump last year, that have underscored a sharp rise in political violence.
“This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,” Utah’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox said at the press conference. “I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.”
With the suspect still at large, there was no clear evidence of a motive for the act of violence.
Trump, who routinely describes political rivals, judges and others who stand in his way as “radical left lunatics” and warns that they pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric.
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” Trump said in the video. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”
On Capitol Hill in Washington, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the US House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing.
Kirk’s appearance on Wednesday was the first in a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.

Asked about shootings, then shot
Seconds before he was shot, the married father of two young children was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, according to multiple videos of the event posted online.
“Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked.
He responded, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” He was shot moments later.
Kirk and the group he co-founded, Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.
After winning his second presidential term, Trump credited Kirk for mobilising younger voters and voters of colour in support of his campaign.
“You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,” Trump said at a rally in Phoenix in December. “It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.”
Kirk had 5.3 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio program, “The Charlie Kirk Show.” He had also recently appeared as a guest co-host on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” He was part of an ecosystem of pro-Trump conservative influencers including Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens and others, who helped to amplify the president’s agenda.
Kirk frequently attacked mainstream media and engaged in culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.
At the White House, staff members, many of them young and admirers of Kirk, were ashen-faced as news of the shooting spread.

Political violence on the rise
Republican and Democratic politicians alike expressed dismay over the shooting.
Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement: “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values. We pray for his family during this tragedy.”
The US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
In July 2024, Republican Trump was grazed by a gunman’s bullet during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. A second assassination attempt two months later was foiled by federal agents, with opening arguments in that suspect’s trial set to begin on Thursday.
In April, an arsonist broke into Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.
Earlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic Senator John Hoffman and his wife. And in Boulder, Colorado, a man used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a solidarity event for Israeli hostages, killing one woman and injuring at least six more.
In 2022, a man broke into Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer, leaving him with skull fractures and other injuries.
In 2020, a group of right-wing militia members plotted unsuccessfully to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

• HRCP highlights plight of climate refugees
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has ente­red this year’s flood season with more substantial economic buffers than it had before the 2022-23 floods, but the country’s improved macroeconomic situation comes with new constraints, according to a `targeted analysis’ carried out by the Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWS) Network.
The analysis expects that the 2025 floods will primarily drive short-term, localised, food insecurity among flood-affected households.
Produced at the request of the US government as a part of FEWS NET’s global coverage, the report notes that this time, the flood response will be constrained by limited fiscal intervention capacity, in contrast to the emergency subsidies in 2022-23.
The 37-month IMF Extended Fund Facility explicitly prohibits the use of untargeted subsidies and market interventions that were used during the previous floods.
According to the analysis, increases of eight to 10 per cent in wheat prices are expected in coming months due to flood-related market supply disruptions, but will likely return to near-normal levels once affected roads are restored.
However, production losses of Kharif season crops due to flooding are expected, particularly for rice, sugarcane, cotton, and vegetables.
The government can deploy foreign reserves in the event that emergency imports are needed, and negative food inflation provides a substantial cushion against the level of price spikes that devastated household purchasing power in 2022, according to the analysis.
 
 

The ongoing floods are expected to affect the Kharif season, which started in April. While complete information on the extent of crop damage due to flooding is not yet available, early findings indicate a significant localised impact.
They are expected, however, to affect household income from agricultural labour and crop sales, particularly in Punjab, the report warns.
HRW report
In a separate statement, global rights watchdog Human Rights Watch has called upon the government to address unchecked development amid a changing climate.
It noted that unchecked development exacerbates the effects of floods, and one representative example is the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project, which the government launched in August 2020 to address Lahore’s many problems — pollution, sewage, water, housing and employment — while aiming to revive the city’s “lost glory”.
This is just the latest in a string of failures by successive governments in Pakistan to enact needed reforms and policies to regulate development, HRW said.
It assailed the government over its history of conducting “poor quality environmental assessments for politically connected infrastructure projects”.
“In this case, it ignored warnings by independent environmental activists and experts who called the project ecologically and financially unviable and argued that building barrages and other dams on the river and replacing farmland with paved concrete could swell water levels upstream and cause flooding.”
Today, most of the area earmarked for the project is submerged, along with parts of Lahore city itself, HRW regretted.
Protecting the vulnerable
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), has called for expanding the rescue and relief operations that are currently underway, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable segments.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the rights body highlighted the plight of climate refugees, who have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods.
“Particular attention must be given to the most vulnerable — women, children, the elderly and persons living with disabilities.”

According to industry leaders, industrial output remained subdued as workers failed to report for duty due to safety concerns and transportation issues.
Faisal Moiz Khan, President of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI), stated that nearly half of the 4,500 industrial units in the area remained closed. Workers were reluctant to return after the torrential rains in the third week of August left several people stranded in factories late into the night.
 


Additionally, around 100-125 factories in sectors A to D in F.B. Area, including export-oriented units, suffered damage as the swollen Lyari River inundated production facilities, destroying raw materials and finished goods worth millions of rupees.
Moiz pointed out that the overflow from Thado Dam had submerged roads leading to the Super Highway, exacerbating the city’s already struggling infrastructure. “The city faces serious problems during the rains due to poor infrastructure,” he added. NKATI represents 70 per cent of Karachi’s export-oriented industries.

Flooding destroys raw materials, disrupts supply chain

Ahmed Azeem Alvi, President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), echoed similar concerns, reporting that 60pc of workers in 3,500 factories did not report to work despite there being no significant road blockages. “A shortage of workers has led to a 25-30pc reduction in production activities,” Alvi said, adding that workers were hesitant to leave their homes due to fears of being unable to return if the rains worsened.
In the Korangi industrial area, which houses over 4,000 factories, the output was down by 30pc due to a low turnout of workers, who accounted for less than 50pc of the usual workforce.
Junaid Naqi, President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), mentioned that entry points to the area were closed in the morning, and workers were already on edge due to the overflow of Lyari and Malir rivers. Additionally, power disruptions, caused by tripping of feeder lines, further worsened the situation, leading to the suspension of multiple shifts.
 
 

Sheikh Mohammad Tehseen, President of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), said that production activities across industrial zones had been severely affected, with factory attendance down by 50-60pc.
“The supply chain has been disrupted, slowing down the delivery of raw materials and cargo shipments to seaports,” he added. Tehseen also urged the government to collaborate with industrial associations to restore business activities and normalise the economic cycle.
The e-commerce sector also faced challenges as logistical disruptions hindered the movement of goods. Shoaib Bhatti, President of the Pakistan eCommerce Association (PEA) Karachi, reported delays in shipments both domestically and internationally, with quick commerce services suspended in various parts of the city. Long electricity and internet outages further hampered online shopping services, causing losses for e-commerce businesses.
Rauf Ibrahim, Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), noted that 80-90pc of shops in key wholesale trade areas, including Dandia Bazaar, Jodia Bazaar, and Lea Market, remained closed.
The remaining 10-20pc of shops that were open closed by 2 pm due to the adverse weather conditions. The combined impact of heavy rains, flooding, and infrastructural limitations has caused widespread disruption in Karachi’s industrial and commercial sectors, with long-term effects expected if the situation does not improve soon.

National Paigham-i-Aman body is a subcommittee of National Committee
on Narrative Building
Senate committee alarmed by misuse of Peca by provinces

ISLAMABAD: The government has notified a special panel — comprising clerics, religious leaders of non-Muslim communities and senior officials — to counter extremism, hate speech, terrorism and sectarianism in the country.
The Ministry of Information has set up the National Paigham-i-Aman Commit­tee (NPAC), which will draft a unified national stance against extremism and terrorism.
The NPAC, a subcommittee of the National Committee on Narrative Building (NCNB), has been tasked with devising a unified national narrative that promotes peace, harmony and religious moderation.
The NCNB, which was notified earlier this month, is a 20-member body that includes the information ministers of all four provinces, GB and AJK, as well as federal minister. It also includes representatives of the military, intelligence agencies, the foreign and IT ministries, as well as the PTA chairman.
It is meant to deal with “information operation, formulation, dissemination, propagation and evaluation of [the] national narrative against the spread of terrorism [or] extremism through media, communication and cyber networks for smooth implementation of Revised National Action Plan 2021,” according to a notification.
Meanwhile, the director general of the Internal Publicity Wing of the information ministry will serve as the NPAC secretary, while Maulana Tahir Ashrafi has been appointed its coordinator.
 
 

The committee’s first meeting will focus on formulating its terms of reference, which will be submitted to the NCNB for approval.
Speaking to Dawn, Allama Arif Wahidi said the committee could be seen as an extension of the Paigham-i-Pakistan initiative, launched in 2018. “The Paigham-i-Pakistan narrative was the theoretical step to counter religious extremism. The target of this committee is to implement the idea and devise practical steps to stop the dividing forces in society,” he said, adding that these steps would also be implemented by provinces.
Allama Tahir Ashrafi told Dawn that the move reflected the government’s intent to adopt a more inclusive and strategic approach to peacebuilding through institutional coordination. He added that the initiative aims to centralise national efforts to craft and disseminate a cohesive narrative countering extremism in multiple dimensions — religious, sectarian and ideological.
Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee voiced reservations after being informed that provinces were still registering cybercrime cases under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), despite amendments barring them from doing so.
 
 

The Senate Standing Committee on Information, while reviewing the implementation of Peca, expressed concern that the law was being misused.
Director general of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the committee, chaired by Senator Syed Ali Zafar, that 10 journalists were currently facing cases under Peca, adding that 611 cases of financial fraud and 320 of harassment were also under investigation.
The committee members noted that under recent amendments, the provinces were no longer authorised to register cases under to Peca 2025, which must now be referred to the NCCIA. The officials said that any cases filed by provincial authorities after the amendment were invalid. “All these cases are illegal — now what should we do with them?” asked the committee chairman.
The lawmakers decided to form a subcommittee to review the issue of illegal case registrations. Senator Zafar ruled that 378 cases registered under Peca by provincial authorities were unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

The Anti-Terrorism Balochistan (Amendment) Bill 2025 was tabled by Parliamentary Secretary Mir Zareen Khan Magsi on behalf of the provincial home department, whose minister in-charge is Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.
The bill said it aimed to strengthen the counter-terrorism framework in accordance with international standards. “In light of the evolving security challenges and the sensitive nature of terrorism related cases, the bill see­ks to empower the government to implement add­i­tional protective measures for the safety and security of judges, public prosecutors, defence counsels, witnesses, and other individuals involved in such proceedings,” it said.
The bill introduces a procedure for handling “sensitive terrorism-related cases through a confidentially appointed BS-21 officer”. This officer, who will remain anonymous, would determine whether a case required extraordinary protection under this new iteration of the anti-terrorism measures.
“If so, the chief justice concerned constitutes a panel of five judges and forwards it to the designated authority, who then assigns the case to judge selected from that panel”.
A similar procedure will be adopted for prosecutors from a panel of five in consultation with the prosecutor general concerned. The new amendment also “enables the use of anonymity protocols” as well as virtual proceedings, besides advanced security technologies to safeguard all participants in the trial process.
Similarly, the identities of all those involved in the trial will remain hidden for security purposes and if a courtroom “is used for physical hearings, it shall be situated in secure premises, accessible only to judges, counsels, public prosecutors, witnesses, defence counsels and persons concerned with the trial”.
 
 

Under this bill, the “designated authority” shall be nominated by the provincial government and its identity “shall be kept confidential and shall only be communicated to the chief justice”.
The authority will consult with the chief justice for performing functions, such as deciding whether a case or a class of cases requires extraordinary protection measures, assigning cases to the judges; and consulting and coordinating with the Balochistan government.
“These measures aim to preserve judicial independence, uphold due process, and ensure the effective prosecution of terrorism related offences,” the bill read.
Opposition concerned
JI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman warned that the proposed law would undermine justice and human rights. “We will now serve justice through WhatsApp,” he quipped. According to the JI leader, if any innocent person were killed under the new law, the current government would be responsible. He said that instead of bringing this law, reforms should be introduced in the judiciary. “This law is a murder of human rights and justice,” he claimed.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti defended the bill. He said the counter-terrorism law would not be used against political workers, but solely to punish terrorists in accordance with the law. CM Bugti emphasised that the bill did not deny fair trial rights, and defence lawyers would have access to witnesses before judges.
On the issue of missing persons, the chief minister pledged that the government would permanently resolve the matter through legislation. “Any person arrested will be immediately reported to their family and the magistrate,” he assured. CM Bugti also announced strict action against poppy cultivation, revealing that 35,000 acres of poppy had already been destroyed this year. He vowed to confiscate lands given to Afghan cultivators and end illegal trawling in Makran, calling it “another form of terrorism”.
Levies-police merger
The provincial assembly also passed the Balochistan Forensic Science (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Balochistan Levies Force Bill 2025 under which the Levies would be merged into the Balochistan police.The Maulana argued that the bill required further consultations. Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani, however, noted that the government had invited the opposition for dialogue but could not force their participation.

“In view of the sensitivities attached to the highest institution like the judiciary, it is my humble request to all honourable judges that the best forums for expressing grievances are their tea rooms, the chambers of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, or the committee rooms,” he said.
This marked the minister’s first response to a recent series of letters written by several Supreme Court judges — a development he termed “unfortunate” and part of a troubling trend that has emerged in recent months.
Speaking informally to the media after attending a ceremony outside the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Islamabad, the law minister recalled that even during the New Judicial Year ceremony earlier in the week, apex legal bodies such as the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association had advised judges to resolve such issues privately rather than through public correspondence.
 
 

“This is not in the interest of the judiciary, as such tendencies erode the dignity and reputation of the top court,” he remarked.
He added that if the concerns raised in these letters were genuinely reflective of the internal situation, it was all the more reason to resolve them within institutional boundaries. “Bar councils have always been at the forefront when it comes to safeguarding the judiciary,” he noted, suggesting that lawyers’ bodies remain the appropriate avenue for internal accountability.
The minister’s comments come in the wake of a recent letter by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, along with Justices Munib Akhtar, Ayesha A. Malik, and Athar Minallah, criticizing the convening of Monday’s full court meeting to approve the new Supreme Court Rules 2025 as a mere “cosmetic exercise.”
“The convening of the full court at this stage is not only puzzling but also fallacious,” the judges wrote, alleging that the meeting was intended to give a “veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process.” In a prior letter, Justice Shah questioned whether the CJP was fostering judicial independence or seeking compliance to turn the court into a “regimented force.”
He expressed reluctance in writing the letter but felt compelled by what he described as an “unavoidable institutional duty.” “What compels me to write is your persistent and complete indifference,” he wrote, lamenting that his repe­ated letters and communications on crucial matters had gone unanswered.

• Pakistan, Algeria and Somalia request emergency Security Council session
• MBS, UAE ruler also back Qatar; Canada says will ‘evaluate’ ties with Israel
DOHA / ISLAMABAD / JERUSALEM: As the world rallied around Qatar after Israel’s reckless targeting of Hamas leaders on its soil, it’s leader declared that Benjamin Netanyahu had been wasting their time with the mediation process.
Doha and Egypt have been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
But despite their best efforts, and great flexibility demonstrated by Hamas, Isra­el has repeatedly moved the goalpost, and ‘ghosted’ neg­o­tiators after the Palesti­nian group agreed to the last draft, already vetted by the US.
Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohamed bin Abd­ulrahman Al Thani said the Israeli PM was leading the Middle East towards chaos, adding that today, the entire Gulf region was at risk.
He also revealed that in the wake of the Israeli aggression, Qatar was reassessing everything about its mediating role in the Gaza conflict — as well as Hamas’ future on its territory.
The Qatari PM’s remarks came as the world bristled over Israel’s unprovoked attack, which claimed the lives of at least five members of Hamas’ negotiating team.
Even its most staunch ally, the United States, seemed to waver, with President Donald Trump giving Netanyahu a rare slap on the wrist while denying any role in the attack.
Trump said he was not notified in advance of the Israeli attack on the Gulf state, and said he wasn’t “thrilled about the whole situation”.
Qatar, in addition to its role in the Gaza negotiations, is home to a huge US airbase, and also recently gave Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
“This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” Trump said in a post on social media, insisting that he viewed Qatar as a strong ally and friend.
Trump also focused on the possible damage to his efforts to end the war in Gaza, saying that unilaterally bombing Qatar does not advance Israel or America’s goals.
The US president added that he had assured Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in a phone call that “such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”
Israel, however, doubled down, insisting that it would strike its enemies anywhere in the world.
“There is no place where they can hide,” Defence Minister Isr­ael Katz wrote on X, while Isra­eli ambassador to the US Yech­iel Leiter told Fox News that even if they failed to kill Hamas leaders in Tuesday’s airstrike, the would “succeed next time”.
World rallies around Doha
Pakistan on Wednesday joined Algeria and Somalia in convening an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council and backed calls for a summit of Muslim countries after Israel carried out air strikes in Doha targeting a Hamas delegation of peace negotiators.
The UNSC session, initially scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, was postponed after Qatar requested rescheduling to allow its Prime Minister to attend. The meeting is now set for Thursday.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan had formally requested an urgent UN Security Council session to take up Israel’s “aggression against Qatar as a grave threat to international peace and security”.
He also called on the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, on behalf of the Org­anisation of Islamic Coo­peration (OIC) and in coordination with Gulf states, to hold a debate on the strikes.
The upcoming UNSC meeting is expected to address the serious implications of the Israeli escalation and discuss appropriate international resp­onses.
Saudi Crown Prince Moha­mmed Bin Salman also came out in support of Doha, saying that Riyadh rejected and condemned Israel’s “assaults” in the region.
 
 

“The brutal aggression against the sisterly state of Qatar requires Arab, Islamic and international action,” he said in a televised address, calling on the international community to confront Israeli aggression.
Meanwhile, the attack generated a flurry of diplomacy between Arab states. United Arab Emirates President She­ikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan led a delegation of some of his most senior ministers to Qatar on Wednesday, where he met with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and his cabinet.
Jordan’s Crown Prince Huss­ein is also expected to visit Qatar, while the Saudi crown prince is expected to arrive today Thursday, an official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The visits, which were not previously scheduled, were a show of regional solidarity with Qatar following the Israeli strikes, the official said.
Canada also said it was evaluating its relationship with Israel after the attack on Qatar, saying it considered the action unacceptable, especially given Qatari attempts to facilitate peace in the Middle East.

LAHORE/GUDDU: With South Punjab still in the throes of a devastating flood crisis, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has confirmed a high-lev­el flood situation, particularly in the Sutlej River, after India relea­sed more water on Wednesday.
All barrages in south Punjab on the Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi rivers are flowing at extremely dangerous levels, submerging vast swathes of low-lying areas and posing a severe threat to urban centres, such as Jalalpur, Alipur and Rahim Yar Khan tehsils.
Flood conditions in Jalalpur Pirwala, one of the most badly affected areas, intensified again after the Sutlej started rising and increased pressure on a major embankment.
On Wednesday, a rescue boat carrying 19 people overturned in the area, leading to the death of a child. All others were safely rescued, officials said.
Seven villages in Liaquatpur have been submerged due to the floods. In Alipur, a child died and five people went missing after a boat capsized.
The situation has worsened further due to the breach of the Azm­a­tpur embankment in the Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district.
The ancient city of Seetpur is now at severe risk from floodwaters. Dozens of settlements, inclu­ding Khairpur Sadat, Khan Garh Doma, Azmatpur, Kundarala and Sultanpur, have been inundated.
Water flow
According to Flood Forecasting Data released at 11pm on Wednesday, the water flow at Ganda Singh Wala headworks on the Sutlej River was 182,188 cusecs (steady trend) and was classified as “very high flood”.
Downstream, the flow was steady at 121,698 cusecs (high flood) at Sulemanki headworks and 121,010 (high flood) at Islam headworks.
On the Ravi River, the water flow was normal at both Jassar and Shahdara headworks and was in low flood at Balloki. However, at Sidhnai headworks, the flow was categorised as “very high” at 94,556 cusecs (falling trend).
On the Chenab River, the flow at Panjnad was “very high” at 598,731 cusecs (rising) and “medium” at Trimmu at 231,154 cusecs (steady). The flow at other headworks on the river — Marala, Khanki, Qadirabad and Chiniot — was normal.
Meanwhile, Guddu Barrage recorded a brief spell of high flood on Wednesday morning before returning to medium flood levels by the afternoon, leaving officials puzzled as the anticipated peak has yet to arrive fully.
 
 

The barrage reached high flood stage at 6am with an upstream inflow of 502,844 cusecs and downstream discharge of 492,443 cusecs. “This indicated a high flood when the barrage passed a flow of 500,000 cusecs,” an official said.
Guddu Barrage Chief Engineer Sardar Shah said that following the morning surge, about 10,000 cusecs were diverted into the Begar Sindh Feeder canal on the right bank, which irrigates rice-growing districts in the command area.
Soon after, flows at Guddu fell to 493,281 cusecs upstream and 471,549 cusecs downstream by 1pm. By 11pm on Wednesday, the inflow was 495,509 cusecs, and the outflow was 472,094.
A gauge at Chachran also showed a decline, dropping from 10.5 feet to 10.3 feet by afternoon, indicating the Indus rise had been short-lived.
Mr Shah noted that with a 48-hour time lag between Panjnad and Guddu, the peak recorded at Panjnad on the evening of Sept 7 should have reached Guddu by Tuesday night. Instead, the rise was observed on Sept 10. He said if another peak is building upstream, it could arrive late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, authorities at Sukkur Barrage said they were monitoring the situation closely. Upstream discharge at Sukkur was recorded at 405,665 cusecs and downstream at 382,355 cusecs, with officials watching for the expected peak.
Evacuations accelerated
Meanwhile, Punjab’s Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that over 4,400 villages have been affected due to severe flooding in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
He said that 2,190 villages were affected due to flooding in the Chenab River, 651 villages in the Sutlej River and 1,495 villages in the Ravi River.
More than 4.2 million people have been affected due to the flood situation in the rivers, while 2.19m  people trapped in the floods have been relocated to safe locations.
He said that 404 relief camps and 488 medical camps were established in districts severely affected by floods.
Besides, 421 veterinary camps have been established to provide treatment facilities for livestock. In the affected districts, 1.581m animals have been relocated to safe locations during rescue and relief activities.
Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, while Tarbela Dam is 100pc full, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is 90pc full, Pong Dam is 99pc full and Thein Dam is 97pc full. He said that 76 citizens lost their lives in various incidents.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said that the intensity of monsoon rains has decreased and no further increase in river flows was expected.
However, a Met office forecast indicated that isolated showers were expected in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and the Pothohar region.
Five dead in Karachi
In Karachi, five people were killed and hundreds rescued as heavy downpours and hill torrents from the Kirthar range swelled the Lyari and Malir rivers to record levels, inundating low-lying neighbourhoods and damaging infrastructure.
Floodwaters submerged homes in Gadap, Scheme 33 and along the M-9 motorway, with major relief operations carried out by Edhi Foundation, Rescue 1122, security forces and civic agencies.
A 20-metre section of the Hub Canal and a gas pipeline were damaged, while part of the under-construction Malir Expressway collapsed. Authorities suspended heavy traffic on the M-9 amid fears of further inflows from Balochistan.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said more than 400 people were rescued in the city, while 172 people stranded on the motorway were evacuated.
Separately, four bodies were recovered from a flash flood incident in Gadap Town and a teenage boy died of electrocution in North Nazimabad.
Schools were closed on Wednesday but are set to reopen today (Thursday) as the weather system has moved away from the area.
